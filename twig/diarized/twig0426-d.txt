Joining us from Berlin, Jeff Jarvis.  What are you there for, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good night.  The One IFRA, which is the World Association of Newspapers  conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You love going to Germany, though.  This is like your favorite place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Berlin I like quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel very comfortable here, oddly.  And you were saying you had a little free time this afternoon,  so you went to the Stasi Museum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The East German Secret Police.  Yeah, and all this talk we have that is if the advertising  world is a surveillance state, it just so trivializes what a  real surveillance state is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when you really get into it.  What was the movie, there was a very good movie about the Stasi.  The Lives of Others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lives of Others.  Very good movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chilling.  Also joining us, Mike Elgin.  And you know, it's always a fun game to play with Mike Elgin.  Where the hell is he?  But this one, the only reason I know where you are, Mike,  is because I follow you so closely on Instagram.  He's in Georgia.  He's also muted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say that again.  The country of Georgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a fantastic country.  And I've been out of the United States for quite a while.  We just missed each other in France.  I saw you fly by on the highway there near the Cote de Rosay.  And then we came out to Georgia.  We've been living in Georgia for the last two weeks.  And I'm like, I'm going to go to the West Coast.  And I'm like, I'm going to go to the West Coast.  And I'm like, I'm going to go to the West Coast.  And I've been with you for the last two weeks or so.  You're in Tbilisi?  Tbilisi, Georgia.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where next?  It's a former Soviet Union country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Going back to Italy?  We're putting together both the  you know about the Barcelona experience  putting together the Prosecco experience  and then the Provence experience.  We're doing two in a row this summer.  And it's going to be amazing.  We're going back to Italy to work on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gastronomad.net if you want to find out what Mike and Amira do.  You've already had your first in Barcelona  which looked from the picture.  It was fantastic.  It looked really great.  It was fantastic.  Prosecco coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mike, a quick question. For all that travel, do you ever get  Ode to Cambat  in the stomach because of the travel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Funny you should mention that.  I had it a couple days ago.  There was a big street festival.  And  here in Tbilisi  basically what the festival is  is people come from all the different regions  of the country into the city.  They set up booths, they barbecue pork  and all this other stuff and then they have just  outdoor eating all day for two days.  And you know I felt a little bit  you know but it was totally worth it.  I would do it again.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's important to eat street food  so you build up a resistance to all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Normal street food.  If you're in Mexico City or something and have street food  it's probably going to be at least as safe  as the restaurants because  when the street vendors are there all the time  and they've been doing it for years and years  it's usually good. Whenever it's a carnival  type thing people set up just  once a year or something like that.  Good point.  You don't know how they're transporting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stay with the professionals. That's a good point.  That's right.  Alright. We've learned something today I think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We always do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week we talked on and on about all the things  Google had announced and gosh knows there was  plenty to talk about but I don't even think we got through it all.  So we have a big kind of Google news dump  of a bunch of stuff that's been going on with Google.  I'll start with Puerto Rico.  As you know tragedy going on in Puerto Rico  right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.  Three weeks later  and there's still  no power in 85% of the country.  Cell service is down  in those areas.  Hospitals are suffering.  People are dying.  But Google was given permission by the FCC  this week to deploy  those big project  loon balloons  for emergency  connectivity in the wake of  Hurricane Irma and now I guess  Maria too.  Emergency LTE coverage to the island.  That's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The thing is  a lot of people are talking about it  as if it's a done deal.  Unfortunately it isn't. They have permission from the FCC.  Now they have to establish  partnerships with the carriers in Puerto Rico.  There are 8 carriers.  8 carriers.  And when they do  get some sort of connectivity  online with the carriers  then people have to actually  install an update for their phones.  So we're a ways away from this actually happening.  The good news is they have plenty of paper towels.  And that's about it.  In Puerto Rico

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'm going to be in San Juan  in a couple of months.  I don't know what I'm going to see there.  Our heart goes out to people in Puerto Rico.  I was supposed to go there for a conference in November

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and they moved it to Miami.  I just feel bad that the island is losing business.  That's why I still want to go there.  I was thinking of canceling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were going on a  I'm taking my son on a sailing trip in the Virgin Islands.  Which also needs support.  We fly to San Juan.  We go to Tortola.  And then he wanted to spend a week in San Juan afterwards.  And first I was going to say  I don't think there will be any infrastructure.  But as long as they'll let us  we'll go if we need to build things.  So I think that's really cool.  I hope so.  So what about the electric infrastructure with Elon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was the other thing.  Now this one may be real pie in the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't it funny how  Puerto Rico is suffering  but the science fiction future  is ready to come in.  Elon Musk says if you're going to rebuild  the electric infrastructure, which apparently they have to do  you really ought to do it with solar and giant batteries.  And he's talked to the governor.  And there's apparently some interest.  I don't know how far along it is.  Or whether  I doubt Tesla has the money to do this on their own.  But it will be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Puerto Rico has no money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they have 77 million I think to rebuild the power.  The power infrastructure.  At least there's seed money from the federal government.  So remember Puerto Rico is America.  Just remind everybody.  What is it's official status?  It's a territory?  It's a territory.  Yeah.  But it's America.  So just as the American Virgin Islands are in America.  So one would hope that  federal resources will go in there  and they can get it rebuilt.  But right now it's just in Puerto Rico.  I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No power and still no rain water.  No fresh water rather.  How do you survive?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to get more people over there.  Meanwhile we have had a close call up here  in Northern California.  And I think a little bit of a better understanding  of how  you could talk about federal aid  but ultimately you're kind of alone  when this stuff happens.  And technology is not a savior.  So we have these big fires  about 10 miles away in the wine country.  I know Mike's very familiar with the areas  that are burning some of our favorite wineries too.  But a couple of things.  First of all  during the first few days of the crisis  it was very hard to get any information at all.  You just really didn't know what was going on  or where the fires were.  In fact one of the reasons I think so many people died  and I think many more are going to be discovered  dead  is because it happened so quickly  and there was very little communication infrastructure.  We've started to rely on cell phones  for emergency alerts  and they weren't working.  They went out right away.  Remember there used to be when you were a kid  did you have a whistle?  An air raid siren?  The noon whistle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't have known what you were supposed to do  if it came out at 3 o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you heard it at midnight you might want to at least  get up and go what's going on?  Well that's the point is we've let this kind of  infrastructure die relying on technical infrastructure  that died went out immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually have some of that infrastructure still around.  I'm not sure if it's connected.  I was in Los Angeles about 8 months ago  and I saw this tower with a weird thing.  I'm like what is that?  I kind of looked it up and it was an air raid siren  right in the middle of a posh area of LA  and there it was.  They may be using that again now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well they ought to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or ring the church bells or something  because what happened was it sprung up at midnight.  People didn't know.  Some people never woke up.  Some people got out the skin of their teeth  and they ran.  They literally had to run  to get away.  It moves very fast.  It isn't over here because tonight we're expecting high winds  again and what they call red flag conditions  which are very high fire danger conditions  all in this Sonoma Napa  and Mendocino and Sassoon County.  It may not be over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw a CBS report here from the BBC  and was this downtown Santa Rosa?  It's just devastating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well not downtown but very nearby.  There's an area  a little north of Santa Rosa  where interestingly the county courthouse,  the county city is the county jail  and a bunch of beautiful homes.  The Kaiser Hospital.  Many of the beautiful homes up in the Fountain Grove area burned.  Golf course Silverado,  golf course the homes around that.  But also many trailer parks.  It's just devastation.  If you look at it, I've never seen anything like it.  It's a moonscape.  These were such fast moving hot fires  that everything just was flattened.  Of course we have employees  who are up there  waiting to hear if they're evacuated.  We have many friends who  have been evacuated. Some have lost their houses.  There are shelters all around Petaluma  that are set up  and for the most part full at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The C&B opened up the volunteer rooms for free.  I thought that was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is great is you don't see  I don't know where  the firefighters are obviously very busy.  Right now they're trying to save lives, not property.  So the fires are burning uncontained.  But you don't  I don't see a lot of tanker planes.  I think the big 747 tanker plane is supposedly here.  But what you do see  is the community.  Another reminder that we think  the government is not going to be able  to save us.  It's the people on the ground.  We went over yesterday  with blankets and pillows.  They needed them at the shelter.  There were just a constant stream of people  going in bringing stuff to the point where  they said, no more.  We got too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A friend of mine, Leo  has a newish cafe  called the Pharmacy in Santa Rosa.  It's an exquisite place.  The food is amazing.  She's just giving away food and coffee.  She announced on Instagram  she's giving it away until it's gone.  A lot of the restaurants around here are doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so neat.  That's where  you can talk about FEMA.  You can talk about the National Guard.  You can talk about all of this.  But ultimately the community steps up.  And thank goodness it's not unlike Puerto Rico  which the devastation was universal.  Here it's just  small pockets. We're safe by the way  in case anybody cares.  The studio and the Petaluma area  are currently not under threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the strange things about this  that I haven't heard mentioned  and of course obviously the safety  and the loss of life  and property is the biggest thing  but this is the wine country.  It's affecting the three major counties  for wine production  Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino.  This is going to affect  wine for years.  Wine will actually retain  tastes and stuff from the fire  for several years.  Oh no.  California is a huge exporter of wine.  So California wine  is going to be different for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's good news for Tbilisi.  Yeah.  The Georgians are happy.  I didn't realize this but you said this is where wine was invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go downtown  Tbilisi, Leo, there's  literally at least one wine  store on every block and there's one  block where there are four wine  stores next to each other in a row.  There's wine stores everywhere.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Google has acquired  a company I liked a lot and used to  listen to a lot. Liz Gaines  was one of the people there.  We've had her on the show. She worked  for 60DB.  It was a company  founded a couple of years ago to  rethink how radio works.  It was a great way to listen to...  I mean fast company is calling it a podcast app.  I'm not sure that's fair to it.  It was much more than that. But Google bought the company  and will be shutting down  the service  next month.  It was founded by a radio reporter, Steve Hen,  two Netflix veterans, John Ciancudi  and Steve McClendon.  All of them will be going to Google.  Liz will be going to Google.  Not the service anymore.  The fast company says  Google's purchase of 60DB seems to  imply they're taking the whole podcasting thing  a bit more seriously now.  Which is great.  This was a surprise from the New York Times.  I don't know if this is true.  It said, it's not true for us.  According to the New York Times,  65% of podcasts go through Apple's built-in iPhone app.  That is not true for us.  iTunes and iPhone podcast app are below 50%.  But it's still a big chunk of it.  So it makes sense that Google  might try to muscle in on some of that business.  It's kind of good that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to dance on their grave.  It's not really a grave.  They're being acquired.  This was an alternative to podcasting.  In a way it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could listen to podcasts through it.  But you're right.  It was more like you would listen to this instead of podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't need podcasting forking into these different platforms.  I love to see everything being poured into the standards for podcasting.  So that you can get a podcatcher  and you can listen to the podcast you want.  And keep it that way.  I think it's kind of a good thing.  I hope that Google getting serious about podcasting  will also light a fire under Apple.  Because I think they don't take podcasting as seriously  as they do music and other things.  Hopefully we'll see a lot more effort being put into podcast.  Promoting podcast.  I personally think that radio and TV  are the best way to do it.  I think that radio and TV should just go away.  And it should all be replaced by podcasts.  I think the world would be better.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although as somebody pointed out in the chat room  one of the reasons these environmental crises are a problem  is because nobody has TV anymore.  And radio anymore.  They're not getting the emergency EAS notifications anymore.  Again, all of these systems that we used to have.  Do you remember?  This really betrays my age.  AM radios used to have a civil defense symbol  on the band, on the dial on the AM radio.  Am I imagining this?  I think that sounds right.  It's where you'd go  if there were an atomic attack  a nuclear attack on the country  you'd dial to the civil defense frequency.  And all the radios had these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, when was the last time you listened to radio radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, I do a radio show.  I know that.  Besides your own show.  In terms of saying the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you when I listen to radio.  Now that you ask  you're right, I don't listen to a lot of radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I did during the fires.  We tuned in the local news radio station  it was the only source of information.  So there you go.  I'm going to go back to the question  that you asked.  So there you go.  That's one of the reasons you've got to keep this stuff around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've got to hope there's local reporters on the other end of the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because  we also have here  Krone, Channel 4, which used to be an NBC affiliate  lost its NBC affiliation  about 10 years ago.  So they've been really feisty trying to do local news.  And they were the station to go to  because they had reporters all over the area.  And many of them were either very young  there was one reporter I swear to God  she was 16.  But they did a really good job.  And it just showed you  there are a lot of people  you teach these kids all the time  there are a lot of people who want to be journalists.  And I hope there's still places for them to go.  Connell Rad, that's what it was called.  Here's a Connell Rad  here's a car radio.  I think it's from Mad Max's car there.  Did somebody dig this out of a ditch or something?  It's a little rusty.  It is a relic.  But God, it's in my memory.  See those red triangles there?  Those are the Connell Rad frequencies  that you go to in case we get attacked.  We might want to bring that back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sigh.  Let's see.  What else is...oh Google says us too!  I love this.  Facebook and Twitter both came forward  in a congressional inquiry.  Yes, the Russians bought ads. Here's the ads.  Google...  amazing!  Has discovered that Russian operatives  spent tens of thousands of dollars on YouTube, Gmail  and Google search ads  in an attempt to effect the 2016 election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite part of this...  I'm sorry, Russia actually...I'm sorry, go ahead Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, go ahead Mike.  Here's the problem here folks.  We're 10 seconds behind.  So Mike, Mike, then Jeff.  Mike, then Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Russians actually hired people  YouTube personalities  to spread its propaganda.  Those were the worst!  And it was all about sowing divisions  the social divisions within the United States.  It wasn't about electing one candidate or another.  In this case it was about  exacerbating existing racial tension  within the US.  I would love to play with for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some of these blacktivists  as one of the accounts.  They had people pretending to be  African Americans in the United States.  They were clearly not.  I think they've all been pulled down since.  Saying, I hate Hillary Clinton.  She's a bad person.  I am voting for Trump!  And it was so blatant.  I don't think, in fact, most of them had very few views.  But there were a number of  these accounts purchased by  the Russians.  Now go ahead Jeff,  because I think I know what you're going to say about  the funniest thing about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  That Facebook found the accounts.  Twitter didn't really do any work and got in trouble with Congress  because they just went to the accounts that Facebook found.  And then Google  didn't fully do it.  It was Twitter to figure out where the accounts were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hysterical.  This is the one I was going to say is the fun one.  And then Microsoft said,  we better check to see if they bought anything on Bing.  So far, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poor Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't even get the Russian influence dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My other favorite story,  I can't find it right now.  I got in Vassily Gathov,  who's speaking here, he's an expert in Russian stuff  because he's Russian,  had this great story that there was fake news in Russia  of a Putin cheeseburger.  That's supposedly a New York restaurant named Lucy's  right near Penn Station, which I've eaten at.  Had an honor of Putin,  and for some reason had this gigantic cheeseburger for Putin.  And they called the restaurant  and somebody who supposedly worked there  said, oh yes, we are honoring Putin with this cheeseburger.  And they went to great lengths to do it  until finally a reporter from elsewhere  called and said,  do you have a Putin cheeseburger?  And they said, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Is Lucy's where you and Lisa and I  and Gina Trippani went  and we had delicious burgers?  I think that was Lucy's.  No.  It was around the corner.  Why did you take me to the not so delicious place?  No, no, no. Lucy's is not so delicious.  Oh, Lucy's is not so delicious.  I take you only the best.  Thank you.  I'm glad you're doing it very well.  A little word of warning.  If you  can't really trust  what you see on the  Chrome store.  I think Google has fixed this.  But about 37,000  Chrome users  downloaded a fake ad block plus extension.  Google has taken it down.  Swift on security tweeted about it.  It's a fabulous Taylor Swift account.  According to Swift on security,  the fake extension was created by a fraudulent  developer who clones popular names  and spams keywords.  Ad block plus, very popular ad blocking extension.  I guess since the name was ad block plus,  I wouldn't be too surprised if people were fooled.  According to one of the reviewers of the  fake Chrome extension,  Google has removed the ads that open lots of tabs after you installed it.  Exactly the opposite of why you install ad block plus, of course.  Google has removed it.  But the point is, I don't know how good their verification process is.  If something like that could sneak through.  You know my new rule, I've been saying it a lot.  Don't install anything  you don't absolutely want and need.  And be careful when you do.  It's when you install stuff on your system that you  get in trouble.  And that leads us to the Kaspersky story.  Is Kevin still out there?  He is not responding.  We may just  forget Kevin.  We have enough countries.  We've got Georgia, we've got Germany.  Do we really need England?  It would be kind of fun.  It will always be there.  There will always be in England.  I think it will always be in Paris.  The sad story gets stranger and stranger.  It started with a Wall Street Journal report last week.  That an NSA contractor had taken work home.  By the way, that's a really big red flag.  Taken his work home and put it on his home computer.  He was running, according to the journal, the Kaspersky anti-virus program.  Kaspersky intentionally or not, it's not clear, notified Russia that there were NSA secrets on this computer.  And the Russians were able to then exfiltrate those NSA secrets.  The question that remains is what was Kaspersky's involvement in this?  And you may remember that the Department of Homeland Security a few months ago said that no  government agencies should be running Kaspersky.  You know Eugene Kaspersky.  Jeff, you've been on a panel with him.  He's a very likable fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've met him.  I've run a panel with a very affable fellow.  And apparently one would believe very frank about security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The journal says that there's evidence that in fact Kaspersky was involved.  There's evidence involved, but not concrete evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is that the saying could only have been made with the company's knowledge.  This is one person quoted by Orszag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An unnamed official with knowledge of the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but that phrase doesn't make any sense.  Companies don't have knowledge.  Individual employees have knowledge.  And you don't know whether could this have been done with one insider, a few insiders?  Could they have been bribed?  Were they moles?  Did Russia have them be hired?  Was it a long-term thing, short-term thing?  Were they hacked?  Just because it requires somebody on the inside doesn't mean that Kaspersky is a company or  that their CEO and founder had any knowledge.  It also is possible that they did.  So at this point there are so many unknowns that it's impossible to really understand  to what extent Kaspersky is a spy agent's wing of the US government or not.  Well, we do know a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know that Kaspersky has written software for the FSB, the Russian secret police,  that they have done contract work for the Russian government.  Eugene Kaspersky says, yeah, but that's not.  We also know that Putin exerts a lot of influence over Russian companies.  We also know that antivirus software just by its very nature kind of opens vulnerabilities  in a way in your system.  You have to really trust your antivirus software because of the nature of the way it works  and how deeply into the system it goes.  It puts its hooks.  And we've seen this happen.  It could be, if it's poorly written, a venue for exploits to get into your system.  An antivirus can actually make your system less secure.  In fact, I don't recommend people use antiviruses.  But at this point, I would very much not recommend anybody use Kaspersky,  whether it's Kaspersky's fault or not.  Interestingly, the German federal cyber agency BSI says there's no evidence that Kaspersky  was used by Russian hackers.  There are no plans to warn against the use of Kaspersky products in Germany since the BSI has no evidence  for misconduct by the company or weaknesses in its software.  That seems like a dangerous thing to say.  The Israelis say, well, no, wait a minute.  We hacked Kaspersky months ago.  And we warned the U.S. that Kaspersky was responsible for exfiltrating this data.  This is crazy.  Adding to the craziness is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, we don't know anything about where this came from.  Here's just, you know, I don't believe this is true.  I have no evidence.  I haven't even heard this or read this.  I don't know.  But just as a point of devil's advocacy, it's possible.  Imagine if the NSA or another agency or Israel or somebody were able to infiltrate an American anti-virus program  that you wanted to be used in Russia.  One way to get that to be used would be to compromise the Russian anti-virus so that people...  Kaspersky is probably the leading anti-virus globally, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that I read that there's...  What was the number?  It was a very large number of installed users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what was the brand of old?  McAfee, one by a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you were going to hack McAfee, don't hack Kaspersky.  Don't hack the Russian company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't exactly as normal as Mr. Kaspersky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For some reason, I want to say 400 million users.  That can't possibly be right.  But it is certainly very popular.  It's been recommended for a decade.  It is 400 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's astounding.  I have one recommendation, people, and you know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Chrome.  Chromebook. You don't need an anti-virus.  Well, I would submit you don't need an anti-virus on any system anyway.  This just goes back to me saying don't install anything you don't absolutely have to have.  There's no evidence that an anti-virus makes you more secure.  And there's a lot of evidence that makes you less secure.  So whatever the name.  But certainly at this point, if I were using Kaspersky, I would uninstall it.  The company says, Kaspersky says, Kaspersky Lab, should I do it in a Russian accent?  No, I won't do that. That would be mean.  Kaspersky Lab was not involved in it.  It does not possess any knowledge of the situation in question.  And the company reiterates its willingness to work alongside US authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems.  On the other hand, the government of Israel said they alerted in 2014 the US that Kaspersky software was being used to find American intelligence information.  This Israeli's own computer hackers penetrated Kaspersky Labs networks in 2014.  So the Israelis were spying on the Kasperskys and the Kasperskys were spying on us.  Once inside, the Israelis discovered how the software is being used and how Russia had obtained classified information from the NSA.  After the Israelis passed along what they knew to the US, officials at the NSA began an investigation that led to the contractor who had installed Kaspersky software on his personal computer at home.  People familiar with that, this is the Wall Street Journal, people who are familiar with that investigation say he appeared to have no ill intent.  But of course he knew that removing classified material from Fort Meade was a violation of agency rules and possibly a crime.  So now we at least know why the DHS banned federal government agencies from using Kaspersky last month.  That's the information that they were working on.  22 government agencies were authorized to use Kaspersky.  It's also of course widely used by consumers.  We may never know whether Kaspersky was a knowing, that's what's not clear, whether they were a willing, knowing pawn or an unwitting pawn of the Russian government.  But we do, I think from this it seems pretty clear that it was an avenue for getting into somebody's system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does Kaspersky recover from something like this?  You can't have this kind of reputation in this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially since there are many competitors who are just as good and there's no compelling reason to go with Kaspersky.  If you want an antivirus, there's nothing requiring you to use Kaspersky.  I would not use an antivirus.  This is Dan Gooden writing in Ars Technica.  This is also a recent new report.  Kaspersky reportedly modified its AV to help Russia steal NSA secrets.  But I'm with you Mike.  We don't know for sure.  But I also think it would be foolish to use Kaspersky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we take this at face value, if the Putin government is using this to hack the NSA and in the wake of revelations of all the ads and meddling with democracy,  it's got to be generally backfiring for brand Russia.  Wouldn't Russia prefer to be a trusted partner?  Russia is in every story these days.  What do you think?  That's a good question, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some say that Putin loves all this attention because the truth is Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's.  It isn't really a big nation, big power.  It's not one of the top powers anymore.  It does have nuclear weapons.  But Putin likes the fact that people fear and respect Russia.  That this is a good thing for Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think?  I read an interview with this guy, Vassily Gatov, who I'm speaking to after tomorrow here in Berlin.  I had coffee with him this afternoon.  Fascinating guy, former media executive in Russia, now a USC fellow.  The analysis he gave, I think it was critical, was that Russia has been invaded often,  never defeated, except the notion that it lost the Cold War.  That's what grates.  That's what they can't stand.  That's why you have this authoritarian Putin trying to beat his breast to have victories.  In an authoritarian government, it's not brand Russia, it's brand Putin.  One way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They want to be seen as a strong player, as a power.  Here you are, Mike, in a country Russia invaded not so very long ago.  They've been invaded by everybody and their brother over the last 10 centuries.  Georgia was a Soviet republic.  It's where Stalin came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was annexed.  That's a nice way to put it.  There's no question that Putin yearns for the glory days of the Soviet Union.  The reach that they had, a global superpower at the center of things in terms of international affairs.  That's part of his allure, the idea that he's going to bring them back to that glory days.  If they bring back the bread lines and the poverty and the famine and all that stuff as well,  which people don't remember quite as well as the international heft, then maybe that idea wouldn't be so popular.  To a certain extent, the other meddling in democracy with ads and all that kind of stuff,  that's a win-win for Russia.  On the one hand, maybe they'll screw with our democracy, yes, maybe they'll...  But even in that case, even when they're caught red-handed with their hands in the cookie jar,  they can say, look, all these tech companies, Silicon Valley, they're not so great.  We hacked them, we messed with them, we did all this stuff.  Part of it is tarnishing the Western brand, if you will.  The things that are alluring about the United States and Europe,  those take a big hit when Russia successfully is caught meddling with our culture, with our democracy and all that kind of stuff.  Well, let's extend it beyond Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  North Korea too has a very active hacking cadre, a very effective hacking cadre.  It's an easy way for a country that's small and doesn't have a lot of resources and can't foot a million-man army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  North Korea literally has a million-man army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and probably Russia does too, and both may have nukes.  But cyber warfare, 20 good hackers is all you need.  Yeah, exactly.  And you're a player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot cheaper.  It's a hell of a lot cheaper.  And I've plugged this on the show before, but the NATO handbook on Russian information warfare is spectacular.  And it makes clear that the goal is to get the country to turn on itself.  Yeah.  I think it's simplistic to say they just wanted Trump to get elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a much more, it's a longer game they're playing than that.  Although there is evidence that there was not a lot of love lost between Putin and Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the word that is making its way into the English language is desinformacia.  And there's actually a book on that topic and lots of really great articles I've mentioned in a couple of my columns.  But this is the idea behind desinformacia is to, the ultimate goal is to erode trust in information itself.  To the point where people don't know what to believe and everything is equivalent.  Legitimate claims, false claims are all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who might win from all of this? China.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's already happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  As the West declines into chaos and Russia acts like a mean teenager,  China can stand above it all and say, well, go ahead, you guys fight it out.  We're going to take a break.  Actually, if you're worried about spying, it turns out maybe the worst thing you can put in your house is a Google Home Mini.  Oh, that was a mistake.  It was a mistake.  And they fixed it. We'll talk about that in a second.  Jeff Jarvis is here. He's in Berlin.  It's great to have him from the City University of New York, BuzzMachine.com.  It's funny because Paul and Mary Jo did their show from CUNY today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. Yeah, they got the show. It didn't work okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But thank you for helping us get that going. That's great.  And from all the way from the state of Georgia on the Black Sea, can you see the Black Sea from your house?  I can see it from my house. Absolutely.  He's in Tbilisi. Mike Elgin of Gastronomad.net.  He and Amira are planning, yes, another gastronomatic adventure next in Italy, then in France.  And who knows, maybe, you know what, I'd go to Georgia to taste some of that wine that you've been singing the praises of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're considering it. I'll bring you a bottle, Leo, but we're considering doing an event here as well.  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be really, I just, so much fun.  Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell.  Actually, it's by all the Ring things. Ring's mission is to make neighborhoods safer.  We've talked about the doorbell before. I have it. Everybody at Twitter has it.  In fact, it's funny because when somebody comes to anybody's door in the house, one thing Ring, please, make it possible to have differing ringtones.  Because all of our phones go ding, ding, ding, and then we all say, oh, there's somebody at my door.  It's a little confusing. We're all in on Ring. We love our Ring Video Doorbell.  It's a great way to see what's going on at your front door wherever you are in the world.  You put the camera up. As you mentioned, Mike, last time you were here, great for an Airbnb if you want to see when your visitors come and go.  Somebody rings your doorbell, you can talk to them. They can talk to you. You can say, leave the package there.  Now we've got this. This is so cool. This is the Ring Floodlight Cam.  The idea behind the Floodlight Cam is, well, you've all seen the motion-activated floodlights people have on their garages.  But the Floodlight Cam adds that special Ring goodness. The camera with the speaker and the microphone and the motion detector.  Somebody comes in your backyard. They're brightly lit. You're notified on your phone even if you're far, far away.  And you can see who's there and say, hey, raccoon, get out of my yard and listen to see what the raccoon says.  And if the raccoon doesn't respond, you can even push a button that triggers a 110 decibel alarm.  And that'll scare the little fellas right out of your backyard.  Ring's stuff is great. It's well-made. It's smart. It works with your Amazon Echoes and other devices.  It's a great way to hear, see and speak to visitors at your door or anywhere around your house.  When things go bump in the night, you will know what it is.  And you know, for situations like this fire here, the ability to go check your backyard and see if there's anything going on, if the fire's getting close, that is really valuable too.  Here's what you do. Go to ring.com slash twig and take a look at the Ring of Security kits they've put together.  Choose either the original Ring doorbell or the new Ring Pro doorbell and one, two or three of these floodlight cams.  Easy to install.  Connect them with your favorite locks, your smart locks, your hubs for added convenience, monitoring and security.  And save up to $150 at ring.com slash twig, the Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.  Thank you for keeping us safe and supporting our show.  So Google last week announced, a week ago exactly, a number of new devices including a new Google Home.  Two new Google Homes, the Google Home Mini and the Google Home Maxi, or Max. It's just Max.  They gave everybody at the event, I did not go to the event, now I'm glad.  They gave everybody at the event a Home Mini, including from Android Police, Artem Rusakovsky.  Artem set his Ring Mini up and then noticed it seemed to be responding a lot to kind of random noises.  So he went online, you know, Ring, not Ring, the Home, Google Home has an online interface.  You can see all the triggers.  So he went to his Google My Activity portal, opened it up and he says, my jaw dropped.  I saw thousands of items, each with a play button and a time stamp.  All attributed to this device called the Mushroom.  So he was a little nervous.  He thought maybe Mushroom is the Mini because he knew that the code name for the Google Home was Pineapple.  So he listened to the audio clips and it was like sounds coming from his living room.  Oh, I'm sorry, not his living room, worse. He put it in his bathroom.  So he sent a note to Google thinking, well, hi, please forward this to Google Home team for response.  I discovered this issue. Would you please confirm the Mini's code name is Mushroom?  And here's my activity page.  He says, here's the kicker. Based on Google My Activity, the onslaught of thousands of transmitted and saved assistant-related audio queries started the day the Home Mini was set up.  Needless to say, if a listening device records almost every minute of every day and stores it remotely, we're talking about a huge privacy violation.  Does Google have a comment about this?  This is at 422 p.m. He heard from them 10 minutes later.  And by 7 p.m. Google was on its way to his house to take the Mini.  An engineer drove up to Oakland to examine it that very night.  The next day they say, we've learned of an issue impacting a small number of Google Home Minis like all the ones we handed out at the press event.  That causes the touch mechanism to behave incorrectly.  See, apparently, just like your Google Home, if you touch the top of it, instead of saying, OK, Google, you touch the top of it, it'll trigger it.  Apparently, they had something wrong with the switch and it was registering phantom touch events.  So the fix, which they pushed out pretty quickly, simply disabled that capability.  And he says, the company let me know they're in the process of building a long-term fix.  But if you're one of those journalists...  No, but actually, you wouldn't have to do anything because they pushed the fix to all of them.  But how embarrassing is that?  Wow.  I think that was malicious or intentional.  They certainly responded very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if they hadn't discovered it for like two weeks, it would have been like the, what was the drive-by Wi-Fi thing that happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they'd be in lawsuits.  Oh, there'd be much action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Google's defense, it was discovered because Google is so transparent about all the audio recording.  Anybody can go see it and that's what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  He was able to go.  If you could just join us.  Kevin Marks is here, adding to the trio of countries we're visiting this week.  Kevin is in Bootle or in Yorkshire.  Kevin Marks is in Yorkshire.  Jeff Jarvis is in Berlin.  Mike Elgin is in Tbilisi, Georgia.  Wow.  And the people say we're stuck at home.  People say we're American-centric.  Not true, not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Leo's been all over the place recently too, haven't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm unfortunately kind of stuck here to do the shows because I have to anchor it at the home base.  But anyway, thank you for joining us, Kevin.  It's great to have you.  You missed all the fun stuff though, Kaspersky and the Pixel, I mean the mini.  Are you excited about the Pixel 2 and the Chromebook Pixel and Pixelbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they seem like nice incremental improvements.  The Chromebook looks very nice because I've still used the Chromebook Pixel I got four years ago.  So them doing another one of those is encouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason Howell is also, and he said, can I please replace my original Chromebook Pixel with a Pixelbook?  And I said, yes, of course.  Jeff, though, you'll be interested to know I did cancel my order for the 256-gig one and I'm ordering the 128-gig one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guess what?  You inspired me to do the exact same thing.  I don't think you need more.  I'll wait another week.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want, for instance, the fastest drive storage, you have to go all the way up to the $1,650 version with the i7 and the NVMe drive.  I'm not willing to spend that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not either.  And I think that because the keyboard is exposed when you use it as a tablet, I can't see just pulling it out of the path train and running it.  I'm watching a show and risking the keyboard and it being bigger.  So it's going to be a desk, you know, leave it the desk machine, I think.  And I'll keep using the tablet, which I'm using right now for reasons I'll explain.  And thus, when I travel, I want all my shows and movies and things on the tablet so I can watch that.  That's why you'd want extra memory on the device.  And if I don't travel with it, I don't need that much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're so spoiled though, because really 128 gigabytes, that's a lot of movies, a lot of music, a lot of...  Sure is.  I'm not sure I really need all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing is that I never feel like I need it, but if I think about what frustrates me about my one or two year old devices, it's always that they don't have enough storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just ordered the new Amazon Kindle, the first waterproof Kindle.  What?  You can take it in the tub now.  It's weird that the waterproof Kindle is named Oasis.  It has 32 gigs, but remember, that's a ton for books.  Yeah, it is a lot of books.  You know, on the other hand, they do now read audible books.  You can play from the Oasis to a Bluetooth speaker, it doesn't have speakers built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any advantage to that though, as opposed to your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I'll tell you why.  Because if you buy the Kindle book and the audible, you can do both.  You can switch back and forth.  And when you listen to the audible, it'll show the text highlighted as the reader reads.  And every once in a while, there's a book that I wish I could read it at the same time as I'm listening.  Most of the time it doesn't matter.  Or go back and forth easily.  Game of Thrones is a good example.  The way they spell those names, you'd never know.  It's not unusual that I'm listening to a book that if you're reading it and he mentions somebody's name at the top of the page,  Who are we talking about again?  But if you're listening, that's a big rewind.  So it's nice to have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially if you're in the tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now I can do it in the tub!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, audible books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  Mike and I, again, let's apologize to the audience.  Mike and I are each on delay, so we don't know when we're interrupting each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Mike.  No, no, go ahead.  I'm pretty much done making my crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ruled by me.  So I listened to the Jean LaCarrée and the dramatization of it was spectacular and not over the top, not obnoxious,  but just using the voices, one reader, but really doing, they've gotten so much better at this.  It's just amazing.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John Ronson, Ron Johnson?  Yes, we have.  You mentioned it.  Yeah, you really like that.  That was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a new LaCarrée novel.  Is it good?  It's very good, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a legacy of spies?  Yeah, it's very good.  Okay, because I'm a huge fan, but I just thought, wow, I didn't even know he was still alive.  I hate to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, amazing.  It's presumably valedictory in the sense that it wraps up some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you like this, I am going to recommend also on audible, and I wish audible had an ad today,  they have taken the complete BBC Radio 4 dramatizations of all the Smiley books and put it on more  than one audible thing, and it's really, really well done.  It's 18 hours and 59 minutes.  Call for the Dead, Murder of Quality, Spy Who Came in Through a Cold, Looking Glass Ward,  Tinker Tailor Soldier, Spy, Honorable Schoolboy, Smiley's Peoples, and The Secret Pilgrim,  all in one, all dramatized.  It's fully dramatized with lots of actors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say it...  You need to listen to that before you listen to the new novel, because it'll make that easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it reminds you of who Smiley is and all that stuff, but I love all that stuff.  When the last veil was removed, George blinked and blushed and understood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He'd imagined, so he said, fellowships and a life devoted to the literary obscurities of 17th century Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here he was being offered a job in the British Secret Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it!  You know what, I think the new book is better.  It doesn't have a bunch of actors.  It has only one guy.  I'm going to get it.  I have two credits.  In terms of the production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just added it to my cart.  Thank you for the recommendation.  And all of this without an audible ad.  A lot of the BBC ones, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the BBC.  Did I share you the BBC adaptation of Asimov's Foundation?  No!  I'll dig that out for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make that your pick.  Of course, the BBC is very famous.  People think The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a novel or some confused people might think it was a movie.  But it was a BBC radio play first.  In fact, Douglas Adams was scribbling the lines like minutes before they went on the air and handing it to the actors.  And if you can get a copy of the original, original BBC Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, wow, is that good.  But I can't wait to hear the foundation.  That would be great.  I was about to get the book just to reread it.  It's been so long.  We were talking about that.  It was on this show, wasn't it, Jeff?  We were talking about it a couple of weeks ago how we're headed quickly towards corporate world domination.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this point, that's what Google wants you to do.  Maybe this isn't a Russian plot.  This is a Google plot all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So while we're on books, I just want to mention, I want to give a plug, John Green of Hank and John Green.  His new novel is just out yesterday.  Got a spectacular review in the New York Times.  I just bought it.  I mean, his book's from effort teenagers, but this is, he has a character who's deep into a deep episode of OCD.  John himself is now talking about his own OCD and how this book was basically inspired by a crippling episode of it in 2015.  And the interview and the review of the Times were stellar.  So we like the Green brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will read that too, even though I try to stay away from young adult fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would normally too, and people say that, and especially his, kind of sad, I'm told.  But this one sounds like it's an excellent window onto OCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did anybody see Mark Zuckerberg's VR tour of Puerto Rico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't actually think that Mark was, I think he made the point that it's very different when you're in the VR.  Let's see if, can we find it? No, I don't have it here.  Oh yeah, here he is.  So he was kind of, they were walking around Puerto Rico, he was walking around with a Facebook executive.  And looking at all the devastation.  But remember that Mark is a cartoon character in this.  This is using Facebook's Spaces VR app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does he see himself that way or does he only see the background?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He would have seen her, she would have seen him.  But that was the point that Zuckerberg's people made.  At one point he says, do you want to teleport somewhere else?  Yeah, maybe back to California, says another executive.  Zuckerberg responded in a comment to all the negative comments.  One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy.  My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help see what's happening in different parts of the world.  I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with Red Cross to help with the recovery.  Reading some of the comments, I realized this wasn't clear and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.  He came back and actually added some more.  He said, when you're in VR yourself, the surroundings feel quite real.  But that sense of empathy doesn't extend well to people watching you as a virtual character on a 2D screen.  That's something we'll need to work on over time.  So I don't, I think he, I don't know.  What do you think?  Go ahead, Mike first and then Jeff.  Sorry, I think that Facebook and Zuckerberg apologize for a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they all have a similar theme, which is that they, there's a lack of understanding about what the public, how they perceive things by Facebook and Zuckerberg.  I think this is one of the reasons why he went on his grand tour of the United States.  He doesn't understand people. He doesn't understand why they respond the way they do.  He doesn't understand why people do what they do and how they think.  And so this is yet another example.  And I think that hopefully what he's learned and what all such companies should learn is that when there is a crisis and people are hurting and suffering, that's not the time to promote anything.  Yes. Thank you.  Yeah. So I think that's a good point.  There is in general in Silicon Valley though, a kind of a bro related insensitivities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why we always say, Oh, they ought to have some people of color, some diversity on their boards.  They need to understand a little bit better how the rest of the world thinks they are a little bit in a bubble.  Yes.  All right. Well, we won't beat him up. He apologized and you know, Facebook's very good, has gotten very good at apologizing.  I actually have a Google alert that searches for Facebook apologized, Zuckerberg apologized.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably the best way to find out what they've done wrong lately, right?  Well, I wrote a post last week. We didn't talk about Google, but we mentioned it quickly about the need for the technology company to be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wrote a post last week. We didn't talk about Google, but we mentioned it quickly about the need for the technology companies to go to find, to establish and learn moral authority.  That's not good enough to say, don't be evil. It's not good enough to say, we follow the laws. It's not good enough to apologize.  They have to, they have such tremendous power now. The internet, thus the future is in their hands.  They have to go beyond what they thought they had to do. And they're being expected. And so I don't want to make them overly cautious, but they just have to have a North Star in front of them at all times.  And understand that once they, if they do gain moral authority, that is the platform, right?  We in media thought that our platform was technology and we found out too late that we'd lost our moral authority.  These guys haven't gained their moral authority and they have to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean such as when Walter Cronkite said, you know what, we shouldn't be in Vietnam. That was the weight of America's most trusted voice saying Vietnam is a mistake.  That carried huge weight in those days. That kind of moral authority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And, and, you know, I think that an example of the Russian ads, I don't know when they knew they had Russian ads and I don't, I don't presume that they knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They denied it a long, long time though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But whenever they, A, they should have searched like hell and B, if they, if they had come out first and said we were manipulated by the Russians, then the story would have been the Russians.  Instead the story is Facebook. And, and, and so I want to see them go even further now where I think they should make all the ads public immediately.  Robert has said that in the future, when you see a political ad in your feed, you can go and see who bought it. That's good.  But I think we should all be able to see all political ads.  I also think very adamantly that they should reveal targeting, data for, for these ads so that we know who's being targeted.  That Facebook and Google could go far beyond where television is, and certainly where direct mail is, where there's no transparency.  They could see that they have the opportunity to set a new moral standard here, rather than merely saying what they say today, which is, we follow the laws of the country we're in. Not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google seems to have tried to do...  How did it even go so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, go ahead, Mike.  I'm suspicious of ads that don't advertise a product or service.  Political ads, a lot of the things that Russians apparently bought on Facebook and elsewhere, they weren't political ads. They weren't political at all.  They were just people ranting about this, that, or the other thing, or they were supposedly some sort of non-profit group that was concerned about some identity politics or something like that.  And all of that stuff, I think, is potentially suspicious in the wake of all these revelations.  I think it would be great to see companies that do, especially mobile advertising and social networking advertising, to demand that advertisers are selling something, either a product or a service or something identifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do remember, though, that Facebook, since 2011, has told the Federal Elections Commission that they should not be held responsible in the way that other media is for ad disclosure.  They did not want to be held accountable.  Since 2011, they've asked the Federal Election Commission for blanket exemptions for political advertising disclosure rules.  So that tells me that they kind of knew.  Why would they want to be exempt from that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's why, I think, I'm not justifying, but we never had advertising to this scale before.  And when blogs came along, suddenly anybody could publish, it opened up tremendously, it also opened it up to spam and manipulation and worse, and trolling and worse.  Now, advertising has similarly been democratized.  Aunt Mary can advertise her jam to the world around, or Amira Elgin, God knows what she can make, and sell the world around.  And that opens it up, and that creates whole new businesses and whole new opportunities.  But the scale is so difficult to deal with that it's not like you're a TV station with a very finite number of ads or a newspaper with a finite number of ads.  This is a virtually infinite number of ads.  And it does bring a cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not just scale, these are dark ads.  So let's say I find one person in the world who's terrified of leprechauns, I can serve up ads about how this political candidate or that is going to unleash the leprechauns, and nobody will ever know that that was the ad.  They're dark ads, nobody can see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The irony is the FEC...  The advertising people don't like clowns. I'll buy into that, I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The irony is the FEC did not give Facebook an exemption.  So they were required to disclose, but they decided, well, it's the ad buyers issue, and we're not going to do it.  So you can apologize, you should say we did better, but they have not been on the right side of this for some time.  You know, there's a lot of money to be made in these ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also has to be said that it's understood in the advertising industry.  I read Ad Age and some of the other advertising publications that Facebook is the gold standard for targeting.  You can target people better on Facebook than anywhere else, and it's global.  It's a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were those ads effective? Somebody in the chat room who I think has an axe to grind says, oh, we know they weren't very effective.  It's interesting, though, that they were highly targeted at states where there was a very slim margin, and Trump did in fact win via a very, very slim margin, 17,000 votes.  You're never going to prove beyond correlation.  You can't prove their effectiveness, but boy, if they're putting the ads in those states, and those are the states that they turn it,  it seems to me that those ads, you know, can't prove it was effective, but there's evidence maybe they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The catch-22 for Facebook is that they claim that this is their business model.  We are really effective for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you want to target Wisconsin and Michigan, you can do it.  Leprechaun lovers in those areas.  For a hundred thousand.  In fact, this is all amazing ads for Facebook.  $100,000 and you too can become president.  Facebook did not help their moral authority this weekend when Alex Stamos, their chief of security,  ranted on Twitter about how nobody understands how hard it is to stop fake news.  And I wish the journalists would just, you know, ask us and we could tell them how hard it is.  Lots of journalists have celebrated academics who made wild claims about, I think you're probably one of those celebrated academics, by the way, Jeff,  wild claims about how easy it is to spot fake news and propaganda.  Was he thinking about you, Jeff Jarvis?  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does he know you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's easy.  I don't think we've ever said it. We know how hard it is. We've had that discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Full disclosure here is, I got, I just, whenever this comes up,  I started the News Integrity Initiative and I got a substantial amount of money from Facebook,  the Newark Ford Foundation and others to deal with this.  And by the way, one of the grants we just gave was to PRI, Public Radio International,  where they're doing a really neat project to basically use the same techniques the bad guys use,  well, my view of the bad guys, the Cambridge Analyticas, to find people who are vulnerable not to propaganda but to journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vulnerable to journalism? Let's find those people.  What is that? That sounds really nefarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my favorite things about Alex Stamos' rant is that he says that he encourages reporters to talk to engineers.  And I'm thinking, really? So if I contact Facebook PR and say,  I'd like to talk to some of your engineers about the album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll be it.  And next I want to call Coca-Cola and talk about their secret recipe.  I'd like to know, how do they do that?  Hey, good news for our friend Danny Sullivan, who was on the show not so long ago.  He has retired, as you know, from Search Engine Land and Marketing Engine Land.  He now has a job at Google.  Danny Sullivan, I think he's taken basically the Matt Cutts position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's brilliant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google needs somebody who can talk and be human to explain Search.  And that's his new job, to explain Search and help bridge the gap, he says.  And there was a picture of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He has a lot of credibility. You know he's not going to spew BS.  He'll do it in a way that people can understand. Brilliant, brilliant move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're reaching out, seeing if Google will let him talk to us.  He can bridge the gap right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's probably busy going through the, so all those things I speculated about for 10 years.  Which ones of those were actually true? Can I see some code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He posted a picture of him in front of the Nugler statue.  Which is, the Nugler statue is, tell me, you've stood in front of this too, I think Kevin Marks, where you stand if you're new to Google, right?  Or as a statue to the new ones at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember the statue. This may be newer than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, first day at Google in front of the Nugler statue. See the beanie with the propeller?  Learned all I know about orientation from the internship. It is slightly different.  Slightly different, he says. I love that.  Good for you Danny. Well done, good luck.  He was in San Diego, right?  I wonder if he's going to move up to Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd move to Mountain View.  There's a Google office in San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, if you want to rob a bank, probably not the best idea to Google how to do it.  Now, he robbed the bank, by the way. So that may be how they caught him.  But he later told police he searched how to rob a bank on Google to help carry out the robbery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube probably would have been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I imagine that will come up at the trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you get Baby Driver and he'd be picking the right tune to rob the bank to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you find if you search Google for how to rob a bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to rob a bank.  So now, by the way, I can't rob a bank because this will be used in the trial against me.  You can search on YouTube.  Wow, look at this. There's actually a lot of YouTube videos.  Here's one.  The following information is for educational purposes only.  Robbing a bank. An amateur's guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will need to gather specialists who know their craft.  The mastermind, the driver, the lookout, the train, the inside man.  More than half a million views.  It is important you choose your team members wisely.  Supplies and tactical gear.  This is really irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is very irritating.  What, is it the robotic voice that bugs you?  Yeah.  Oh, there's all sorts of technologies involved.  This is crazy.  I think this is more how to write a bank heist movie than anything else.  Anyway, I doubt that he did all of this.  Wow, though. You really truly can learn anything on Google.  Now that means, right, I'm going to get from now on along with the bikini clad women in my Google autoplay,  I'm going to start having bank robbery videos, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not in Germany, I got it in German.  There were quite a few bump stock videos and so forth on YouTube.  And after the Las Vegas shooting, they have banned many of those modding tutorials from YouTube.  But they were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is an example too of the authority question.  It's hard and it's expensive and I get it, but you can't just set a standard that says  when the disaster happens, we'll then backtrack.  Now we don't want them to be in a position to censor the world, we don't want them to be the judges of the world,  we don't want them to say what's true and false, but they have to set standards above child porn is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now this is an interesting question.  Where do you stand on Twitter banning, or tell me what they did.  There's a candidate for Congress in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, I've forgotten.  Somewhere down there, right?  Who had a video including something about if elected, I will stop the sale of baby parts.  And initially Twitter decided...  Marsha Blackburn.  Initially Twitter shut down that video, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.  It's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you could still...  They reversed their decision.  Did they shut down the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they...  So Twitter is reversing a decision to block...  Oh, she's already a member of Congress, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, for promoting her  Senate campaign launch video on the social network.  The company said Monday that a line in a video referencing baby body parts was inflammatory,  violated its guidelines.  I guess they pulled down the tweet referring to it, but then they reinstated.  And Blackburn says this is a victory for conservatives in America.  It was pleased with the reversal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the reversal was a good idea, and I think the banning was a bad idea.  I agree too.  I don't like, but it's like it's not...  She's using inflammatory speech to make a political point, and that should be protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the Blackburn campaign said that it was pleased with the reversal.  The Congresswoman raised money off the decision on Monday saying that Silicon Valley elites  were trying to impose their values.  That's not my problem with it.  My problem with it is if somebody has an opinion like that, opinion whether you disagree or  agree, you need to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what if it is?  I agree.  Just to play it out a little bit more here, playing the Leo role.  What if it is, for example, I hate the phrase, fake news?  What if this is a debunked thing that it was in the campaign?  Which it was.  Which it was.  So, at some point, the rule was after them to go after fake news.  By the way, this is Twitter, which doesn't go after horrible, horrible stalking and harassment  of people.  It just says, oh, we'll just turn it off so you don't hear it.  So, a different standard.  But if the world is telling the platforms, get rid of fake news, this is fake news, what  do we expect them to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really interesting challenge, right?  It is.  What we're calling on Facebook and Twitter to do is stop fake news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Mike, let's say a politician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's inflammatory speech.  It's based on false information.  And in this case, I mean, she is in Congress.  I think the clear remedy is more speech.  She's not going after her out.  Basically, going after her with more speech.  I don't think, you know, of all the things to censor and silence, this is a bad example.  She's not a fake news organization per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, Mike, so just to play with it, just to keep going.  Let's say she's not running for Congress.  It's not a politician.  Let's say it is an edgy news site.  It's Sputnik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then what do you say?  Well, I mean, in the case of something like Sputnik or RT, which themselves, they have  a lot of legitimate information mixed in with the BS.  It's the you have to consider the purpose of the site, you know, in which case, you  know, Sputnik is clearly pro-Russian propaganda.  And I wouldn't call for banning that.  There are some other publications that would call for banning, some of the Macedonian ones  that exist purely to spread fake news and that sort of thing.  But in this case, you have lots of politicians saying lots of, I mean, the president wouldn't  last an hour if the rule, you know, against, if there was a rule against politicians saying  things that were untrue.  And so, you know, you have to, to a certain extent, allow occasionally.  Now, if this politician, I don't know her that well, but if she's, you know, if every  day she's coming out with more stuff that's patently false and so on, then that's another  issue. But I doubt that that's the case here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really, it's challenging.  And this is, by the way, Alex Stamos is right.  This is a hard thing to do.  And I don't think we've ever denied that.  Facebook has now added an I button to its news feed for more information.  This is a test, so not everybody will see it.  For links to articles shared in the news feed, we're testing a button people can tap to  access additional information without needing to go elsewhere.  Contextual information pulled from across Facebook and other sources like the publishers'  Wikipedia entry, a button to follow their page, a trending articles or related articles  about the subject.  The idea is to combat fake news by giving people an, a button they can press.  Let's see what the I button looks like.  A button they can press to say, well, who is this from?  We talked about this a little bit on Sunday and the consensus seemed to be, well, that's  an easy thing to do that nobody will ever click.  Look at that. That's the I button.  You're going to click that button?  Nobody's going to.  And certainly nobody who agrees with the story.  Only people who already disagree with it are going to click that button, right?  I mean, it's nice to, is that a, well, let me ask Jeff, because I think it's a good  question because Jeff, you really, this is, you're on the forefront of this and, and  ways to solve this. This is one of the things you suggested, more contextual

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  information. Is this what you were talking about?  I think a button is, is difficult, but I do think that what Facebook has done that's  from the beginning, we talked about this long ago before all this came up is that  when they have the related links, that's the more powerful mechanism and, and the  related link can be who's the source.  I do think that, that sourcing in all kinds of ways is important, positive and  negative. But you're right. Readers are not going to, nor should they be expected  really to go do homework on every, on every link.  But before you share it, before you know, people don't even read the article

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  before they share it. We know they share it based on the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can we change, can we change the norms? We're early into this system.  You know, if, if it's the same as I've argued about trolling, if you, if the  troll needs her meds and they got problems, but the person who, who gives  attention to the troll is, is, is, is the person we have to reach out to.  Similarly, yeah, people share crap, but at some point, should you be embarrassed  that you did it was wrong and you did it?  Not if you're an addict to Grind.  Then that's different, right? But at least we can get rid of some of this by  saying, you know, did you know that came from blank? It's the same, you know, I,  I see people embarrassed all the times when they, when they express something  and somebody says, oh, they know they died five years ago. What are you doing?  And, or that's on Snopes and here it is. People have since get embarrassed by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if Neil deGrasse Tyson ever said this, but if he didn't, he ought to.  The internet landed in our laps without creating a curriculum that empowers  you to know when someone online is full of shit.  I don't know if he said that, but boy, that's a good, that's a, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that sounds like it's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't really have, we don't, we haven't been taught how to do this.  I mean, having an eye button is great, but that doesn't teach people to push it.  Yeah, but I also argue that.  Go ahead. Let, let, let, let Mike go talk for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just, you know, the, the, the companies like Google and Facebook,  their proposition to us all is that their algorithms are amazing, that they do,  that they're able to do all these wonderful things.  There's got to be a way that a combination of downvoting things, as you see on Reddit,  and upvoting sources, like, you know, if, if you, you know, if lots and lots of people  are constantly saying, you know, this is, this is a legitimate thing, you know,  there's got to be a way to understand, to, to link the, the, the behavior of the individual  to, to their, to their activity.  And we're, we're not talking about whether something can be posted.  We're talking about whether something can be made viral, given the, given the jet engine  of, of viral distribution that Facebook is capable of giving different types of news stories.  If somebody posts it and two or three people see it or whatever, nobody cares about that.  It's like, they should be very careful about which news stories, which videos and so on  go wildly viral on the site.  That's, that's really the key thing.  And they're not really addressing the positive side of it.  But what if they said, okay, look, if it's a story, a news related story, if it's current events  or something like that, we're going to be super, super careful.  Most of the stuff, we're not going to allow to go crazy viral, but we're going to cherry pick  sources, we're going to use the community behavior and our algorithms to identify the really  good sources of information.  We're going to let only those go crazy viral.  Nobody's talking about that.  But why does everything with the get a lot, gets a lot of likes automatically have to go crazy viral?  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the point is that is, that is the feedback loop that works.  The, in some ways, Twitter has tried to do the opposite thing and say, yes, there are these verified people  and you can trust them.  And that misses the point that a lot of the things that take off are started by someone who you  wouldn't think had any influence, but somehow they've expressed something in a way that's pithy  enough that other people retweet it and it will spread and jump from just them talking to their friends  to them talking to the world in, you know, an hour or so.  And that is, that is the challenge of this because those, those things can be great and they can also be  funny, but also they can be devastating for the person who started them because suddenly there are,  you know, a hundred thousand people trying to argue with them about it or take them on and they don't  have the facilities to deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting Amazon to buy you may not be a bad idea, but I don't think going on Twitter to beg is the  best way to go about it.  Carl's Jr.  I wonder maybe this is just a marketing campaign.  Carl's Jr. is now begging using the hashtag Amazon buy us.  Hey Amazon, for the next 24 hours we'll be sharing one of our big ideas every hour on the hour  trying to get a no joke.  You like shipping boxes?  We like filling them with food.  Our logo smiles, your logo smiles.  Perfect fit.  This is from the official blue check marked Carl's Jr. Twitter feed.  Amazon buy us.  Seriously, for real, let's do this.  Let's change the future of eating.  Hashtag Amazon buy us.  They actually admitted Jeff Jenkins, the chief marketing officer at Carl's and its sister  Hardee's told USA Today, the tweets are obviously a start to try and see where the dialogue goes.  If I'm Jeff Bezos, you know, you never hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can hear his laugh from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never, you never go out with a girl that begs you.  That's just not, that's just not a good way to get Amazon's attention.  On the other hand, if you're a teenager, you may now be able to buy things on Amazon with your own account.  As long as your parents say okay, Amazon, which I didn't know this, had apparently blocked kids 13 to 17 from buying things on Amazon.  They'll now be able to use an Amazon household account to shop the marketplace.  Parents will be notified of each purchase via text or email.  They will by default have the chance to approve or deny it and they can set spending limits.  But, speaking of begging, as they make the purchase, teens will be able to include a note that explains or begs why they need the particular item.  The parent will either say why or and this already goes on in our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, put the parents in a terrible position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's funny because we've got a shared Prime account as well, but mostly what that means is when someone, anyone buys anything, it just shows up in each other's targeted ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's really bad. Yeah, that's a good argument for getting a separate account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My son buys a video game, it shows up in my targeted ads for a day and he's like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another, that's just Amazon's poor recommendation engine, by the way.  Let's see, what else? Oculus, the Oculus event was today and Oculus Connect's fourth annual get together in San Jose.  They announced a standalone $199 VR headset called the Oculus Go.  It's really a lot like the Google Daydream or the Gear VR, it doesn't need a PC, but it doesn't need a phone either, it doesn't need wires.  I can't imagine how this would even work.  You ordered one yet?  No, I'm not going to. You know what? I'm over VR.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it funny, Leo, that Oculus was going to be the second now and we're all still kind of, you know,  waiting for the real VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're dropping every third word now, Michael. I can't really understand. Try one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say that I remember a couple years ago when Oculus was the future, VR was the future.  We were all just, the whole thing was about to just break into the world, change everything.  But since then, augmented reality, mixed reality, etc., 360 video is clearly going to be such a, so much bigger impact and wider views.  I do, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is this just the next thing?  There's another one that we're saying, yeah.  The next big thing that won't go anywhere. This is another confirming story Nokia made.  Remember a $30,000 camera? We actually taped an episode of one of our shows with this, the Ozo. Was it Twig or Twit?  The virtual reality camera? They're killing it.  And 310 people are losing their jobs due to slower than expected development of the VR market.  And the fact that it cost $30,000 didn't hurt. I'm sorry, did I say $30,000?  $60,000, although they did reduce the price to $45,000.  So Alex Lindsay, I think, bought several of these.  Oh, wow.  You've got to be careful in this business. You can easily get sucked in by something that seems really, you know, you're right that augmented reality has a lot of promise.  But remember, wasn't the Apple event going to be the big thing, Mike?  Scoble told me it's going to be the breakthrough for AR. Oh my God.  Notice how AR has just taken off ever since Apple's iPhone 8. Not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think what's going to happen is it's kind of like when the app store first hit for the iPhone.  The first few months was like, you know, this is kind of cool. There's this, that, and the other thing.  But I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see more and more phone apps and tablet apps have augmented reality that's practical.  Things like you can use a measuring tape to measure a cabinet using your phone. Well, that's kind of amazing.  And, you know, it'll be sort of stepwise. I do believe that, you know, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We may never know what he believes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't the old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on a second. Let me get Mike to say whatever it is he believes. One more time we can edit out the gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think that augmented reality is going to make a huge impact. Not this year, not next year. It's coming.  By the time we're, you know, completely think it's mundane, it'll definitely be here changing the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, you've been through this, you know, technology that we're going to change the world and didn't and some that did. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's coming in via photography. I mean, Snapchat is actually the biggest AR company because they do all this weird face modification stuff that people create and post.  That's true.  I think it's coming into the world of augmented reality. If you think about doing that and if you look at the way that it's moving into the cameras with both the Apple's face scanner and Google's applying AI to do photo processing, things like that, we're starting to see it happen in that space.  So that's where I think it will end up being showing up in those practical spaces first rather than requiring us to strap things to our faces again, which is a big ask. That's the piece that's been difficult about this.  And Zuckerberg turned himself into a cartoon and going up to his waist in virtual water, real water, but virtual him is not helping any of this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real water, but virtual him.  This is actually an intro. Here's the first AR app on the iPhone. By the way, it's also available on Android that I actually kind of liked. And Megan Moroney showed me this yesterday on iOS today.  It's from a company called Vuforia. It's called Chalk. And you have the app on your phone, it could be on your Android phone, and you point it at something.  Let's say you're at an Airbnb, Mike, and they've got a remote control. You don't know how to get the TV working. So you call them up. They have the chalk app, you have the chalk app, and you say, let me show you this remote control.  What buttons should I push? And then they can actually use their finger or pen, let's see if it shows it here on this video, to circle the buttons, to point to the buttons.  You're pointing your camera at the thing they need to do, the thing you want to understand, and they're drawing on it to show you how to use it. That I think is really interesting.  That's kind of cute.  It's kind of a crowd-sourced...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It should be good for grandparents. If you could teach the grandparents how to use chalk, you'd need the chalk to teach them to use chalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the funny thing you should say that because that was on our episode of apps for your parents, for your elders, how to show them how to do stuff.  I think that's kind of interesting. It's chalk.vueforia.com. It's Android or iOS.  I've tried all the apps on iPhone 8. That's the first one I've seen that I thought, oh, that might be useful. Not wildly useful, but it might have some value.  I think the best thing you can say about AR is it doesn't make you nauseous.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  As nauseous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As nauseous.  If it's got lag, it makes you pretty nauseous because you're trying to see the real world.  Good AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. Ev Williams is back reinventing journalism. Let's try this one more time.  He says, anybody who writes on Medium now will be able to put their articles behind a paywall.  Jeff Jarvis, I don't know, you like Medium, but I think you've had mixed feelings about this new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on Medium to get more social coverage, not less. I know I'm not going to make any money with my blatherings.  I'm frustrated that I can't read some of the stuff that I want to read.  I love Ev. I think the world of him, and he's changed the world twice, and I'm never going to bet against him.  But I don't think we're there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So far, since the company expanded its partner program near the end of August, 83% of the participants who published at least one members only story earned money.  83%. The average amount earned $93.65.  Doesn't sound like riches, but it's better than nothing.  Probably better than a Google ad.  Yeah. Most any single author received in September was $2,279.12. Now that's decent money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not much for a professional journalist, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they don't tell you, Leo, is what percentage of the world's population they hid that article from because people in certain countries or certain economies are not going to spend money on journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, of course, Jeff's point, which is he'd rather get people seeing it than paying for it.  And that's what we do here. We give this away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's support advertising and figure out how to make advertising work. Let's not figure out how to make these little elite bubbles even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'd go a slightly different direction with that. I'd say find a way to get people to pay for things that doesn't require putting it behind a paywall.  That's the piece that's... The payment part is interesting, but the wall part is boring.  And I can't put it to you.  My dog has just pulled my headphones out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, poodles. What are you going to do? What can you do with a poodle?  Let's take a break while Kevin Marx puts his headphones back in. We're going to get your picks of the week, gentlemen, when we come back, or your number or whatever it is, whatever final thoughts you have.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  You know, if you are buying a new home or you're refinancing your home, you're about to enter into the Twilight Zone, submitted for your approval.  A normal couple trying to buy a new home, trapped by the bank for months.  That was me and Lisa four years ago when we tried to buy our house, the house we're living in now.  We went to the big bank, the number one lender in the country. You know the bank.  And we figured we're going on vacation in a couple of, I think it was four weeks.  This will be over by then.  No. No. They wanted more materials, more materials. We had to fax some stuff. We had to fax some stuff from the vacation.  Lisa had to call her sister and say, Debbie, can you please fax some stuff? They need more.  It took more than a month to get a home loan. That was my friend's 2013.  Today in 2017 we have a better way. We have Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.

Kevin Marks, I feel bad we hardly had much from you today.  We got to you late, but I'm glad you, I'm always welcome, and I know it's like the middle of the night, so thank you for staying up late with your poodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the poodles are waiting to be fed as well, so they're-  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks to Grumpy with me at the moment.  Well, what, do you have anything to plug with the open web? Anything you'd like to let us know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the usual thing is to go to indyweb.org and see what the upcoming indie webcams and homebrew website clubs are. There's a few of those there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'd like to promote that. I'm a big favor of the open web. Big fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, people are starting to think about this again. It's interesting to see people start to say, well, what if we have something that wasn't Facebook?  So you're like, yep, we're here waiting for you when you want to think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're ready for an open web.  But you said you were going to give us that foundation pic, and I do want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the foundation link, the best place to get it is on the internet archive.  If you search that for BBC Foundation, or I made a short link, j.mp slash capital BBC found, and it's an eight part adaptation of the whole trilogy.  So it's a little bit compressed, each eight hour long episodes.  And this was made in 1973.  So it's a reasonably faithful adaptation. It gets most of the original stuff through. They cut a few bits here and there.  But it's also got a great classic radiophonic workshop soundtrack from the D.D. Adabeshu area.  So it has that sort of retro futuristic thing that you get from 1970s BBC.  So I listened to it sometime last year, and it's a fun listen.  The BBC does an amazing amount of drama.  There's actually a BBC drama of the week podcast that I recommend that's worth subscribing to.  Because it'll give you something to listen to at regular intervals as well.  And they produce probably something, radio play every day, stuff in there.  They've also done great adaptations recently of a couple of Neil Gaiman novels that are up there.  So there's a bunch of really good stuff in the BBC's archives, and they get in the hang of the podcast thing there.  So my broader recommendation is go to the BBC and look for podcasts there, because you'll find something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's just reminded me, as long as you're talking about this, RTE, which is, I guess, the Irish radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's the Irish BBC, effectively.  Irish BBC.  Radio, Telefis, A-RAN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a phenomenal reading of James Joyce Ulysses.  It is widely agreed.  Jesus.  Now calm down.  How long does that go?  Oh, it's pretty long.  I was looking for a good version of Ulysses, and Audible literally has four or five various readings and so forth.  And I searched around and widely agreed that the RTE's version is the best, and there happens to be a copy of it on Internet Archive.  That's what reminded me of this.  And actually there's two versions.  You're going to want to get the little bit higher resolution VBR MP3 version of it.  But it's dramatized.  It's quite good, I have to say.  And I've been listening to it.  It is a hard book, but in some ways it's easier to listen to it, especially if it's acted out.  It kind of comes alive.  And who better to act it out than RTE?  So as long as you're on the Internet Archive and you're looking.  And you can also buy this on the CDs directly from RTE.  It was recorded in 1982 to celebrate the centenary of James Joyce.  And it's a full dramatized production.  I think it's unabridged.  I think it's everything.  It's very long.  So basically they read the text, but then they had actors do all the voices and so forth.  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  We know what you've been watching.  What do you think of it, by the way?  I'm not sure I like it.  I always like it.  Yeah, he's great.  We're talking about curb your enthusiasm.  The BBC Radio 4.org has the 1973 BBC Foundation trilogy, but you can also go to bbc.co.uk  slash podcast and subscribe to the drama of the week.  Is that what?  Which BBC channel is that on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Channel 4.  Channel 4?  There's a set of BBC Radio 4.  There's also a set of Radio 3 dramas as well, which tends to be slightly more classical.  Radio 3 is the classical stuff.  So they will do adaptations, whereas the BBC drama of the week is usually original drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one, two, three, four.  I'm all confused which is which.  Some are music, some are spoken word.  BBC 4 is the one that has all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Radio 4 is spoken word.  Radio 3 is mostly classical music.  And one and two are...  Two is easy listening and one is pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't listen to that.  What's nice though, this is through the iPlayer.  What's nice is even though I'm in the US, I am able to listen to it so they don't have  the geographic restrictions that they do on the video stuff on the iPlayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a mixture there.  There is a BBC Radio iPlayer app that has quite a lot of stuff.  The challenge is a lot of the iPlayer rules are available for one week only, so you actually  have to listen to it that week.  Whereas some of the podcasts have deeper archives.  One of the best is BBC In Our Time, which they basically do live, a 45-minute  seminar on something every week.  And there's about 400 of those up that you can listen to.  So if you want to learn all about James Joyce or something that they've covered,  something historical, it's like history, science, art, culture.  You basically get a 45-minute seminar led by Melvin Bragg with three academics  explaining it.  And they've spent a week getting it down to 45 minutes, they do it live, and they put  the podcast up.  And that's another one of these things.  It's nice having your podcast because once a week you get a brain dump on something  and it's usually interesting.  And it's usually very well produced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the Complete Foundation trilogy, is it?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do it in eight hours, which is quite tight for the trilogy.  I think the audiobook is quite a bit longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So it's abridged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a little abridged, yeah.  Sounds like a great listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Archive.org has so much great stuff on there.  What a great site.  You can use Hypercard on a Macintosh.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another Archive.org thing this week is they've just found that it's legal to post  books that were out of print in the U.S., that are out of print, sorry, that were  published between 1923 and 1941, if you're a library, which they claim they are.  So they're busy digitizing every book published in the U.S.  between 1923 and 1941 that is not in print anymore.  That's this week's time.  That's an interesting slice of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just noticed this ad on Facebook.  They also have a very large collection of Russian audiobooks, just in case.  Just in case you would like to brush up your Russian.  Just in case you need that.  Just you might.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I like this one.  I'm going to look over here.  So Google, so a couple of researchers, Feng, Li, Yong, Shi, and Ying Liu, according to  Boing Boing, tested the IQs of the various AI systems.  Google came out on top with an IQ of 47.28, doubling Siri.  Take that, fanboys.  Which had the 23.94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Jeff, 47 is not very bright either.  It's not.  It's an actual moron.  Okay.  But it's the best of the bunch.  That is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't have a chance to look at the whole paper and figure out the methodology.  What an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an interesting idea.  So Google's AI, Google Assistant has a 47.25 IQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Obviously, if you take the IQ test, you could program it to, as Donald Trump evidently said,  get 100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he didn't say get 100, did he?  He said I had a perfect score.  I had a perfect score on my IQ test.  Mike Elgin, Pick of the Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So I, unlike a lot of my fellow tech journalists, was not particularly impressed by Google Pixel Buds.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I would think in Georgia they'd be so useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm not impressed by the translation feature in particular.  People are saying, oh, with the Pixel Buds it translates languages.  No, it doesn't.  I recommend that everybody use Google Translate.  What the Pixel Buds actually do if you have a Pixel is they'll take the sound of the translation that's incoming to you and put it in earbuds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're not doing any work, I understand.  It's not that impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's face it, folks, you're not going to use that feature.  Even I'm not going to use that feature.  And I'm always living in countries where people speak a foreign language.  As earbuds, they're dramatically inferior to AirPods, Apple's AirPods, which I think are one of the best Apple products since the iPad.  They're phenomenal.  I love them.  And you can use them with an Android phone.  But here's the problem.  The way they work on an iPhone when you use AirPods is you double tap and you get Siri.  You don't want to use Siri.  You want to use Google Assistant.  So there is an application, there's an app for Android on the Play Store called AirPods for GA.  And it's a free app.  You download it.  And once you have this and you're using AirPods with an Android phone, you double tap on the AirPods and you get Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so that's interesting because remember, Neelay Patel was saying that really these different,  the Pixel Buds and the AirPods and the lack of a headphone jack is really about creating kind of walls between these different platforms so that you...  That's still true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true in terms of the optimization.  So AirPods are not optimized for Android.  You can use them. They're great.  The AirPods as a hardware product are super slick.  The batteries and all that stuff is fantastic.  They're not optimized.  You can use them.  They're not as good of an experience as on the iPhone, but it's probably better than Google Pixel Buds, I'm guessing, in general.  And again, double tapping for the Google Assistant is a pretty key feature, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Nice picks.  I'm going to tell you a couple of things coming up because I don't want you to miss them.  Friday on triangulation.  Triangulation has moved to a new time, 3 p.m. Fridays, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.  And I know many of you are fans of the Expanse series on Syfy and the Syfy Network.  Daniel Abraham will be joining us.  Is that right, Karsten?  This Friday with Father Robert Balas here, he'll be interviewing Daniel Abraham, the author of The Expanse, on Friday.  That's a big one.  That is one you do not want to miss, but we have some really exciting triangulations coming up.  The following week on October 20th, I'll be interviewing Philippe Kahn, who is absolutely legendary in this business.  I know Mike Elgin, you probably know Philippe, not only for his great saxophone work, he's a sailor.  But he started a little thing called Borland, which transformed the computer industry back in the 90s.  And I don't know if people know this widely, but without Philippe Kahn, I don't know if we would have camera phones.  He originated the technology, patented it, and I think still reached the rewards of inventing technology that was vital to the camera phone.  So that will be very exciting.  The following week we're going to talk about a new technology, gallium nitride technology, that's going to make a massive difference in technology, in computing, in processors, but right now in amplifiers and finfets.  And then Scott Galloway, we've been talking about Scott Galloway's article.  He has a new book called The Four, The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.  He wrote the article that said that, you talked a lot about Mike, actually, you wrote about it, that said that Silicon Valley is losing the faith and it's basically losing its reputation in the rest of the world.  And he was the guy who said it's just a matter of time before governments really start cracking down on Google and Amazon.  He'll be, Jason Howell will be interviewing him on November 3rd.  So we have some really big...  Good punch.  Yeah, well, and let's not forget Andy Weir coming up November 17th, the author of The Martian.  He's got a brand new book, we'll talk about that.  So, make sure you tune in to Triangulation at its new time almost every week in the next few weeks.  It's just huge.  3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern, 2200 UTC on its new time.  Friday's, I wanted to give it a bit of a plug.  And I want to thank you all for being here.  Kevin Marks, staying up late in Yorkshire.  Thank you, sir.  IndieWeb.org, always a pleasure.  Nice to have you here today.  Great to be here again.  No, no, no, that's fine.  Jeff Jarvis, joining us all the way from Berlin where it's equally late.  We're going to let him...  Are you staying in an Airbnb?  That's not a hotel, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a hotel, but it's pretty tacky behind me, I now see, yes.  That wallpaper...  The hotel's actually nice.  The conference and the Wi-Fi is good.  The conference, I forgot to make my hotel reservation, so I used hotels tonight and got something fast.  I got better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little tacky height.  I like it.  And then all the way from Tbilisi, Georgia on the Black Sea.  Amazing.  Mike is of course planning his next food assault at gastronomad.net.  They had a great success in Barcelona.  Next it's the south of France.  I'm sorry, Italy, then the south of France.  And who knows where's next.  It's great to see you again, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just found out that the best restaurant in the world is just around the corner from  us here, according to TripAdvisor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not Michelin.  TripAdvisor.  What is the best restaurant in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the best restaurant in the world?  It is the Black Swan at Oldfield.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds like there's some shenanigans going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looking it up now.  Is it that good?  No, it's basically, I haven't actually been there, but it's run by this sort of nice unassuming  local food company.  It does very good local food and has won a place on like a top chef competitions in the  UK, like a real one, not one of the fake ones.  And so I imagine this is the kind of place you go to think this is actually really amazing  But it's basically got the top ranked one on TripAdvisor worldwide.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Oldstead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oldstead, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm on my way.  And you get to go see...  Ooh, look at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's even nicer than your hotel room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and you can stay the night too.  Thank you everybody.  It's kind of booked now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet it is.  Best restaurant in the world.  Thank you all for joining us.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern, 20.30 UTC.
