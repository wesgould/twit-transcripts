Starting with Gina Trippani, who is at Etsy this week. Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, I'm at the Etsy office this week. There's a hack week going on here.  So this place is filled with handmade scarves and hardworking coders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do you mean a hack week? What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they invited a bunch of coders in to hack on Etsy features.  I see. I think they have a judging and that kind of thing. So the office is pretty busy and open today.  It's pretty cool. Every single desk here is handmade. I mean, these people, they live it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The desks are handmade? Not sure that's a good idea.  I don't know why, but I think handmade is wobbly. It sounds wobbly. That's all I'm just saying.  It's unique.  Also here with us as always, Jeff Jarvis, the city professor of journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello. So Gina, my office is in the Schmada district.  And there's a storefront I just saw that has a fancy, amazing, modern knitting machine in it.  And they kind of talk about hacking that. Oh, yeah, because it uses a computer.  It's like a 3D printer, right? So you can get an API. Yeah, I hack some knitting machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also here, Kevin Purdy, author of The Complete Guide to Android. Kevin, good to see you.  The Complete Android Guide. Good to see you as well.  Okay. CompleteAndroidGuide.com. Sorry. Let's get it right. No, let's get it right. Let's get it right.  You know, actually, Gina, when you talk about a hacker week or a hack week, it reminded me of that letter Mark Zuckerberg wrote to investors when they were  doing the road trip for the IPO, in which he said, we're hackers. We're not. We want to be more hackery.  We're not. The hacker way is the way to do it. And the thing that kills businesses is when they get entrenched, you get middle management to manage hackers.  And that's antithetical to the hacker way. I thought that was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's such a great point. I was just talking to the CEO here at Etsy and they were saying that they deploy code several times a day.  And on your first day at work at Etsy, you deploy code. And it's very much that like rapid iteration, you know, break things and fix them later.  That holds kind of Zuckerberg philosophy. Yeah, that letter is interesting. It talks about, you know, the open web and the hacker way.  And Facebook is not, I mean, you know, it's an incredible product, right? But it's not very open.  There's a piece in Wired about this, about whether or not Facebook is a monopoly and if they've closed the web more.  But yeah, Facebook, that letter also was really just interesting that it was piled up in all the financial statements during their IPO tour.  It's a weird document amongst the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He writes, hackers try to build the best services over the long term by quickly releasing and learning from smaller iterations rather than trying to get everything right all at once.  Done is better than perfect. We have the words painted on our walls. Done is better than perfect.  That was kind of like Steve Jobs, who said, great artists ship. Yes, it's meaningless if you make something perfect that you never ship.  He also says to encourage this approach. Every few months we have a hackathon, which is what's going on at Etsy right now, where everyone builds prototypes for new ideas they have.  In fact, they had a hack all night hackathon the night of the IPO to make sure all our engineers share this approach require all new engineers,  even managers whose primary job will not be to write code to go through a program called Bootcamp, where they learn our code base, our tools and our approach.  And it really is almost anti middle management. It's almost pro like the kind of company platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And it's, you know, use your API to build on your own API is the other thing that we keep on hearing.  But, you know, let me ask you both, all of you in the news business, it's hot to have hacks and hackers hackathons because journalists, of course, are called hacks.  But they don't often put out anything that's terribly useful.  Then people get together and say, Oh, I touched a coder this weekend and we made something and then and then nothing comes out of it.  There's a hack. There's a hackathon need to be in a context like a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean a hack?  There's a hackers group out in Rochester that actually took the local election website, which was totally, you know, non verified, non searchable and stackable data and turned it into an API.  And so on election night, instead of having to, you know, hit refresh and load scripts that automatically refresh the page, they could actually pull numbers as they appear on the website without having to get a government grant or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And did that code get implemented? Did it get put in the site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're using it every year. I'm pretty sure.  That's good.  Hacks, hackers, Rochester.  But, you know, that's a small bore target.  It's not like, you know, they're reinventing some part of journalism.  It's just there's a problem with something we want to write.  Let's fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I probably shouldn't say this because I'm here and I love Etsy and I think it's great they're doing Hack Week.  But I've always been a little skeptical about hack days and startup weekends and Hack Weeks because it's this idea that you're going to go in and you're going to launch a company or create a product.  And they're really just you don't hear about many products that were born out of out of Hack Day.  It's not unheard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But features, you often hear features that are born out of hacking, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You often hear that, you know, engineers at a company during their, you know, the Hack Weekend when they're, you know, have freedom to do what they want, take up a kind of a passion project, ship a feature.  Right.  But I think the purpose of these things is more about social coding, meaning like kind of being in a room with a bunch of other people who are wrangling with the same API and getting questions, answers and just getting used to interact with.  The tools.  And so maybe, you know, product doesn't launch, but you have the company comes out with a bunch of developers who now have very intimate knowledge of their API.  And that gets kind of gets stored in the back of their heads and any things that they go forward and thinking about in terms of apps they want to build or things that they can do.  They then have that knowledge, you know, getting getting coders in a room to all look at the, you know, documentation together and hack together is very, very powerful rather than having a bunch of coders just kind of alone in their basements.  You know, reading the documentation.  I think that might be a lot of the point of that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the social aspect of it.  Absolutely.  I also find it interesting that Etsy sees itself very clearly as a as a as a technology company, not as an auction site or whatever it is, not auction.  The craft.  Craft.  Palette form.  I mean, obviously they focused on crafts.  I mean, you were saying you're sitting in a room where even the ducts are wrapped in knitted products.  Knitted scarves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're very aware of that.  But it's interesting.  They really see.  See, we have that.  This is I'm thinking about that in terms of Twitter because we can't decide.  Are we a media company?  Well, we are a media company.  We are in many ways a traditional media company, except that we are delivered just as Etsy is in many ways a traditional e-commerce site or a commerce site.  Boy, we're hearing that debate all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it was Marissa Meyer and Yahoo is a technology company, a media company.  Then Twitter.  Dick Costello was answering that question just last week.  Now you know, I mean, I was starting to think it's mean is because the problem is that what's a media company?  It's something new.  It's something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the question is, what is our product is content?  Yes.  But unfortunately, in this modern age, we have to pay attention to delivery because we're inventing in some way.  If you want to do a television or radio station, it's such a well-known thing that you don't have you have an engineer, you have a staff, but they know what to do.  It's kind of a well-known.  But here we're kind of making up how it's still too early in the technology phase.  We spent a lot of time with technology still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say your product is not content.  What is it?  Content is a tool that your product, your value for this way, your value is the relationships you have.  Well, I agree with that, but we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the sugar is advertising.  The sugar is content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the content is a tool that comes in to do that.  But it's the relationship you have with people that really matters.  And I think it's really important.  But that's true of any business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every business is about your relationship with the customers, not the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just the problem in media companies.  I spoke to 50 CEOs, international CEOs from a big magazine company on Monday, and I gave the same spiel.  And somebody could say, oh, it's just another Jarvis tweet.  But I mean it.  Content is a tool that goes to the relationship.  And Facebook and Google and you and others, Etsy, are built on finding and extracting the value out of those relationships.  Whereas media companies think their entire value is in the content, and that's why they want to sell their content.  They're done with the business.  You're right.  I have no desire to sell our content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every once in a while, in fact, I had a conversation with a Hollywood producer on Monday saying, you know, G4 would buy your content if we could take it.  And we could massage it.  And I said, under no circumstances for you to pitch G4 anything.  But I don't see ourselves as a content company.  He said, you got all this great content.  And you're right.  I couldn't figure out why that didn't feel right.  Because your relationship, because I don't want somebody to buy the content like Apple's and resell it.  We're not about Apple's.  We're about our relationship with our audience.  Truly have a community here.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why you've said before that you don't want more than 100,000 people because or thereabouts.  I don't know what twig and twit are, but you want it to be focused in a community and workable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't put a limit on the numbers, but we don't focus on the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. You don't make it.  You don't say that the goal is millions.  Because when you do, that's the whole problem with page views and media.  It corrupted the business all across media and made that's more, more, more, more, more.  And what I say to media companies now is you should make your new metric.  Who do we know?  What do we know about them in ways that we can give them value back because of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then get ready for this because Twitter and Hollywood are working on an in-stream video series.  This is from Adweek.com.  Forget the debate over whether Twitter wants to get in the media business.  Twitter wants to be a media player.  The San Francisco company, along with multiple Hollywood producers and network execs,  are in serious talks about the possibility of launching, I don't even understand how this would work,  several original video series via Twitter.  Talk about a company that's confused about their business.  What the hell does that mean?  One project in particular could debut this year, potentially as early as in the fall.  They've been pitching this to a select group of advertisers,  a video series that would live on Twitter and enable users to participate in real time in some fashion.  The series has been described by sources as similar to MTV reality shows, The Real World and The Hills.  In fact, one of the producers behind The Hills is said to be behind the project.  The show could live on a standalone Twitter page similar to the events page Twitter launched with NASCAR in June.  Or maybe the series would be distributed within tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because tweets become rich so you can watch the little segment.  They hired a friend of mine named Fred Graver.  Fred, I bow to him because he was a writer on both Letterman and Cheers.  And he started Best Week Ever for VH1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't this somebody saying, I know how to do this, so let's shoehorn my style of content into your 140 character blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The meeting you had with Hollywood, yeah, I think it could be.  Why should Twitter create that?  If Twitter is a platform, of course, is Twitter a platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dick Costolo told the Wall Street Journal this week, Twitter is, right Jermaine, to this conversation, a technology company in the media business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then it's trying to become, to make media.  The next story in the rundown is Twitter did a deal with SiriusXM to make a show about politics based on tweets, talking about soundbites.  Yeah, it's in the schizo world of, I think it's leaving the idea of being a platform.  That's why it's changed its relationship with the developers.  That's why it's trying to own more things.  They think they're a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is this smart? Is this right?  Is this a last ditch effort to monetize or a clever move, a visionary move, understanding better than anyone what the business is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I underestimate Twitter at my peril.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think it's a last ditch effort.  I think it's a very, I mean, I think it's a strategic decision and it remains to be seen whether or not it'll work out.  I mean, clearly Twitter cares about right now making tweets more than just 140 characters, right?  The embeddable rich media, they want eyeballs on the site where they can show you ads, where they can show you promoted tweets, where they can show you promoted accounts.  That's where they get paid.  And they want tweets to be richer than just 140 characters, which I mean, is a little sad to me because the kind of thing I love about Twitter is that it's 140 characters of text and that's its roots.  But you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Tiamic Pentameter, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't start a company.  Look, this is to me, this is stupidity in the ninth degree.  You started a company doing a microblog 140 characters.  You built it up for people like me and Gina who loved that idea and Jeff.  And then you say, oh, no, new idea.  We're a media content company.  We're going to distribute media.  That's just that's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would say that they're a media platform, right?  They're trying to be Facebook in a way.  They want to create a platform where you can plug content into their web interface seamlessly to bring more people to the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But doesn't it?  I mean, Facebook, you could do that.  Why? But Twitter seems like that's a stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, it's not the 140 character limit.  It's the it's the fact that my relationship with Twitter is such that I know that Twitter is the thing I go to when I have something to say or when I want to see what's going on.  I don't think a politics series or a shutter Hills like show that doesn't that kind of breaks everything I know about Twitter.  And I'm not trying to sound like I'm from the 1920s.  I just I won't think of Twitter that way.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You cannot just decide, oh, hey, remember, we are the one thing now or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, but every other media uses Twitter as a place to have conversations.  I mean, every TV show, primetime TV shows have hashtags on the bottom.  I know it's amazing.  The screen. Right. So people are watching watching TV online and talking about on Twitter.  Twitter wants a piece of that. They want to run their own.  They want people to have common experiences and talk about them on Twitter.  And they want them to get that media to begin with from Twitter.  Stupid. Stupid.  I mean, I appreciate it. I think that I don't really know how I feel about it.  I don't feel like it's a last ditch effort at revenue.  I think this is a very strategic decision for them.  They've decided to be more than just a communications platform.  And I'm interested to see where it goes.  I'm personally not so like I'm not on fire about the idea of watching a reality show on Twitter.  But I am interested to see how they do it because, you know, Twitter's got some pretty great product folks there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, a pivot is a well accepted thing in this in this industry.  And it works often for many companies.  But you only pivot when you have failed at the first thing.  And Twitter has clearly not failed at the first thing.  So what they're showing to me is ADD.  They're showing to me an inability to focus.  Oh, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, or it's not pivot isn't just failure.  I think pivot is also building on success.  Two examples. Right.  One is Amazon starts as bookstore, becomes general retailer, becomes content distributor, becomes right.  That's not a pivot.  That's straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's expanding.  That's building.  It's an enhancement.  It's enhancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same with Google.  So is Google pivoting by starting as a search company, becoming an ad company, becoming a services company, becoming a mobile company?  Is that a pivot or is that a no, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a that's a judgment call on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you if you build on Twitter, I think Twitter, you know, if if Twitter's users started just on their own using Twitter in neat ways to start to distribute video in ways we never thought of, then I'd probably say cool.  You're happy here is that instead Twitter says, let's force this through the save and let's turn ourselves and let's demonstrate how we are a TV company.  So you look at the difference in YouTube.  YouTube says we're this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, I mean, this is not the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the other problem is, and this is where this is where they really realize that they went off the mark.  But I think they were on the mark and they're wrong about their decision.  There's off the mark is by having developers create clients.  That's what made Twitter explode.  That's how I experienced Twitter.  But I can't experience the tweets the way Twitter wants me to experience them now because they're out of control.  That's what an API does to you.  You lose control.  That's exactly the point.  And either you build the company around losing control as a benefit, which I think is the Internet way to do it, or you build the company around holding on to control.  But when you do that, you limit yourself.  And I think that that's the danger that Twitter is in right now.  It built as being an API and giving control to developers and others.  And now to try to do these new things, you've got to bring back control.  And as as my friend long ago, I haven't talked to her in ages friend, but used to know her name.  It was a friend of mine said to her famous celebrity lesbian mate who then tried to recant this, she said, You can't go back in the closet.  And that's the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so I think that that's in essence what Twitter is trying to do is they're trying to go back into the closet of becoming a controlling centralized media company.  But again, I've been wrong about them before and I'm not condemning it.  I'm just always befuddled by them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but this this isn't too doesn't feel like too much of a pivot to me, I think, because I went to the Twitter Dev conference.  I think it was called Cherp like in 2010 and they announced they announced this thing that never came to fruition called Twitter annotations.  Do you guys remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember how excited you we all were about it.  Yeah, we were pretty excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a way to attach any random metadata, arbitrary metadata to any tweet to add to the payload.  And the idea was that your app could display could attach data to tweet store in data in Twitter's data store and render it in your app.  And just it was really exciting to me because I was like, wow, the possibilities seem endless.  You could attach a tweet to anything and they never shipped it.  I never heard anything about it after that.  But this feels like an iteration of that with just a lot more control.  Right.  So we're going to we're going to embed this media content into into tweets, or we're going to put it out through Twitter and have our users interact around it.  So I'm waiting to pass judgment.  I'm interested to see what the API is going to look like.  You know, once they start launching this embedded media, you know, do developers have access to the to that metadata?  Can they render it in their in their apps?  Can they add to it?  You know, is it just partners that can do this?  Or can anyone do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm interested to see you compare this to we have some stuff this week from YouTube.  Yeah, I think ties in directly.  So what YouTube is doing at the same time, they had two big announcements.  I think big announcements today.  The lesser of the two is that they've opened a creative studio for their people in London, which is very much like Etsy.  Well, they want people to make stuff, help them make it.  So Etsy is creating right, you know, workspaces and creative spaces.  And the second thing they're doing, they did a big deal with Creative Commons to to create bring forward just tons of video for remixing.  And so then you're enabling you're truly like a platform of both cases.  You're saying we're here to help you create.  We're distributor.  We're going to get it around for you.  You go make the cool stuff and we'll invest in it and we'll create stuff to help you do it.  But we don't create you create.  I just feel like otherwise in a channel conflict, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think YouTube should announce one hundred forty character blogging, micro blogging site.  And then everything would all be right with the world.  I don't know.  Why do I want to put somebody in a box?  Let Twitter do whatever it wants to do.  But it's interesting that companies as companies are fleeing the idea being media media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. It's a rotten business.  And that's that's that was when this discussion was on Twitter today.  People without video, no reality show.  People were talking and I was saying the response back was, but isn't everybody a media company?  Is that what we say?  And yeah, nobody's a media company because everybody is.  Right. There's no distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I'll do it now.  I mean, if you think about what how how Google Plus think about how Google Plus uses Hangouts.  You could do a show in Google Plus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's got embedded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are already doing it.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're talking.  Kevin Purdy is here.  Complete Android Guide dot com.  Should say everything you need in three words.  Complete Android Guide dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Shazazzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Etsy lady is here.  She's not with Etsy, but she's handmade.  Miss Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm wearing something from Etsy today.  Oh, that's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see. What is that?  It's the serotonin molecule.  Wow, that's cool.  Now I know I see people with caffeine molecule t-shirts, but a serotonin molecule necklace.  Now that is cool.  What does that mean?  If you look at that, do you go into ecstasy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just I'm just happy all the time.  Where do you think this smile comes from?  That is a neat necklace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that molecular structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know who was here who was a block away yesterday, Chris Colfer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going I go out the door.  My boyfriend.  I know I go out the door and there's all there are like hundreds of teenage girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and with sign I love you, Chris.  I want to hold your hand and blah, blah, blah.  And and I like I was and so there's a bookstore across the street.

Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's doing a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know he's doing a book signing and the line literally goes down around the block, around that block, around that block.  I mean, they were it was it went on for hours.  Teenage girls.  And it's in there.  It's like two guys in the entire line.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

The Land of Stories, the Wishing Spell.  That's kind of neat.  Do you think he really wrote it or they're capitalizing on his fame?  Looks kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe both children's book.  I wouldn't have I would have assumed it would be a YA novel.  But he doesn't read.  Let me read a little bit from the prologue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dungeon was a miserable place.  Light was scarce and flickered from the torches bolted to the stone walls.  Foul smelling water dripped inside from the moat circling the palace above.  Large. Oh, the Chris Coulter fan clubs going crazy.  This is the large rats chased each other across the floor searching for food.  This was no place for a queen.  How many times have I heard that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of sci-fi fantasy.  He's a little bit of a geek.  Snow White. Snow White's in it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know what, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need a Squarespace site to call it.  Squarespace has a big announcement, by the way.  Brand new service.  They're calling it the new Squarespace.  You might have heard me talk about it as version six.  Let's just talk at the new Squarespace.  Oh, my golly gosh.  If you tried Squarespace before, you got to try it now.  Completely new set of code.  Completely new.  50 plus newer improved features.  The pricing the same.  But, boy, you get a whole lot more of these beautiful template designs.  And they're, by the way, the latest thing, responsive design.  So when you drag an image in to your Squarespace gallery,  it automatically sizes the image into, I don't know, half a dozen different sizes  so that your site looks great on any device.  So and it's automatic.  So if you're on a big screen, you'll get the big picture.  If you're on a mobile device like an iPhone, you get the little picture.  They call this in the world of the Internet responsive design.  And it works so beautifully from PC to tablet to smartphone.  This incredible layout engine.  You just slide and push and pull and you make it exactly yours  without any code, without any JavaScript or CSS.  Although if you know JavaScript and CSS, it couldn't be easier.  They will import all your existing content too.  Saving all the SEO, all the links, all the images, everything,  even the comments are preserved.  And of course, if you have a social media account,  it's very easy to incorporate your Flickr, your Foursquare, your LinkedIn,  your Twitter into this and your Google Maps.  It is so nice what they've done.  This is, it's interesting.  This is not a content company.  It's a content enabling company, a company that uses great technology to do hosting  plus the best software in the world to give you the best website you've ever seen.  And it's yours free for two weeks when you visit squarespace.com.  Just click the Try It Free link.  You don't need a credit card.  Actually, it says Get Started now.  Click the Get Started link.  You don't need a credit card.  In fact, they're so anxious to get you to try it.  When you click the Get Started now, it says, well, choose a template first.  Like you don't even give them any information at first.  This is just to get you to wet your whistle, so to speak.  Look at that.  There's a kind of a Pinterest-y template called Flatiron.  Click your template.  This is all before you give it a site name.  Maybe, what did I do?  And then, then you don't even need a credit card.  You've got two weeks free to try it, to play with it, to use all the features,  get an idea of what Squarespace could do for you.  If you decide to buy, oh, you're going to love this part.  Squarespace has not changed the pricing.  It's still very affordable.  Now, I'm going to recommend an annual plan.  I'll tell you why in just a second.  Well, let me give you the pricing first.  So it's $8 a month for the basic, the standard.  $16 a month for unlimited.  Boy, when I say unlimited, $16 a month and you get unlimited bandwidth,  unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.  So you can do a blog with a dozen contributors as well.  Really get in the publishing business.  The best hosting, the best software, $16 a month for unlimited everything.  And when you use the offer code TWIG7, you get 10% off your first purchase.  So make that first purchase a big one.  That way, you get more savings.  Really incredible. Squarespace.com.  Go there, give it a shot, try it, play with it.  You get to see everything.  And then if it makes sense to you, and I know it will,  use the offer code TWIG7 when you sign up and you'll save 10%.  Squarespace, the new Squarespace is here.  We've been waiting for it. We've been so excited.  I've been playing with it for six months and I can vouch for it.  It's just fantastic. Squarespace.com. Give it a try today.  Gina Tripani is here. Kevin Purdy is here. Jeff Jarvis is here.  We're talking Twitter, Google.  We have a little bit of Facebook, the cloud.  SiriusXM has a show based on Twitter.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called politics powered by Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a new radio format diving into politics from every angle driven by Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to be the blog guy unpaid on MSNBC's Coast to Coast  with Monica Crowley and Ron Reagan.  And I was on regularly all the time.  They do this news and they turn and say,  well, Jeff, what's the blog world saying about this?  Well, here, Ron, are three disjointed quotes out of context  that mean absolutely nothing in isolation,  but we're going to act hip like we have the blog world.  And that's the problem with all of this.  It's the same stuff we see on TV news when they say,  well, what's Twitter saying?  Well, Twitter is saying this ridiculous thing that makes no sense  outside the context of 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm wondering, I mean, what this sounds like to me is they have announcers reading tweets,  but I can't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're discussing them too or something,  but how much do you read a tweet?  You say, well, this is, gee, Romney's trendy today.  Yes, he is. Is he trending as much as he was yesterday?  I don't know. Let's try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a brand new radio format that reports to listeners exclusively  what politics are being talked about on Twitter,  including trends and tweets from politics,  journalists, celebrities who have active voices on the key political issues,  electrical races, electrical, I'm sorry, electoral races,  and breaking news specifically designed as a daily digest  for serious listeners driving home from work, politics powered by Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you digest Twitter?  That's like digesting the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pre-chewed Charlie's. It's already digested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Try and hard, try and hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it is interesting how often you see like on local news  or news stories just being a series of tweets.  I mean, the Colorado shooting.  That's right.  My local news was just reading tweets.  And what frustrated me is that there was one tweet in particular  that they kept screenshotting, the one from Jessica Redfield saying,  you know, the movie doesn't start for 20 minutes.  She had replied to a friend who said, well, why are you tweeting?  Why aren't you at the movie?  Right. But obviously like the news people didn't know how Twitter worked  and didn't acknowledge that she was actually replying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She keeps tweeting this. She keeps tweeting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The movie doesn't start for 20 minutes.  So, but yeah, I don't know if I can handle a whole show.  Is it just going to be kind of the best sound bites from Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It's an hour long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine the poor schmucks doing it.  You know, that's why this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like people like you, Jeff, who got roped into it, and they know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could have Gilbert Gottfried to read them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then on Twitter somebody writes,  Ms. Romney!  Oh, God. Oh, God.  You want to see a Nexus 7 commercial?  Do they need to advertise? They've already sold out.  They can't make anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so happy I have mine. I have not used my iPad in a week.  I guess they have the 8 gig version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And frankly, I think that's fine if you really want...  That's a $200 version, but they've sold out of the 16 gig, the 250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously did not predict the demand,  which also probably tells me the 16 is too small itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so. I think people assume that.  But it's such a cloud device. I don't find that an issue.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's...  Go ahead, Kevin.  No, just in Google's mind, I feel like it is...  The way that they pitched it at I.O. and the way that they've pitched it in general,  to them it is a great way to get stuff from the Play Store.  But most people are looking at it as a great tablet  to throw their music and their own movies on and their own stuff on.  And so, of course, they're going for the 16 gig  because it's a ridiculously nearly subsidized price for a 16 gig tablet.  I bought the 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But let me just check and see.  I'm curious how much of it I've used.  I've got 53 apps on here.  And I don't have a whole lot of content.  But you haven't taken a plane ride yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The key to this is a plane ride.  I got the smaller iPad and I ran out of space on that real fast.  I have used...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have 11 gigs available.  Sheena, did you put media on yours for your plane flight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I downloaded a couple of Kindle books, but I didn't download...  Just take up no space.  You're classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm using Google Music, so I guess you'd want to cash a playlist or two, right?  Yeah, and doesn't Google Music do smart caching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, it tries to...  Like, when you start to listen and stream a playlist, it caches ahead.  So that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nice to grab the rest of it.  I watched four episodes of The Walking Dead on a plane ride with the 8 gig.  There was space left over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you can't put your entire video collection on it,  but you can judiciously load it up with enough to satisfy you.  Yeah, I mean, I've got 200K of audio,  257 megabytes of pictures and videos,  767 megabytes of apps,  total space 13.24 gigs available, 11.62 gigs.  I got a ton of space left.  And I've been using it a lot.  I love this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just thrilled that Google finally has a hit on its hands.  And I've always felt like the Nexus was the best Android experience.  And I wish that Google would market the Nexus as the Google device.  Yes.  They don't do it.  I'm not sure why they don't do it.  I don't know if they don't want to scare off everybody else.  I don't know what, but the Nexus is a great experience.  I love it. I love that thing.  I haven't been able to take my hands off it, too.  I've had it with me.  In fact, if it weren't for the show, I thought about maybe trying to do the show on the Nexus.  And then I thought, maybe I'll take the laptop.  But the rest of the week, I'm just traveling with the Nexus and a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the ad.  Not that they need one.  But what I think is really most telling is people like MG Siegler,  people who are normally at Ani Anaka, who are normally iPad fanatics and say,  oh, there's nothing close, are all almost to a man saying, and a woman saying,  this is actually really good.  Yeah.  And you can take it camping.  Wait a minute.  Hold on there.  Do they have Wi-Fi at the campsite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kiwi, you're going to don't keep going.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 50 plants.  Daddy is waiting.  Let's play chess.  Great Father, Son moment.  I know they're in the backyard.  It's obvious.  Oh, it's a spoiler.  Yay.  Point being that without 3G, you can't leave the backyard.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what you have to do is tether to your Galaxy Nexus.  That's the trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I do.  That's the first time I've ever seen a major use of the flashlight capabilities of devices.  Every geek does it.  We all know it.  It's the dirty little secret.  That's the first time I've ever seen it in public.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dirty little secret.  Actually, there's another thing us old farts do.  You won't know about Kevin for another 20 years.  You can also, and you can't do it with this, but with a camera on the back, you can read menus.  I see people doing that all the time.  If you go to the early bird special, you'll see people going like this.  What is that?  And what they do is they take a picture of it and they magnify it on their phone so they can read.  It's better than readers.  Wait a minute.  Update packet downloaded.  Wait a minute.  Samsung.  What's going on?  I've got an update on my Samsung Galaxy 3.  Could it be device will be rebooted?  Wouldn't it be nice if Jelly Bean just showed up?  With Jelly Bean?  No, of course not.  They do this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, speaking of things just showing up, I just received an email from Sergey Brin.  Not personally.  A mass email.  You should have gotten this, Kevin.  Welcome glass explorers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have gotten it too because I bought a pair of glasses.  Oh yeah, you got one too.  I'm number 747.  What's your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even know my number.  I was so late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excuse me, but you should.  That's how we keep track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know.  Just promising lots of fun glass stuff.  A little picture that he took on his road trip to Montana.  And I guess they're going to set up a private glass explorer edition Google Circle, Google Plus Circle, where they're going to post updates and things.  Fun.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Jason, is our glasses, are they attached to your email?  Probably, huh?  So look for an email from Google inviting you to join a fabulous new group.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For stuff that you can't really use because you won't have the glasses for another year.  So wait a minute, apparently this update warning, OT update for the Galaxy S3 disables local search.  Is this, this is some lawsuit crap.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice job.  I can see the little Android gut spinning.  You're doing it.  Can you stop the update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, at my peril.  Yeah, no, you don't want to stop that.  This is the new update, which I like.  They have a little tesseract in the Android's tummy and it rotates, as you say, while it's updating.  Well, whatever it is, I've done it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the, that's the lawsuit that for those who don't know, it's the lawsuit stemming from Siri and local search and that kind of thing.  Yeah.  Well, that sucks.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you mean what happened there is Apple,  sued and so as a result, they're just taking, this is the international version by the way.  So that's why I'm getting this.  If you have a Galaxy S3 from Verizon or Sprint, maybe you, I don't know why you won't, but you won't.  But so the latest OTA update does away with the universal search function, which browses your phone's contacts and apps for results.  Apple says, no, you can't do that.  Oh, this is so stupid.  27 megabytes.  Apple just reached into my phone and squeezed my testicles.  See, I told you I would say the wrong thing today.  I told you that's me all over.  This is where I say my sexist, make my sexist comment.  It feels like that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like they're just, they got me and they're slowly tightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sons of beaches.  Somebody said Samsung did it, not Apple.  I know Samsung did it because of Apple.  Samsung did it.  Yeah, Apple did it by proxy.  All right, moving on.  That was really depressing.  What just happened?  That should not be allowed to happen.  I guess I could have turned it down if I knew what I was doing.  Oh, wait a minute.  Waskel says, you're not allowed to do that.  You're not allowed to do that.  I could have turned it down if I knew what I was doing.  Oh, wait a minute.  Waskel says, no, Samsung did it because they stole Apple's technology.  And it was, they had to do that because they were bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The dialog should sort of said, would you like to downgrade your phone?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you like the special Steve Jobs edition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android is upgrading.  Unless you download that, you can't get Jelly Bean in the future and so on.  No, you have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you have to do it.  I understand.  And this won't happen again.  This is the European unlocked version.  That's why it happened to me and not you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I had to be an early adopter and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The PC World magazine already, Google Glass is not even like, it's not even a demo.  And already PC World has an article, Google Glass Horror Stories from your privacy free future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh, obvious crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mark Sullivan writing in PC World, call me paranoid, but I think Google Glass is scary.  Well, I don't know.  Is it scary?  Are you scared?  So are airplanes.  Airplanes are very scary.  Airplanes are scary.  Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Geez.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has immense power.  It's just all that standard claptrap stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A marketer's dream, a consumer's nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the device itself is more conservative than most people realize too, because in order

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to take a picture, you actually have to press a button on the top right of the visor.  It's not like you can just look at people and go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and take a picture  of them.  Blink, blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to like, yeah, I mean, it's just as awkward or as interfering as a Japanese

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  camera phone.  And you know, the device itself, what it's showing you is such a small little piece of  glass in the upper right corner.  It's really not the, it's not like the altered augmented reality that everyone thinks it  is yet.  It's really like a first step towards that.  But the device, you know, the designer herself told me that, you know, they design these  so that people know you're wearing them, because it takes a while for society to get used to  these new kinds of technologies.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google more than anybody's aware of the pitfalls of doing this surreptitiously.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that people don't give Google credit all the time, but in this case, I really feel  like people don't give them a little credit for understanding what it's like to put cameras  in everyone's hands and everyone's on everyone's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drives me a little nuts.  Google is seeking campaign money.  There's always crazy money in election years.  How much did, so Romney's got hundreds of millions, Obama's got hundreds of millions.  It's going to be a billion dollar campaign for both, probably.  It's why the country is so screwed up.  Yeah.  Billion dollars.  And, and of course, Google wants a little bit of that.  A little bit of that.  So they're touting the net as a prime information source.  Forget your television.  This is a Google infographic called Four Screens to Victory.  What do they do?  Is this for sales?  It is.  Google.com slash elections slash ads.  Sure.  You can have your TV ad, but what about mobile devices?  The other three are ours.  Tablets and personal computers.  If you really want to be big this year, if you want to be the next member of Congress.  I can't quite read it, but you get the idea.  I'm so sick of infographics, but you get the idea.  I am too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just something that could be said in a paragraph is now said in an acre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw an infographic this morning.  It said something like, if you converted every tweet into pennies, it would reach to the moon and back.  It's like, what does that mean?  It means nothing.  They're not pennies.  They're not going to the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that mean?  And it was a picture of Earth and then the moon and pennies.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was so stupid.  And it was a five meg JPEG file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was huge.  If you converted this JPEG to dollar bills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was your Seinfeld imitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  And that's on my flipboard.  So of course it's taking over my phone.  Four screens here it is is bigger.  Access to political information no longer comes from one place or one screen.  In just four years since the last presidential election, the continued growth of the web and proliferation of smartphone and tablet have radically changed when, where and how voters access political news and information.  Tablet ownership has doubled over the last holiday season.  80% of smartphone owners actively use their device while watching television.  That's because television is so crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need something to distract ourselves.  We're just bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are going to be so bored by your political ads this fall.  You should have another place to reach them as well.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  They're looking at their phone while your ads are going on.  83% of mobile phone.  This is interesting.  This is a fact, according to Google.  83% of mobile phone owners are registered voters.  24% of campaign donors rely on mobile election information.  Adults spend more media time on mobile than newspapers and magazines combined.  I think this is a pretty compelling case.  I'm going to buy some ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, you know we want you to run for president.  Oh no, no, no.  We all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want you to run for school board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm on the board of my kid's high school.  There's a fun job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you should buy ads for re-election at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to run.  You know, I got a tool for you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just was thinking about this.  But since you already have another tool, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not married to my tool.  I'll paste this into your tool section.  Okay.  And then you can review it.  You could do Duck Duck Goog.  Or you could do this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a good tool.  You're a tip though.  You're a tip.  Yeah.  So I could do that.  You do it if you want.  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Gina Trapani is here.  It's so fun to have you in the...  Would you just go get something handmade and put it on your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I should.  Just so we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bring it back to something completeness, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, Kevin Purdy, CompleteAndroidGuide.com.  Are you freelancing for anybody, Kevin?  What are you doing these days besides that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I freelance for Fast Company and IT World and myself.  You see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yourself.  Do you pay yourself?  Well, I write for whoever else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the tax consequences of freelancing for yourself?  It's a weird or a boros of...  You're eating your own tail.  I just...  Myriad other publications that I don't have time to list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have a show on 5x5, which you very carefully not mentioned,  with this person over here whose name is Gina Trapani.  50% of your guests.  50% of my guests have a show on 5x5.  It's the same show.  What's the name of the show?  It's called In Beta.  In Beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, we're so in sync that we almost...  It's like a half second difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Next week on InBetit, they're going to read tweets.  It'll be very exciting.  Yes.  I got a really cool email I'm going to read in just a second.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, the author of Public Parts.  I have only one show, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yours.  Aww, that ain't right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mentioned Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You saw that Seinfeld has a new show, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just put the link up on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.  Now this is one...  If I were our good friend, Creighton from Red Dwarf, what's his name?  You know, the guy who does the car thing.  Lule. Robert Lule.  Robert Llewellyn.  Llewellyn.  If I were Bobby Llewellyn, I'd be pissed.  I would sue.  I would say, you need to downgrade your show, because this is exactly what he does.  He gets people...  He gets Llewellyn, yeah.  Yeah, Bobby Llewellyn does.  He drives around in a car.  Anyway, here's Seinfeld.  Apparently it's a Volkswagen ad.  I didn't even know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think...  You see the three cameras pasted on the windshield.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think V-Dub paid for this.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a 1952 VW Bug in Azure Blue.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that.  That's the turn signal.  I know, and they don't have a...  ...25 horsepower engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gas meter, they have a reserve tank.  ...because the rear window was made in two pieces to save money.  And if like me, you feel that true humility is always in short supply...  Look at that.  ...this is the car for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hysterical, that turn signal.  It just sticks out.  It's a car collector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just got to be able to write it off.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey.  Bingo.  Want to do something?  Absolutely.  Really, you're free?  Yeah, I can be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See the three cameras on the windshield?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's get them.  Are they...  GoCams?  What are they?  Yeah, GoCams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're good.  Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld, and this is Comedian.  That's exactly how Bobby Llewellyn does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  It's different.  He has coffee involved.  All right, I'm bored already.  This is another show about nothing.  I've been watching my smartphone the whole time.  Is there advertising in this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't need the money.  So why is he doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  There's a preview of the next episode there, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Ricky Gervais will be in the next one.  That should be good, yeah.  Oh, it's going to be hysterical, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There are funny moments in this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he's a different car in each one.  So basically he's getting to write off each of his entire collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a nice twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Bobby's always in his Prius.  This time is a Triumph.  Oh, don't drive fast in that thing.  That's a death trap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, that made it worse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no seat belts in this car, by the way.  I just want to tell you.  Okay, that's funny.  We're getting coffee for cost.  We're not turning views above the bar.  All right, little plug, little plug for comedians and cars getting coffee.  But now the actual ad.  Speaking of cars, you probably are not.  You know, maybe you should.  Maybe he will do a 2012 Ford Focus Electric.  I want to lobby for that, Mr. Seinfeld.  Because I'll tell you what, you would have a much smoother ride.  You'd actually have safety equipment, which goes a long way towards reassuring your passengers.  And you could show off the incredible MyFord mobile app.  You know, he really should do this.  You can get Seinfeld.  You could just snap up one of these at an EV certified Ford dealer near you.  Bring along your BlackBerry, your Android or your iPhone and install the MyFord mobile app.  And you can show people how, like, for instance, if you lose your car, the app says where it is.  It'll tell you where charging stations are.  This is a really, I think the point of this is really it's a technology demonstration for app developers of why you want to take advantage of Ford.  You want to take advantage of Ford's API.  It's called AppLink that lets you use the car as a platform.  Your car's current location, grocery store.  You can also there's a website, MyFord mobile website, that tell you how you're doing in terms of CO2 consumption with leaderboards.  You could be like the number one CO2 saver in the Northeast.  It lets you set go times so you can have the car heat up or cool off before you actually get in the car.  You say I every every weekday at 8 a.m. I want the car to be 72 degrees Fahrenheit.  And you turn that on and off.  You can have charging value charging profiles that say only charge during off peak hours.  Save me money.  It is the MyFord mobile app, one of the many great features, one of the high tech features that Ford is bringing to all of its vehicles.  Ford.com slash technology to find out more.  And absolutely, if you get a chance, go to your Ford dealer, your EV certified Ford dealer and test drive the 2012 Focus and bring your smartphone so you can try the MyFord mobile app.  So I did a bad thing on a show a few shows ago and I meant to make it good and I never did.  We were talking about the org charts of Google and Microsoft and Apple and how the problems Microsoft was having is because they had, you know,  they had, you know, internecine battles and I had referred it to a website called Techno Buffalo where I'd seen this.  But in fact, it is not from Techno Buffalo.  It's from bonkersworld.net.  Manu Cornet or Corneille sent me autographed originals of the org chart.  Isn't that great? I'm going to frame these.  Thank you, Manu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Manu is a Googler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Manu is a Googler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brilliant.  In-app purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In-app purchases.  So Manu, thank you.  This is so great.  This guy's great.  Here's a good one.  How tech companies apologize.  Google, we screwed up.  Sorry.  That's Eric Schmidt.  Facebook, sorry, but we're still right.  Smart sucker bird.  Oracle, say one word, we'll sue your ass off.  Rim, mistake, we're mistake.  Apple, you're holding it wrong.  And Microsoft, it just has Balmer sticking his tongue out.  I'm getting these framed.  These are going in the office.  I should probably send each of you one.  Those are really cute.  Let me do that.  Which one do you want, Gina?  There's one more here.  This is one for you, Gina.  The life of a software engineer.  Clean, slate, solid foundations.  This time I will build things the right way.  Much later.  Oh my, I've done it again.  Oh yeah, that's mine.  That's for Gina.  That's for Gina.  We'll frame that up and send it out to you.  I don't know which one you want, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he have them up on a dedicated site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bonkersworld.net.  Yeah, let's give that plug.  Bonkersworld.net.  Manu, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take the business model one if you're offering.  You want that one?  The phone?  Sure.  It's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like a New Yorker cartoon.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, that's great.  All right, so we're going to get those two frames sent to Jeff and Gina.  Kevin, if you come on more often, I'll have one for you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want these for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can have them all for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm going to send those to you.  He's got more though at Bonkersworld.  That's really cool.  Bonkersworld.net.  Here's five minutes of TV.  Let's see what this one is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, some people are just too smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guy's a Gmail engineer and a brilliant cartoonist.  I hate that.  He does have a Gutenberg one, apparently.  Oh, really?  Yeah, let me see.  Wait a minute.  You know what, Manu, if you're watching, let me thank you, Big Ginge, in our chat room.  He's sending us the Goob Gutenberg one.  Well, I can't get to it now.  You just...  Mr. Gutenberg, I know this is...  Here, show it.  Mr. Gutenberg, I know this is a breakthrough, but it's launched nearly two quarters now.  We haven't made a profit yet.  Yeah, I guess it's time to kill it.  I think we should...  Manu, if you could send me that, I'll get that frame for Jeff.  That is awesome.  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is awesome.  Very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, some people are just too talented.  I hate that.  Yeah, I hate that.  I barely have one talent.  He's got like eight.  Probably plays the banjo too.  And they're often great musicians and programmers and artists and just all this stuff.  Sure, I'll own that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  The myth of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Gina, do you play at a musical instrument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.  I don't.  I played piano as a kid.  But no, I don't have any major epic artistic hobbies.  Maybe I should get one.  What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She'll pick up the banjo and play it like that.  You should build things out of sugar cubes, massive things, and then bring them to Burning

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man and burn them.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Knitting.  There you go.  Knitting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you want Gina to make sweaters for us all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  Here you go.  The chat room's got it.  Oz Ned says, knit a banjo, then play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect.  Multi-talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vizio has got its pre-order up for the Google TV set-top box.  It's cute.  This is better than the Q. Look at this.  It's called the Vizio CoStar.  That's a good price.  And it's the new Google TV experience.  It's another one of these set-top boxes.  You do get a remote.  A little bit more complicated than the Apple remote.  But the Q is not a Google TV box.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the irony?  No, it's not.  $300 and you don't get Google TV.  Yeah.  This...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Blue dot that stares at you, though.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little blue dot that constantly judges you while you watch TV.  For a penny less than a Benjamin, can you tell it's in gadget writing, it adds the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google TV experience to your existing set-up and brings along its remote with it.  It's a Marvell Arm processor.  Ready for apps like OnLive.  Oh, that's interesting.  So you could game with it as well.  Oh, this is very tempting.  This competes directly against the Apple TV and the Roku.  August 14th, current ship date.  But you can...  You can...  Order now.  I'm going to order one right now.  I was convinced that my TiVo was busted last weekend because I was getting stuttering every

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30 to 60 seconds.  Yeah.  And I tried everything.  I downloaded something from Amazon to check.  I checked my cable signal.  Everything seemed fine.  I was just about to buy a brand new TiVo and I posted a Google Plus about it.  And someone said, do you have a Google TV hooked up to that TiVo?  Oh, no.  Because that can cause that problem.  Oh, no.  I unplugged the Google TV and everything was fine.  Oh, that's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was great that the people in my Google Plus comments saved me a couple hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  And once I reset the Google TV, it was fine.  Oh, okay.  So it works now.  It works now.  It just was one of those things that I was just...  I really like having a browser on my TV, but I don't know if I can do that.  I can have a browser on my TV, but not if it's going to cause problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not if you can't watch Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uninterrupted.  They're going to do a project butter for Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They need a project butter for Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to smooth out all the kinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to iTunes99 in our chat room, the Sony Google TV second generation will be available at 4 p.m. today.  Didn't even know that.  Oh.  So this is cool.  The Vizio CoStar.  They showed it at Google I.O.  I did not get a chance to see it, but it looks pretty cool.  You could preorder Vizio.com slash CoStar.  And they've got a preorder button right on there.  What does the new Google TV look like, Gina?  It's not something we have, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new Sony unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just the new UI.  Oh, the new UI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I don't think that we've gotten it.  I don't think the review...  You have a review, right?  Yeah.  Logitech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that we have got it.  I have a review.  Hmm.  1080p, full HD, 3D support, Wi-Fi.  I like how it looks.  Now, here's the new Google TV experience.  It looks kind of similar.  You know, I have to say, given the choice between how Apple does Netflix and how the  Logitech review does it, I far prefer the Logitech review.  Yeah, it's nice.  Apple's got a brain dead interface.  They really didn't do a good job.  It's a lot of clicks to get around.  This...  Look, they've got a control.  The remote control has a trackpad on the Vizio device.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's quite a remote control.  That's a little much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then on the other side, you've got a QWERTY keyboard.  Oh, there you go.  So, you're guaranteed to push a wrong button no matter where you hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not the most spouse-friendly remote I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no such thing.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in particular, a trackpad and a keyboard is kind of intimidating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is interesting.  No, this is the same as the review.  It's got HDMI.  This is one of the things I think...  I don't know if people understand what's unique about a Google TV.  It's a passthrough device.  So, it's an overlay on top of your cable television or your satellite television,  which I really like.  So, you can get a menu bar.  Your TV continues playing the show.  You can do stuff with the TV in the background.  Picture in picture.  Yeah, much nicer than the Roku, which you either watch the Roku or your cable.  It's a separate device.  This is kind of an overlay.  And so, it has the passthrough, dual HDMI passthrough.  802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  Bluetooth?  Hmm.  And USB ports.  Not sure what you could do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, I now imagine a remote control that has the old ThinkPad nipple on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's only a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody uses it, but then 10 people use it and they always tell you about how great it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we got one here. It works here.  It has to have the nipple.  Without the nipple...  Yeah, right there.  Look, he's going to pop his head off in a second.  There he is.  Did you hear him say it's great?  There, right there.  Oh, we got two of them.  Two hands.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Howard Stern, this is a straight line.  I'm going to get in trouble for it.  I'm going to get in trouble for it this week.  But Howard Stern wouldn't go to a Mac because he liked the nipple too much, but of course he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, of course he did. Right. Of course he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry I said that, right? I was defending him.  I apologize. Good news, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe for you. Twitter says we're going to be able to get your old tweets back someday.  Right now there's a limit of how many? 5,000 tweets back.  3,200 tweets back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a full history download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is such a long time in coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Costello told the New York Times the company's building a tool that would let Twitter users download their own tweets.  He says, well, it's complicated.  It's a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a cold storage, hot storage issue there.  I mean, they just offload old tweets onto different storage.  And in Europe right now, you can send Twitter a letter requesting your archives, and after a certain amount of days, they'll send them to you in a file.  But it sounds like this tool is going to let you just do that, just export your tweets.  And it's a good step in the right direction. Feature zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so it's something they had to do for regulatory reasons.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, this also we've had this conversation like Anil and I were joking that we both celebrate, you know, the yearly holiday when like Twitter says they're going to let you get to your old tweets.  When we see it.  But the truth is like this date, this is a data liberation problem.  It's like, okay, so I click on an export button and I get an XML file or an HTML file.  And like what?  Okay, like how useful is that to me?  I can feel good about doing that, but you can't search that stuff.  You can't say, hey, can you show me Kevin responded to something witty, you know, in 2009.  Can I find that?  You know, it's just your old stuff out of context of the system and it's not search enabled.  So, I mean, it's the first step to I think what I think there's a lot of Twitter.  It's concentrate on being what's in the moment, right?  That's always what they've what they've done.  And so I don't know how if we're ever going to see the ability to be able to search through your archive or search the replies to you on Twitter.  So much functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, because because I my old blog have a pretty things on the blog to save it and delicious.  And delicious.  I put things in the work.  But if I knew we're in Twitter, if I don't get to it, I would use it even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a good argument for installing.  Think up.  Yes, it is one of the reasons I did, because you mine all the tweets and all the replies, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the replies, all the links, all the favorites, all your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't go back in time.  But if but from the moment you're running it going forward, you're going to have an archive of that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes as far back as it can.  So you start with the thirty two hundred.  Yeah.  And then you have the thirty two hundred tweets.  And then they do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they do this, it sounds like it may be fairly trivial to then just add your added archive back into what you've got.  You may not get the depth that you provide, but you get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it's great for it's great for us because it means that, hey, you can import your tweets and to think up and we can maybe do further analytics on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be really nice.  Yeah.  That'd be great for us.  I mean, we're you know, this is this is huge.  I'm not I'm I'm excited.  I'm excited to be able to build that functionality and because honestly, you know, the archiving bit and the capture bit of think up like that's that was part of my original motivation.  But I'm ready to we're ready to move it to the next level and and see what interesting things you can do with your data.  That's what we're working on right now.  So it's for me.  I'm thrilled that we'll be able to get people's whole archives so we can do more interesting things.  The data rather than just get a CSV file out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have for a long time also been running a plug in on my blog that just makes a blog weekly blog post of my tweets of the week.  It's pretty primitive, but at least I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a fine way to do it.  Then you have it in WordPress search or your CMS search.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then also, it's fun.  And I have this is something I've had a long time on my blog on this date in past years.  So I you know if there's a you know I can go back to my my tweets from 2008.  Yeah, that's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On this day in 2008, I was having a carnia super burrito.  I just finished Neil Stephenson's anathema.  I was get this.  I was talking about Twitter on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very funny.  Yeah, I mean, but I think that for me, I mean, no one else could care anything about this particular thing.  But for me, it's nice to be able to look back into.  There's that. Have you ever done time?  What is it?  Abe's time hop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's time hop.  Timehop.com.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do that too?  I thought it was just a salop cystic narcissistic me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I loved it.  It's like, oh, yeah, that's when I got married.  That's when I went to China.  I mean, sometimes it's like that's when I ate a burrito.  In fact, most days.  It is that stuff.  But still really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they'll make an option now where you can load your old texts into it.  Like it's a manual thing.  You have to hook it up through iTunes or whatever.  You can load your year ago texts into time hop and it'll email them to you every morning.  And I haven't done it because I'm afraid that all the anxieties of like trying to find someone at a supermarket will come back to me a year from now.  Right.  Like, where are you?  I'm in this aisle.  I don't see you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it does sound pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'm going to find out about that.  Let me see.  Go to settings.  So this could be an early tool time hop dot com.  What were you doing one year ago today?  You hook it up to your Facebook, your Twitter, your Instagram, which is nice if you've been taking pictures there for square.  And and then it sends you an email every day with what you were doing on that day.  So July 20 or July 22nd, 2011, I was these are mostly four square check ins right now.  But this was fun.  Like, here's a check into this restaurant.  I remember we took every team out because we were about to open and we took everybody out to an Italian restaurant.  So it's kind of it does.  It kind of jogs your memory what you've been doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  The Brickhouse is a year.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a picture of it all dark.  Says lights up in six hours.  Yeah.  So that's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can remember with pleasure the stress that that was and how calm you are now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I can't do I'm going to remember psycho psychotic effects I used to have.  Yeah.  That's the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did I say that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm nervous about I don't know what I don't want to get my sex from years ago.  That would not be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, speaking of psychosis and Twitter, did you see the story here that there's going to be a study out under Twitter?  The last one in there that is going to analyze three million tweets to try to predict and then they gave psychological tests to the tweeters involved.  They're going to try to predict psychosis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think if somebody is really crazy that the first thing they're doing is getting on Twitter.  You know, in some times it seems like that.  Really?  They're crazy people on Twitter or on Facebook.  I know there are crazy people on Twitter.  But I'm just if you're in the throes of psychosis.  Yeah, I know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The psychosis is a bit of a joke, but it but it could from your tweets.  Can it can it predict things about your psychology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is interesting.  So they're going to share this information on Defcon on July 29th on Sunday.  So we'll find out what they found should be interesting.  Since the beginning of the year, we've been investigating what someone's Twitter activity might reveal about their personality.  Oh, so they're they're the headline is not exactly what they're up to.  Yeah.  After tweets from celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Tony Hawk, we had over three thousand people take part in our study.  This is basically what think and cups doing, though.  I mean, you're they only have two thousand nine hundred twenty seven tweeters.  Three million tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference is they gave them psychological tests.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, think of is not really trying to suss out your psychology, but we're we're we're working towards sort of business.  Yeah, this is opportunity.  It is an analysis of your activity.  But in the purpose is to kind of help you be a better participant on the network and give you hints about what works and what doesn't and that kind of thing and about relationships that you have.  You may not have known of.  I do think that one's tweets do say a lot about that person, though.  So I'm interested to hear what they find out.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I thought I was being sneaky and coy.  This is a Kaggle dot com Florida Atlantic University and a handful of curious data science.  Well, we'll find out on Sunday.  They're going to be looking at psychopathy, narcissism.  And I did.  I'd never heard this term in psychology for Machiavellianism.  I don't think that's a scientific term.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something to look forward to on Sunday.  YouTube and Creative Commons in bed with one another.  I think this is a great thing.

Transcript:  Oh, you fixed it.  Well, I don't know. Did I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd you do that?  What's going on?  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazing, amazing, amazing.  So Facebook's first earning call.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has it has it been three months already?  We're going to find out.  Is it today?  The first earnings call for Facebook tomorrow.  What what to look for.  Stocks gone up and down.  Hasn't gotten past its original thirty eight dollars per share.  I think we'll be watching ad revenue, right?  I think we'll see how they're doing there.  Yep.  Some concern that ad revenue had been bad this year, last year and perhaps even going farther back than going down every year.  And of course, will Zuck appear?  Someone who is not appearing lately.  In fact, he did not appear on the recent earnings call for Google is Larry Page.  He has no voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And after what Steve Jobs went through and all the speculation, all the concern and all the news coverage of it, I'm surprised there hasn't been more about Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been it's been very quiet, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been six since I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, before I.O.  He lost his voice before I.O.  And they've acknowledged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, does it have anything to do with the nature of the two illnesses, Jeff, that people thought that Steve's was life threatening, whereas they just thought that maybe Larry's just having a, you know, extended voice thing, but he lives in email land.  So it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but isn't I mean, I won't forget now, was it Larry or Sergey who's doing the genetic research on hereditary illness?  Sergey, isn't it?  It's Sergey. OK, I think it is.  Yeah, right.  With Parkinson's and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's just it's it's mysterious.  And and the argument with jobs was also that there was a need for transparency.  So we don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't.  Yeah, I mean, it could be.  I mean, you could be very, very serious.  It just depends why he lost his voice or whether he's going to get it back.  It's got to be a problem if you can't being a CEO, if you cannot speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, the ADA does not apply to the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I and I just think that after the jobs thing that people are very with stock.  Look, it's a public company.  It's it's absolutely germane to the value of the company and whether you might want to invest in it if the CEO is ill or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Dr. Mom says in the chat room that she's very concerned about this prolonged absence.  There are no causes of laryngitis to take this long to recover from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It sounds like something much more serious than laryngitis.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe I mean, I'm concerned, too.  I mean, just it's not just about the greed of the stock.  It's it's concerning.  I have a lot of respect for him.  And I know bad timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, he really was on a roll.  Things were really going.  And now, according to was it Nikesh or Aurora, he's still running the company.  Larry Page is still running the company.  Yeah.  So, you know, it is true in this email era.  You don't have to speak.  Well, since the Google Plants as a management tool, Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer Google Nikesh Aurora said during the analyst call, Larry has lost his voice but continues to run the company.  It does. You know what?  If the Steve Jobs thing hadn't happened, it probably would not be a story.  But because of that, I think there's well, that's a little odd.  Facebook's Zuckerberg wins privacy patent.  In great irony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone has to chuckle about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a patent application from 2006 governing privacy settings.  Patent number 8,225,376.  A system and method for dynamically creating a privacy summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Patents are not a measure of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Well, and I've been told time and time again, you can't read the abstract and have any idea what the patent's really for.  So I won't read anymore.  EU antitrust case.  Google wants to settle it.  Google bought Sparrow.  I'm pissed off.  Did you?  Does anybody use a Mac?  Anybody use Sparrow?  I never use Sparrow.  Love Sparrow.  I use a Mac.  I wasn't in Sparrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so addicted to Priority Inbox.  Do you use Priority Inbox on Sparrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's nice about Sparrow, yeah, it's kind of a Gmail, but it's a desktop and iPhone interface.  And iPhone interface to Gmail.  It's better than Gmail, which is why Google bought it.  Because they want to, I'm sure, incorporate those features into Gmail.  All right, we're going to let's see.  Yeah, I think we could take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more interesting one, if I may.  Go ahead.  Gordon Krovitz at the Wall Street Journal in his last column, and Gordon's a very nice guy, by the way.  I know him.  Wrote a column that should have gotten some editing, man, arguing that the government had nothing to do with the creation of the Internet.  And there are three or four great corrections out right now.  One in the LA Times and some others.  And then Vince Snurf moments ago was interviewed at CNET and came out and said, this is a bunch of hooey.  Guess what?  He should know.  He was there.  He said, quote, Finter said, I would happily fertilize tomatoes with Krovitz's assertion.  Krovitz basically said that the invention of Ethernet was the invention of the Internet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's completely wrong.  Bob Metcalf.  Yes.  Yeah.  OK.  So all you got to do if you want to debunk this is read Katie Hafner's incredible book, Where Wizards Stay Up Late, that talks about DARPA and James Licklider, who was a federal government employee who said, we want these two computers to talk together, went to BBN, which was a private business, and said, figure this out.  But it was funded by the government.  It was primarily used by the government and the NSF.  And anybody who's less than 12 years old may remember when the NSF finally said, and I think it was 94, that you could have commercial traffic on the Internet and everything changed.  It's crazy to say that it wasn't.  I don't know where this that's talked about revisionist history.  You can revise history, but not something that happened in our lifetime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's arguing against big government.  I think the big government is not, and not Obama.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the guy who's doing the ads for Mitt Romney, the self-made guy who they just really recently realized that he in fact took a million dollars in government loans to self-made businessman.  Yeah.  Joe Plummer moments.  Yeah.  Twitter.  I got one more Twitter.  Twitter is because the Olympics.  Yeah, this is cool.  We're excited.  We're going to watch the opening ceremonies on Friday, right?  I'll be watching nonstop TV with my cell phone and my Nexus seven in hand case I get more with sweat.  Glee with sweat.  They're going to light up the London Eye.  Twitter.  This video is no longer available because the YouTube account has been terminated due to multiple third party notifications of copyright infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems to be having a lot lately.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sheets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the sentiment as in it's just going to be a different color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be a giant mood ring.  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  So Kara Swisher tweeted that during the week and she said, what other monuments could you imagine for this?  And so I imagine waking up every day to see the Empire State Building and saying, oh, New York's in a bad mood today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I should we should explain that London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel that dominates the skyline of London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I really like to see is Big Ben tweet like have like, you know, like have the LED.  Dong, dong, dong, dong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So I don't know exactly.  I mean, what is the what is the mood going to be angry?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but but but Twitter does have moods.  That's that's the I've talked about the story on the show before, where the the University of Indiana scientists who found that they could predict the daily ups and downs of the Dow Jones with more than 90 percent accuracy through six moods in their opposites on Twitter.  And and Jonathan Harris, magnificent, magnificent artist and programmer and developer in something called We Feel Fine, which was with blog mentions before Twitter was there.  And he tracked moods on on on blogs and statements.  I feel good.  I feel bad through times of the year, times of day, age, geography, all kinds of things.  So, yeah, there actually is kind of an aggregate mood that moves on Twitter, which is pretty darn cool.  I joked to that that you could probably do it to the Golden State Bridge in San Francisco.  But, of course, that would always be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I talked to somebody who's a local person who's doing a LED 20,000 LED light show on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco.  It's going to be a six month temporary installation.  I don't know if it will be tied to Twitter, but it's going to be doing stuff.  So that's kind of we feel fine.  That was that the one that.  Yes, we find.  And by the way, Big Ben does have a Twitter feed.  Did you see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It bongs.  It's hilarious.  So the London Eye sentiment thing is UK based tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So every time England loses, we can watch it, you know, turn purple for sad.  Well, what did it here?  So here's the deal.  Every night, there's a 30 minute light show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just so you know, here's the code.  The eye was on the bridge.  So every night, there's a 30 minute light show.  Just so you know, here's the code.  The eye will glow yellow if England is in a good mood, purple if it's in a bad mood,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and green if it couldn't care less.  Those are not very intuitive colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, maybe it was really cheap LEDs.  Yellow for happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  We'll be back with our tool, our tip and our number of the week.  Kevin Purdy from Complete Android Guide dot com.  Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine dot com and SmarterWare dot org's Gino Topani are here.  But first, a word from Carbonite, the best way to back up.  If you had to design a backup strategy, you would be looking for something that was automatic,  so you didn't have to remember it.  It would be continuous.  So any time you make a change, it'd be backed up.  You wouldn't have to think about it.  And here's the cool part.  It would be online, off site.  So if the worst happened and everything fell apart, you'd always have a copy in the cloud.  A secure copy, by the way.  You could, in fact, use strong encryption on it and only you have the key.  It uses SSL.  This is Carbonite.  Carbonite is automatic, continuous, online backup for $59 a year per computer.  That's less than $5 a month for everything on your computer.  You've got more than one computer.  You've got external drives.  You've got plans for that.  Small businesses, they have a plan for that.  You've got to visit Carbonite dot com.  This is the way to back up.  Once you put it on your machine, you just forget it.  Mac or PC, you just forget it.  It's backing up and you always can get your data.  In fact, you can check your data.  And this is something I actually add as an additional criterion.  I don't trust a backup where I can't see what was backed up.  You can log on to your Carbonite account anytime on any computer,  even on their free smartphone and tablet apps, and there's your stuff.  And you can open it and download it just like it's cloud storage.  So I love that.  Carbonite dot com.  Steve Gibson said it does conform to his trust no one criteria for security, for safety.  I just think it's fantastic.  You don't need a credit card for the free trial.  You just need our offer code, twig.  Go to carbonite dot com.  Use the promo code twig.  And if you decide to buy 14 months for the price of 12, you get two extra months.  For 59 bucks, 14 total months.  It's just a great deal and a great peace of mind thing, especially for a laptop,  especially for a kid going off to college.  Boy, when Abby went to college two years ago, first thing I did, I got her the laptop,  and then I put Carbonite on it.  Carbonite dot com.  Use our offer code, would you?  Twig.  Oh, somebody gave me the London Eye video.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that.  Yeah, let me just see what this looks like.  The London Eye.  Thank you, London Bob, for that.  London Bob, this account has not yet been shut down.  Although our show probably will.  So that's the light show it does every night.  And if it's yellow, then London is happy.  I'm amazed that they allowed that in London, to be honest.  Doesn't it seem kind of cheesy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you're there, no, it's kind of...  It's okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They got one in Paris, too, in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've written the Eye, and it's a really neat ride.  It does seem disproportionately large.  It's huge.  From the ground, but it's a really cool thing to ride.  Weren't they talking about the one in New York, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say again?  Well, the one in New York was going to be at this white elephant mall  we have in New Jersey called Xanadu.  Good.  I was one of the bidders to take over and change that whole mall,  but we lost for political reasons.  But yes, there was a spot outside for a gigantic thing like that.  You were trying to buy a mall?  I was involved in the team that was trying to get the mall  to change the entire concept of retail.  You're just such a mover and shaker.  It's what Google do.  Somebody came to me and said,  this is exactly compatible with my idea of how to revolutionize retail  and turn it into something entirely different.  And I love disruption, so I got involved.  So we'll probably do it somewhere else.  I'll tell you about it when that day comes.  The, what do you call it, gondola over the Thames broke.  That just makes my palms sweat.  I just hate heights.  I hate things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean broke?  Did people fall, tumble into the water?  They were stuck up there.  Stuck's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would send my heart medication up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, let's start with you.  Your tool and you have many, I'm sorry, I do the tools, you do the tips.  Your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tip of the week is DuckDuckGoog.com.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DuckDuckGoog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's happy because Kevin loves DuckDuckGo.  We talked about DuckDuckGo here on the site, right?  It's kind of an alternative search engine.  It's kind of a nerdy search engine.  It's got this bang syntax.  And by bang, I mean exclamation point.  So if you go to DuckDuckGo and you search, say, exclamation point IMDB,  put in a search term, it'll automatically redirect your search directly to IMDB.  And that works for dictionaries and Wikipedia and Flickr and Lifehacker.  And their user submitted shortcuts.  DuckDuckGoog mashes up the two.  So you can bang search through DuckDuckGoog.  And if you don't bang search, then it just shows you regular Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is this from DuckDuckGoog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So DuckDuckGoog is basically an interface that mixes,  it either goes to Google search results or DuckDuckGo results, depending on how you search.  Whether you bang it.  Yeah, you get all the cool search shortcuts, the bang shortcuts of DDG or DuckDuckGo,  but also the regular Google search results, depending on how you search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But is it the same company or is it just some guy who wrote an interface?  I think it's just some guy.  I think it's just some guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a link on the front page to add it to your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you've sort of taught yourself those bang searches,  which I have because I've been using DuckDuckGo pretty religiously,  it's nice because you can bang search anything, but then also just get Google search results.  It's a little nerdy, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So bang the duck.  Slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're in trouble.  We might have a show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Searches Google and bangs DuckDuckGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bang the duck slowly.  Kevin, I could give you a chance if you have a tip you'd like to share, maybe an Android tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. Leo, do you have a Galaxy Nexus or your Nexus 7 handy?  I do.  All right.  So normally you would turn it off by holding down the power button.  Yes, that's what I do.  So you unlock it.  Yes.  And then you'll see the options to turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, if you keep holding it down, you get additional options, right.  Wait a minute.  Well, yeah.  Let's do that again.  So you're saying if I hold it, now I can airplane mode or silent mode.  You mean that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But instead of tapping power off, hold down on power off.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm getting.  I'm getting this special menu, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah.  You hold down on power off.  You hold your finger down on power off.  I'm still holding it.  Like tap and hold.  No, I mean the screen, not the power button.  Oh, this. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, reboot to safe mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. So safe mode in Android 4.1.  So all 12 of us can use this.  So you can reboot into safe mode.  And that is, I'm almost ashamed to say it's kind of like Windows safe mode.  Is it simple?  Simple.  Mac, Mac, Windows slash Android, iOS comparisons aside, safe mode literally just reboots your phone with only the core services running.  So instead of so if you think something's slowing down your phone or you want to like, you know, kind of get rid of the app that you feel is taking over your Android, which hopefully should happen less for the newer versions.  But anyways, you can reboot your phone in safe mode and it literally just, you know, calling texting and the core Google services.  And it's a really great way to just like see what your phone could run like without any third party apps going.  So, you know, a little bit of self-shutton Freud, but also, you know, troubleshoot stuff that you think is going wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be good thing to see how your battery life is running a day without anything installed on it or whatever, you know, or as you run your battery.  I think it'd be a good way to conserve.  Yeah, maybe conserve.  Yeah. So so I just did that.  Now I'm in safe mode.  It says safe mode in the lower left of the screen.  So I know and the Evernote widget is stopped.  That's right.  Because I but now the apps aren't gone.  I could still run third party apps, but the widgets are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and in the background, there's nothing running that there's nothing running a core phone in your case tablet phone.  Got it.  So the next time you reboot, it goes back to normal.  But cool.  That's very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when I hold the on off button, press and hold power off and you'll get the option for the safe mode.  Yep.  To save money.  Cool.  And that's Nexus only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's four point one only four point one only.  OK.  Whenever phones get four point one, they'll get that option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  So I'm going to shut down and turn it back on.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I could do the fact that Zynga stock is down to three dollars, but that was in the show.  Wow.  So instead, I'll say that Facebook now has 50 million users in India alone, up from eight million in 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's but there's a billion people in India, right?  There's a ton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get there fast.  The interesting thing to me is that the vast majority of them come on through mobile.  And so the international usage is really going to push Facebook to get its mobile act together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.  Very interesting.  My tip is my tool is something I saw on Lifehacker this week.  And Jeff, you tried it and you weren't able to get it to work.  I got no, it works.  It's working now.  It's called Friday.  I think that this there's a lot of stuff that's kind of we're going to see that is kind of Google now ish.  So I don't have Google now on this phone because I don't have jelly bean on their Google now kind of collects a bunch of cards from a variety of different sources and makes a single page with some interesting information on your search page.  This is called Friday by Dextre.  It's called Forget to Remember.  And what you do is you hook it up to everything like your email, your Facebook, your Twitter and all that stuff.  And it gets information and creates these pages of all the stuff that you've done.  So now here's the deal.  I can now search it.  Now I've only just started using it.  But if I could say, oh, I remember I had a call a couple of days ago with this person or that person, I could search through the Friday database that has been created and find I can also post little notes in here.  And you see it's kind of four squarish.  I have different activities, maybe more Gawala ish TV watching music, listening, reading.  I have a great idea.  I could post that.  That will become part of the database.  I continue to share that Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare.  I think this is kind of an interesting idea.  It would be a lot more useful was integrated into the phone as opposed to a separate standalone app.  But it does run apparently all the time.  I can even warp back in time.  We were talking about time hop to a previous date that I have been using this.  And since it's gone through my database of tweets and so forth, I might be able to go pretty far back.  No results found, I guess not.  So, you know, it's going to get more useful as you use it.  And Kevin Purdy was saying, oh, this is a typical of a whole bunch of a whole category of apps where a guy writes the app to collect the data and says, don't worry, we'll figure out what to do with the data afterwards.  I just like the idea that I can go back and search that.  And that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if it makes you uncomfortable at all, I think it's one of the best.  Their policies, privacy statement is very, very good.  And also, Leo, if you click on the little three three dots in the app, you'll see an option there to just wipe user.  They make it incredibly easy.  That's right.  To just say, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can also do some filtration so I can say what shows here.  You got everything and I can see what filters I've got.  I think they've done a very interesting job Friday, a personal assistant, they say, that learns all about you and can tell you anything you need to remember.  I think we're getting very close to the idea of and it was Gordon Bell, I think, was met what he called his memo box where he had a camera around his neck all the time.  He was recording everything he did.  And and that data and it's what you said, Kevin.  And we'll just collect it because you'll find a use for it later.  Same idea in some ways as as a Gina's app, you know.  So it says Journal answers analytics self discovery Friday for Android only for right now.  Very interesting app.  Certainly worth taking a look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why is it called Friday?  Because it's forget to room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Friday.  Remember, it's your man Friday.  It's your girl Friday.  It's your assistant in a box.  I get it.  Get it.  Now I see they have other apps too that they they do.  There's one called Trails.  I guess remembers what trail you've been on.  All right.  We're out of time, but I thank you all for joining us.  Kevin Purdy is the author of the I'm going to say the complete and Greg guide at completeandroidguide.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's correct.  And working on the four point one update and if you buy even the version right now, then you'll get the update for ninety nine cents when it arrives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do appear I'm sure on all about Android on a fairly regular basis.  We have them on Twig once in a while.  And of course, he does a weekly show with Gina Tripani called in beta on the five by five network.  Oh, this is good.  Thank you. This is good. I like this.  A nice buy the book and then you can have the whole dang thing forever and ever and ever.  Jeff Jarvis teaches journalism to some very lucky people at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't hear what she's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said thank you for being patient with her technical difficulties, which of course only just became exacerbated at that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
