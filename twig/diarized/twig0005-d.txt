Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig This Week in Google.  Episode 5 for August 29, 2009, Ice Cream in the Clouds.  This show is brought to you by listeners like you and your contributions.  We couldn't do it without you.  Thanks so much.  This is Twig This Week in Google.  Well, really, it's This Week in Google, the cloud and anything else we feel like talking about.  Jeff Jarvis has the week off spending time with his family.  How dare he?  But Gina Trapani is here as always.  Gina, great to have you back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Great to be on the show.  Good afternoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Smarterware.org, founder of Lifehacker, author of Twitlytics.  That's going to be your new credit.  I try to install it and I have some questions for you.  Uh oh.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, let's talk.  You didn't mean to support it, did you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You just thought he'd write it and throw it out there.  But replacing Jeff Jarvis on the show this week, a guy who certainly knows a lot about the cloud, Doug Kay of the Conversations Network.  Hi, Doug.  Hi, I have my head in the cloud.  Doug's been doing cloud for a long time.  In fact, you have a business, don't you?  A cloud business of some kind?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  No longer.  No, no.  I did some software development using Amazon Web Services Cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have experience using EC2.  I sold it.  You sold it?  I sold that business, yeah.  What a smart man.  Yeah.  Doug's best known for being a proto-podcaster with the Conversations Network and IT Conversations,  and he's really been keeping the conversation alive for six years now, seven years, eight years.  When did you start the Conversations Network?  Yeah, 2003.  Wow.  That's great.  And we have a new person.  This is going to be, I think, the way we're going to do this show.  I love doing this, where we have Jeff and Gina and me, and then we rotate in a fourth.  And there's so many wonderful voices in the community out there.  I was very pleased.  I got a DM on Twitter over the week from Mary Hodder, who said, how do I get on that show?  Mary is very well known in the community.  It turns out, knows Jeff very well, knows Gina very well, knows Doug.  Everybody knows Mary Hodder.  From napsterization.org, an entrepreneur, an expert in user experience.  What other credit can I give you, Mary?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, I'm the founder of Dabble, which was a video search service that I started about four or five years ago.  And then I'm starting a new company, actually.  It's called Wellness Mobile.  So what we're doing is building mobile applications to help people monitor their own health.  And this started because I was working at a mobile company for the last year, building products for them.  And in the meantime, I got an Android when they first came out last October.  And one of the effects of having a startup, especially one that you work incredibly hard in and never take any breaks,  is that you gain a little bit of weight, which I did.  And I was sort of horrified because I've never been overweight like this.  And what am I going to do, right?  Of course, I turned to my mobile phone and I start downloading apps.  And I realized how horrifying they all are.  They're just punitive and awful.  And I thought, I can fix this.  So we're building something that's really fun and really motivating and totally different than what anybody else has got out there.  So I'm actually having a blast doing it.  Mobile stuff is actually great.  It's really fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you are also your developer as much as you are an entrepreneur.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, I'm not a coder.  You don't code?  No, I have coded and it's scary.  I'm a usability engineer and I write search algorithms and I do data stuff, XML and that kind of thing.  But I don't consider myself a coder.  I think that's like a whole other level of technical understanding and ability that I have not mastered.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And as you know, the worst thing about coding is you have to support your users.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, that is true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look at that look from Gina.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not a coder either.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just kind of play one on Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't claim being a coder.  Doug, you're a coder.  You're a coder, Doug, right?  You code?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  About 60 or 70 hours a week.  Yeah.  That's a coder.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well, I took 20 years off to run a company and I spent the last 10 bagging coding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it kind of nice to be back doing that?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Oh, it's great.  I love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, you know, the Google, it's funny, the Google took a little time off this week, not a huge bunch of new stuff after a flood of new stuff over the last six months.  But Apple filled in the gap with this snow leopard thing.  It's a very pretty cover.  Sleppard.  Sleppard.  I call it snow job.  I like that.  I think this, I would say, Gina, you had the same experience I did.  In fact, I started to talk to people, despite the good reviews, and they got a lot of good reviews in all the big, you know, magazines and newspapers and everybody said, oh, great news.  My experience of it was, okay, I just installed leopard.  Yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A better leopard.  A leopard.  What leopard should have been?  A little better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not better like Windows 7 is better than Vista.  A little better.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Cheaper for those who didn't upgrade from the other.  Yeah, 30 bucks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's good.  And by the way, even though Apple says you have to upgrade from leopard or buy a full package, this works just fine.  Even on an empty hard drive, it doesn't ask you for a serial number or anything.  No, it doesn't.  So yeah, this could be the upgrade from anything as long as you have an Intel Mac.  Yeah.  I think it's significant because they abandoned PowerPC, finally.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well, my family pack is sitting here on the desk and I've still got a couple of rumored incompatibilities.  That's why I'm holding on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I'm thinking is nobody should rush to this because of the incompatibilities.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  So what did, maybe Gina knows the answer to this.  What did they change that would cause these incompatibilities?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think the official word was that the software that doesn't work with Snow Leopard, the developers had used, you know, methods that they shouldn't have or had, you know,  integrated with the operating system in ways that they shouldn't have.  And the incompatibility list isn't too bad.  It's mostly old stuff.  I don't think there's anything really major that's, you know, like that's a new version.  I've been running this Snow Leopard dev preview for months and months and didn't run into any problems, though I should qualify that by saying, you know, I'm not a designer and I'm not, you know, I don't edit video and that kind of thing.  So maybe I'm not a good example.  But I don't think the incompatibilities were too much of an issue.  Have any of you, Leo, have you run into any trouble?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, a little few menu, like they have a menu calendar that stopped doing what it was supposed to do.  And probably you're exactly right because they used some call that was either deprecated or never even revealed.  Exactly.  And Apple's always having to do that, telling people don't use these, you know, we have an API for a reason.  Right.  But a lot of people, you know, haxies and that kind of thing, they're trying to get around the little kinks in the operating system.  So they use on I have two family packs, Doug.  I bought because I have enough Macs.  I thought, well, you know, and I mean, look for a missed you two family facts, one for here and one for the other family.  But I have to say, for under 100 bucks, I've upgraded 10 Macs.  So it's not expensive.  Gina, you were saying it's just exactly the right price.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is just exactly the right price.  And I wrote a post on my blog basically saying, you know, I think Snow Leopard is a service pack, which is exactly what I've been saying that like haters were going to say that that was an uninformed wisecrack.  And I'm sorry to come off ungrateful.  I'm generally not this like entitled and self-righteous.  But the you know, the reviews, which were very good and I agree with because I've been running it and it's better.  It's smaller. It's faster.  And those things are all great.  The reviews were just a little more gushy than I think that it really deserved.  I mean, you know, $30 isn't such a good deal.  It's exactly the right price.  I was I said in my post, if they had charged for more than $30, it would have been robbery.  And right now I just kind of feel like a little nickel and dime.  But, you know, it was worth it.  It was very worth it.  But, you know, really, to the end user, to people who don't understand how operating systems work, which is 99% of the population, this isn't that big a deal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, no, in fact, if you put two computers side by side, Leopard, Snow Leopard, there they there's no difference.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. You know, the things that I love about Snow Leopard, I mean, for example, if a file is in use and you try to eject the disk that the file's on, now Snow Leopard tells you what processes locking the file.  That's really that's great.  But like, is that something I'm going to be like really excited about?  I mean, isn't that something an operating system should do?  I mean, Windows doesn't.  I'm not sure actually if Seven does or Vista does.  But like, you know, really, like, am I going to get like excited about that?  Like, thanks for doing the thing that I should have done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thanks for letting me eject disks more.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Thanks for letting me eject the disk I want to eject and give me information about why you're not letting me do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  Now, the reason we bring this up in a cloud show is this is the opposite.  This is this is the old school.  This is an operating system that comes on a disk and then you install and you upgrade.  This I think we're rapidly coming to the time when we're you're just this is not going to happen.  You're just not going to get a CD with a full blown operating system on it.  I look at the pain that people are going through with clean installs.  There is no upgrade on this.  You have to do a archive and install.  And where is my plug in?  Where is this?  Where is that?  This seems so antiquated.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it seemed crazy that I went to a store and bought a DVD and came home.  This is crazy.  I did the wipe and install thing, which, you know, most people just did the upgrade, but it was kind of crazy.  I was like, why aren't I downloading this again?  Why wasn't this a patch?  I mean, I don't know.  People said that it was such a big rewrite of the underlying code that pushing it through software update was a little too unreasonable an expectation.  And then and fine, like I'll give them that.  But the whole go to the store, purchase the DVD thing or have it shipped to me in a truck, you know, using gas just seemed insane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, maybe I mean, maybe we the whole idea of an operating system in general is kind of that, you know, this kind of antiquated idea.  Maybe the you know, what we really need is something a thin client that just has a good browser in it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was thinking about this like in terms of in terms of cloud computing, it really brings the question is like how much does the desktop operating system really matter?  So I mean, I've been using a Mac and PC side by side for years.  I mean, ever since I started doing serious or tech blogging, I had to be conversant in both operating systems.  And and I rebuilt my Mac a few times during the process of the Snow Leopard coverage, you know, just just to do the coverage.  And basically, once I had Firefox installed and X marks, which is where I store all my bookmarks and keywords,  like I was 75 percent to a fully working computer, you know, on any computer that is like any any brand new machine.  Once I had Firefox, isn't that kind of interesting? Yeah, I'm 75 percent there.  I mean, you know, sure, I have to, you know, move my data and install.  I have a favorite text editors and I like Quicksilver and those kind of things.  But but really, it's about the browser. So it's interesting to me.  Same kind of thing when Windows 7 comes up.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  That's exactly why I I've been converted to Mac user for, let's say, the last five or six years, having come from Windows like everyone else.  But I wanted to start traveling with a netbook. So I get the netbook. It's got the browser. What else do I need?  I pretty much have everything. You know, passwords were the only thing because I use one password.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But is Chrome going to be like that? Is Chrome really just a I mean, Chrome, the OS, the Chrome, the browser?  Is Google's OS going to basically be Chrome? Well, that's the hope, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the hope. I mean, Chrome is building into the dev builds do include password.  No, not password. Bookmarks. Right. Yeah. Bookmarks sinking right now.  So, I mean, I wonder if Chrome I was thinking about with Android, you know, when you set up your Android phone, the first thing you do is sign in with your Google account.  You can't run the phone without signing in first. So I wonder if, you know, Chrome's going to do the same thing.  Just sink down all your data, you know, your bookmarks, maybe even frighteningly enough passwords.  I mean, X marks does store passwords as well. So I wouldn't be surprised if Chrome did that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then you just go from there. I love installing X marks and just I'm done.  As you say, I've got the passwords, Firefox, passwords, bookmarks.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  It's like I'm home. Yeah, exactly. When Google first when we first started talking about Google as being a serious competitor to Microsoft,  I don't think we really understood what that meant. I mean, we said, well, we saw things like Google Docs.  Does it mean they're just going to compete with Microsoft Office?  But I think with something like this, we're starting to see what the flavor of Google's ultimate competition to Microsoft or their challenge to Microsoft is ultimately going to actually look like.  Because they're moving in that direction, but we don't really talk about it in those terms. It's not going to be a head on challenge.  I mean, they're going to they're going to change the game. Yeah. Rather than the knocking the knocking Microsoft can Microsoft.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Certainly saying, OK, oh, we get it. Can they compete?  Is Azure and the new Microsoft Office that's in the cloud? Can Microsoft put together something that's competitive with whatever this new thing is?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  I mean, they've never done it before. I mean, they've all everything they've done in that vein has always come after the fact.  I mean, they've always, you know, come in later than their competition and sort of, you know, push their way into the marketplace.  So they're certainly not going to be the leaders of this. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mary, we have we have been talking around you. Do you have anything you want to throw in here?  I should tell you if you're ever on a Twitch show that the normal bounds of decency are all gone.  Just interrupt the hell out of us. Really? Oh, yeah. Can I even swear? Just jump right in. Don't swear.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I'm just kidding. I just want to know why we don't swear because we have kids listening, but we can interrupt each other because kids don't do that.  Right. Now, I actually have been paying attention to the Chrome thing, but I haven't really made up my mind about what I think about it.  You know, the Chrome OS issue, right? I think it's a really interesting thing.  I think Android actually, and at least for me right now, has had a much bigger impact on the marketplace than than the Chrome OS idea.  I mean, the interesting thing about Google is when they make an announcement, they can ice a market and they can change a market.  I mean, they're like Microsoft. Used to be. Microsoft could do that. That's right.  Microsoft could do it 10 years ago and now Google does it. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so now it's pre-announcing Chrome like that really did get a lot of attention, even though it's a year off. It's huge. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  In this case, I think they actually will build it. I know instances where they've announced things and then never done anything.  Certainly for us in Dabble, you know, in January of six, they announced that they were going to build video search and it took everyone two years to realize they were never going to build video search.  They can't. And so it, you know, I always take what they announce sort of with a big grain of salt.  But at the same time, I am really interested in whatever, you know, what what sort of impacts that's going to have.  I think that the Android thing, I'm actually looking down at my my G2.  Oh, you're a G2 user. Yes. Oh my God. I love this phone.  So I promptly got rid of my my two G1s and started using this. And I think Android is amazing.  And we've already written a couple of like four programs for it. And it's just it's great.  I mean, it's missing some stuff that is really necessary. But, you know, so what? It's going to be built in.  It'll be added. You know, it's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mary, are you are you developing for that platform because it's it's better, it's easier or because it's open?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Both, actually. I think it's I do think that it's better.  But I also think that someone just wrote on the IRC that Android needs better hardware designs.  So there's 18 phones coming by the end of the year. Wow. And and yeah, I mean, really like we're we're not even one year into Android.  And they've already sold I think the June figure was 12 million phones.  I mean, that was that was eight months after it came. The G1 came out.  I mean, it's it's going faster than the iPhone because the iPhone paved the way for a big marketplace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty good for what is essentially a crappy handset. I mean, that's pretty good.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, the G1 was but the G2 rocks. I mean, it's it's really great.  But but I also love the fact that when we make a version of, you know, some app that we can throw it up and people start downloading it.  And, you know, I mean, Ed made so Ed is coding Wellness Mobile and he he did a thing called RPN Calc.  So he made an RPN calculator and he made several versions of it.  He did like a science version and a regular old RPN Calc.  And then he did a financial calculator and he's selling the financial one.  But the other ones, you know, he just put them out and twenty thousand people downloaded them and continue to use them.  And, you know, that's great. Nobody, you know, Steve Jobs did not have to have his feet kissed by us.  I mean, we just put it out there and it's it's cool.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  And so this makes me think of something that I put on Twitter earlier in the week that got a lot of reaction, which is amazing since nobody listens to me on Twitter.  I put up something where I just said mobile apps are the new content and I got a lot of flack on it.  But let me explain what I was thinking about there.  This the whole idea that sort of the impulse buy of the app, which used to be the ringtone, it's the MP3.  And, you know, when you now go to somebody with an iPhone or an Android phone, you know, you're just as likely to say, hey, you know, try this free app or try this 99 cent app as you were a few years ago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I 100 percent agree. In fact, I can back you up.  My son just had his 15th birthday last year.  He got credits towards songs this year.  He got a $15 app store credit and it kind of blew me away.  I realized it's exactly as you say, that's the new kind of mobile app.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  And it's also it's also the fact that if you're a publisher, you are now tending to wrap any content you have exactly the form of an application.  You know, look at the the public radio apps or any of the print journals or anything.  You don't deliver content to a raw phone.  You wrap it in an application, which is a somewhat somewhat of a new paradigm.  It's interesting, though.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  The there's, you know, there's a sort of a continuum where you can you can put content out on the Web.  You can do m dot Twitter dot com and people can go to that that, you know, page through the browser in their phone.  And you don't really need to wrap it in anything in order to get it out to people.  And then there's, you know, going to the opposite end where the entire application sits on its own.  It doesn't access any data at all from the outside world.  And then there's all the stuff in between.  And, you know, I actually think that in the future we will build apps where it's really just wrapping around Web pages so that you can grab whatever you need.  But right now, things are so slow and it's so inconsistent in terms of pushing that content out into the little wrapper that you might have on the phone application that it really is just a much nicer user experience to have most of the stuff in the application.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very retro, though, because after all, isn't that a lot of the progress that the Web brought us was that before the Web, everything was an app.  And the Web said, here's one app to rule them all.  And here's RSS.  And now you could do everything in one app.  And we're now completely reversing it.  And I have to admit, as a content creator, you know, yeah, I would actually really like the idea of having one app on a mobile device.  That's me.  Press that button.  You get all our shows.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well, not just that, Leo, but it's not, you know, you don't want just a Web based thing that comes into the phone as a bookmark.  What you want is you want to use a 20th century term.  You want the real estate.  You want an icon on that phone that's going to be there forever.  That's the big thing.  That's what we're doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But is that good for users?  I mean, it's good for content creators.  Is that what users want?  You can store hundreds of apps on your phone.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  You might as well.  They're more convenient than putting a bookmark in a mobile browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one thing I didn't like about the G phone, the Google phone, was I only had, have they increased this?  But I only had three pages of apps.  Oh, I've got you.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I've got way more than three pages.  Because with the iPhone, I have 12 now and even that they're almost all full.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  I buy apps like candy.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  But speaking of mobile apps.  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, go ahead, Mary.  Can you say I don't know how many do you want me to show you this?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So here's the G2.  Here it is.  Yeah.  And actually what you're seeing right now is St. Louis, Missouri, from a webcam where, so I have this.  So the desktop's live.  Yeah, the desktop's live.  And basically every 30 minutes, the application, it's called World Apps, goes out and grabs a screenshot from some webcam somewhere.  So it totally makes you want to travel because it's like Paris and Rome and St. Louis and Tokyo and a gorgeous lake somewhere in Oregon, whatever.  And basically, so it's constantly changing the background.  So that's my favorite app actually.  That's really cool.  I totally recommend it.  It used to be called Latour Eiffel because they just had the Eiffel Tower webcam.  So this is the, I'm going to try to do it.  This is, whoops, oh, it went away.  It's really hard to do this pointing it at the camera.  Upside down and backwards.  Upside down and backwards, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like Ginger Rogers.  No, she wasn't upside down.  She was just in heels.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So let's see if I can get this thing.  And plus, putting it at the right distance in the camera.  It's like really, anyway.  So normally you slide it left to right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're sliding up.  Oh.  Yeah.  So see if I have all these different apps in there.  Oh my goodness.  Now is that something you added as a third party application or?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, that's just the built in menu.  Yeah.  That's just the built in menu.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  It's not desktop screens.  You pulled up the menu.  I got it.  Okay.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  So I mean, I could do it sideways if I did it this way, but I mean, the point is, is  that, you know, it's, in other words, I keep downloading apps and I have no indication  that I'm ever going to hit a limit.  I think it's just the amount of memory in the phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's the amount of memory.  Like I downloaded Listen, which Leo talked about last week, and I downloaded a couple  podcasts and immediately ran out of space because it was, you know, because it was downloading  MP3s and I had filled it up with music already, but that's a limitation of the handset.  That's definitely, that's not Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How, if we get, have you, obviously Mary, you've seen some of these, you probably can't  talk about all of them.  Motorola is going to have new handsets.  Yeah.  Who else, what do you like?  Is there one that we should look for?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So Motorola and Samsung are the main ones that I know of that are developing Android  based apps for the fall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about Android on larger platforms, non-phone platforms?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I think it's a really interesting idea, but I don't know anybody who's doing it yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought it was odd that Google would announce Chrome OS when it really has an OS.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I did too.  You know, here's the deal with this, like the mobile world, at least the way that I  see it.  So, you know, so Ed, who's coding for this for me is a Linux kernel engineer, which is  very old school, right?  That used to be like the top of the heap of the geek pyramid, right?  And the geek food, food pyramid that was like right at the very top.  You know, and, and really that kind of coding for a long time, I think with the web has  sort of fallen out of fashion.  It's like very mundane and boring and whatever.  But with mobile stuff, it comes very much back into vogue because even if you're not  actually coding Linux, he happens to be a Linux kernel engineer, was at Google now,  he's at Palm.  He, that kind of coding is very in sync with what you need to do on a mobile phone.  So just general app development, you know, there's a lot of, a lot of similarity.  The, the other thing that's interesting for me about this OS is that it really is a mini  version of, of what you have in terms of running Linux on a server or whatever.  It's just missing certain pieces.  It's very, yeah, but it's Linux.  I mean, it's easy to plug those things in or build little pieces or little sort of mini  parts.  Mini parts that need to be stuck in.  Right.  Modules.  Modules, whatever it is.  Yeah.  But it's, it's a really interesting, I think it's a really interesting platform.  And I think it's super cool that it's open and the fact that, you know, they have a few  rules and you just follow the rules and you put your app up and that's it.  And you know, that for me is just huge over iPhone.  I think in the long run, it's going to be much more successful than an iPhone kind of  style thing where it's very closed and controlled.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, as it happens, Phil Jackson agrees with you.  Whoopi Goldberg.  Did you see the new T-Mobile ad?  Well, if you want to sing out, sing out.

Transcript:  And if you want to be, yeah, good commercial.  There's Whoopi.  And Kat Stevens, I might add.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's Phil Jackson.  Who's that?  I don't know who that is.  Jessie, somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-Mobile presents the first phone that becomes 100% you.  The new My Touch 3G with Google.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Only from T-Mobile.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that the first, that's the first I've seen G1 or a Google phone ad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting one.  Makes me want one.  It's so warm.  It's an interesting marketing tactic like that.  This, you know, the first phone that can really be you.  Like that app that Mary just showed where the background changes.  She's waving her phone.  Mary's waving her phone in front of the camera, which I love.  That's not something that you could do on an iPhone that's not jailbroken.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Good point.  You can customize the phone in ways that you can't, you know, with the iPhone.  And this is the thing, this is what Google has to sell Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was subtle.  That was a little subtle, but that was a zing, wasn't it?  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  John Grubber wrote that great piece, which burned me to death because I wished that I'd  written it, the Android opportunity, which I actually, I should have bookmarked it.  But he wrote this great post and he's totally, you know, he's the Apple guy.  He wrote this great post about the way that Google needs to market Android.  And one of the things that he said is, you know, marketing 101, they have to emphasize  the things that you can do with the Android phone and you can't with the iPhone.  And one of those things is just like setting your freaking wallpaper to what you want it  to be or, you know, webcams from around the world.  I mean, how cool is that?  And that's really what that commercial is showing.  I couldn't tell what app they're using, but like when Whoopi brings up that cartoon image  of herself and someone else, I mean, that looks like a wallpaper to me.  So, God, I just, I hope they can do it.  I hope they can get a decent handset out there and I hope they can emphasize, you know, the  things that you can do with Android that the iPhone can't do.  And what Grubber said that I really liked too is that that kind of marketing tag will get  the power users and the savvy folks.  And that's fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That gets the iPhone users going, yeah.  Wow.  That would get you, you know, like that would get us.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And that doesn't have to be the entire iPhone market, but you just have to kind of win the  hearts of the leaders in tech.  And right now, you know, it's, you know, we have like Mary and me, but, you know, there  are a lot of people who tried out Android and said this sucks.  I did.  I did.  Oh, and it was battery life.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was memory.  It was those things that you already talked about, but that was the G1, which wasn't a  great piece of hardware.  The G1 sucked.  It was terrible.  The form factor was awful.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, but the improvements in the OS and the improvements in this phone, the form factor  here.  Oh my God.  I love this phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have you played with the tour yet?  Cause that ad was for the tour.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  That's the newest one.  Well, this one was, this phone was given to us at the Google I.O. conference.  That's the G2 one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you see it on the back?  Yeah.  Oh, look, it says Google I.O.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Everything.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's cool.  And you got, that means you got a wave invite too.  Yes.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I do have a wave invite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The best, the best swag of the year.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  We played with wave a little bit and to be totally honest, I wasn't that excited.  I didn't care.  What can I say?  You know, here's the deal.  We started playing with the, the, um, Google app engine because we made this April Fool's  app.  Um, it was called personal hype quotient and it's at personalhypequotient.com.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I gotta try my personal hype quotient.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So, and frankly, we haven't updated it.  So if you go to our quote unquote advisors page, which is completely bogus, um, you'll  see a list of people, but some of the icons don't resolve and it's because they've changed  them on Twitter and we pulled them from Twitter.  But basically we hacked this together in like two days and what it does is you stick in  your Twitter credentials, you, you say, yes, give me my personal hype quotient.  And then you get rated and it's from zero to 10.  Um, and basically we did it as a joke, you know, cause people are hypey on Twitter and,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  um, I can only imagine what mine's going to be.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well put it in and check it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm proud to say you're using OAuth.  So I didn't have to use OAuth.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  We were one of the very first apps to use OAuth because it was literally right at April  1st when they made that switch.  So we bumped into every horror in the plan, you know, in the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On a scale of zero to 10.  Yes.  I am level seven founder promoter, which either means I've got VC dollars riding on my own  hype or I'm running a conference or both.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm running mine right now.  It's redirecting me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is not, this is actually not a made up number.  This you do have an algorithm.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's not, we actually have a little algorithm.  So basically we took the algorithm, it explained, we explain it down in our FAQ about how we,  how we did that.  Um, basically we took the number of, we took your last whatever number of tweets, we figured  out how many times you link to yourself and we used, we used five APIs.  We use the Google open social API to figure out what, what URLs you were associated with,  even if they didn't have your name in them or anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Um, well wait a minute now.  I didn't link to myself.  It says you self linked in zero.  You retweeted in 20 of the last 540 tweets, but I hyped in 13.  What's hype mean?  How do you measure?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Hyping means that you use any of certain words.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exclamation marks.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  No, no, it actually, we could use exclamation marks, but no, it's, it's more about, do you  say, you know, I'm doing this and, and, uh, or yeah, if you exactly do something where  cool, then we would take the I'm cool statement and, or for example, if you retweet and you  retweet somebody else who's then promoting you and you leave your name in there, your  Twitter handle.  Yeah, that's bad.  Yeah, that's kind of bad Twitter etiquette.  Then we give you a high point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I get high points because I have so many followers.  I don't think I did.  I didn't do many.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a, it's partly based on your number of followers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mostly what it is.  Cause look, I only had 13 out of 540, 20 retweets, zero self links.  I think I'm pretty cool, man.  Did you get a lot?  You got a five?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did.  It's on level five.  My website needs hits.  Okay.  So get on board the me train.  I love the copy.  The copy alone is awesome.  It's really good.  Mary, I love it.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  I'm still waiting for it to come back from OAuth.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  That's the Twitter OAuth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm sure everybody and their brother who's watching is doing this right now.  That's why we broke.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Probably broke Twitter now.  We, yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Not so hard to do.  Or the APIs.  Yeah.  Well, so basically we, that was my first experience playing with the Twitter, you know, APIs,  the Google open social, the OAuth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How is open social to work with?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's actually very easy.  I really, really liked it.  I'm hopeful for open social.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really am.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It actually has this really cool thing where it figures out who are you socially related  to and then it says, okay, here, these are your relationships.  And then what you can do is in our instance, because we were trying to figure out, are  you, are you tweeting about yourself?  Like Guy Kawasaki constantly links to himself.  Oh really?  Well, he links to Altop.  He doesn't even do it himself.  I know he's got other people doing it.  But his account, his account links to Altop and Altop is associated with him.  So he gets a really big score.  He's just under the Armageddon of personal hype.  I think he's, I hype myself, therefore I am.  But guess who is the only person who was the Armageddon of personal hype?  It was Gary Fee.  No.  Gary Fee.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bring the thunder.  I got mine back.  What's yours?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  I'm a whopping level three.  Yeah.  You're the least typey.  I don't follow anybody.  Yeah.  Well, it's not who you follow.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's who follows, how many followers do you have?  And then how many times do you talk about people following you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see.  Oh, that's a bad, that's bad.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  See, that's like another socially uncool thing to do.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  But I'm stintedly unaware of my social climbing and hyping possibilities.  I'm not.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Maria, you're using the URL that the person like puts in their profile as their self-link?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yes.  We look at that, but also we take their Twitter name and that URL and we plug that into Google's  OpenSocial API.  Oh, nice.  What is this person also involved in?  Oh, how interesting.  That's very cool.  We use another API where you can look up all the shortened URLs.  So there's 50 services that actually shorten URLs.  Most people use Bitly now because Twitter has done this thing.  In April, that wasn't totally clear.  A lot of people use TinyURL.  There were all these different things.  So we use another API to back into what are the real URLs.  Then we match them with OpenSocial.  So are you using longurl.org?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's the service I'm thinking about for Twitter.  Cool, because it covers like a hundred different shortened.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it takes a shortened URL and undoes it.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yes.  I think their API is actually great as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In order to get the full set of URLs, you had to use OpenSocial to find this.  It's not a social graph.  It's my...

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's kind of your URL graph.  My me graph.  Yeah.  Your me graph.  Yeah, it's something like that.  Anyway.  Cool, Mary.  That's cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want OpenSocial to work and to do well because I think the other competitor is Facebook.  It's really a choice of having Google do it or Facebook do it.  I think if frankly, Facebook's coming on strong on this.  I think this is really what Facebook wants to do is do OpenSocial.  They want to do social graph stuff.  They want to use their services.  It scares the heck out of me.  I took a ACLU has a quiz.  Have you done this yet on Facebook?  It's terrifying.  It's on my Facebook.  I'll send it around to all of you.  Would you take the quiz?  It's about what a quiz knows about you.  Not only does the quiz have access to all your personal information, and I guess you  could understand that.  You take a quiz and there are all these quizzes.  What beetle are you?  You take this quiz, whoever's doing the quiz and there's very little validation of these  developers, not only has your entire page, but when a friend of yours takes the quiz,  they get your page too because you're linked to them.  I don't even understand how that happens.  At the end of the quiz, look, folks, if you're on Facebook, search for this.  It's from the West Coast Division of ACLU.  Search for this ACLU quiz and put it on your page and take it.  It shows you here's what we know.  As the quiz designer, here's what we know about you.  They know everything.  Here's what we know about your friends and they know everything.  They do give you some settings at the end that you can change, but the default settings  are wide open.  It terrifies me.  Do you think Google is going to be better with that kind of information?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wonder.  The Google Maps traffic overlay, crowdsourcing that data that came out this week, they announced  this week.  If you have a phone and you're on the freeway and you're inching along, by default, you  have to opt out of it.  By default, it sends that data to them.  From your phone?  From the phone, yeah.  From a GPS enabled handset, it lets them know how fast you're going and then it aggregates  that data to show the traffic overlay, which is super cool.  We're living in the future.  This is what I thought of when I saw this.  This is amazing.  But it's opt out, which wasn't so cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had a Dash GPS, which was based on OpenMoco.  It did the same thing, but only with other members, only people who had Dash's.  Dash had, I guess, it knew where you were, but yeah, to be able to make this map of green  and red and yellow streets based on other people with G1 handsets and how fast they're  moving is hugely valuable.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is.  It's incredibly valuable.  They're saying that they're only taking the data and aggregate, that they scrub your start  and destination point so that they're not tracking where you're going.  This is what they're saying.  Okay.  Because they're privacy issues.  But it freaks me out when these things are opt out.  The Facebook stuff, too.  It freaks me out that that stuff's opt out.  You have to go into settings and change it.  The default settings are incredibly powerful.  People don't change them generally.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  That's true.  I mean, default settings, typically, 80% of the people will never even go to the pages  that change things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which just explains why MSN or Bing is still so well.  It's just automatic.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  My issue is that Facebook is set up so that their TOU, their Terms of Use, and the whole  premise of the way their features are built is to collect data on you and then go out  and match it across the web.  They actually pay outside companies to collect even more data on you and match it all up.  Google, on the other hand, is A, not paying anybody to match any data on you that I know  And I know the people at those companies and they've never done any work for Google.  So I kind of trust that that's not happening.  Google's TOU also on a lot of things, like for latitude.  They take your last location, they keep it in the system, and the next time they grab  a new location, they delete the old one.  And so there are certain things that Google has done to actually try to manage some of  your privacy issues and to be a little bit better.  I think in Google, it's not so much an issue culturally for the company or for the leaders  and the leadership in the company to make things private for you as it is that they  are not necessarily thinking about it all the time.  But if EFF or somebody comes along and says, hey, you guys, get it together on latitude,  then they get it together.  But on Facebook, Facebook's thing is, look, if you can't get a million people in a group  who all protest something, we're not even going to look at the issue.  And B, we don't care about EFF.  And C, hey, it says right in our TOU that we're grabbing everything we can on you and  matching you because this is our business model, even though we still don't know how  that's going to work.  So it's a very different approach.  And I'm far more concerned about Facebook than Google.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Did you happen to read the story about the Canadian government and Facebook?  That's actually what stimulated this.  Because I've been working with it.  Last two weeks, I've been going back and forth between implementing OpenID and implementing  OAuth, which means my head just hurts because I get them confused.  But in the process, I was talking to the folks at Jan Reign, who are sort of the gurus of  OpenID.  You have the OpenID guys.  Yeah.  I brought up this whole issue of the Canadian government, which has discovered that Facebook  is not at all good about...  They essentially grant you permission, and then you sort of have it forever.  It's very hard to retract some of the permissions that you give to Facebook.  And as a third party, it's even nastier because there's things in the terms of use that say  that we're supposed to do certain things about removing or no longer using their identity  information.  But in fact, that's not enforced technically.  It's a very poor system, the way they've got to put together there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when you take a quiz on Facebook, what can the quiz see about you?  Only your answers, only...  Oh, people are trying to chat with me.  Only your information is set as public.  Almost everything on your profile, even if you use privacy settings to limit access.  And it will show...  It shows when you take this quiz, all the stuff it knows.  It's pretty dramatic.  And of course, there's quizzes like crazy on Facebook.  So that's why I would like Google and OpenSocial to win.  Because I admit, Google could be evil too.  But Facebook clearly is not paying any attention to this at all.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well, Facebook Connect in particular certainly has flaws for third parties, which is what  I've been working on.  And that's what Eric Schoenfeld over at TechCrunch really covered this week pretty well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We gave the Palm Pre a hard time because we found out it was sending GPS data to Palm.  And now we find out that the G1 and the G2 are doing the same.  Gina, do you have to have an app installed for that to be doing that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Actually, I believe that it's all GPS enabled handsets, iPhones as well.  It's Google Maps.  What?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Google Maps is doing this?  Yeah, but wait, hold on.  It's not for every phone.  It's only phones that can collect GPS information.  So for example, my Trio, which is this other phone.  Can you see it?  It's old.  It's funky.  It's orange.  It has GPS in it.  No, it doesn't.  It's a Trio 680.  So for example, if I installed an app that could collect a GPS data, right, which is  triangulating between the cell towers, then that data could be transmitted back through,  if I have an internet connection, transmitted through the internet.  The phone companies will not allow that data to be transmitted back.  What Gina's talking about, I think, Gina, if I'm wrong, correct me, but I think what  you're saying is for phones like this one, which have both the map program comes installed,  which I, to be honest, I'll show it to you.  So right here on the phone, there's a little maps thing right here.  And if I click it, what it's going to do is not only is it going to bring up a map, but  it's actually going to pinpoint me on the map using GPS.  So it'll take a second.  I don't know if you guys can.  Yeah, I do that all the time.  You can see the map and you can see a little dot with me and here I am.  So for phones that do that and use Google Maps, then yes, your location data will be  transmitted back, especially that is especially useful to Google if you're driving because  instead of Google having to go out to either Traffic Cast, which charges, or to Caltrans  and try to piece together data, they can actually get direct user feedback about how fast you're  traveling on streets.  The question that I have for Google is, are they treating it the same way that they treat  latitude which is, hey, we have this personally identifying thing that we know about you,  your location and your phone number, right?  Because now you've transferred this information to them and they've got that.  Are they taking just what's valuable, which is the delta between the last two pings and  tossing the personal information, i.e. your phone number and the fact that you were at  that location?  Are they getting rid of that so that when the NSA or somebody comes and subpoenas their  stuff, they can say truthfully, hey, we have no idea where Mary Hodder is, we just don't  know.  And that's what I would like to see them do.  They should be doing the same thing that they do with latitude, which is use the data and  discard it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they're saying in the official announcement.  So I'm looking at the official announcement on the official Google blog and it says the  iPhone Maps application does not support traffic crowdsourcing.  Oh, OK.  But some phones such as the T-Mobile, My Touch 2 3G and the Palm Pre come with Google Maps  and traffic crowdsourcing pre-installed.  So OK.  And then they talk about privacy and they said exactly what Mary just said.  We only use anonymous speed and location information to calculate traffic conditions and only do  so when you've enabled location services, their instructions on how to opt out.  And it says when a lot of people are reporting data from the same area, we combine their  data together to make it hard to tell one phone from another.  The vehicle carrying a phone is anonymous.  We don't want anyone to find out where that anonymous vehicle came from or where it went.  So we find the start and end points of every trip and permanently delete that data.  So even Google ceases to have access to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can I trust that statement?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well I think there's not just Google.  There's nothing to keep NSA from getting into the data stream before Google makes the decision  about what to throw away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So even if Google says that, it's still going over public networks.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  We all know that NSA is capable of getting into the data through the fiber if they want  to.  Right.  So the fact is.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well or through the phone company.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean Sprint knows exactly where I am.  T-Mobile knows exactly where I am.  Through a GPS.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  With GPS they know within about 20 feet.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Right.  So if you want location privacy, you shouldn't have a cell phone.  And that's the unfortunate truth.  The NSA really isn't going to go.  I know it sounds very cynical.  They're not going to go to Google really to get your location.  They don't need to.  What they're really going to do, they don't need to.  They already have friends.  They've already got boxes reinstalled at AT&T, T-Mobile, Q West, Verizon.  They have that.  So you got to basically turn off the pings to the cell network to really have location  privacy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we might as well just suck it up, say we've got no privacy.  And gosh now I know how bad the traffic is going to be.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, see for me the traffic thing wasn't scary.  For me the thing is not so much the government because I know they've got that data.  Right?  For me the issue is, is someone who I don't really want to know my location getting access.  A stalker.  A stalker or maybe my neighbor down the street who really wants to hang out with me and I'm  not that crazy about hanging out with them or something.  And if they show up at the restaurant where I'm already having drinks with friends, it's  awkward.  You know what I mean?  So I'd rather not have the whole world have it in terms of publicly broadcasting it.  But it's, you know, I think we will spend the next few years getting comfortable with  the idea that having a cell phone means not having complete location privacy.  And then we'll figure out where those lines are about, you know, who else can have access  to that besides the government and the phone company.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know whether to be depressed or elated or enervated.  I should say.  Ah, screw it.  I'm going to go take a nap.  So really all that upset about Palm.  I mean, I was, I was very vocal about, oh man, Palm, you know, collecting this information  didn't tell us.  That's shocking.  It really was naive of me.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Everybody knows this.  It's okay to be naive.  It's cute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's cute.  Oh, isn't he cute?  He still thinks no one knows where he is.  Oh, isn't he cute?  Little naive innocent fellow.  That's so pathetic.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Oh dear.  Somebody on the IRC said people love social networks, but don't like their neighbors.  And it's like, yeah, you know, we don't always like everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey.  I just watched, I think you probably, many of you have seen this.  I just saw, I got a screener of Vondee's movie.  We live in public about Josh Harris.  Which raises some really interesting questions about privacy and so forth.  And Josh's opinion was everybody's going to live in public.  You know, you'd be lucky to have 15 minutes of obscurity, not 15 minutes of fame.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  That's actually really good.  Yeah, that is good.  Where's my 15 minutes of obscurity?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just want 15 minutes of privacy.  That's all I ask.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  You had your 15 minutes of obscurity, but it's already happened in the past.  It's too late.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  You've already used up your 15 minutes.  Too late.  No, I actually think the really interesting piece about this is that before the contours  of privacy and public and semi-public or semi-private were much more evenly spread out.  You had private, right?  You could go into your house.  You could really be private, go into the bathroom, you know, and you had these layers of privacy.  And because you had physical architectures that supported those layers, you could see  where you were and who could see you.  And if you yelled really loud in the bathroom or cried, you know, the person in the living  room might hear you, right?  But you kind of knew.  You had a sense of that.  And then if you went outside your front door, the neighbors could see you.  And if you went to school, everyone at school could see you.  If you went to work, same thing, blah, blah, blah.  And then, you know, we had really public stuff, which is like, maybe you got written up in  the New York Times and now millions of people could see you, right?  And they knew something about you.  But the contours and the barriers in the analog world were, you know, pretty easy to see.  And now, of course, online, we have this really different thing.  And I think what's collapsed is the in-between place for privacy where when you went out  your front door, just your neighbors could see you.  So now the line is you're inside and away from a computer and no one can see you.  Or you're near a computer and somehow putting out some kind of an expression, right?  Even a tweet or even just like the most basic, like an IM just with one other friend.  But you know, that friend could like cut and paste your whole IM, stick it in a website  somewhere on a blog post, and now it's all public.  And because it's really easy.  So we've collapsed the middle area where there was semi-private, semi-public.  And we've pushed all that to public.  But it's not that everything is public.  I can still go to the bathroom.  You can still go to the bathroom and no one's going to know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The NSA will know I'm there, but they can't.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well they'll know you're at your house, but they're not going to know probably where in  your house because GPS is actually unbelievably unreliable.  I mean, the whole thing where people want to do like coupons when you walk past a store  and they're like, well if you're in front of this store, you're going to get that coupon.  But if you walk 10 more feet in front of a different store, you're going to get a different  coupon.  It's not very reliable.  It's not that reliable.  It's not that speedy.  And this is spoken as somebody who's trying to develop this kind of software.  I've worked on it.  So the dream as it were to do this is not...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What about augmented reality?  We've now seen, you've got some augmented reality apps on the G1 or the Google phone  and Apple has a couple.  I just got a Yelp update that if I shake my phone three times, click my heels and say  there's no place like home, this new Yelp update on the iPhone, I can hold it up and  point it and they'll say, oh yeah, right there, that's that.  Oh yeah, that's that.  This is the review.  That's pretty cool.  But that's a compass, right?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  That's a compass and it's also just using the gyroscope to figure out when you're moving.  Oh, so it's not that simple.  There is actually also a thing that you can do with an altimeter.  So one of the other pieces of software that Ed, who is my coder, worked on this spring  was a flight planning software.  And actually when we go on a plane together, he'll pull out his software and you're allowed  to use GPS apps on an airplane on a commercial flight.  Yes you are.  You can track yourself using Google Maps.  But I have to turn off the device.  You have to turn off the phone part.  You're not allowed to connect with phone cell towers.  So the GPS doesn't transmit.  GPS is just a satellite.  So you're allowed to do that.  So we pull out our phones and we can track where all the air parts are, even the little  teeny ones and where the plane has a little icon on the map and we follow, like we'll  fly somewhere and you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd love an augmented reality because I always look at the window and say, what am I looking  at?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  This shows you.  This shows you that.  It happens to be designed for people who are pilots.  But it actually would be really cool for anyone just in an airplane to see where you are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was wondering about that.  I thought we really need to have my GPS on.  But I thought, well, that's probably not allowed.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  But the thing about it is that it uses the altimeter piece and it uses the gyroscope  and it uses the compass.  And so it actually can, you wouldn't want to fly with it.  If you relied on it, you probably would die.  But it is really fun.  But it's very fun to take in the plane.  Ed has a plane, so we'll use it in the plane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's fun.  I'll have to do that next time I fly.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  We should actually send it to Doug because he has got a plane.  He's a pilot.  Doug's a pilot.  It's fun to play around with.  Get an Android phone, Doug, and we'll send it to you.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Oh, that would be fun.  I have GPS in the plane.  It's amazing.  I mean, it's completely revolutionized navigation.  Yeah, totally.  When you can see what side of the runway centerline you're on based on GPS, you know it's pretty  scary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's awesome.  Brown University outsourcing its email to Google.  I think a lot of universities are starting to do this because students got tired of the  10 megabyte limit on their mailbox.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  A listener sent this story to me and I thought it was kind of a big deal because I just didn't  know a whole lot about Google Apps for Education.  It turns out that lots of universities already use it.  The part about that story that I thought was really interesting is that Brown students,  60% of them, they ran some stats, 60% of them already forward their university email to  Gmail, which is kind of huge.  I mean, Gmail's really won the hearts and minds of not only the tech savvy, but young  people.  I was actually talking about this with my wife who's at UC San Diego and I was like,  isn't that a big number?  And she was like, not at all.  It seems small almost.  Yeah, from students is either on behalf of so-and-so from Gmail or just a Gmail account  to begin with.  So I guess they're testing it out with 200 students and going to see how it goes, get  feedback and then roll it out.  But there are quite a few universities that already use it, but not including Stanford,  which I guess I saw a tech, I was researching this and then a TechCrunch reported in 2008  that they went with Zimbr.  Which I thought was surprising since the Google Stanford kind of connection.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  We have Google for Education, whatever it's called.  We have that as our corporate mail, corporate stuff because we're a nonprofit.  So we get it for free also.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know why anybody would use Exchange at this point.  I really don't.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  You need a server.  Why would you want to have a server?  I mean, this is, we want to be in the cloud, don't we?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  You know, the only thing that I would say about that is that I've got friends who run  companies where they'll have like 40,000 employees or 10,000 employees or whatever.  And so I have one friend, he's a CEO, he has a company with 10,000 people.  And he contacted Google a year ago about using Gmail and Google Apps generally.  And they, because they're a big enough company, they wanted certain things.  And basically Google just can't give support and can't, they couldn't really support them  in a corporate circumstance.  But conversely, I really think that the school application of Gmail, you know, the school  use of that is just perfect.  I mean, it's great.  Schools don't have the money to put into that.  And frankly, to have an IT department to support it sucks, right?  So the idea that you could just, you know, outsource all of that stuff to Google is great.  But I can see how corporations would not want to do it because they want more stuff, you  know, and they can afford to pay an IT guy to do it.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, so.  Well, and there's hosted exchange, which is kind of the best of both worlds from their  point of view.  Yeah.  They get exchanged, but they don't have to run the server themselves.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  But also I think if you look at the demographics of the student body, they're much more likely  to be self-supporting.  I think Mary's right.  The corporate overhead from supporting that is something that the IT guys saying, look,  we've got to support exchange or we've got to support office anyway.  We're going to stick to that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was thinking of using a Google groups for a group that I am a part of at the school  my kid goes to.  And I was worried about privacy issues.  Do you think that's a part of it?  Do you think?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  I'm not talking about Google groups you're talking about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'm talking about group.  Yeah.  Yeah, groups.  Not news groups.  The mailing lists.  Yeah, not news groups, but they call it Google groups.  But yeah, it's mailing lists.  It's like a message board.  Right.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Right.  No, we use groups too, but that's separate.  Is there a privacy issue?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I understand.  Okay.  But same thing with same question for Google mail in a school.  Is there a privacy issue?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Well, there can be.  I mean, we have about 20 different groups in Google groups at conversations network  and some of them are private.  Some of them are locked down and some of them are wired.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'm just saying that a corporation or even maybe even more so a school would be  maybe concerned that using Google to host either email or groups or anything else might  be a problem in terms of privacy, at least with the exchange server that you run, you  know where that data is going.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think in terms of like revealing identity or?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, here's a third party.  I'm trusting a third party with this data.  No, that's not a problem.  I don't think so.  Am I being innocent and naive again?  But endearing.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  I think one of the bigger problems that a university has is shared computers where,  you know, you log in.  That's right.  I mean, no, I mean, that's much more significant.  And that's certainly makes the Google Groups problem worse because, you know, you walk  away from a computer, you've logged in the cookies there.  Right.  And that's not so bad when you have a client app.  Well, that's not true.  I shouldn't say that.  It's bad no matter what.  But that's where the privacy issues are, I think, for most things like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a much more significant issue than what's who's going through the data.  Yeah.  Who's storing it and so forth.  Hey, let's get to our.  This is something that Doug and Mary, you can kind of sit back on if you want.  Normally what Jeff, Gina and I do is a tool of the week, a tip of the week and a number  of the week.  Jeff's not here to do his number of the week.  So, Gina, I guess it's you with the tip of the week.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Is this like Sesame Street?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could do a number.  The letter A, the number seven.  Mary, if you want to come up with a stat, you can come up with a stat.  I'll give you some time to think about it or a tip or anything.  But you don't have to, is the point.  Okay.  You can take a buy on this one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So, my tip this week is Gmail related.  They just launched a new contact chooser when you're composing email.  So, if you open up a new email in Gmail, you can now click the to label, the word TO next  to the field to add recipients.  And it'll pop up a small window which lets you search through your contacts and check  off multiple recipients.  And you can do this for your CC or BCC as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  So, just hit compose.  It's doing a look up from the content, from the contact database.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's basically a new interface to your contacts list, which is much needed.  Gmail's contacts interface in general isn't one of the strongest parts of the app.  But so, if you, so you're looking at an email now, Leo, if you hit the compose link.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where is that?  Left side at the top.  Oh, yeah.  You can see I use Gmail all the time.  And then if you click the TO field.  Okay.  And then I, oh, look at that.  So, it's got all the.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's auto complete.  So, you started to, so you started to type.  And that works well too.  But if I do this.  Click on the TO.  This is what's new.  Yeah, there you go.  This is what's new.  This is brand new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I like this most contacted thing.  These are the people I've sent the most email to.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really smart and handy list as well.  So, you can search through your contacts.  You can filter down by group.  And then when you have a list of contacts, you can check them off as many as you need.  And then it'll add them to the TO field.  And then you hit the done button and you're good.  I, you know, this has been up for a week now.  I haven't used it a whole lot because I just tend to email specific people and use the  auto complete.  Right.  But it's really helpful if you send out a big message to several people that you have  in a group or, you know, that you just don't remember their email addresses or whatever  their handles are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you want to start paying attention to your Google contacts because it's getting  more and more useful.  For instance, because I categorized my contacts, I can have in Google voice different voicemail  messages.  It actually threw my wife a little bit because she left a message.  You know, she called my number and it said, Hi, I'm not here right now.  Leave a message.  Love you.  And she, and she said, do you say love you to everybody who leaves a message?  And I said, no, you're on my family list.  You just didn't know that.  And that's really cool.  And then, you know, you can have an indefinite number of groups and have different responses  for each of them.  So, so start.  And so that I noticed that shows up in the two too.  I can, I can search, I can categorize and search through them that way.  I think that's great.  I'm, I'm, I'm liking Google context.  I want to, I mean, that's basically not my contact database.  And I sync it up with the iPhone and the app and the Mac.  The pre did that automatically, which I thought was very cool.  And of course, any Google phone would do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  I got serious about my Google contacts with Google voice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Voice really.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That really did it for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this work.  Yep.  My thank you for the tip.  Appreciate it.  My tool of the week is something new added to a Google reader that I think is very cool.  Bundles have been a part of Google reader for a while.  In fact, our friend, Kevin Marks made a comics bundle, which I subscribed to immediately.  But this is that great browse for stuff section of Google reader that you told us about Gina  a couple of weeks ago has actually now got some stuff in it, which is pretty cool.  So now they've got power reader bundles and they've gone to a lot of big shots.  There's different categories.  There's news, there's technology.  You know, you can see who Ariana Huffington reads in her Google reader and not only see  what her feeds are, but subscribe to them in a bundle.  This is kind of Google's response in a way to OPML.  I guess it's really kind of probably back end is probably is OPML.  When you subscribe, you see it, for instance, over here on the left, I've subscribed to  Chris Anderson, the editor of Wireds bundle.  It will actually be in a folder so I can see what Chris Anderson is reading today, what  Marcos is reading in the Daily Coast.  I've got the Lifehacker group, which is the editor of Lifehacker, Paul Krugman's group.  So you can, you can subscribe.  And they've done a nice job, by the way, of finding conservatives as well as liberals.  So you know, you've got Michelle Malkin as well as Paul Krugman.  You don't have to feel too limited by that.  But I think this bundles thing is kind of a neat way to kind of snoop on what people  are reading and add them to your feed.  A great way to find new feeds too.  So all you have to do is, looks like I just broke it.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Just don't use it in the bathroom.  People will know what you're reading.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right.  So you can see these featured bundles created by power readers and then view all 27 of the  bundles.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  If you combine it with GPS and I'll know where Paul Krugman was when he was reading.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't that be cool?  The Lifehacker is Adam Pash.  Let's see, food and health, trends and fashion.  I like this idea.  I'd like to see more of these.  So that's my tool of the week.  Of course, Google Reader has been a great tool.  Since we started the show, they've really done a lot of neat things to Google Reader  and this is one more nice little feature.  Anybody want to add a number for our dear Jeff Jarvis?  I didn't come up with a number for Jeff.  Well, we can do our wine of the week.  I'm sorry, Gina is so positive.  She likes to call this our wish list, but I prefer to think of it as our bitch list.  Oh, I thought you were going to actually recommend wine.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  I was like, okay, I'm totally there.  We've done that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Mary is who you want to talk to.  Wine and food, Mary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say Mary's recipes are, in fact, I tried to get Mary to come up here because  I was hoping she'd bring in an apricot tartatam, but couldn't get her to do that.  So maybe next time.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Apricots are out of season, but I could have brought nectarine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have peaches.  We have lots of peaches right now.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  My new thing is making ice cream with liquid nitrogen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I saw that on your blog.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we're bringing up a doer of liquid nitrogen to Burning Man this week.  And I've got fig ice cream, nectarine, a chocolate one, like dark chocolate, a bunch of different  things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah.  Here's your number of the week.  How big is a doer?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It depends on the size.  The one that we have is 10 liters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A 10 liter doer.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you can make about 10 batches of ice cream with that or gelato or sorbet or whatever it  is that you want to make.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've done it before.  So how big is the nitrogen ice cream?  It's because it's so fast.  It's very creamy.  You don't get any crystals.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  You don't get the crystals.  And the thing about it is that when I made gelato, which is already a really reduced  fat recipe compared to ice cream, it's still too fat.  Like they're so creamy that you can barely eat it.  So what I ended up doing was cutting the fat to a quarter of the gelato one, which is a  quarter of ice cream.  Wow.  So now, yeah, you have almost nothing in there.  And so it's actually very healthy.  It's got that great creamy feel.  The tongue feel.  Added donuts.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, how do you get...  Okay.  So when you have the fruit and stuff, you make your custard, your ice cream custard,  that's in a bowl.  How do you get the fruit and the fillings in?  Do you have them separate or you mix them in?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Well, so for the fig thing that I just did, I just pureed very ripe cadoda figs, which  are the green figs with like the pink insides.  And they have them on sale right now at Whole Foods.  And I just bought a ton and they were very ripe and I pureed them with a little lime  juice and sugar and a little bit of balsamic vinegar and some water.  And then, and that's it.  So that one's going to be a sorbet.  I did one with nectarine, which has like a quarter, it has a half a cup of cream and  like six or eight cups, I think, of nectarines.  And again, they were super ripe.  Just pureed them.  Little lime juice, little sugar, little bit of vanilla.  That's it.  You know, so very easy.  So then, yeah, you just exactly like that.  Yep, there we are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's pouring her doer in.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  So the funniest thing is, is that it's so, it makes all this mist.  So you actually can't really watch it happening.  You're doing it all by touch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't know what you're going to get.  But so you pour the nitrogen in and it's very, very cold.  You've got a mixer and of course you're wearing gloves and don't try this at home and your  tongue will stick to them.  Yeah, oh, no, we wear at home.  No, I'm saying it to the other people.  Mary's a trained nitrogen professional.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  That was only my first time.  Those photos.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really fun.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  It's really fun.  I totally recommend it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dr. Kiki did it on our TV show a couple of months ago.  It was really fun.  All you have to do is, is yeah, liquid nitrogen.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  All you have to do that's really important is go to the web and read a couple of the  guidelines.  Like find somebody who's got, you know, guidelines about how to store it, how to manage it, how  to do the gloves and stuff and wear goggles because you don't want it to splash in your  eyes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It could freeze your cemerus.  Yeah, that would really be bad.  And Doug wanted to know, where do you get the nitrogen?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Oh, you can buy that from places like, I think Airgas is a company that is like kind of a  chain of places.  So it's legal.  It's not restricted.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like $3 a liter or $2.25 or something like that.  It's very reasonable.  So you can make a batch.  Leder will make a batch.  And yeah, it's totally great.  I mean, it's just easy and simple and very, it happens so fast.  You put it in a bowl.  You actually don't need the mixer.  We've now determined because it's our third time doing it.  You can do it with a spoon.  You can do it with a spoon.  It takes like 30 seconds to a minute.  And it makes, puts all this air in the ice cream without ice crystals and it tastes amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you don't, the custard, you don't make it any different way.  You make it just like you were going to make ice cream.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if you're going to, so the chocolate one has like a quart of milk, a half cup of cream,  sugar, dark chocolate, very, very simple.  And egg yolks.  You do your custard the way that you would get a recipe online, you know, do, do an ice  cream recipe or a gelato recipe, throw it, you know, refrigerate it.  Like you always make ice cream.  You always refrigerate the stuff.  Then you pour in your liquid nitrogen and it's great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When I think of the hours I spent on the back step with rock salt cranking, I mean,  literally hours cranking the ice cream maker.  This is so, no need.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  And, and it's super cool.  You get to wear a giant welding gloves and a mask.  I mean, you know, you could wear a cape if you really want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should have done that for Henry's birthday party.  What was I thinking?  What was I thinking?  Well, Mary, who needs a stat of the week?  We've got liquid nitrogen.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mary, Mary hotter is at napsterization.org slash stories.  We'll look forward to seeing what you're doing with this new mobile platform.

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's interesting.  We'll look for it.  It'll be on it.  It'll be on a Google phone, right?

Speaker: Mary Hodder
Transcript:  Yes.  Android, along with we, we do want to do an iPhone version as well as Blackberry Palm  pre cool, that sort of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe Windows will help me lose weight and eat liquid nitrogen at the same time.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ice cream.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you, Mary.  I'm so glad you called and could get on the show.  This was wonderful.  Thank you for joining us.  Thanks for having me.  Gina Trapani is at smarterwear.org, which sounds like a place to get smarter underwear,  but it is not.  Although it wouldn't be a bad thing to have as like a sideline, a little merchandising.  You could do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Great to be here.  This is a great show.  Miss Jeff, but this is a fun show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff will be back next week, I'm sure.  Yeah, lots of fun.  Thanks once again also to Doug K of the Conversations Network at conversationsnetwork.org.  Anything you want to plug, Doug?

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  All the new work is at spokenword.org.  It's our new, not new, but it's our project that will ultimately replace the podcast store  on iTunes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It's about time.  Wow.  I'm ready to free us from the chains that bind us to Apple.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Yeah, we, we, we, we had a lot of people talk to us about that.  We had a town hall meeting and we realized that everybody hates the iPod store in iTunes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know who hates it most, at least in my opinion, is me.  And it's only not, look at it was a...  You're always there, Leo.  I said, did I not say when iTunes came along, this is the best thing that happened to the  podcasting and the worst thing.  You did say that.  It's great because it exposed it to a lot of people, but we've hit the ceiling.  We hit the ceiling years ago because it's still too hard to figure out how to find a  show, download it, get on your device and listen to it.

Speaker: Doug Kaye
Transcript:  Too many steps.  It's a closed system and there are no APIs and we're going to do an entirely open version  of that.  Oh, that's great news.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anybody can use.  Well, I look forward to seeing that.  And we are working on a solution too that will, we did not want to release videos of  all these shows and we will be doing videos soon of all these shows because we make video  of all these shows.  But I didn't want to release them on iTunes because I didn't want it just to have it be  another podcast.  So we've got a new idea that is kind of related to something we were talking about earlier  and I'll leave that as an exercise for the listener.  You can watch this show.  We do a two fifteen Pacific time.  That's five fifteen Eastern time every Saturday at live dot twit dot TV.  And then of course, subscribe on iTunes and you'll be able to hear it at your leisure.  Thank you, Mary Hodder.  Thank you, Gina Trapani.  Thank you, Doug Kay.  I'm Leo Laporte.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google and Other Stuff.
