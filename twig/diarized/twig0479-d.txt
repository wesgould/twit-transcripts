She's got one of those little colts that are nodes.  But you sound fine, actually.  Well, good.  I'm making fun of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's OK.  I expect that.  I expect nothing less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ha ha.  Until you get that fist to come out of the back of the thing  to punch me, I'm safe.  Also with us, your erstwhile cohort of GigaOM,  Matthew Ingram, now chief digital writer  at the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.org.  Great to have you, Matthew.  Thank you.  Great to be here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I'm glad you both are here.  And I would love to have had Jeff here.  But he's traveling still.  He's traveling.  This is his time of year to travel.  But I saw with some disappointment  that Jimmy Wales' citizen journalist enterprise maybe  isn't doing all that well.  They've let all the journalists go.  And now it's all going to be community driven,  like a wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it sounds like I've actually been  doing some research on this.  And it sounds like they are going to hire new journalists.  So it's not that they're not going to have any.  But they want to.  What happened to the 12 original guys?  Well, the story is that they want the journalists  that they hire to be more community friendly  or to interact with the community better.  So the suggestion or the implication  is that the ones they had were two sort of, I'm a journalist.  And I say what goes.  And I get content from you, the user.  And then I turn it into journalism,  as opposed to helping.  At least that's the way it was phrased anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Wiki Tribune.  And the last line of the Verge article  says, Wiki Tribune plans to hire more journalists  in the future in a capacity that's more community driven  and less about supervising the work of outside contributors.  That makes, I remember at Tech TV, that was always,  and even before then, any television show in the 90s  that had a website and a TV part, as Tech TV did,  as the site did before it, there was just an impermeable wall  between the television people and the web people  at that time.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's changed over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Jimmy wrote something on the site about the changes.  And he said that a lot of journalists,  and I can agree with him on this,  a lot of journalists see themselves as sort of  above regular people because they have certain skills  and they've done certain things.  And so that that's not a great mindset to go into  collaborating with users on.  And I would go along with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know that's how Stacey feels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, I hate collaborating with normals.  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you are better than other people.  So it's not just a feeling, it's actual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, good, I'm actually glad that it's doing all right.  That's actually, it sounds to me  like a reasonable course correction.  And it is inevitable in this kind of thing  that you have people who train in this,  who went to graduate school like Stacey did.  I don't know about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually did not go to graduate school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's important to know.  Like Matthew did.  I did.  One of you did, I know.  I wonder that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Graduate school was a waste of brain cells for me  because mine was all about content analysis  as opposed to practical journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, get me on the streets.  I went right after typewriters were invented.  So most of my students use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jeff, who teaches graduate school in journalism  isn't with us today.  The lobby of his graduate school  actually has a display of antique typewriters.  So it's all coming full circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I tell the kids when I go to the 20 year olds, the kids,  when I talk to them at journalism schools  about our journalism school, which was typewriters,  and we typed things out and then we had to print them  on a giant Gestetner machine.  Oh, geez.  It sounds like the Middle Ages.  Did you shout, copy?  And then this huge roll of paper would come off  and you'd cut it with an X-ACTO knife  and then try and trim it and glue it on to the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember many years ago, 25, 30 years ago,  going to the Chronicle where they were laying out the comics

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and they still were using wax and X-ACTO knives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the guy said, he said,  this is, by next year nobody will do this in the world.  I think they were one of the last holdouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember using Dreamweaver to actually code the magazine  that I was putting on the web in college.  On the web for the first time.  You're not that old, Stacey, that does not.  I remember Hot Metal Pro.  Hey dude, that feels like forever ago now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you remember Hot Metal Pro?  HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, HTML, Hot Metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was one that it had spider in it or something.  Spider, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the web spider.  Yeah, get it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have received, am I, oh go ahead, Stacey,  anything else you want to say about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to segue us off of old journalism too.  New exciting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The newest, latest gizmo has arrived.  Okay, just to give you a sense,  for those of you watching at home,  if you're listening, I'll describe this.  This is the Google Home Hub.  The thing Google announced at Google I.O. finally came today.  This is a Pixel 3 phone, also announced at the same time.  These are almost exactly the same size.  So it was hard to tell in the announcement  how big this Home Hub was.  It ain't big.  It's actually a little bit functionally,  a little bit smaller than the Pixel 7,  seven inch, or the Nexus 7,  seven inch tablet that Google used to sell.  They sold that for $127.  This is $149.  No camera, that's a light sensor.  It's an ambient light sensor.  In fact, if I cover it up, you'll see at night,  the pictures get darker and darker and darker.  So it won't keep you up at night.  I have to say, though, excellent camera.  This is a nice photo frame.  It integrates really well with Google Photos.  What I did for this is I picked people.  You could choose people that you want  to have in your pictures.  So I chose my family.  And every one of these pictures has somebody,  sometimes in a tiny, tiny picture of my family in it.  And it's really fun, because it goes back 20 years,  ever since I started taking digital photos.  So it's a really fun photo frame.  Now I've sent it for every 10 seconds.  You can make it every minute, every five minutes,  every hour, you don't have to change it that frequently.  But just for purposes of display.  And it has also got Google Assistant.  Let me turn the microphone on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The mic's back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And say, I don't know, listen to This Week in Google.  Oh, I have to say something first.  Pardon me.  Hey, play This Week in Google.  I don't know if it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  Here's the latest episode of This Week in Google MP3,  twig 478.  When a doorbell rings, a roadie gets its wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's time for twig.  This week in Google, Kevin Toffle and Stacey Higgins.  Hey, stop.  So the sound is, I think, pretty good.  It's coming out of these fabric covered speakers  on the back, which is pretty good.  I'm sad to say, I thought, oh, it'll have a type C connector.  It doesn't.  It has one of those barrel plugs,  proprietary barrel plugs.  And it has, and I can't show you because it's plugged in,  the poorest design for a plug I've ever seen.  It's so round.  And people have already started complaining.  It doesn't work very well in a power strip.  Just be prepared for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google did that with the home.  Is it the minis, I think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did that.  Yeah, I was really disappointed in that.  Please, come on.  So you know what we're doing with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The default display is a photo.  You see, it's still showing the twig.  It's the default display.  Let me turn it down a little bit because it's  a little bright for us to see.  You swipe up to get controls from the bottom.  You use the Google Home app to control it.  Oh, now I can't see anything.  I love the photo slideshow.  And I think that the screen is very good for that.  It's more than adequate for the slideshow.  It also has, as you can see, a clock display.  It has a variety of digital and analog clocks you can use.  But I think everybody's going to use this as a photo frame.  No video calling.  You can do audio calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do duo on it, though.  Kevin and I discovered that.  You can, but no video.  You can, but no video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like this.  And I think at $149, this makes a lot of sense,  putting this in the kitchen, in the bedroom.  No camera, right?  In the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it looks good in the kitchen.  I'd say bedroom, maybe bathroom.  Kitchen, I feel like I would want the larger, maybe  that JBL you've got there, or maybe the Lenovo Smart Display  that I've got.  You have the Lenovo.  This just came out.  It's a little small.  That's a little small.  I would like the 10-inch Lenovo, which I've got with me,  is great for watching YouTube.  You can watch YouTube on it.  You can't watch Netflix yet on the larger ones,  although you are supposed to eventually.  Yeah.  How much is the Lenovo?  The bigger Lenovo is $250.  The smaller Lenovo is $200.  The smaller is 8 inches.  The big one is 10 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll like this.  I can slide down from the top and see my home automation  stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and you can control the lights.  I'm very excited by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?  Yeah.  So these are the lights, media, broadcast.  I could view the rooms.  This one's in the shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I think this is actually a very nice device,  especially at that price.  And I would say I'm going to get a couple more.  I'm really pretty happy with it.  I really love the photo frame.  It's for me.  And this makes more sense if you've stored a lot of photos  in Google Photos, if you've been using the face recognition.  It really is fun because it goes back in time.  Here's a picture from Hawaii from four or five years ago.  And it's just completely random.  So I like that.  It doesn't sound bad.  We played some music.  It's not horrible.  It's better than one would expect for something this size.  But of course, yeah, I'm sure the JBL will sound better.  And the Lenovo sounds pretty good, too.  I would say the Lenovo is not hugely better than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Lenovo sounds better.  Of course, I'm not in the same room.  Here's Henry at the prom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I definitely like it.  I would like it definitely bigger.  I've been trying to actually have a computer,  a dedicated server that just plays photos.  And I like them to be big so I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought about building a photo.  If you want really big, of course,  if you've got a TV that's cast enabled,  you can always just put it on TV, right?  It gets 70 inches of photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, before you rush out and buy one, Matthew,  I will say I would be looking in a month,  we're going to be actually less than a month now,  is going to be Black Friday.  And if I don't see lots of hot Google deals,  I'm going to be shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shocked, I say.  They already sold this Google Home at 100 bucks  for eight hours on.  Yeah, online.  So I wouldn't be surprised.  I'll have a full review for you Saturday  on the screensavers, but I got it this morning.  But initially, my initial reaction is  I'm pretty happy with this.  I like it.  But I like the Echo Show too.  The new one?  Well, I don't have the new one.  I have the original one, which a lot of people hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new one is very beautiful.  And now that I've got the old one,  but once I saw the new one, I was like, ooh, ooh.  Yeah.  Old one, you are so dated and yucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It already looks old, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so gross.  Now we come to-  Okay, so gross is such an over-exaggeration, I'm sorry.  It's so gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the new way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we come to the Pixel 3.  And I can't figure out if people  are just being really nitpicky  or if there are actually some significant issues  with the Pixel 3.  There's one that I have certainly experienced,  and I think pretty much everyone's experiencing.  If you're listening to music on the Pixel 3  and you launch the camera, the music stops.  It has very aggressive background process killing.  Some say it's because they only put four gigs of RAM in here.  I don't believe that.  I think it's either a bug or Google tuned it  a little too aggressively.  Remember, in the early days of the iPhone,  you couldn't run anything in the background  except Apple's approved stuff  that was to improve battery life.  Later, Apple added background.  Google's had it, Android's had it for some time.  So it could very well just be  an aggressive memory management technique.  However, I was trying to play Pokemon Go the other day,  and every time I took a picture,  it restarted Pokemon Go, which was no good.  And it's certainly no good if you're listening  to a book or music and you want the music to continue  while you take a picture or do something else.  You can multitask, but it looks like two or three apps  is the limit, and some apps like the camera  are so demanding that nothing can run in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that all the fancy computational photography?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, yeah.  Sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, Matthew.  So it literally shuts the app down?  Like if there's something running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I could show you.  I can do it.  I'll play some of the, this is from Google's own app.  This is Google Play Music.  Let me turn it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems suboptimal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Okay, so I'm listening to some music on here.  And as soon as I launch the camera,  did it just the other?  So this part of the problem is it doesn't do it all the time.  So it didn't do it this time.  Oh, but now it's gone.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it runs out of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe a RAM issue.  Four gigs is a lot, but maybe,  this to me, this feels like something they could fix  pretty quickly, and I imagine will.  There's also issues.  Some people have complained of the camera losing photos.  You take a picture, it records it, but it doesn't save it.  Yeah, that would be pretty bad.  It has not happened to me.  But that could be pretty upsetting.  People are complaining about the sound  that the two speakers, and everybody hates this,  everybody, I don't hate it,  but a lot of people hate this notch.  But at least the excuse for the large notch  is that you've got a speaker here.  But the thing is, it's a smaller speaker here  than on the chin, which people also hate.  And even though these are left light, right speakers,  one is louder than the other.  And then somebody, I can't remember who,  maybe it was Neelay Patel, put rice on his back  of his Pixel while it was playing music, there it is.  Oh, Russell Holly did this.  And there's so much bass that the rice is vibrating.  Now, is that being nitpicky?  A little bit.  I think so.  Hey, who's gonna be eating rice off the back of their Pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, that's just to illustrate  the heavy bass phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I want heavy bass.  Got to have the bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not everybody does.  I don't enjoy super overweighted bass, I'll be honest.  It doesn't strike me as overweighted.  And you know what, a lot of people,  a lot of people put, they boost their bass  because their overall sound quality isn't great.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you've got, I mean.  I would agree.  The sound, while the sound is very loud,  and Google made a lot of noise about that, so to speak,  it's not great.  It's a little, it's not great sound.  But I don't expect a phone to have great sound.  Paul Therotte says he was unhappy with it.  It's not as good even as his Pixel 2 XL.  So another thing to be aware of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, but if the bass is strong enough to move the rice,  then the haptic feedback on that thing must be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, it's surprising.  It's not.  It is fantastic.  And that is the one thing everybody's very happy about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pluses and minuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  The screen is great and the camera is amazing.  We're just now getting an updated camera app.  Doesn't yet have the night shot capability,  but that seems to be just around the corner.  Actually, the new version of the Google camera app  was decompiled and people have found the night shot in there  and there are APKs floating around with it on there.  So it's, I'm very excited about that.  That's a feature Google said will come out soon.  It's an excellent camera.  I'm very happy with the images.  So, I don't know.  I don't know what to say about this.  I think those are definitely problems.  There's no phone that's perfect.  Every phone has problems.  I've been very happy with the Pixel 3  and I can live with the fact that it's closing out apps  in the background.  Presumably that'll be fixed.  If it's not fixed, then it's an issue.  Then I would agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought, I saw somebody, I was at an event  and I saw it and it looked great.  I mean, the screen looked amazing.  The screen is very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last year's screen was not so nice.  That was a terrible OLED screen.  Apparently they're giving these  from Samsung, according to Kevin Toffle, so that's good.  Sorry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought, I was looking for a new phone  and I saw something that said the 2 XL  had a different screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did, it had the LG OLED screen.  It was terrible.  And that it was not recommended.  Not recommended, but the 3 is as good.  It's a Samsung panel reportedly  and it's, I would say, is as good as the iPhone  or the Samsung phones.  Very crisp, great color.  Of course.  I got a Huawei P20.  The P20's great.  Are you happy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very happy.  The camera is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has not one, not two, but three cameras.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's, the two big ones on the back  are designed for low light and zoom  and its performance is incredible.  I mean, it's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a copy of, I bought one too  and the thing that set me off a little bit,  do you remember that when you set it up,  Huawei asked for permission to look at everything  on your phone and send it back to China?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I just said, sure, fine.  What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care.  You're not a Chinese dissident.  That's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, hello Chinese dissidents trying to contact him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That put me off a little bit,  but other than that, it's a really nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a great phone.  I'm really happy with it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This sort of ties to this Pixel 3 charging story,  which opened me into this crazy world  of insider baseball on Qi.  Well, wait.  What's going on there?  So did you read the update at the bottom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it starts with Ars Technica saying,  DRM for chargers, Google Pixel 3 locks fast Qi charging  to certified chargers and chiefly,  their claim was that the fast 10 watt charging  is only available if you have a Pixel stand.  Google's response, the Pixel 3 does not support  10 watt Qi charging at all.  It supports 10 watt wireless charging  and it supports the Qi wireless charging standard,  but these are two different things.  Qi is capped at five watts.  For 10 watt wireless charging,  you need a charger with what Belkin calls Google's  10 watt proprietary wireless charging technology.  So that does kind of make sense that, yeah.  This is what I mean.  Sometimes I think the fanboys jump on these things,  get all irate, I blame Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Assume it's a conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and then the facts come out  that actually you can't get a 10 watt Qi charger.  It wouldn't be Qi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  I do think Qualcomm has pushed this  with its whole rapid something something charging.  So chip vendors are constantly doing this  to differentiate with their products, right?  And the idea that Google or Apple or any,  you would do this to boost your own product,  that totally makes sense,  but it is kind of frustrating for a user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but they do allow, for instance,  the Belkin charger to do 10 watts.  So it's not just Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's more the idea that now if I'm buying a phone  and I want rapid charging, I don't buy Qi.  That's not the one.  So all of my standardized stuff doesn't work.  I have to go buy something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a failing of the Qi standard though, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yes, they are working on higher wattage standards,  but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have the Samsung fast charger for my Note 9

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it does charge fast.  And it works with everything else.  It works with the iPhone and it seems to charge  pretty quickly, both the iPhone and the Pixel 3.  That's a 15 watt charger,  but obviously it's not a Qi charger.  So Qi is like the...  The lowest common denominator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lowest common denominator, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and Qi has several denominators, it's worth noting.  They've got the phone stuff,  they've got a big massive wattage  for charging electric vehicles,  and then they've got another group  working on like kitchen standards and...  That would charge my phone pretty fast.  Yeah, that would blow your phone out of the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would explode.  It would make rice dance on the back of it, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, have you ever put your phone in a microwave?  Because that's what it would be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Article and Wired about the secure enclave,  the hardware chip in the Pixel 3,  the Titan M, which I didn't realize this,  is based on the big boy Titan that is in Google's servers.  And it is a secure enclave, there it is right there,  physically separated from the chip,  which is actually a little different  from where the secure enclave works on Apple's iOS devices.  Their secure enclave is on the die for the CPU.  And Google says by isolating the Titan M completely,  moving it off the dip.  That's smart.  You get, he says, everything that lives  in the main processor, including Apple's enclave,  is sharing cache and RAM for the most part.  In order to use it to protect keys,  that's a reasonable thing to do,  but you know there's still gonna be the risks  of things like Spectre, Meltdown, and Rowhammer.  This is Will Drury,  who's a principal software engineer at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if they're combined, it's easier to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we move the key matter to tamper resistant hardware  that has its own private storage,  its own private RAM, its own private processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so that's a super common design,  but I will say when you integrate it on chip,  one of the reasons you do it is to save space,  and also to save on costs.  So I just wanna point out that,  because a lot of times we don't discuss the trade-offs there,  and it's worth discussing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And everything's a trade-off, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My phone has a secure enclave,  but it's located in Shanghai.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll take good care of your data here at Huawei,  in Shanghai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so secure I can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually had a long,  and I thought a fruitful conversation  on Windows Weekly today about exactly that,  because Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple,  spoke yesterday in front of a European Privacy Commission.  He was quite heated.  He was clearly targeting Google and Facebook.  No question in my mind.  He didn't mention them by name, but saying-  Yeah, I don't think he was talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  I think he was talking about two other large-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so wait, wait, y'all,  because I have strong feelings on this.  I think it's actually really good that he did this.  But yes, he's talking about Google and Facebook,  but he's bringing up- He calls them  the data industrial complex.  But actually, everyone wants to be like them.  So he's also making a really important point.  And we talk about it on this week's show,  but I don't know if you saw the story about GM  listening in on the radio signals from their cars last year.  So this came out, and if you Google like GM, I don't know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They used their OnStar technology to do that, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did, and they pulled this data,  and there was a quote from one of their executives,  and he talks about why they were doing this and playing this.  He's like, because we could.  Which I don't know about you,  but hey, that's freaky as all, get out.  So- We know TVs do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know this is not unusual.  In fact, that's what Cook said.  He said basically we're in a surveillance state.  But I guess the question I would ask you,  and it's a question I asked Paul, is  where do you draw the line?  Google is a free service.  Apple does not give its stuff away.  But Google and Facebook and others are free services,  not GM either, but let's stick with Google and Facebook then.  And the way they monetize their services  is by selling advertising.  The way they make money in advertising  is by selling targeted advertising using information  they claim is anonymized.  Actually, Google, I think, does anonymize it.  Facebook pretty obviously doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and let's be clear, users buy into that, right?  Users effectively know that that's occurring.  Well, that's the question.  But if one of you agreed to make money-  How much do users know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a good question.  And how much do they care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's how much do they know  and how much do they care.  I think it is a, we have to come to a consensus as a society  on what data should be protected and how we should use it.  So I know that Facebook is using my data  and I don't get enough value from Facebook.  So I'm like, screw it, I'm just not gonna be on there.  But there are plenty of people  who get lots of value from Facebook.  And if they had the option to have better controls  over what data went where, I think some of them,  not all of them, but some of them would take it.  And I think denying people that  and just shrugging it off and saying  it's because they don't care,  I don't think that's a really nuanced conversation.  It doesn't further-  No, they should care.  So that's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I completely agree that there should be,  in particular, Facebook and Google should make,  Facebook in particular, should make it easier  to control your data in a more granular way  and even to take it with you if you want or to.  And I think if there is one place  that legislation could look at, it would be that.  It would be transparency around that  and it would be more information  and more sort of ability users could have around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I just wanted to ask this one question.  Is it okay with you, and as long as it's explicit,  and everybody knows, to get free services  like Facebook or Google or Twitter,  because the way it's paid for is with targeted ads,  if they stopped at that, in other words,  they used the information they gathered about you  to target ads, which is highly lucrative for them,  would that be okay?  It's fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey?  I mean, that's the deal I got into.  Yeah, it doesn't bother me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I'd prefer targeted ads.  I know what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but here's the deal.  As we move the computing to everything else,  it becomes really interesting to see.  It's one thing to get a targeted ad  when I'm surfing the internet.  It's another thing to get a targeted ad in my home  on my, I don't know, television that I'm watching  with my new boyfriend or on a billboard  because I'm walking by.  This is all theoretical.  I make them silly so you can see that it's theoretical.  And I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GM snooping on what radio stations I'm listening to  and selling that data off without my knowledge,  maybe with my permission and the fine print,  but without my knowledge, is wrong.  That's wrong.  Because they're making money on the car,  and similarly, Apple's making money on the hardware,  but if I'm getting a free service, ad-supported service,  I don't know if that's wrong.  I don't see what GM did at being such a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I'm totally, I don't care if they listen  or if they look at what radio stations I'm listening to  or songs I'm listening to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You clearly do not have the All Britney Spears channel.  What the heck, Matthew?  But it's been a, so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's that information is, I don't care about it.  I don't, it doesn't bother me that someone's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going a little farther than I was willing to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they were looking at where you were listening to it.  They were looking at what vehicle you drove.  All of that would freak me out.  Totally.  And I would say a couple things.  One, in a few years, you're not gonna be able to buy  an unconnected product, for example,  in your appliances.  So GM, GM, sorry, Ken Moore and GE Appliances,  they've both said that they're not gonna make  non-connected products.  So when you start thinking about these things  are gonna come, connectivity is gonna be coming by default  to a lot of these, then you realize you can't opt out  of this world.  So we have to start making these rules  and having these conversations now.  And Matthew, you may be like, I don't care if, you know.  Yeah, I know you're right.  Ken Moore, GE knows what's in my fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And maybe I don't care about the songs on my radio,  but you're right.  Everything is going to include sort of data harvesting.  Some people do care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's clearly a spectrum of care.  Some people, for instance, somebody in the chat  was saying, well, Leo, you have ads.  Yeah, but we don't collect information about you  for those ads.  So there are some people who say no ad is okay.  I want a free service and I don't want you to monetize it.  That's one extreme.  There's some people that say no data collection  is okay at all.  That's another extreme.  And people generally fall between those in some way.  Well, you could collect data,  but you can only use it exactly this way.  I'm of the opinion, for instance,  as long as you're explicit, this is what GM did wrong.  They didn't tell people.  And as long as I have an opt out,  and maybe the opt out is a trade out.  Maybe, well, if you don't want to see ads,  you can't use Facebook.  That's the trade off.  But that's got to be explicit.  And I have to have the choice.  I have to be informed.  They have to be informed consent,  which is what GM didn't do.  And I should have the right to say no to that.  And as long as I have that,  and I will say yes in my case to,  yeah, you can collect data about me to target ads.  You can't sell it to the government.  You can't sell individual information about me to anybody.  If somebody says,  hey, I want to know what Leo's blood type is,  you can't give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I mean about granularity.  It'd be better to have a bit more control  rather than just sign here to give away all your data  so that we can do whatever we want with it,  and we're not going to let you know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may be that Kenmore sells refrigerators  that must be connected to work.  If that's the case, wow.  I mean, if you get a benefit from connecting a refrigerator  but you don't have to for it to cool food,  then that may be a fair trade off, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I should point out that I said I don't care.  I don't care about lots of things  that I probably should care about.  So taking my advice.  He's pretty apathetic folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's Canadian.  He's Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing to fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm reminded by my wife all the time  that there are things I should care about  that I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I realize there's a problem.  I'm kind of like you, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't give a damn about anything, anything at all.  It comes with age, I think.  Here's what-  I took a, your member's-  I think it comes with privilege, you guys.  Oh, privilege.  We're white guys.  You're right.  That's fair.  That's totally fair.  That's actually strictly true.  That's exactly right.  It comes with privilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't who said you don't have any privacy  and you should probably get used to it.  That was like 12 years ago.  Scott McNeely.  Yeah, Scott McNeely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of privilege.  Well, it's pretty privileged.  Here's what Cook said.  He's also privileged.  Our own information from the everyday  to the deeply personal is being weaponized against us  with military efficiency.  These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own,  are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded, and sold.  Taken to this extreme,  this process creates an enduring digital profile  and lets companies know you better  than you may know yourself.  Your profile is a bunch of algorithms  that serve up increasingly extreme content.  That's something I'd worry about.  And that's, we see that at YouTube.  That's what he's talking about, obviously.  Pounding our harmless preferences into harm.  We shouldn't sugarcoat the consequences.  This is surveillance.  He's calling for federal regulation.  But by the way, so is Google.  So is Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook.  Because I think these tech giants all realize,  well, we need a national law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next year it's gonna happen, so they have to do it.  And they'd rather do it on their terms.  And they wanna get out in front of it.  To the extent possible.  I would say he's also probably talking a little bit  about the data brokers.  I mean, he's not a dumb man.  And those guys are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're actually worse.  I think in some cases.  They sometimes are.  Because they're less transparent, if that's possible.  And they merge all kinds of databases  that people don't even realize exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I think that's, Tim does nail it there  where he's saying each piece by itself is innocuous enough.  But when you aggregate them, you can create something  that is pretty dangerous.  He also says AI is going to make this worse.  He says, for artificial intelligence to be truly smart,  it must respect human values, including privacy.  If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound.  We can achieve both great artificial intelligence  and great privacy standards.  But it's not only a possibility, it's a responsibility.  I agree with him.  Of course, it's directly aimed at Google.  And I guess you could be a cynic and say,  well, yes, since Apple doesn't have that information,  they don't want AI to be able to use that information,  because that would give Google an unassailable advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say it's easy in some ways for Apple  to make that argument, because they don't do it.  They don't do it, and they don't really need it.  They can sell phones for $2,000 and make billions of dollars.  And they don't provide, like, Apple fans  are going to get mad, but I think  Apple is terrible at most services.  And a little bit of user data would probably  help things get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least data about the way people use their stuff.  Yeah, or don't.  Or don't, yeah.  Clearly, Apple, I mean, GM makes plenty of money selling cars,  but they wanted to make a little more money.  And clearly, Apple could do the same thing.  There is strong incentive on every company  to make more money, even if you're making a lot of money.  But I like hearing him say no.  He says, GDPR has shown us all that good policy  and political will can come together  to protect the rights of everyone.  He tweeted this early this morning.  We believe privacy is a fundamental human right.  No matter what country you live in,  that right should be protected in keeping  with four essential principles.  This is, by the way, cribbed straight from GDPR.  Data minimization, transparency, the right  to access and the right to security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GDPR is hugely problematic.  I mean, it's not like it's the best privacy legislation ever  devised.  It has all kinds of unanticipated consequences,  I think.  I'm not sure we should say that's the gold standard we  should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say it has a potential for harm.  And what the EU commissioner said is, but we won't go there.  We'll use it with a light touch.  We'll use it appropriately.  But any time a law gives lawmakers  a tool that could be harmful, that's, to me,  harmful in and of itself.  However, it hasn't been misused to this point, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only a few months old, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to take us a year or two.  You know, all-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The trend is toward things like the right  to be forgotten, which is a huge minefield of-  Yeah.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's OK.  I like, tumped over my microphone.  So I'm sitting here going, oh, hey.  You may have already talked about this, which is, look,  I think we're going to have to find a balance between,  it is possible for us, given compute power, given  social media, and everything that we have,  to know just about everything about everyone  and have it tracked forever somewhere, right?  And that is, historically, something  that we really haven't had.  I mean, I guess we've had it in small towns back in the day,  where your family was, you could have that taint  from your family forever.  Or in East Germany.  Or in East Germany.  But you could always move, which is a big deal,  but still possible.  Now you're not going to be able to ever escape that.  And so we're coming from this era of,  it's really impossible to know anything about anybody,  it's possible to know everything about everybody.  And we've got to figure out the median between how  we want to handle that.  And Matthew's going to be a little different than maybe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think it's a lot more complex than,  and I think we've talked about this before,  if I own my data, quote unquote, on Facebook,  what does that consist of?  Does it consist of my address book?  Because those are the phone numbers of other people.  Do I own those?  Or do they own those?  And if I want to take them somewhere,  so if I want to take them somewhere,  I have to get permission from all of those people.  If it's data portability or Facebook giving me control  over, quote unquote, my data.  It's fine if it's my photos or content I uploaded,  but as soon as it involves other people,  it becomes exponentially more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think we're developing mores around that, right?  So I know at school, I would never  take a picture of someone's child  and post it without them knowing.  And I think beforehand, like 10 years ago,  I might have done that, or someone else might have done  that, but now no one does that.  Oh, really?  That's interesting.  So that's become the more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody will do that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my child's school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I posted a photo of you.  I tagged you, I think.  I posted a photo on, I think it was Facebook.  She's a grown up.  But I'm a grown up.  No, but I tagged you, and you said,  I wish you wouldn't do that.  Oh, yes, and I do.  I tell my friends that.  That literally not occurred to me.  And so I thought, oh, that's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wish you wouldn't post photos of you or tag them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I don't like people mostly tagging,  because that makes it much easier to find me.  To find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although we know that Facebook's face recognition algorithms  are so good that it doesn't matter anymore, right?  If there's a picture of you on Facebook.  Yeah.  So would your preference now be that people not post photos  of you at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like people posting photos of me.  It really depends on context.  If you post a photo of me at an event, that's fine.  If you're at my house and post a photo of me, that's not fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you post a photo of me in front of my kid's school,  also not fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think you're right.  I think we are developing a kind of morality or,  morality is etiquette slash morality.  I mean, these things are so new.  You know, it's really, it's early days in terms of determining  how you behave when two billion people could possibly see  the thing that you're posting.  I mean, we just don't know what that's like, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there was some backlash recently about the people  who took a video of maybe a homeless man shaving on a train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that one because I was thinking about it  just today.  He was shaving, the guy sort of made fun of him  because he was making a god awful mess.  He didn't have anywhere to put the cream.  So he was just flicking it on the floor.  And he was shaving repeatedly and there was a lot of shaving  cream and it was hilarious.  And you were thinking, why would this person be doing this  on the train?  And then within about an hour or two, it turned out that he  was homeless and had just gotten out of a homeless shelter.  And he was going to meet, I think his brother and he wanted  to look nice.  And so he was shaving the only place he could.  And you know, it just completely changed the entire  perspective that you had on the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of this is because social media has allowed bad,  people with bad intent to act out so horrifically  that we are now all much more sensitive that any picture  that's posted is the potential for being misused.  All of a sudden we have to be aware of this.  And partly it's because of, I think because of Twitter  and Instagram and Facebook make it so easy to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is how we learn, right?  If there's a, so now I think it's become pretty commonplace  to be irritated or to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all outraged all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, to see it as bad when say somebody is in public  and they overhear someone having a conversation  and then they live tweet the conversation  or they take pictures of them.  There was one, I think on a plane where it seemed  like these two people were getting together.  Like that's an invasion of privacy.  But if you see the purpose of social media  as being to make fun of people who you don't know,  you probably think it's great.  But as soon as you start to think of them as real people  who have lives, then you maybe reconsider.  And I think it is interesting to see the shifting  of kind of the way we look at those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Life is so complicated now.  And by the way, I thought Alex Stamos,  the former Facebook security chiefs,  response to Tim Cook on Twitter should be taken.  Oh, I didn't see it.  Yeah, he says that Apple needs to come clean  about how it blocks ways to provide a more secure  and private way to access apps in China.  Apple absolutely supports the Chinese government  in surveilling its citizens.  Here's the quote.  We don't want the media to create an incentive structure  that ignores treating Chinese citizens  as less deserving of privacy protections  because a CEO is willing to bad mouth the business model  of their primary competitor who uses advertising  to subsidize cheaper devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, cheaper devices, my buttocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google's devices aren't cheaper,  but there are free and cheap Android phones  that are effectively subsidized by the fact  that Google gives away Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he cares about our privacy,  but he doesn't care about the privacy of the Chinese.  Right, so how are we supposed to see that  as some shining moral compass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always am suspicious when people are very sanctimonious  because often the most sanctimonious people  are the ones who are the biggest sinners.  And we've seen that time and time again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm very sanctimonious and I am not a big sinner.  Well, there are exceptions.  My biggest sin is eating an entire package  of Sour Patch Kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's bad.  You're a bad person.  I am.  Actually, the only person you're hurting is yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  And my family who I'm taking the Sour Patch Kids away from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also have to deal with me  when I'm in the sugar high and on the halfway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it like a speed ball for sugar?  Like it's sour and sweet,  so it's like counteracting the sugar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not how it works.  It's a sugar speed ball.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram is here.  He is in charge of digital writing,  whatever that might be,  at the Columbia Journalism Review at CJR.org.  Chief digital writer.  Does that mean you don't write with ink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, exclusively with pixels and ones and zips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're only allowed.  I think it means you cover digital technologies.  Uh-huh, yes.  That'd be my guess.  Yes.  And Stacy Higginbotham,  who only covers internet of things,  little tiny internet of things things.  That's actually not-  Or big ones.  Or big ones.  Stacy, I like your GM vehicle.  Stacy on IOT.  That's an internet of thing device, isn't it?  If it's phone and home.  Yes. Sure is.  Stacy on IOT.com.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  When it comes time to buy a home,  you have, of course, many choices.  Lots of people want to lend you that money  to buy the house.  That's nice.  That's a good feeling.  But there's different experiences involved.  For instance, the big bank where we got our loan.  Lisa and I got our home loan five years ago  for the house we live in today.  First of all, you got to go to the big bank.  And you probably should dress up a little bit.  You look prosperous.  I don't need a loan.  I'm just going to do you a favor and borrow some money.  And then they go, boom.  Here's a stack.  Here's the application.  Go home, do some homework.  And we did.  We were good.  We went, we got all the paperwork,  got the old pay stubs,  got the bank statements from years gone by,  filed it all.  We thought, well, this will be done soon.  Let's go on vacation.  Two months, two months later,  we're still getting requests from the big bank  for more information.  We're on a cruise ship faxing them,  like pay stubs and stuff.  It's crazy.  We finally got the house,  but it was not a good experience.  Fast forward to the 21st century and Quicken Loans,  the number one lender in the country  for the last eight years, according to JD Power  and their customer satisfaction survey.  Number one.  That's made them number one in volume.  They've actually surpassed the big bank as of December.  That's really good news.  It means more people are getting  the great customer experience of Quicken Loans  and Rocket Mortgage.  Rocket Mortgage is their entirely online  mortgage approval process.  You don't have to go to a bank.  You don't have to go to the attic to get paperwork.  You just go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig,  answer a few simple questions.  Within a few minutes,  they'll check your credit  and give you pre-qualified approval.  Boom, just like that.  You choose the loan you want,  the term, the rate, the down payment.  Then within 24 hours, step two,  they'll verify your income, assets, and credit  and give you verified approval.  Now you're as good as a cash buyer.  You go right to the front of the line  when you're buying the house.  The seller says, oh good,  because you have the letter.  It says, see that we got the money.  That's a nice feeling.  There's still a little anxiety though  because rates are going up  and there's some pressure on you  when you're looking at a house to buy now  before the rates go up  and it costs you lots more.  That's where Rocket Mortgage really kicks into gear.  Once you're verified,  you qualify for their all new exclusive  rate shield approval.  They'll lock that rate for up to three months  while you shop, up to 90 days.  It can't go up.  Rates can go down and your rate will go down,  but if the rates go up, yours stays the same.  Either way, you'll win  and that's exactly what makes Rocket Mortgage  and Quicken Loans the best lender in the country.  To get started, it's easy.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.

Just remember this.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  They've really transformed the lending process.  Check them out today.  Are you ready?  You wanna do a little, actually before we do the change log,  I had mentioned a few weeks ago  it was the 10th anniversary of Android.  Actually the HTC One, the Google phone,  came out, the G1, on October 22nd, so 2008.  So there were a number of posts.  I have that G1.  I bought it, I was very excited  and then as everyone else was,  very disappointed by that first Android device.  Can you still use it?  I guess it has a proprietary charging port.  I'd have to find the weird,  all those days all those phones were weird.  You know, there's a weird Nokia,  those things you plug in.  It didn't have a headphone jack.  The main reason it wasn't any good is not Android.  The phone was very underpowered.  It was very slow.  Or maybe it was Android.  They had the on-screen keyboard  and the multi-touch, it had a physical keyboard.  They had apps.  No, they didn't have apps.  No, they didn't have an on-screen keyboard.  No, they didn't have multi-touch.  You know what else they didn't have?  They didn't have a headphone jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  That's very forward looking.  Yeah, right?  They were way ahead of the times there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But over time, Android got better and better.  Here's Cupcake 1.5.  This is a fun walk down memory lane from the verge.  Cupcake added the ability to cut and paste.  That turns out to be a hard thing to do  on a mobile device, I guess.  Windows Phone didn't have it for a long time.  The on-screen keyboard that arrived in 1.5.  The extensible widgets, video capture and playback.  Android 1.6 Donut.  Remember that?  Then Eclair 2.0.  Yep, Eclair.  There you go.  Eclair was a complete redesign of how it looked  and it had, according to the verge and unheard of,  854 by 480 display.  Wow.  Wow.  That was interesting.  The Motorola Droid.  I did not like the Droids.  Multiple account support.  Wow, I didn't realize it had been around that long  since 2.0.  Wow.  Google Maps Navigation came out in 2.0.  Live Wallpapers, Speech to Text.  Then there was Froyo,  because remember they're all desserts, 2.2.  Gingerbread, 2.3.  An approved keyboard, better battery,  and app management, front-facing cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't Android give us the battery indicator?  Yes.  As I just imagined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're good.  That's exactly right.  That was in Gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was their thing.  Was that in Gingerbread or was that earlier?  I think it was earlier, right?  Scroll back up through those pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gingerbread helped make that a little easier to fix  with a new bundled utility  for graphically viewing battery drain over time.  That was in Gingerbread 2.3.  Honeycomb.  Honeycomb was designed for tablets, I remember,  and did not work very well.  That came out with that Nexus 7.  That was the seven-inch tablet I was talking about.  Honeycomb was an interim ice cream sandwich  was the real deal, 4.0.  Now we're getting to kind of something that looks like  the real Android that we're used to.  Face unlock, Android Beam.  Here's the, to go with the battery drain indicators,  here's data usage analysis.  It's funny if you look at this,  there's a lot of this stuff Apple's added recently.  And touts.  Like face unlock.  Yeah, face unlock was, not that it worked,  but you could do it.  Theoretically, it was possible.  It was in there.  It's the thought that counts.  Jelly Bean, 4.1.  4.2 Jelly Bean.  4.3 Jelly Bean.  Then there was Kit Kat.  October 2013.  Has it been that long?  Wow, Kit Kat 4.4.  Well, I can go on, but there's a very nice,  if you want to go down the Android memory lane,  they even have little videos from Google I.O.  Look at the first Android Wear watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That thing is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's big on a big wrist.  I can't even imagine it.  Just like, that's a huge, it's Android the giant marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy 10th to Google Android.  A sweet decade of Android and Google's own blog  had its little memory.  Oh, you know what?  It looks like most of that Verge article  was taken straight from Google's blog.  We'll all be diggity-danged.  There's the Nexus 7 tablet.  I still use my Nexus 7.  I have two of them.  It's quite useful.  I only run one program on it.  Oh, they had boarding passes in Jelly Bean.  What's the program?  That must be Google Now, right?  Is that, yeah.  Google Now started in Jelly Bean.  So now we know it takes, how many,  four Android versions to kill something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sigh.  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the program you run on your tablet?  The one.  The one in front of me?  It's this thing.  You said you have two and you only run one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I wrote a little Android,  what do they call the,  the Android. An APK?  Yeah, it's an APK, but I made it with a very simplified  Android programming environment.  And it does one thing only, which is time my radio shows.  So as the time goes by, it counts me down to the next ad.  And it turns out this is,  the Nexus 7 is a perfect size for it.  So it just, there it is.  It's just, cause it's big, it's big numbers  and it's just counting me down.  And when I get to zero, then it's time to do a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I had, I just thought you went by feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not here.  By here it's feel is exactly right.  Radio shows, network.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So actually I was doing it wrong.  I was in a commercial.  Now I'm green, which means I can talk.  I have 547 seconds.  And then, and then it's radio, commercial radio.  In fact, if anybody wonders why our shows go on so damn long,  why I talk about the same thing over and over again,  it's because I never was allowed to  for 40 years in broadcasting.  So I'm a rebel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just did all these thoughts,  just stored up in his brain.  I just wanna talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How long did it take you to write that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not very long.  What was the name of the, it was,  MIT took it over.  Six months.  Oh God, no.  If you saw the code,  here, I'll show you the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure it was like an afternoon or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Barely, because it's mostly one big if then,  if then else thing, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only programming I do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  App builder it's called.  Actually, I still do some, I do some coding.  I love coding.  It's always been a good hobby.  Is this it?  No, that's a dumb,  that's a,  that's the base.  Maybe,  this can't be it because this is like demo code,  but it's, that's what it looks like.  But you don't usually write it in that,  you write it with the app builder app.  MIT took this over.  And then, so this is the APK,  it's a megabytes, pretty small.  I put it, it's nice and small and easy to run on a  10 year old, whatever that is, tablet.  But it's very useful.  And the thing is, it goes all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The radio shows only on Saturday and Sunday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but this goes all the time.  It's always, it's always.  It never stops.  Never stops counting down the minutes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, at least you can count on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something you can count on.  Let's just leave this right here.  This is, ironically, this is actually bigger  and maybe even more useful than the Home Hub.  There you go.  That'll give us some idea.  Yeah.  There's me and my wife.  Does it have a counter feature?  No.  You know what?  If I could get that app on this, then I'd be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I smell a challenge.  Mm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you run apps on the Home Hub?  I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's running, it's running cast.  It's Chromecast, right?  Cast, so.  I guess you could do it, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somehow.  Let me have a look into that.  That'd be interesting.  So Google has made some changes,  which we will start talking about right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite 2001 of Space Odyssey, but here it is.  What's new from Google?  And this is a big one.  It's not in response to Tim Cook,  but if somebody brings up Tim Cook,  it's a good thing to mention.  This is in the Keyword Blog.  Ed Moralia writing,  Director of Product Management,  Privacy and Data Protection Office.  They are gonna make it easier for you to,  they say this is part of an overall plan  to make it easier for you to make decisions  about your data directly within the Google products  you use every day, but it's starting with search.  You see in this animation,  you go to the settings of search and there is a new entry.  I don't see it yet, but presumably it will be coming  to all Google devices called Your Data in Search,  in which you can then go down and delete your data,  control your data, see what Google knows about you.  See, this is, to me, as long as Google is transparent  about what they collect and gives you these kinds of things,  now you might be cynical and say,  well, they're only doing it because of GDPR.  Well, fine, if that's the case, fine.  But they're-  Regulation works.  Yeah, they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the threat of regulation works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you can see what searches you made.  You can delete search activity.  You can decide what search activity is saved.  Coming to Maps, too.  Yes, eventually it sounds like they plan  to put it in every Google application.  We're always working on making it easier for you  to understand and control your data  so you can make privacy choices that are right for you.  Earlier this year, we launched a new Google account  experience that puts your privacy  and security front and center.  We updated our privacy policy with videos  and clearer language.  Today, we're making it easier for you to make decisions  about your data directly within search.  So I don't think it was in response to Tim Cook, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I imagine they've been working on it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I think you probably have been.  More 4K, I'm grateful to Google.  Apple did this when they released the 4K Apple TV.  Google is now upgrading your movies  that you've purchased on Google Play to 4K for free,  even if you originally bought it in SD or HD.  Of course, the movie has to be available in 4K.  They're also lowering the prices on 4K titles.  Is that because nobody cares enough to update their 4K?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that because nobody cares enough  to update their 4K on their own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that would be the cynical interpretation.  But I think the real interpretation  is that more people have 4K TVs.  In fact, you'd be hard pressed to buy a new TV,  even a cheap TV that isn't 4K.  So it just makes sense.  They updated the app on Samsung, LG and Vizio TVs.  They will automatically support 4K if those are 4K TVs.  And you can use-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you bought it in SD when there was an HD alternative?  Because sometimes when I buy-  Well, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say, even if you originally bought the movie in SD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, sometimes you're like,  ah, I'm really only buying this to watch on my tablet.  So then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you that's so unusual.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I the only cheap person in the universe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You save a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it is so worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about a new course to teach people  about fairness in machine learning?  My daughter actually has been doing her thesis on this.  And we all know that machine learning can be highly biased  if it's trained with limited samples, right?  If you only train face recognition with Caucasians,  it's gonna be a terrible job with African-Americans.  So here's the question.  What do you see?  Bananas, stickers, or bananas on shelves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stickers.  There are stickers on all the bananas, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So students who complete this training  will learn how biases might affect this.  People asked to describe a photo of bananas  may not say yellow bananas,  because those of us in the US,  and I bet in Australia too, that's all we see, right?  Fair point.  But in many parts of the world,  yellow is not a common color for banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're pink.  No, they're green.  They're pink.  They're green.  They're green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Orange.  I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have never, ever heard of this.  That's like how I felt when I heard that wombats poop cubes.  I was like, what?  Perfect cubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wombats poop cubes.  Now we're going down a whole different road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, non-sequitur, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do, but yes.  But bananas are often better than ours too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to recognize bananas  and you don't make distinctions about the colors,  you might not ever recognize those bananas,  the red or the green.  Those are plantains.  You might not recognize those,  because you go, no, no, no, no,  every banana I've ever seen is yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are plantains different than bananas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're related.  I know they're related, but-  They're both banana-y.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I have no faith in this discussion anymore.  That's all I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will tell you though, I do know this for a fact.  Look at that, red.  There's a pink banana.  The variety of banana that we get in North America-  Is a monoculture.  A particular strain.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a monoculture.  They are clones and they're dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And they're politically incorrect.  We need new bananas.  Their history and the dual corporations history  is horrific.  So, okay.  Google is a bad company sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has told its employees in an internal memo  that references to sex acts are no longer allowed  in workplace documents or short URLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And was that a big problem or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking if they had to make a policy,  it might've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess maybe it was.  By the way-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just file out other things you shouldn't have to say.  Shouldn't have to say.  Cavendish, yes, sorry.  Yes.  Catrim said Cavendish.  Cavendish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should never have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you want to talk about Bloomberg at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, yes, but let's finish the changelog.  I'm just looking in.  Okay, sorry, I'm sorry.  All Kiwis.  All Kiwi schools get a license to Chrome.  And you get a license to Chrome.  And you get a license to Chrome.  I thought we were still talking about fruit.  Yes, we could be.  Why do the Kiwis-  As part of an agreement  with the New Zealand Ministry of Education,  all state and state integrated schools across New Zealand  can claim ministry funded Chrome education licenses  to manage and use, I don't know.  Google, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like the Google or the-  They made a deal.  Yeah, they made a deal with the  Federal Department of Education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They made a deal.  Free to you, maybe not to Kiwis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm nothing against the Kiwis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing.  How about a better way to share your ETA with Google Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm down for that, voluntarily, through my texts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought you'd do that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it.  After you've started navigating to a destination,  tap the up arrow button,  and then on the share trip progress,  you'll be able to share your live location,  route and ETA with all your favorite contacts.  This is Android and iOS.  Today's update also allows for sharing across  third party apps like Facebook, Messenger, Line,  WhatsApp, and more.  So they can-  Ah.  You don't have to just give them maps.  I've always liked that feature.  We've watched people who are late to the show.  We've watched them drive up here.  I think it was Robert Scoble who was the first  to discover that feature in iOS,  and we watched him speed the whole way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he make it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not so quickly that we weren't able to,  on the air live, watch him come here and park.  And drive way above the speed limit.  He must have been driving one of them GM cars.  And that's your Google Change Log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  IT'S A GOOSEBERRY

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First the kiwi was originally known as the  Chinese gooseberry.  Yes, the kiwi fruit.  It is a gooseberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not the kiwi people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, no, they were not known as the Chinese gooseberries.  Those Chinese gooseberries down under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, I really want to call people Chinese gooseberries.  I'm like, oh, that's kind of like a loving thing.  A kiwi fruit is a gooseberry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but much like rapeseed oil,  they realized no one would buy it  if they didn't rename it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I use this often as an example with my kids  of the importance of marketing,  and particularly naming.  I think the Vikings did that with Greenland  because they were trying to get people to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and you know that...  No green anywhere.  It's green.  Well, they made the mistake of calling Iceland Iceland  and no one went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one went there, exactly.  Yeah, that's why no one went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's another example.  This, the Patagonian toothfish.  No one would really want that unless you named it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chilean sea bass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In which case it'd be delicious.  Delicious Patagonian toothfish  to go with your Chinese gooseberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mahi mahi was originally, it's a type of dolphin,  but it's not the cute kind.  The good dolphin.  But they didn't want to use the word dolphin.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Probably mahi mahi means bad dolphin in Hawaiian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other dolphin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other dolphin, the one you can eat.  The edible dolphin.  What makes mahi mahi okay to eat then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds good.  It's not, they're not under threat.  Like it's a type of, it's not even a dolphin really.  I don't even know why it's called that.  I don't name things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now I'm not going to want to ever eat mahi mahi again.  Let's look here.  No, it's not a dolphin.  It's a fish.  It's the pompano dolphin fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it has dolphin in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or Dorado.  Actually I've seen it as a Dorado.  Oh, it comes from the Hawaiian language.  Very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It means very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very strong.  Very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, is it that strong though, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It isn't closely related to dolphins.  It's just called the dolphin fish, but it's not related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're a fugly looking fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  In Malta, they call them the lampuka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also a bad name.  Put that on the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have lampuka for dinner, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  You know what?  I'm going to get you out of here fast because Stacey is faint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm focused.  Well, I'm reading now about mahi mahi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you see the rat holes we get into.  Are you getting one of them rhodomatics?  We still haven't really decided who's getting the rhodomatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  They've offered me a review unit, so I can take one  if you really want me to do a tortilla analysis.  What's a rhodomatic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an automated rhodomaker.  Now I would buy an automated Montreal bagel maker, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Montreal bagels?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  This is her ad?  Let's tuck it into the bagel thing.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She doesn't know from bagels.  She's in Austinite.  When do you move to Seattle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  June.  You'll hear a lot more coming in  because I've got a whole thing.  What?  Whoa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, Matthew, I tweeted this and I told people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you read Twitter religiously?  And if you miss something, go back and look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I blocked Stacey at one point.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why.  Is it my insults to Canadians?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel so righteous when I say what I don't read Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is going on?  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I move into Seattle in June  because I've wanted to live there for a while.  And because I've lived in Austin for 20 years  and it's time to get out of here.  But you have that great house.  I do.  I'll have a great house elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So have you started house hunting or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to rent for a year.  That is wise.  We're going to rent on Bainbridge Island.  Oh, I love Bainbridge Island.  We're going to see if we're island people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have family there.  Excellent.  Bainbridge is a nice island because it has a bridge.  And looking at an island that doesn't have a bridge.  It's risky, man.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seattle's great.  Yeah, it's a beautiful area.  We may end up up there with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Twig studio could move?  Oh no, you'd be retired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think this is not exactly a job  one retires from.  Because basically it involves sitting in a chair  and talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, are you going to keel over in your chair?  I do not want to be on the air for that.  I'm going to feel terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be great.  I want to die in the saddle, so to speak.  Retired.  Or the Dr. Evil chair, as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He retired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What am I going to retire?  What am I going to retire to?  Sitting in a chair and talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sitting in a chair and not talking on the TV.  Just talking to nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just talking to nobody?  Does that sound like fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, all right.  Yeah, you're going to have a Facebook live stream.  People doing it at several.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told Stacey, get the Rotimatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Heston Q used once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hanging on the rack.  Looks pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could probably sell it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with it is,  A, just as you said,  who doesn't know how to use a pan?  B, it's all designed around  videos and recipes on the iPad or the tablet.  So you say, oh, I want to make stew.  Now you have to watch a whole video and the thing.  And then, because you can manually control that burner,  but it does things.  It's got a mind of its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give it to, do both of your kids know how to cook?  Because that's who you should give it to.  Someone who doesn't know how to cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of, it would be like a hot plate  without being a hot plate, right?  Cause it's an induction burner.  An $800 hot plate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to add insult to injury,  that pretty much the same timeframe,  I bought the Facebook portals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you did?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew will test them out with you.  Daddy will, see?  He doesn't care about privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's like, yeah, listen in on my radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook, come to my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to get a Huawei portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got the P20.  Get the Huawei portal.  You already have it, my friend.  Our show today.  Oh, our show today brought to you by DigitalOcean.  I am a DigitalOcean fan.  DigitalOcean is one of those companies  you may not have heard of.  I guess if you're a developer,  or you're a startup, you have.  But I think a lot of people don't know about DigitalOcean  because it's one of those things  that is really making a huge difference.  It is an innovation engine for the modern times.  And here's why I say that.  Back when my friend Kevin Rose started Digg,  the long lamented, late lamented Digg,  I remember him, he had to buy a colo server  and then buy a server.  He had to go to the colo, put the server in.  He had to configure it.  He had to set it up.  And then he had one server that could run Digg.  Fast forward to 2018.  If you've got an idea for a technology to change the world,  if you've got an app that you wanna put online,  a website you wanna put online,  if you wanna learn how to make apps or websites,  if you wanna play with ideas,  do what we call nowadays a minimum viable product,  DigitalOcean not only makes it easy,  makes it very affordable.  It is powering the transformation of the world, I think.  And I love it.  So what is DigitalOcean?  It's the industry leader in cloud platforms.  Makes it easy to deploy, manage and scale applications.  What you do is you create a droplet.  See, you get a droplet in the ocean.  You create a droplet.  And that droplet is basically a provisioned server  that'll be ready for you to use in a minute  in any way you want with 99.99% uptime.  And they've got an SLA for that, cloud firewalls.  You get monitoring, you get alerting,  you get a full DNS management.  You get a public IP address that you can then use  with your domain name if you want.  You get enterprise SSDs.  Very easy to use API.  So 150,000 businesses, including some of the world's  fastest growing startups, have been using DigitalOcean  to get their first minimum viable product up,  to create a product without a whole lot of cost.  And I mean, when I mean affordable,  it starts at $5 a month.  So I, in fact, I'm gonna, let me just,  I'll show you real quickly.  I like to do this on the show.  I'm gonna set up a droplet.  I have three droplets running right now.  Total of $7.90.  I mean, that's what we're talking about.  Let me show you how easy it is to create a droplet.  You could choose an image.  So if you just say, oh, look, I want an Ubuntu running  or a FreeBSD running ZFS or Fedora or Debian or CentOS.  You can even select the version,  which is really pretty amazing.  I like to run a really stable Debian 8.1, right?  So that could be it.  But you could also use containers.  Or let's say, you know, I wanna do some node programming.  I want node.js.  I'm gonna write a node application.  So all I do is I say, okay, I'm gonna create a node.js.  It'll be running on Ubuntu 1804.  I want, I'm gonna do it cheap, $5 a month or 0.007 cents  an hour.  That gives me a virtual CPU, 25 gigs of storage,  a terabyte of transfer, plenty for an MVP.  I always enable backups in case I do something good.  Choose your server all over the world.  Frankfurt, London, Singapore, Amsterdam,  Toronto, Bangalore, New York.  I always choose San Francisco, because it's nearby.  I like it with the SSH key.  See, I can use my SSH key to log in.  That's very handy.  They got IPv6 private networking, lots more stuff.  Name it, Leo's node.  Watch this, I am gonna create my droplet.  This is literally provisioning a server  that's gonna be very inexpensive  and ready to use in about a minute.  It's a great way to create your first website,  to learn how to write code,  to create a minimum viable application  for your new startup.  This is what's transforming the world, in my opinion.  I love DigitalOcean.  I love what this means for entrepreneurs.  You could choose from standard  or CPUs optimized droplets, customized from there.  They now have volumes.  It's easy to add volumes.  So if you need more storage, it's easy to get.  Oh, it's done.  I now have a node server running at this address.  It's really awesome.  I can log into it via SSH.  I can start writing my node code right now.  Fantastic.  Say hi to 138.68.17.123.  do.co slash twit.  It's gonna get even more affordable right now.  If you go to do.co slash twit,  we're gonna give you a free $100 credit.  That's gonna give you quite a lot of time  to play with this for free.  And it integrates with everything you're already using.  do.co slash twit, a free $100 credit.  I always tell students, get an account at DigitalOcean  so that when you start learning how to code,  you can do it in a real world environment.  You can even invite your friends to use your new site.  And for businesses too, it's a great way to get started  without having to buy server hardware  or wait for provisioning days at a time.  do.co slash twit, a $100 credit right now at DigitalOcean.  Love DigitalOcean.

Transcript:  I wanna read an item from the Bainbridge Island  police blotter, can I do that?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Random selection.  A person or persons yet unknown  forced their way into a pasture on Island Center Road  and stole a horse exercise ball  while several of the animals were present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we read the local paper, it is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are no suspects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But somebody's got an illicit horse exercise ball  in their living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that like a normal exercise ball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so, but larger probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I was like, wait, what is a horse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe somebody just needed a really big one  and that's, they couldn't think of how else to get.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is an island, you wouldn't wanna have to drive off  to order something and there is no prime now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no prime?  Oh, there's no prime now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no prime now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, cause there is a bridge,  so you do get deliveries and stuff.  Yes, yes.  Like I said, my aunt and uncle live there and they love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, ScooterX says his business partner lives there.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My late uncle also lived there.  He built one of those log, you might as well do this.  He got a Lindell Cedar home,  one of those log homes that they built it himself.  Oh, there's the exercise ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's art.  Oh, is that art?  Okay.  I think so, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he was in the CIA and he retired to Bainbridge Island.  There's a complaint against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel safer already.  Yeah.  One of the councilmen, improper conduct,  because he called a hotel owner a liar seven times.  You saw?  A liar.  Televised council meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he challenge him to a duel afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is where you want to live, I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't, but my family really does  and it gets me closer to the Pacific Northwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll get tired of it pretty quick.  You don't want to live there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.  You want to live in Seattle, don't you?  You want to live in town.  I'm a little more urban than the rest of my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll go live there with them.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said there's good kayaking.  There is good kayaking,  but it's only during certain months of the year.  It's like Canada, actually.  What am I saying?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just Canada.  Do they get ice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm sure they do.  I think they might get ice, but not like,  it doesn't stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay, then it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not like you get a week of ice or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's an island though, so you do get a lot of power outages  and internet outages.  So I'm going to have two internet service providers,  both Comcast, who serves the area,  and a local DSL provider.  And a windmill?  And also a windmill.  And a little hamster on a wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to give you a chance.  We have talked a lot about the Bloomberg Super Micro story.  We've gone back and forth.  Each of our hosts,  well, no, but I would actually love your take on this.  Each of our hosts has widely differing opinions.  Steve Gibson and I feel like Bloomberg  didn't make this up,  but we've had people like Andy Iannacco and Greg Farrow  on Twitter just as recently as Sunday say it's bollocks  and that Tim Cook and Amazon's demands for retractions  are right and Bloomberg should retract the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt?  I mean, you know, Bloomberg,  it's not like this just showed up on some guy's blog, right?  I mean, Bloomberg has been around for a while  and they know what they're doing.  Like they, so that's my first starting point.  So obviously there's something going on,  but, and they claim they have 17 different sources,  but the denials that we've seen,  like typically you get denials that are super vague.  These are extremely detailed and explicit denials.  You know, denials of every single alleged fact,  denials that any company is under a gag order.  So if even if it was a top secret investigation,  denials that are so specific,  writing letters to Congress saying it's not true,  like that's not something you do if there's any truth to it.  So then you have a source,  one of the only named sources says,  well, I sketched out a hypothetical way  that this could happen  and the facts all match identically with my hypothetical.  So that makes me nervous.  And then there's a guy who writes a blog  all about network architecture and servers.  I don't know him,  but he did a five page analysis of the description  that Bloomberg gave and said,  it's not only not plausible,  in some cases it's functionally impossible  for the things to do,  the things they described doing things to do those things.  And even if you wanted to do those things,  you wouldn't do them in that way.  You would do them through software  or through different types of chips.  And so I just have this huge,  you know, it's not that I don't trust Bloomberg, I do,  but it just feels wrong in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's the question is if it is,  you know, and you've got John Mechelthwaite,  their editor in chief.  And by the way, I talked to Mark Millian  who writes at Bloomberg Business Week,  a couple of Twits ago.  He said Mechelthwaite was involved in this story  from its inception two years ago.  This goes back to Obama administration sources  as well as Trump administration sources two years ago.  And Mechelthwaite is highly respected in the industry.  He said he was very much involved  in vetting these sources and vetting this story.  So to me, it's a great puzzlement.  Now, somebody told me-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we need more.  So Eric Wemple at the Washington Post wrote  something about it in which he said,  Bloomberg has to come up with more.  They have to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one would think that if it's a true story,  others will come up with more as well, right?  Somebody will have one of these motherboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Theoretically.  Well, yeah, because I mean,  the second we saw that Bloomberg story,  everybody called everybody they knew to try to follow this.  I mean, and while there are very few  hardcore enterprise server type reporters out there,  they still do exist.  And I even called some people I know  and talked to them about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess on the other hand,  I would expect none of these companies to admit it.  Not only is it bad for business,  it's probably they're under gag order.  I mean, it's very likely that the intelligence community  has told everybody under no circumstances  are you to tell anybody that this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's why I would have expected  the denounce to be a lot more general.  And we would have followed up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, I just, I was reading Seymour Hersh's biography,  right, just actually two weeks ago.  And one of the astonishing things  that still remains true to this day is once you pull,  once you pull the thread, the sweater unravels,  once someone starts talking,  even when people are trying to shut that person up-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, usually the more comes out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's not happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just-  And yeah, I do not believe that Mikkel Thwait  and the two reporters involved are lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, of course not, no, of course not.  But I'm wondering whether they talked to guys like this  source who gave them hypotheticals,  and they built a story around things  that their sources have not actually seen,  that they have heard about.  And that's always the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sticking.  It's hearsay, and so less reliable.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sticking with my,  their touch in the back of the rhinoceros.  They think it's rhinoceros,  but it's really an elephant, or however I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly, yeah.  And the other thing which I've always said,  whoever you believe is that it is an issue,  these things do happen.  Every security expert says, you know,  however it happens, whether in software,  at the factory, in transit, it happens.  We do it, they do it.  And it's a big problem because you can't ever be assured  that trust is a huge part of modern life.  And as these machines that we use every day  in every context are more and more complex,  we have to trust them more and more.  And this fact, that's why this article's important  and why this debate is important,  because it sounds like whether you believe  the facts about super micro, these are not.  These dread vices are no longer trustworthy,  and they are everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that's why we need more detail.  Yeah. We need.  We do. You know.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I'm glad, no, hey,  Columbia Journalism Review, long-standing journalist.  You actually went to J-School when there were typewriters.  I wanted to hear what Matthew Ingram had to say about this,  so I'm glad you brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the typewriters, Matthew,  that really changes how I view journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, that's when journalism was hard.  Oh, Pish-tosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew, do you have a pick of the week,  anything you want to share with us  before we wrap this puppy up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found something, it's in the rundown.  It's the, you can watch a PowerPoint presentation  about how the White Walkers use their Chromebooks  to communicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, the White Walkers, you mean from Game of Thrones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a presentation about how they do recruiting  for the White Walkers, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is actually an ad from Google.  It's very persuasive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  White Walkers make a slide,  the Night King is making a slide presentation.  Not PowerPoint, you said PowerPoint, but let's be fair.  Oh, sorry, it's slides.  This is Google Slides, yeah.  You don't need PowerPoint, you can use the iceberg font.  Winter is year.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cold is ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute, he's using Lightroom on a Chromebook?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is pretty funny.  We need this today, says the Night King.  White Walker, I'm on it.  Night King, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to work together, build armies,  collaborate, destroy walls, manage teams,  conquer Westeros, your Chromebook.  But I missed that, how they did Lightroom.  Maybe that was Lightroom in Android.  Chromebook.com slash White Walkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very good, I like it.  Nice.  Stacey, what's your pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well, I can show you Whisper Mode if you want to hear,  if you want it, it's a little creepy.  Or I can show you, I went to an event,  I was a speaker at an event, and it was for JBL actually.  But as part of that, Chris Turkstra,  who is the head of Google Assistant was there.  And I asked him, because this has long bothered me,  why all the different Google Assistant voices  were called things like Cyan and Scarlet,  no not Scarlet, Red.  They're not called by names.  They're not called by names, they're called by colors.  I currently use Cyan, which is a male voice.  And so I was like, hey, what's up with that?  And he said that they did not want to offend anyone.  It's a fraught topic for gender identification  for nationalities and ethnicities.  So they just went with colors.  And I was like, huh.  And the reason I saw myself saying Scarlet  is he said some colors have names or have gender.  So they don't use that either.  So they don't use that either.  Which I was like, hey, that's actually kind of nice to know.  Smart.  And it's not a pick, it's just information  I picked up talking to someone and I thought-  That's why I don't mind if they spy on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because they're good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For now.  For now.  I think some people there are really awesome,  just like the whole spectrum of humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where do I choose the, where can I see the colors?  Yeah, I'm seeing, I'm in the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You, I don't know.  I've got, you can hear mine if you want.  Let's bring this guy over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to hear Whisper too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay.  Who do you want first?  Do you want to hear Cyan or Whisper?  Whisper first.  What's the point of Whisper?  I'll tell you why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if you have a child and you want your Amazon Echo  to sing a lullaby as she goes to sleep-  Got it, got it.  You don't want the, and I actually have had this problem  with the Google Home because I use it to set alarms.  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're about to spoil my thunder, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like at six in the morning, you know, I want to say,  don't forget to wake me up at 8.30.  Right, right.  So I say, hey, wake me up at 8.30.  And it goes, okay, I'm setting alarms  for 8.30 in the morning, argh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, I don't know.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, forgive me everyone who has a matinee.  Set alarm for 10 a.m.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's so quiet, we can't hear her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You couldn't hear that?  My mic was right there, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, did she say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cancel alarm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  10 a.m. alarm, cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you hear it?  Yeah, it's creepy.  So quiet, all I heard was-  It is really quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I was trying to turn it up and then I realized,  oh, that doesn't actually work.  It's whisper mode, yeah.  So if you whisper to her, she will whisper to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.  And the way you turn that on is you just say,  what, you say echo, whisper mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, this is the most important thing.  I can't believe I forgot it, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I get a Stacy mode in my echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I want Stacy.  I don't think everyone's prepared for that.  Okay, this, to enable it,  all you have to do is whisper at her.  Oh. That's it.  You don't have to say enable it.  She's gonna say, hey, I think you're whispering at me.  Do you wanna enable whisper mode?  And you say, yes.  And this is one of the first,  and you guys, you're gonna hear me talk about this a lot  in the near future because Amazon is actually putting,  as part of reInvent coming up,  a session on voice-based programming.  It's for serverless, so kind of nerdy,  but the point is we are gonna be soon in a world  of voice-based programming and we're implementing.  Like, if you look at Amazon,  they are implementing all the infrastructure needed for that.  Not all, but some of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems like a really nice way to implement these things  instead of having to know what it is and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they did it,  they showed it off at the Amazon event.  They showed off a smart plug.  And that's part of why the ACK, the Madame A Connect Kit,  I can't say her name, I'm sorry.  The A Connect Kit module is still-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Echo, just use Echo instead of A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's because if you use it and you put it  in your product and you use Amazon's wireless connectivity,  they have a word for it,  and I can't think of what it's called.  You basically plug it in and Madame A says,  hey, I see a new smart plug.  Do you want to put this in a room?  That's how it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you say, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she's like, hey, what room is it?  And you're like, kitchen.  And she's like, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like a real assistant.  Yes.  Like a dumb robot. It's so awesome.  By the way, I have video of the whisper mode being recorded.  I don't know if you saw this.  Do you have my sound?  Oh, she's saying quiet whispery things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this an ASMR video?  Is this Cardi B does ASMR?  Yes.  Yes, it is.  Bingo, you win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa, I'm so sad that you can't hear it though.  That's ASMR.  Why does she have two different mics?  Well, you've got left and you've got right.  Okay.  And she's not afraid to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is so weird.  And I think I introduced you guys all about ASMR  way back in the day.  Are you into it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My daughter is, she actually listens to it.  I picked up her headphones and I was like,  hey, what'd you listen to?  And she's like, and I'm like, what is this?  And she's like, oh, it's my ASMR noise.  And I was like.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what does it do for her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does she find it relaxing or?  She's super anxious.  So it makes her feel like while she does her homework.  I used to when I was young,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  some people when they talked  would put me in a kind of altered state.  And I think that's what ASMR was originally kind of about  is that there's almost a hypnotic mode of talking  and a sound.  It doesn't have to be whisper.  This is where I think they've gone wrong with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's supposed to enable this sensory chill.  This sensory.  It was a weird feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like, yeah, it was like.  And it felt good.  But I've never been able to recapture that.  Maybe I should listen to some Cardi B.  Bob Ross does that for me.  Bob Ross is very much that.  See, he's not whispering, but he's very gentle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very relaxed.  Very relaxed.  Did you ever read about why he talks like that?  No.  So he was in the army and he got yelled at a lot.  And so when he got out,  he decided that he would never ever raise his voice ever.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I am going to do the same thing for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would be terrible at that.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be great.  I'd be like, oh guys.  Oh guys.  It'll be so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little weird.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I am going to release the staff and crew  of the good ship Twig.  And let them fly free.  According to proposition 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if I just limp off with my broken toe?  Do you have a broken toe too?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What'd you do?  I don't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I break my toe all the time.  Once every year or two, I break my toe.  You stub it on something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just for fun or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it gets caught on something and then it just snaps.  Oh my God.  It's usually when I'm stepping into my pants.  I'll just be honest.  It's really just terrifying.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  I tore my toe up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's still.  And now just so that you don't think we were lying.  Here is a wombat.  And here is wombat poop.  It's cubic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it is kinda rounded cubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a cube exactly.  Not a cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not, yeah, it's not exactly.  I think by describing it as a cube,  you gave it some, maybe some.  Fake news.  Fake news.  Wombats are adorable.  Look at the wombat.  I love them.  Oh my God.  I had a wombat encounter in Tasmania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Last time I was on you showed.  Yeah, I love my wombat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a Tasmanian devil too, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I showed them both, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those are not cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those look like.  No, those aren't cute, but wombats are.  Although womats can tear right in your flesh actually.  He's grooming, I think.  An interesting point, that butt, it has a bone.  It's almost like a helmet.  And to avoid being eaten alive,  wombats will dive into their hole.  Only their butt will protrude and it's armored.  And they can't be eaten.  However, I've been told by Australians,  that makes them a very poor form of roadkill  because it feels like you just hit a bowling ball.  What?  So what was going on with the thought that was in the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why was that woman starting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some sort of wombat ASMR.  I don't think we need to investigate any further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then there was like a funnel or something.  What is happening in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's demonstrating why wombat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their cubes poop?  Yes.  Why they poop cubes?  Is it their intestinal shape?  That's why it looks the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently there's a physics reason for it.  Got you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh God.  I really love this show.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You learned so much in this show.  I can check that out later.  Check it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Check it.  Learn more about wombats.  Visit your local public library, Matthew.  Google play the wombat poop video.  Isn't that sad that people no longer have to go  to the library to learn anything?  They can just Google it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, my daughter's a teacher.  It gives her, they have to have X number  of print sources for their papers.  That's crazy talk.  Well, what is really crazy to me is we get the New Yorker.  So I'm like, oh, let me, let me go.  But I don't keep the issues.  So she doesn't count unless it's in paper format.  So when she goes to the New Yorker website,  which I'm like, that's the same text.  Yeah.  I'm like, that's, that's a little iffy.  How old is this teacher?  Is it my age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it typing class?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
