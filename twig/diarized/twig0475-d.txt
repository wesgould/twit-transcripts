Hello Stacey  Hello y'all coming to us from Dallas, Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed home of well, I don't know what it's over the Cowboys and the Texas State Fair. It's almost state fair time  I bet this deep fried sneakers sneakers  Snickers. Oh, I'm sure they'll deep-fry a sneaker if you ask deep-fried sneakers would be delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can be proud most anything it'd be good  also with this her partner in crime Kevin Tofel part of the iot podcast and  editor-in-chief at about Chromebooks calm and a freshman in college  Sort of sort of sort of yeah. I Kevin. Yeah great cameras talents before the show. He's taken some courses at the local  JC in computer science, that's really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know what it's it's good I think to know how to code a little bit  I think everybody should at least try it. But you know what if you like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really like the best most fun thing you could ever do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean 90% of what you make you actually is broken and then you spend the other 10%  And it's honestly if you like to problem solve and your logic  Kind it's awesome. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I recently learned what currying is and how to create  Specifications for functions using lambda because I'm all about functional programming

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  functional programs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's already singing it's so much fun  anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not we could talk about that. I actually would not mind talking about that, but  That probably is a little bit esoteric for most people let's talk about very IOT centric though is it it is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you think about serverless and ways to cheaply perform  Basically trigger actions for IOT stuff. That is all functional programming does and one advantage functional program is kind of coming back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know if it was it was all the rage in the 50s  1950s  But it lost some of its gloss during the AI winter because of course Lisp was a big AI language and  People turn to imperative languages for their power like C and C++  but  It also that was part of the reason we have so many flaws and exploits and problems  And now that we're in almost every case not so much IOT I guess but almost every other case doing multi  Core processing and multi threaded computer program people are returning to functional because it's really good for an  Environment where you can't predict you know which core is going to be active when what threads gonna be working when and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so I shouldn't be taking this for training class. That's what you stay away from the old for today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you're taking a Java class which is cool because you can do functional programming  In Java with something called closure  Kalo Jure and closure script for JavaScript and that is I that's kind of my current kind of a fascination  I think that's really interesting, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enough of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not about Google. That's not about Google in my I don't know. Is it about IOT?  I guess if you're talking raspberry pi that's where that's what you were doing right Kevin learning Python on a raspberry Pi and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah for the IOT stuff  I mean we created our voicemail on a raspberry Pi using Python and then we use Python to  Have a light turn a lifex bulb turn green when like Bitcoin was up. I remember that  Yeah, that's a good it was all of 30 lines of code. I mean, it's not too bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like I like how Kevin says we it was really good  Have you done any coding Stacy? I tried to learn Python  I'm I love to problem solve but I hate I have to problem solve with my hands and yeah wires  And I would be your sys admin. I would not be your that's good. I'm a person your heart. He's a maker. It's perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a perfect perfect relationship let's well, I don't know where to start  I we I want to mention that October 9th Google is gonna have a made by Google event in New York City  We will stream that live starting at 8 a.m  Pacific 11 a.m. Eastern time on it's a Tuesday right before iOS today  And I'm hoping Kevin maybe you could join us because I think we're gonna see new Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think we are too and I'm sure we're gonna talk about that in a few minutes  The funny thing is these  potential new Chromebooks I kind of scoped out some code and some hints and  Google was talking to me about an invite for the event to go to the event and all of a sudden I published these little  Things and they're like not getting back to me now. You're kidding. Are they mad? Yeah, I  Wouldn't be surprised but you know, so we respect that this is your article about nocturn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Correct correct and I only found it because Google actually made a mistake in their code  Yeah, see they should have been  Okay. Yes. Well, so the story is I mean you could anybody can go see the chromium code because it's all open source  And that's where Chrome OS is developed and so on and all the new devices eventually roll through there all the functionality  So I'm scoping out stuff like twice three times a day  Well, I noticed that they had four keyboards detachable keyboards mentioned and they were the code names were  Wallaby hammer, I'm sorry a hammer wind whiskers and bridge B  RYDGE well, we all know bridge they make keyboards for the iPad Pro and surface Pro, right?  The next day I looked at that same code and bridge was replaced with the word wallaby  So somebody put in the description bridge when they should have used the code name of this  so I went to bridges site and  Using Google cache found the images that you now see brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's called reportage  That is very nicely done Kevin Tovel. So these youth these are images  That from bridge from bridge but clearly show a new Chromebook and you think it's a tablet because it would be using the  Detachable bridge keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's correct. There's there actually bridges making two keyboards for Chrome OS one is  Looks like USB and one is the same kind that they make for the iPad where you slide the tablet in to the two little hinges  right and  They had renders of the keyboard  But then I noticed renders of the tablet in the keyboard and I noticed something if you look at that  There's no like lightning port. It's not an iPad  It's got a Chrome OS screen rendered on it  Yeah at the top actually that picture that you just had looking at it from way above  There there is a power button that's flat and there's chromium code showing that that's how the fingerprint sensor will work with Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OS at the top left. So this is not just a power button. It's a fingerprint reader. That is correct

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is correct. Yeah, and also these devices should support acoustic echo cancellation  I found code for that that looks like two microphones right there. There's two there  There's some on the sides. Oh, yeah  And clearly when you see the keyboard it has a Google assistant button  It's got the Google Chrome launcher button and it's got the hamburger settings for Chrome OS. So there's no doubt the keyboard is legit  Yeah, is that a render based on a mock-up?  I don't know but I suspect nocturnal looks a lot like if not exactly like what they're showing there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's interesting because of course Google had a tablet called the pixel C  That some loved I thought it was pretty good but was suffering because it was running, you know  Android and then there the tablet apps were just inadequate for it. It was a very nice piece of hardware, but not such a great piece of software  But it sounds like they're going back to the well and this time instead of Android they're gonna use Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's correct, which essentially they're using Chrome OS with Android because you can run Android apps obviously on Chrome OS  I had heard and I can't I don't know if it's true or not  The pixel C was originally designed to run Chrome OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well or some weird hybrid that they were working on right that was it be I think that was  What's his name story in ours? Technica?  Was that he thought that that was it Russell Holly? Who was it that wrote that story? But Russell maybe Ron  Oh, it's Ron. I'm at Amadeo  Yeah, Ron Amadeo had done some digging similar to yours and was of the opinion that the pixel C was intended for a hybrid  OS that never was released and as a result was kind of a redheaded stepchild at Google and which is too bad because it really I  mean  Great Jarvis still uses his was amazing hardware  He loved it. I loved it, but Android just didn't serve it. Well, so this will be very interesting. By the way, I should mention Jeff is  on assignment  He's somewhere trap, where is he Carson? He's somewhere. I don't remember sit wait  Where he's in Milan? Oh  Oh, that's tough life. He's in Italy. All right. I want to go on Jeff's assignment. Yeah Milan is not so bad  That's the fashion and risotto capital of Italy. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is he fashionable is he gonna fit in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably it's risotto  So but it's interesting because most people were talking about this Google made by Google event in October really are talking about the pixel 3  everybody's anxious to see the pixel 3 and  But I think a new Chromebook would be great from Google. Will this be a high-priced Chromebook you think like the existing pixel books? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think it'll be close to those prices  my  Suspicion is that you'll be able to buy the tablet by itself and then you'll have a choice of detachable keyboards or Google will sell  Your detachable keyboard to go with it  It appears that it's gonna have eighth generation Intel core processors that will boost the price  It looks like a there's a more code 3,000 by 2,000 resolution  So if that's the case that'll boost the price  So yeah, and and I know a lot of people are kind of upset about that  I totally get it, but there's a lot of vendors that make relatively low-cost Chromebooks, right?  So Google wants to take that flagship design and price and go with it. That's that's fine  You know and and there are other options. There's there's great mid-range choices as well  I think this will be spec to the max or at least you'll have choices to spec it to the max and raise the price  Because of project campfire, which is running alternative operating systems on a Chromebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google getting a little bit of heat Chrome 69  We talked about this yesterday on security now the latest version of Chrome  logs you in  To Chrome if you use any Google services and people are worried particularly  security experts  Are worried that this means its users privacy be violated because Google essentially know who you are as you as as you use Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enterprises are upset about it, too  But didn't they just say that they were gonna fix this in 70 the other shoe the other shoe drop because we talked about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yesterday today Google announced. All right. All right  We're gonna fix this  In in the next version of Google Chrome 70 and and I think that that kind of underscores  I don't think Google really intended this to be  An invasion of privacy. I think they thought this would be convenient for users, right?  In fact, it's kind of how a lot of like the iPhone works you log into your Google account once on anything  The iPhone makes a note of it and from then on you're logged into all Google things as soon as you use them  That's kind of I think what more most normal users want but  You know some experts said well, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think they were trying to solve a real problem and I commend them for that  But the communication was awful because there really wasn't any this was kind of like found out  Yeah, exactly. So so right there. That's a problem  And then obviously and even in light of that people will take it to the next step saying well gee you sign in all  Of a sudden it might sync everything of yours back to Google or to this shared device etc  And they said no it would not be on but that's not the case sync doesn't automatically get turned on you have to turn on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bad so are they gonna let you are they gonna let you opt out of it or are they just gonna kill that? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Suspect they're gonna let you opt out of it because it is it is a useful feature for people who just say look I use Google  Everywhere I want to log in to Google once and have it be ever, you know  And this reminds me a lot of a couple of years ago and we were talking about on the show  I don't think you were with us yet. Stacey when Google unified all of its  Services remember it was a separate login for a while for YouTube Gmail  It's a etc. And then and then now in this case Google was very public about it. They changed their privacy policy  They gave people advanced warning and so forth, but I think it's the same idea  Which is one account one Google account across all Google services including Chrome  Google clearly thinks Chrome is a Google service, which I think you could make a strong case for  But I think they also understood people's like Matthew Green from Johns Hopkins  Complaints about this and and did the right thing which says alright in the next version you can you can change that behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most people ironically. Yeah, they're saying in fact, they have a mock-up screen of it already in the settings  Allow chrome sign in a toggle button in chrome 70 so you could opt out  I I hope that's going to be off by default. I can almost promise you it's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it would be nice to have it the other way around but  Again, I don't think this is Google trying. I mean who knows it's very hard to impute somebody's motivation or especially a big company's motivation  But I think Google's just thinking this is how people how users work  They just they want it to just work seamlessly and automatically I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean, I know they realize that people have trust issues with them whether it's real reasons or not is irrelevant to my point  But you're not helping yourself by not communicating this stuff. That's what makes it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was avoidable quite frankly, you know, they could have said this was coming an unforced error as we say in baseball. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin and I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see, okay, that's it that's the show I'm done I don't have anything else  It got nothing. Oh, I bet you guys have a few things to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the privacy hearings do we want to talk about that going on or went on this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess they're probably over now. Did you either of you get to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see I watched for like a hot second, but then I had to go so  Not usefully  But I did read the testimony from people and Google sent their chief privacy officer to testify

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People were there from all  You know walks of Silicon Valley Apple sent bud triple there  Okay, not all walks just the big tech companies just the big tech companies and for some reason charter communications  This and by you know  The reason I don't pay a lot of attention to this and I didn't make an effort to sit and watch it is  This is the you know, I don't I don't have a lot of confidence. This is anything more than window dressing. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think you think so. So I think we are gonna get federal privacy legislation  I think we've hit a tipping point and the fact that California enacted their own laws  Will I scared the hell out of Silicon Valley it did and so you see that in the in these negotiations or rather you see?  That in their conversations which is hey  Let's do a federal privacy law now and most of these companies don't want 50 different privacy laws, right?  But they also don't want some of the specifics of California's which calls for more disclosure about what types of information is being  cataloged  So I think actually something could happen. I don't think it's gonna happen this year  Maybe next year it really depends on the midterms so I would  Yes, this is bluster and silly and  You know, it's our politics at work  But I do think behind the scenes we're gonna see some real action on this going forward US News and World Reports

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So US privacy law could be good for Google but bad for you  Congress is taking the first steps toward taking setting national rules governing how companies  Use consumer data kind of our own GDP are  And of course, this is with an eye to states doing it themselves and to kind of preempting that I  the the reason  US News says it would be bad for you is because of course  Amazon AT&T Apple Google Twitter are all gonna lobby Congress hard to make sure that they get heard and  That the privacy rules don't get too much in their way  They still have to pay attention to GDP are though, right?  California law takes effect in 2020  It does only apply to California consumers, but all these companies have business in California

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a lot of consumers and it's the is it the first most populous state or is that New York?  Well, we're right up there with New York if not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know  I don't know New York's got that big city that really skews the results  Two big cities White House spokesperson Lindsay Walter said the goal is a policy that is the appropriate balance  This is what Google loves to hear between privacy and prosperity  Prosperity means profits for Google AT&T Apple. That's that is that is ridiculous. Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One quick question  Do you think I know it's not like the FCC where they they take comments on proposals and such  but do you think they might do something similar to that because I  Think people should have some input into this or at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Commentary the only input we ever have is the vote right and good news six weeks from now  We'll all get something some say in this matter. I don't you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So actually hold on  One second they will write whatever law they write and then they will draft an agency  most likely at the FTC to be in charge of enforcing it and when the FTC makes policies based around that law then there's  the possibility of civilian or  civilian input as part of that process and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there's the courts by the way, according to the chat room. It's California  Texas  We Florida then New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, thank you. So you're number two a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Motto you're probably celebrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I  Don't I have to say I don't mind this notion of let's balance commercial interests with public interests  because it is completely possible that if you  Utterly protect consumer privacy that it's that you're gonna change the face of  Technology and of the internet, right? I mean a lot of you know, I'm okay with that in some ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like we have got this de facto internet good when we've seen a lot of times that I  Think changing the internet might not be a terrible  Idea and I also would say you can roll things back. So I would be interested in some creative  approaches towards  Thinking about privacy and how we legislate around this  I don't I'm not gonna have this knee-jerk act kill it. It'll kill innovation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because well, but and I'm also not gonna have the knee-jerk  Well, you just got to regulate everything because otherwise Google is gonna take over the world. I understand  I mean there's no question in my mind that Google and Facebook particularly but Google Facebook  and these and many of these other companies are not exact exactly protecting our our  Privacy is Apple. I mean that's the Apple's position is what we care

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, I would also bring in so I'm gonna I would bring in the data brokers and  You know, this is something that I think there was actually an article talking about this  But like when we look at like the Experian, oh god, was it Experian or Equifax?  The Equifax data breach for example  Looking at that kind of stuff. We should probably  Be involving them in any of this not to say that the tech guys  But if we're gonna really talk about data privacy, yeah, because it really is companies like Equifax TransUnion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Experian the the credit reporting companies and then other a vast number of names. Nobody knows  That are you're doing marketing companies that are gathering this information and selling it in the most you know outrageous manner  And so Google and Facebook get a lot of heat  But you know, I've always said people are worried about Google. You should worry about your internet service provider  They know as much or more about you than Google does and they are happily selling it off to the highest bidder  Without any regard to your interests

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and law enforcement. No and to third parties who then sell it to law, right?  Yeah, so so these are the things that I'm like, yeah, let's let's bring that in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about that. I think the conversation needs to be had clearly needs to be had. Oh, it should have been had

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well when the FTC originally asked for it to be had back in 2014, right, but that's okay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna bet that this January at the Consumer Electronics Show Stacey and I will hear a lot about this from the from the CEA people  What why?  Because they're always  How do I want to say this?  They almost feel like a lobbying group to me at times they are a lot are a lobbying group this exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are correct sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because yeah, so that's why we always hear about regulatory or entire, you know regulatory stuff at every year at CES when we want to see  What innovation there is what devices are what services are coming? Etc, you know, I don't yeah  I don't want to get bogged down in the politics of things at CES. Yeah. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand love getting bogged down in politics  You can take those meetings. I'm like, don't worry Kevin. I would never torture you that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gary Shapiro online too for you Kevin. Let's his book club  Let's take a little break  It's so fun to have you two. I really I always enjoy having Kevin and that tofu along with this Stacey Higginbotham  They've known each other for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And years man years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here wait a minute you give it to me I'll pass it along to Kevin BAM

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin's like no, silly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I'm balancing a dog on my lap was new to podcasting give him a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, no, he's not cuz Kevin and Stacey do of course the IOT podcast. What's the best place to get that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The IOT podcast.com  Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iTunes just look for IOT podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you have to look for the Internet of Things podcast. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Internet of things, you know, IOT podcast comm how about that? That works too?  That's probably the best our show today brought to you by express  Vp and we're talking privacy. We're talking about how your internet service provider might be spying on you  Not to mention the hacker at the coffee shop down the street and everybody else you're being tracked online by social media sites  By marketing companies by your mobile provider by your internet service provider  Not only can they record your browsing history. They often sell it to other corporations who want to profit-free me information  Let's protect our privacy  using Express  VPN it is the number one most trusted VPN and whenever I talk about VPNs people are always asking which VPN  And I say Express VPN people go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one I use people love Express VPN  They've got easy-to-use apps. They run seamlessly in the background of your computer your phone your tablet  They turn on with one click they allow you to control how the VPN works  Your internet traffic will not only be secure.

You'll see they're the best there to express VPN comm slash  twig  The creepy line I  Want to see this the creepy line. It's an anti-google documentary  It's a conspiracy according to the verge and experience a conspiratorial  Playlist for the right-wing tech backlash. This is where you can go too far, right?  or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't seen it, but I want to see it. I can you see it on YouTube. Where is it?  New documentary claiming to expose the dark secrets behind two of the world's biggest tech empires  Google and  Facebook and by the way the verge says and I again I haven't seen it  But the verge says they basically treat Google and Facebook is interchangeable, which of course we know better  One of the things that they claim Google tweaked its search algorithm to swing the 2016 election in Hillary Clinton's favor did that work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, apparently not actually yes by a popular vote. Oh, maybe they maybe it did work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also repeats the claim that Silicon Valley is censoring American conservatives on web platforms  So this is the problem is that this you can you can go so far in the other direction  That I think that's not fair either that's I guess that's the counter-argument to this notion that well  We got to protect people's privacy  Let me see where you can see the creepy line. I'm just looking at it  Yeah, it premiered in New York City, and they have not announced any full release details yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So don't think we can see it yet  I think it's a clever title because I guess it goes back to Eric Schmidt saying, you know, we there's a line  Once we cross it it gets creepy and we try and go just to that line. Yeah  Hmm right up to that line says Eric Eric poor Eric. He

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He really got he got he I don't know if it's because he was extra candid or what but he would sometimes say things  It just did not  He didn't help himself in certain times unforced errors again another baseball  Analogy actually Eric is in the news again this week  He he says that the Internet he predicts will be bifurcated  into  Chinese Internet and the US Internet  It sort of is in a way. No. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy's nuts that did this trailer. Oh, you're now watching the trailer for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm reading about who's writing about it  The papers that are it's weird that the verge even talked about this but the documentary guy is  Very very much on the right and this is very much  Well, that's the thing you have to yeah, you kind of have to be careful about because you can really play into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we were just doing here Leo. Yes  Okay. Yeah. No, we're not. Yeah, okay, so we don't want to go that far

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, no, we're not yeah, okay, so we don't want to go that far well this guy clearly has an agenda also  What is that noise that is happening in the background? That's me and I apologize

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using my laptop today because I wanted to show Mojave on Macburt weekly and it keeps dinging at me  And even though I've turned off the sound several times  It seems to be independently, you know, it's this damn touch bar if you type

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Okay, now it's muted hands on your buzzers  All right back we go Facebook is giving advertisers access to your shadow contact information the marvelous cashmere hill is at it again  Last week she says I ran an ad on Facebook that was targeted at one person  Alan Mizlove he's a computer science professor who studies how privacy works on social networks  He had a theory that Facebook is letting advertisers reach users with contact information  collected  surreptitiously  And so she said I helped him test the theory by targeting him in a way Facebook had told me previously would not work  She used  She used  Mislaw's landline number a number. He says I never gave Facebook to  Create the ad and he saw it within hours even though  Facebook shouldn't know that number

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's crazy and okay a lot of the story is crazy in like negative ways  But also the fact that Facebook was gathering like if you used your real phone number for two-factor authentication  They were actually using that and I'm like that  That is using security in a way that is i'm gonna go with underhanded and pretty low

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we pissed if I were a security researcher. We uh, I mean Facebook had also done things with uh the app  uh, you know, I mean  And then get they get caught and they as always with facebook said oh god. We didn't mean to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook crosses the creepy line in a way like yeah google I feel  When they cross the creepy line, it's usually because they are not 100 sure where the creepy line is because their engineering kind of focused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of my attitude. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook crosses that line in bold pursuit of profit and then denies it and backtracks and keeps pushing as far as they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that takes us to Kevin's system  Um  Yes, because this is actually a little battle that's starting to rage now Kevin and brian acton and brian acton  Uh of kevin's system, of course one of the creators of instagram brian acton one of the creators of whatsapp both said delete facebook  Uh, I think well, I don't know. Kevin said that brian did famously when he left facebook. He tweeted  Delete at the against his time delete facebook. Uh, kevin just quit. Uh, he was uh,  I made a billionaire several times over by the acquisition of instagram  Uh, he quit this week leaving facebook and leaving people with the impression that there was a little bit of a  disagreement between  cistrum and  zuckerberg  Uh, there's also a really interesting interview with brian acton  Uh in forbes by parmy olson in which acton  Uh is a is even you know, I think you could say cistrum  Didn't say anything. Maybe it was a little innuendo when he said we're going to go off and be creative again  caris swisher pointed out that again sounded like a little bit of a  elbow to uh to mark zuckerberg  Brian acton is not being subtle about this at all. Let me see if I can find some of the quotes. He said he left  because facebook  Well at first he went to zuckerberg to say look we have an agreement that I can leave and get all my stock the issue  Of course is how much of the money that facebook paid for instagram?  He would get there. He apparently left 850 million dollars on the table  Uh, he says I didn't intend to  Because there was a clause in the acquisition agreement that said if facebook should start to monetize whatsapp  He could leave  and get all the stock  If facebook began quote implementing monetization initiatives without the consent of acton and yan kum  So he decided well, that's what they were doing  He uh, he said he decided to pursue two ways of making facebook  He had decided to pursue two ways of making money from whatsapp first by showing targeted ads  In whatsapp's new status feature which acton felt broke a social compact with its users  Targeted advertising he says is what makes me unhappy  He they also wanted to sell business tools to chat with whatsapp users  So he  Said i'm leaving  Um, and I want all my stock  He was called to zuckerberg's office a facebook lawyer was present  Uh, and they said  This is not clause this is not  Invoke that clause you can't get the full allocation of stock whatsapp  Had only been exploring monetization initiatives not implementing them  And then acton says in this article zuckerberg for his part of a simple message  He was like quote. He was like this is probably the last time you'll ever talk to me end quote  Acton said rather than lawyer up or trying to meet in the middle. He just left and left  850 million dollars  On the table now, there's a story  uh a uh  Facebook post by a guy named david marcus  The other side of the story  He said, uh, what he he called he says he called dave moran, right?  He says acton acton's attacks are a new standard of low class  Um dave you're talking dave moran isn't that who we talked to  Uh, this is david marcus wrote this  uh  but  I thought he had talked to dave moran. Okay, doesn't matter. I think moran has left, uh facebook long before

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this no, but I think he um  He quibbled with the acton portrayal. Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but that's okay not having a facebook account. I find it difficult to read these articles. So i'll have to trust you on this  First there are few companies out there writes david marcus  That empower and retain founders and their teams for as long as facebook does  Sisterman krieger the other instagram founder thrived at facebook for six years  Kuhn and acton over four and three years respectively or i'm sorry. It should be act. Yeah kuhn and actin  Yeah for some of them facebook is a place they did their best work  Second on encryption  Uh, you know business model I was president in a lot of these meetings  Mark protected whatsapp for a very long period of time and you have to put this in the context of a large organization  With businesses knocking on our door to have the ability to engage and communicate with their customers on whatsapp the same way  They were doing it on messenger. Oh, okay. So there was a lot of pressure from sponsors. Okay  During this time it became very clear that while advocating for business messaging and being given the opportunity to build and deliver on that promise brian  Actively slow played the execution and never truly went for it  Lastly call me old-fashioned, but I find attacking people in a company that made you a billionaire  It's a good point and went to an unprecedented extent to shield and accommodate you for years low class  It's actually a whole new standard of low class also in stratechary a great article. I think as always  uh by ben thompson talking about  kevin sistrom  saying that the ceo of instagram as soon as he sold to uh  Facebook really is mark zuckerberg and there's no other way around it  And as soon as you sell your company, that's what happens  And that's that I I feel like everyone talking about brian actin and i'm like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, he left a lot of money on the table, but he got a lot of money. He went to try to get that money  He got a lot of money, right?  And it's really easy after you sell your company to facebook for 22 billion dollars to be like, oh yeah  I mean there's  There's no doubt what mark zuckerberg and facebook are going to do in this situation  There was never any doubt if you sell  Your company you can you can fight to keep it from being monetized but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's kind of in a way what what ben thompson's saying over at stratechary is  You're selling your company to to facebook. That's what they do. They're a business and he says that's the difference between creating a product and running it  Business and he says that's the difference between creating a product and running a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, and I would say you don't even have okay  I agree. That's that's sort of true, but you don't have to run a business the way facebook runs a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can run it, but you have to monetize

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to monetize and brian actin actually talked about doing some sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pennies per however many which shirley sandberg said is a non-starter wouldn't scale scale  And so and actin says to sandberg the ceo of facebook  Well, you don't mean it won't scale. Of course. It'll scale what you mean is it won't make as much money as our plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what that's  Good for him for calling that out  I mean  But I I will say that part of this part of the problem here is you take venture capital  You suddenly have people on your board who are going to push you to make the most lucrative exit possible  which will take the the goals of your company and change them and  You know, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why once you sell your soul. You can't really complain that the devil is a bad guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, you can't but you know, you're not gonna last  And it won't matter you certainly can't go like i'm really sorry about my users. I have to live with that every day from my yacht

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From my yacht

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stratecary ben thompson cistern was never the ceo of instagram to be a ceo is to have a company  That can stand on its own  The difference from zuckerberg instagram's real ceo is stark facebook launched in february sold it at 2004 sold its first ad two months later  You know the money they basically was always built to be a viable business  And and I have to say I agree that a lot of times with apps and a lot of the startups in silicon valley  There's never really a notion of well, how is this going to be a business?  It's it's more how are we going to exit?  How are we going to return our the money to our investors and that doesn't necessarily mean by making a profit  Uber loses billions a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that feels disingenuous and it's it's a problem because your users you're gonna piss off your users. Yeah, if you say to them  You know, oh, we're just I mean if you're you're going with this like network effects  We got a scale we got to get as many people as possible and then you suddenly are like  Oh crap, we have to have a revenue model  Yeah, people don't like to pay for stuff that they used to get for free.

I'm thanking you already  All right, the Safety Center helping you stay safe online  which  Quietly was published about six days ago. But if you look very closely scroll down there  Yeah, don't even read the article. Don't even read it. Just scroll down  Yeah, what do you see there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to get rid of this show. I hate this show  It's not now. It's not going away. It's just I'm clicking in and it's I know I show yes  It's cuz you know life would be better if you wouldn't use Safari Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you what you could always right click on the  Image and open a new tab because it's the image that I want to point out this image in particular. It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's let's take a look at that image in a bird is that tab? It's a Chromebook pixel. Is it isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Don't know the pixel  Pixelbook bezels that small. Oh  No, they're not  No, they're not and in fact, I believe the image name is pixel book underscore two  You tell me if it is I actually pixel spoke screenshot underscore one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well too late for them because I wrote it up yesterday  Which  Explains again about that invite coming up. You're not gonna get that invite you keep this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really interesting or it could just be a modified screenshot, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cuz well, let's talk about that for a second because the marketing people would have done that and guess who worked in marketing at Google for  Android and Chrome. Oh, that would be me  you have to go through like 20 layers of  Approvals and reviews to get something put on that site. Really? I know that for a fact  Oh, absolutely PR legal product. Oh, yeah. I remember you complaining about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that for a fact because Kevin discussed how frustrated yes, I remember that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you should hear me when I'm not speaking to however many people are in the show talking about this. But anyway, um  they don't make mistakes like that and  on top of that the  leaked ads which may or may not be true all had a pixel book with  Minimal bezels just like that  so I'm thinking they're kind of at this point trolling us because everything is getting leaked about the October 9th event interesting and I  Think that's what is happening. That's the only probably visual change  You'll see on the outside and then the internals will be beefed up with the latest gen processors, etc

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe Kevin here's a conspiracy theory. Maybe they really like you and want your site to do well. It's about Chromebooks.com you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know we should have mentioned that you're right Stacey about Chromebooks.com about Chromebooks.com. It's all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Com I wish we I wish we had mentioned that at least, you know once

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank You Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one thing for me to suck at marketing myself. It's another thing entirely for me not to help you guys do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will market Kevin to the ends of the earth. I'm like, yeah quality  Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, you will it's about Chromebooks.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Change log news starting. I wish I've got okay. They're really making me not use Safari

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what this is all about because I half the page is hidden by related articles  Starting today you can use Google. Oh, I know why because I made everything bigger  Starting today, there we go  You can use Google Maps to easily plan where you go as a group long press on any place to add it to a  Shortlist the small floating bubble on the side of your screen and once you see that floating bubble, it looks surprisingly  like chat heads the Facebook chat bubble  Yeah, yeah, once you've added places you can quickly share the list with your friends on any messaging platform  Add or remove additional places or vote together in Google Maps. So that's cool. You can just basically you're aggregating  Locations together into a little bubble which you can then share  nice  The group planning feature starts rolling out on Android and iOS this week to get started down with the Google Maps app or updated  from the Play Store app store and  Oh  Finally in the change log. Oh  the things you'll find  Congratulations  Today is your day. You're off to great pages. You're off and away  You have brains in your head and fingers on your hands. You can search for whatever use  You doesn't scan and you can search for whatever and see where it lands  You're on your own with an empty white box roll a dice flip a coin if you're feeling lucky or not  Doesn't rhyme you'll spin around pages do a barrel roll with care about anagram  You'll say did you mean isn't right there?  with oh  With your head full of brains and your hands full of fingers. You're too smart to tap any Super Mario box figures  By the way, all of these are links  If you do not find what?  No, okay. It's see I'll click on a link. See it brought me to Super Mario box figures  Barrel roll we've seen this before you ready  Hold on to your hat. We're gonna do a barrel roll

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I hit it again  Doesn't do it anymore  But they link to it that's so weird  And if you do not find links that you want to click on then go  Then go back to the start type again and hashtag search on but searchers beware. We've hidden more things  so this is a basically a tribute or an insult depending on your point of view to dr. Seuss and  In it links to all sorts of Easter eggs in Google  So this is really a great really great page if you want to find all the crazy stuff  I'm playing breakout right now. Yes. It's so funny that you said that it's exactly what I clicked on  it turns into an Atari breakout with the image search of  Atari breakout isn't that hysterical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to have that on my TI 65 or 63 graphing 64 a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah nice zerg rushes. Mm-hmm. What's a zerg? Oh  Look, there's zergs rushing all the O's are taking over my  They're eating up. Oh my god. They're eating the search results  this is fun, so  This is a oh  That's what you should do probably is it's on the Google keyword blog search for oh the things you'll find and  You'll get the poem but in the poem are links to a lot of Google Easter eggs over the years  This must also be celebrating part of the celebration of 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a nice showcase and I have to say for all the complaints that people may have about Google  Trying to control the web with amp and certain codecs and all that  They still do some really cool things to show off  Standardized features in HTML and so on so, you know, it's it's nice to see this. They're fun. Google's fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let that they are fun company  You know  Honestly, I should never have tried to do that in Safari. It just broke Safari all kinds of ways, but it works nicely in Chrome  So do it in Chrome?  So whether you and I'll end it with the final stanza whether you're Aussie or Kenyan or mostly Hungarian or an Indo-Peruvian  Czech vegetarian you're off to great pages today is your day  Your search page is waiting so get on your way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the most  anticlimactic  Bumper ever  We gotta add  It's almost as bad as  That that that ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Price is right  Thank you for doing that Karsten in my absence Karsten continued with the Google changelog  tradition New York Times is suing the FCC  Saying it hid evidence of Russia Russian meddling in that neutrality repeal  Wow  What is the time standing in this? I mean there I don't understand  They made a foyer request in June. It's gonna say did they answer the foyer stuff? Ah  This led to a months-long process in which the Times repeatedly narrowed its public records request in order to overcome the FCC's  Various objections, but the FCC still refuses to release any of the records requested by the Times  So they're suing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York  There you go. That's it. They're not suing for money. They're suing for information  Go go foyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is well, I mean I guess you can't go up against the New York Times they have actual lawyers  There's been plenty of times. I've made foyer requests and I get back like all redacted pages and I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that but yeah, if you've got yeah if you've got money and you've got the you know  The wherewithal and you're in the public interest at heart. That's exactly the process right you get them to go to court  You're saying they're not living up to their requirements the foyer requirements

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, thank you New York Times and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank You CNET who points out that if you  Want to convince somebody you're not a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Use the word poop I use that word all the time Oh poop I do that that is a phrase that often I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Research it's at the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Tried to create something they called the minimal Turing test  They asked themselves a question if you could use only one word to convince a human you weren't a robot. What word  Would you choose?  That's interesting. They had a thousand participants 400 words were suggested the most commonly  suggested words  related to concepts most people think an AI might not understand like love or soul  Compassion or mercy or swear words  One curious choice made by a number of people according to CNET, please  Now if you said if I said are you a robot and you said  Please I would say you're a robot for sure. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Stacy is a robot. I am I am a I am a male robot according to a replicant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The research that just blows that blows CNET's whole theory out of the whack because she says poop all the time poop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. So they put all the suggested words into to a big bin  Selected the most nominated word from each category. They took down another two thousand  This is a lot of work to go to this for this  This is somebody's looking to get a PhD  2,000 new participants a random combination of two of the ten words then had them select which word they thought was the most  By them select which word they thought was chosen by a human and which were chosen by a robot  After all of this the word most likely events another human being you're not a robot is poop  Wait, that's what people thought. Yes. So you understand what they did  They first got a panel of a thousand people to come up with words. They sorted them. They massaged them. They triangulated them  Then they got another two thousand people  At which point they're their professor their advisors already saying guys  I don't this is not you're not gonna get your PhD and they get another two thousand people and they take  One from column a and one from column B and they say okay, here's two words  please and poop which one said by a human which one said by a robot and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so when sky net goes online and we get attacked by the  Things we're not sure if they're human or robot. We're supposed to say do you need to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  poop and see what they say, you know, we might not have to wait that long because  All the robots now know that  Thanks, MIT in the University of Pennsylvania for telling the robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is very confusing. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Moving right along wait, wait, wait, wait, she's confused by this poop conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One week from today, right right unfortunately fortunately or unfortunate, I'm not sure which right before the show next week  For the first time ever FEMA will test the presidential alert  Everyone in America with a cell phone  Will receive the same text message on October 3rd at 2 18 p.m. Eastern Standard Time  To test the readiness of the presidential alert system, by the way, the message is not poop  It is this is a test of the national wireless alert system. No action is needed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless the guy in Hawaii gets a hold of it when she says it's gonna say the missiles are on the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The missiles are on the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The test will last about a minute a  Hundred mobile carriers will take part which kind of blows my mind because I didn't know there were more than four  The  This is not something you can disable now you maybe have you heard the amber alert  Have you ever heard the alerts or the yeah?  And it's the first thing you do the first thing you do when you get a new phone and you get one of those  Sometimes it's a dangerous  Weather alert or whatever is to go into the settings and disable them right except the one thing you can know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, yes, you can't do that. You're what if someone's child was stolen? I mean, okay, first of all, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. What if somebody's but it's never that it's always the father and the mother

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dangerous it okay. I see that you were you were not as altruistic as I am cynical

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other thing is I get these alerts and it's somewhere 200 miles away. They don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we have that's cuz you live in California in Texas. We have that same thing  They're like someone in San Saba has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't care what are you supposed to do about this I'm gonna look for a dusty blue Chevrolet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, if I get one in the area, I totally look for the car. Are you really?  Yes, that's so cute. My job as a citizen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  You can't disable the presidential alert so you're gonna no matter what  Every phone in the United States at 2 18 p.m. Eastern Time next Wednesday is gonna go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is gonna be hilarious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a shame. We won't be doing twig at that time. I know that's what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure if it's unfortunate or fortunate. I think it's unfortunate  I'll be doing Windows weekly, but I wouldn't you like like wouldn't you like to be like in Times Square or  You know never at a Knicks game or never I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Want to know who's gonna vet the message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this isn't political I mean granted they do say it will be presidential  It is president. Okay, but it is not it's unprecedented

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is never done this before

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is something that we've been working for four years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, it apparently it happened after the  The flooding they said well, you know, we've never used this system  We probably should try it just to see if it works  It's like a test of the emergency broadcast just like that or they now call it the  EAS the emergency alert system, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was I was out running. This is related. Trust me. I was out running yesterday and we had massive thunderstorms and my  Weather app gets the National Weather Service alerts and I left the phone behind because I was running with an Apple watch  Which is has LTE and I was about a mile into my run and I got the loudest alert  Wow my watch because as LTE, right it scared the bejesus out of me, right?  And I the weird I've never heard the speaker on this thing so loud it was like they had a special  Volume setting that they could override on my Apple watch or something was really loud. I was I was shocked. So  So if you have a word at the volume  incidentally be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't want to give anybody ideas, but if you're North Korea and you were thinking about attacking United States  To 18 p.m. On Wednesday would be a great time to do it  Because we'd all go. Oh, no, that's the uh, that's the test. That's here. The missiles are incoming. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Effective you're Kim  Jung eel I would add poop to that message

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to really throw them for some reason when does Eastern when does date when this date when does daylight savings time end?  saving  Time is it like November the first weekend of November when I'm accountably this announcement from FEMA says it will end at 2 18 p.m  Eastern Standard Time next week  So what time is that really? So it's gonna be an hour long  It doesn't it turn the watch off. No, I'm sorry. That was a mistake in in the FEMA and  Announcement says EDT. So actually the FEMA announcement says  218 and then there's an EAS  Alert at 220. So we're gonna we're gonna this the whole place is gonna go crazy  Cell towers will broadcast the WEA test for approximately 30 minutes  beginning at 2 18 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time during this time  We are compatible cell phones that are switched on within range of an active cell tower and whose wireless provider  Participates and we should be capable of receiving the test message  Some cell phones will not receive the test message and cell phones should only receive the message once  That should worries me a little bit  The WEA test message will have a header that reads presidential alert and text that says this is a test  So just just so you know, it's just just a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just gonna say it if it says witch hunt I'm done  That would be hysterical. It would be funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it would be sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be the best presidential alert ever  No, it can't happen cuz you know as you know FEMA is part of the deep state so it's not gonna happen  Let's see that would be pretty funny though witch hunt poop  China  Wow  This is this is kind of from Reuters comes this story. It's a little bit just depressing David Stanway writing  China's shut down more than tooth. Sorry 4,000 websites and online accounts in a three-month campaign against harmful online information  This is according to China's own Xinhua news agency  The campaign targeted content in online fiction that spread improper values  Vulgarity and obscenity as well as content that infringed on copyright  See they have their own internet already, yeah  Yeah, I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point  I think that's a good point

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a good point  Yeah, to be honest. Yeah. Yeah  Did you guys see right before we started the show you probably didn't because it literally happened right before the show I caught a  article on wired  That I threw in here closer to the top about I found this interesting  Mobile websites can tap into your phone sensors without asking. Yeah  What what the yes?  Yes, they can the light sensor  Like two or three other sensors tasty because the web  Standards don't have a way to prompt the user to allow it or not Lily. Hey, I'm in writing on now  Yeah, that was surprising and I'm surprised in a sense that we're just finding out about this now  Because it's not like mobile websites and smartphones are new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Northeastern University North Carolina State and Princeton  Found that of the top 100,000 sites is ranked by Alexa  3695 incorporate scripts that tap into one or more of these mobile sensors  Wayfair priceline.com kayak if you use Google Maps in a mobile browser  You'll get a little pop-up that says this website wants to you see your location and you can authorize that but with motion lighting and proximity  sensors, there's no mechanism and  There isn't so that because there isn't a permissions infrastructure the browser just does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if they write a script to but you have to actively be browsing. Yeah, but yes, by the way, so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they get my proximity to the phone or my or my orientation, it's not my sexual orientation. It's my orientation in space

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what they're doing with the information  if anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The researchers note that on a malicious website the information could fuel various types of attack  Like using ambient light data to make inferences about a user's browsing  Or using motion sensor data as a sort of key logger to do things like pin numbers, you know  I'm not gonna actually I'm not gonna put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can identify a person based on how they walk and you could actually get that from a motion sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but but you'd actually have to be I mean this isn't gonna be useful  It's not like they could turn it on and then watch you walk  No, I guess the point is that this is something people should be aware of because we know that the bad guys are really kind  of amazing and how they can extract information from the  skimpiest of resources it seems I was thinking how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more important than use this to say hey  These pieces of these pieces of glass that you have collect a lot of information  Yes, leak a lot of information about you. That's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Oculus  Had an event and  They announced a bunch of new things at their VR developers conference Oculus connect  There is a new Oculus in town the Oculus quest  Mark Zuckerberg said $399. It's standalone. There's you don't have to wire it up to a computer  it's wireless hand presence six degrees of freedom and  Zuckerberg said it runs rift quality experiences  And there will be 50 games at launch designed to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, I I haven't used any  VR headsets in a while. I think the last one I used was maybe Samsung's or or Google's  maybe it's just me I I  Don't find I use them for like hours and hours like I would use a computer or a video game console  Whatever. It's like oh, it's kind of gimmick. Honestly, it's a little gimmicky  It feels very like bite-sized to me like okay after 15 minutes. I'm like, okay now I can go look at something else  I guess but this is getting kind of boring. It could be me. I don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't like  People say it's games or entertainment or maybe even therapy, but I don't like it because I don't like  Not being able to see my surroundings when I'm surrounded by strangers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny you say that cuz I say that all the time that somebody could sneak up on and bonk me on  the head

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, or in my case sexually assault me because you know, I'm a woman they could sexually assault me too. That is true  It's less likely but more painful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  poop  That's my safe word. I've decided  That's cuz I'm not a robot there we go snapdragon 835 in this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so not excited about VR. I really wish I were funny. None of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jump up and down and say this is the next big thing and I think I'm a little more bullish on mixed reality  but even that I'm  we had Amy Webb on  Sunday on Twitter and she has a magic leap the  The reference one the three twenty five hundred dollar reference one and she says you really she really she's a futurist  But she really can see that this is going to be something big. It's not yet, but it's gonna be something big  I don't think you can say the same thing about VR at least not as it stands today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nevertheless for the price six degrees of freedom  Pretty impressive  Google by the way is testing the same thing with Google Daydream  Although that would require a Android  Phone plugged into the headset, right? So that you know, maybe they'll say something about this on October 9th  I don't know. It's gonna be how long is that event gonna be Kevin you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That I imagine it would be pretty long. I don't think I'm just gonna talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what if Amazon could do their thing in like 70 minutes  There's 70 news items in like an hour and 25 minutes. So what's that 85 minutes? I  Feel that Google really needs to step up its game. So I wasn't here for the Amazon announcements  I was there for the Amazon. Yeah, this is all this is right up your guys alley. What what do you think?  There was a lot and I think that Amazon basically  Articulated the clearest vision for a smart home. That's actually smart. Not only did they articulated it but articulated  They also started putting together the necessary elements. So things like easy getting devices on the network easily  things like voice  Like organizing your rooms by voice things like hunches that are gonna say like hey, you just told me good night  But it looks like you left a light on  That's all of that's  Yeah, and they showed off things like guard which is gonna turn everybody's echoes into a glass break sensor and a  Smoke detection sensor. So those kind of things  Smoke it listens for your smoke detector. Oh, so you still have a smoke detector  Yeah, and then they launched a  It's a module Wi-Fi Bluetooth module that's pre certified which is big deal  So you don't have to go to the FCC and all the other agencies you pop that into your device  Then you can build something like that $30 Amazon wall clock. They should oh, that's really neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry subscribe that while you're at it there Karsten

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They include a bunch of costs as well with that right they do well they include cloud connection costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that means if you buy that module you don't pay for cloud costs now, it doesn't say how far that goes  I'm imagining you can't like create a video camera pop that in and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free load amazing though. So how much is how much is the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now it's a developer preview. So we don't know but you can sign up and get a board. It's on an Arduino

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty cool. I love that idea  I mean, that's basically Amazon saying everybody go out and make make some IOT devices. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's what they're smart that microwave that everyone's like, I don't know why people are so excited about this microwave  But yes, that's what they did. They built that clock and the microwave and then they Android art on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Auto-auto-auto-auto. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were those all built with that an Arduino device those three were built with using that module  So really people were we were mocking the microwave and all that it was really more to demonstrate what you could do with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IOT module and they they're really neat. So not only did they do this module that's like oh  You're not familiar with building hardware and antennas and certification with agencies. No problem. I got you  I'm here take that and they created a new version of the and I'll just say her name  skills  API that basically lets you define your device in three different like categories that you can build something that's  madam a enabled  Very quickly like ten minutes. Wow quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's super smart because there I think there's a there are thousands of people who will jump on that  We'll do that and say and you could see all sorts of interesting stuff out of it  So and ultimately it benefits Amazon even if they give you free bandwidth for a year  Or three servers for a year. It's ultimately gonna benefit Amazon and they'll make money off of it  So we were talking about this on on Twitter on Sunday, and I'm curious what you two think  Is Jeff just does Jeff Bezos have a grand overarching  Vision he's not talking about it, but in his head or is a lot of this serendipity like  We got some extra servers, why don't we give people a chance to rent it we could call it  I don't know Amazon Web Services or  Oh, you know what it wouldn't be interesting if we charge the people flat fee once a year for unlimited  Two-day delivery. How much would you charge that? I don't know. Let's make it $69  There's certain looks like it's serendipitous like there's no it's part of their process you think but do you think there's a grand plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there's a grand plan what I think Jeff Bezos has done at Amazon is made it easy to build  Compelling things for the end customer whether that's so he's created an organization that facilitates this kind of thing  Yes, because if you look at like, you know, all of their products start with a press release, right? You cannot pitch anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the whole way. That's the way it works. You don't go to a meeting with a  PowerPoint deck you go with a press press release for the right

Transcript:  When you think about building if your goal is to  Sell things to a customer, right and actually this gets into my choice for this week. So it'll dovetail nicely with that  If that's your goal having that customer focus, it's not just BS the way he says it  he it really is that because  It entices the user in and you build with that end goal in mind in a way that others I don't think do  So, I don't know if it's a grand plan to like dominate the world so much as it's a hey  Let's make things that people cannot bear to give up  That people will love and use and bring into their life  Even if it's maybe slightly poisonous to their overall societal well be who cares. We'll figure that out later  It's like the sugar industry in the fast food industry

Transcript:  Think Stacey hit the nail on the head and I think all of this from a hardware standpoint obviously starts from the the original Kindle  And which wasn't great and they reiterated reiterated and now it's like their commodities  I mean you can buy a referb Kindle for 30 40 bucks and you know, it's just an enjoyable  Thing to have and to use and you have you know, you're foot in the door with a customer now with a relationship  I think the only time they really got away from that strategy and thought didn't think of the customer as well  Was the fire phone but the fire tablets?  all these echo devices  They're not just cool neat gadget II things. They are helpful and  They're not terribly expensive relatively speaking. So  You know, I think Stacy's right in the grand plan. It's a very customer focused  Approach and  Other things come along for the ride such as all the data and the cloud services and whatnot  Google on the other hand, I think is more data driven, you know, it's a little different type of company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I would say Amazon does use its data to understand so even about the microwave  I was like, oh, how many cubic feet does that have they're like point seven at 700 watts?  It's the most popular brand of microwave that we sell on Amazon. That's like oh, so that's why you made it that size  He's like exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have that data that there's no denying that oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see them do it too with Amazon Web Services. What happens is they are very carefully analyzing  Things like who's using who's a big customer? What are they doing?  What kind of tools are becoming popular on the site?  And if they see something that's becoming popular, they'll either productize it themselves or they'll buy the company that makes it and  Usually they just productize it themselves though. So they are  Yes customer focus, but they do use that data and they use it in a way to like kill their competition  It's it's pretty awe-inspiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing  Have you ever been to the Museum of Ice Cream? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they won't because it will be all gone because we're not archiving any of this  It's all ephemeral thank God, you know, I  Have so many thoughts about this I'm so interested in these things and not just to make fun of them, but  I'm just really curious like what people get out of it and  There's clearly something it's really important to people  because a lot I mean so but I just I find it baffling but I'm also so curious like I  Don't know. I  Mean, I can see why people are doing this because these are perfect for getting you know  likes on Instagram and connecting with people and I feel like it's a deep it's almost a deep psychosis that this this

It's something you and your family are gonna live in for a long long time  And it can be a little anxious. It's certainly not something you want to be rushed  Into or feel rushed or anxious about the process you want to be able to pick the right house, right?  But as most of us, you know, you're gonna have to get a loan  You're gonna have to go and the last thing you want to do is go to a bank and you don't get get all dressed up  Try to look prosperous  You know, the banks don't want to lend money to anybody who needs it  So you've got to look like you don't need the loan, but I'm gonna do you a favor and I'll take the money  Then you fill out a big, you know 20 page  Application much of which will involve  Calling banks saying you have my statement from  2010 or  Former employers that you may not even get along that well with saying I need to get some pay stubs from you, please  All of this just to get a loan. It's not it's crazy  That's why quick and loans the number one lender in the country number one in volume  But that's because they're number one in our hearts number one in customer satisfaction eight years in a row  according to JD Power for mortgage origination since  They created something to take the anxiety the stress the pressure out of buying a home loan they call it rocket mortgage  Rocket mortgage.

They ask a few simple questions you get that pre-qualified approval  Then within 24 hours quick and loans will verify your income your assets in your credit and they'll give you a verified approval. That means  Essentially, you're like a cash buyer when you go to buy a house when you go to make an offer  The seller looks at you as if you've got the cash because you do you're verified you even get a letter if you want  Look, I'm verified  I've got approval  That's nice  But then the third step kicks in once you're verified you qualify for the all-new  exclusive rate shield approval  they lock your rate up for up to 90 days while you shop so there's no pressure because you know rates are going up and  That's a big deal what even a quarter point interest rate increase over 30 years cost you tens of thousands of dollars  You don't want to have the pressure. Oh, we got it. We got to buy this house  It's not perfect  But if we wait any longer it could cost us thousands of dollars more but you don't have to with Rachel approval  You know what your rates gonna be for up to 90 days if the rates go up your rate stays the same  Oh, here's the good part though if rates go down  Your rate drops so it's a win-win  It's exactly why quick and loans is America's largest mortgage mortgage lender and best to get started  It's simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon's mission is to make customer identity more primary than citizenship. Oh, that's an interesting insight, isn't it? Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's like so Amazon's obsession with customers appears to have endeared them again and again to a public that should know better. Oh  I  really  Customer obsession is a happier narrative for this dominance than one of aggressive market capture  So, you know take a take a look at this. It's definitely it has an agenda, but it's it's very thoughtful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is great. I enjoyed it good recommendation. Thank you. It's from real life mag comm the constant consumer drew Austin  the author  Well, this has been such fun.
