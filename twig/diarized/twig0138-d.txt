Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hello, Gina. Good to have you. Jeff Jarvis is also here.  From the City University of New York, where he's a professor of journalism,  the author of Public Parts and What Would Google Do?  And he blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  Hey.  And he said, what did you say?  You weren't sure if you were going to go to Google I.O. because you're not a programmer?  You would feel like a little old lady?  At a rave.  At a rave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need your advice.  We'll talk.  Am I going to be standing there with my thumb somewhere it shouldn't be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We'll talk, Hermione.  We'll just hang in there.  We'll get to you, Bertha.  Also joining us from the Altimeter Group, a guy I've known for years  and we've been trying to get on for a long time and just haven't been able to coordinate.  Jeremiah Oyang is here from, he's an analyst at Altimeter Group.  He also blogs a lot about social media, media in general.  Just everything going on in the world today.  It's great to have you, Jeremiah.  Thank you for having me, Leo.  Gina, Jeff, hi.  I think we agreed to have you on this show last year on the plane back from South by Southwest.  I'm finally getting you on.  But we needed somebody who actually went to South by Southwest because the three of us decided,  why did we decide, Gina?  It was just too much of a party and not enough content.  For me, too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Too big, too much.  Kind of the reason why I don't go to CACES.  It just felt like a little too much this year.  My first year after six years of not going.  And you had FOMO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Was your FOMO survivable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had some FOMO.  I mean, I have a personal policy, no FOMO, but I had a little FOMO.  I'll admit that I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are you missing out on this chocolate pie that I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am definitely having FOMO about the pies.  That is cruel, Leo.  That's a banana cream.  Oh, that looks amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it is Pi Day 3.14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's going to be 1.59 during the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, at 1.59, let's all jump up and down and do the pie dance.  We'll do the pie dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  And you can torture us with more pies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We got pies everywhere because it turns out there's a pie place around the corner called  the All American Pie Company.  We bought pies, like all kinds of pies.  They even make savory pies.  We didn't get any of those.  And Jeremiah...  Leo's not happy about it.  Yeah, Jeremiah knew because he brought me an apple pie.  Where's that from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's from across the street.  That wonderful grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, the Petaluma, which is great.  The Petaluma Market.  Fantastic.  We are really blessed with very fattening food all around us at all times.  So, Jeff, Gina and I forego for when to South By.  You know, in the past, big news has broken there.  Twitter was basically launched at South By.  Foursquare, same thing.  It's been a while since anything big was launched.  Was there any news at South By?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there was no big breakouts, Leo, at this time.  And there really hasn't been for a number of years.  But what was interesting is because there were so many people, over 25,000 people, 27% more than last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Gina started going when it was, what, 700?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was small.  But I don't know that it was that small.  But it was small and it was all in the convention center.  And you'd walk by your friends in the hallway, you know, and have great conversations.  No, no, no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, let's just start from the registration.  Some people were in line for an hour to get their badge.  Now, Leo, this is a digital conference and people are waiting in line.  What do you need a badge for?  So there's significantly a missed opportunity.  And then it started pouring rain.  Horrible. Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  So people barely went about the streets.  So people were clumped together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A lot of the fun at South By is hanging out on the street.  That's what Austin is.  Absolutely.  It's just going down to 6th Street and just every party on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. Having fun and just the serendipity of it.  So what we saw was people were using smaller apps to find more intimate conversations with folks.  So I saw a pickup of GroupMe and that launched at South By last year, but it was picking up more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I liked GroupMe.  We actually that's what we decided on using internally for our messaging when we're at CES, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We also saw a pickup of Highlight and Glancy.  Have you seen those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's what everybody thought would be the two battling apps.  I have Highlight on my iPhone and what it does, it lets you know if friends of friends are nearby.  Proximity.  Couldn't have been very useful at South By since everybody was all jammed together anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little bit too much noise and data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody's here.  Oh, everybody's here.  Everybody's here.  Glancy, we used it to the web, I think.  And it's a way to plan.  What was a plan?  Your conference kind of?  No, no, no.  That's land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more of a proximity.  It's also proximity as well.  And then we saw a lot of Foursquare check-ins because a lot of people were claiming the buzz badges.  Foursquare is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They use it to promote.  Absolutely.  What's sad is Gowala turned off its server that day and that was another one that had launched at South By.  They're from Austin.  It must have been a sad day.  Nobody noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody noticed.  There's just too much going on.  Gowala?  There's just so many social networks.  And therein lies the problem.  I mean, there's more than that.  There's Echo, Banjo, Sonar.  They're all proximity social networks.  So there's just a rash of them right now.  And did Oink die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because I just got an email from Oink saying, here's all your data.  And I'm seeing in the chat room.  Milk decided to shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Milk just decided to focus on other things and said, thank you.  You can download your data.  We're going to have another announcement soon.  So I think they're subscribing to the whole try something out, fail fast.  They said they would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it's easy to say.  And most people just hang on.  Oink is only a few months old and was really fun.  I was very active.  I liked the Oink sound.  But like all of these, there's so many of them.  I got bored with it and I stopped using it after a few weeks.  And I guess Kevin Rose saw the writing on the wall.  And I was wondering why I got that.  What else is Milk doing?  We don't know.  But that was one of the things Kevin said is try many things and fail fast.  That's really...  And then what I admire is they have sent me a link.  I didn't even request it saying, hey, Oink user, your Oink data, you can download it from the link below for the next 48 hours.  And do what with it?  I don't know.  But I guess I should get it.  You know, I think more...  I think this...  You're right.  Do what with it.  But I think every company that goes out...  Guala didn't offer me that.  I think it's a good idea.  If you wanted it, it's your data.  So...  Yeah, feature zero.  That's the...  Yeah, feature zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, when I get the data that I put in out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I worry about Path.  I put so much on Path.  Path's always said if you want the data, you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can email them or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but you have to email them, which is a little weird.  OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's another interesting thing that people are waiting in line to spend $170 on.  And this one is a new thing.  It's called the Nike Fuel Band.  Have you heard of that?  I see them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, I bought an Up.  I've got one.  I bought a Jumbo and Up.  It's a lot bigger than the Up.  But it does have a LED.  So what does that mean, Jeff, those light bars there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those light bars?  Well, what it means is that I haven't met my goal yet today.  My fuel is $13.85.  My goal is $2,000.  Is that $3,000?  Is that steps?  No, that's fuel.  That's a kind of new currency that you say you could compare things.  There's the calories, not very many.  I've been sitting at my desk all day.  Steps, very few.  And what time it is.  You need to do the high dance.  Oh, so it's a watch.  And it was that too, yes.  And then you...  So here's the USB.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's integral, which it was not on the Up Band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And it syncs through Bluetooth to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like that too.  That's how the Fitbit works.  Yeah.  You don't have to look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very good.  I will say that I've had to reset it every other time that I sync, but knock on what  it still works.  And then on your iPad, iPhone, let me see if I can get that out.  It'll show you what you've done day to day, whether you've hit your goals, all this neat  stuff.  And it is forcing me, even though today I'm stuck at the office all day, it has forced  me to, just because it exists, to walk more and to run more.  Are you wearing one, Jeremiah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I didn't have one, but they're going to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, but wait, I like your Wi-Fi cufflinks, though.  That's pretty cool.  You like that?  Yeah.  He's got the Wi-Fi logo on the cufflinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We don't have a Zoom, so there's no camera operator.  He's worked in television a little too.  Can you get a shot of that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, as a matter of fact, no.  So was everybody wearing fuel bands at this point?  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $170 a pop, no, but everybody's going to get one.  They're expensive.  Some VIPs were touting them around, so...  Well, look, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to a Nike event and that's got it.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because I don't think you can...  Yeah, it's sold out.  You can't get it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're sold out pretty quickly.  I mean, I tried to buy it.  Oh, well, it's not coming out.  So should I get one?  Do you think it's a good thing?  I think it's pretty neat.  I mean, it doesn't have the sleep thing that the UP has.  The UP's going to have a new version coming out.  But yeah, I like it.  It's not...  Do you bike, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't bike, but it...  This is one thing about Nike Plus is it's really run-focused, right?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the downside of the feel is, and I was talking to the folks, is it's measuring the  movement of your arm.  Right, so could you put it on your ankle?  I suppose you could.  If you bike.  But it's not gathering heart rate or sweat or GPS.  It's pretty limited data and capture, quite honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is.  In fact, you could buy a watch for that price that would do much more.  Yes.  But it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's very cool looking.  Nike also showed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The event in New York, they also showed...  I don't know if I talked about this before.  Basketball shoes with five sensors in them.  And I think we talked about this before?  It does all kinds of data for you playing.  They showed a pickup game there.  And even though with that, which is so the advanced, you can see where this is going,  it's more...  And this is one of your trends out of South by, Jeremy, more things that are...  Jeremiah, I'm sorry.  The Internet of Things.  Things, right?  And things connected to you.  So it even will show you how high you jump.  And you can make a YouTube video.  You can make an iPhone video.  Have somebody pointed at you as you play a basketball shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Will it put your stats on the video?  It will put the stats on the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  Right?  So you have proof that I jumped 18 inches or whatever the heck it is.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay.  That has a high cool factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also got various celebrity jocks to do routines on this.  So Rafa has one for a tennis workout that's not, you know, it's not a tennis workout.  It's an exercise routine.  And you compete against goals on that if you have those shoes and stuff, right?  So you can see where this is going.  Before the Nike Plus was just the thing in your shoe for running.  Now it's got this, which will sync through Bluetooth.  And then it's going to have more, I think, connected things on your clothing or your  shoes at least.  And neat things can come, but it's going to start with basketball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung had a... they sponsored the Blogger Lounge.  And they were showing off some of their TVs that, I mean, this is tying into the Internet  of Things.  Almost all the TVs are Wi-Fi enabled, as you might imagine.  But now they're starting to put facial recognition, gesture recognition, and voice commands.  In fact, even the remote for the Samsung has a mic on board so you can talk to it and you  say, hello, TV.  And then it starts to activate.  And then Chevy was showing off their Wi-Fi networking 4G that they're starting to put  into the volts.  So we're starting to see all these technologies come together, the Internet of Things.  Of Things, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question for you.  For your Ford, I saw a story that there was an update or an upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They shipped to 300,000 MyFordTouch owners.  Because when MyFordTouch came out, it was kind of an upgrade on the Ford Sync, which  I have in my Mustang.  And it got just panned.  Consumer Reports said this is terrible.  Mostly on user interface.  Not on functionality, but just user interface was confusing and difficult.  And to their credit, Ford stepped back and said, yeah, we blew it.  And they're shipping USB keys with...  I haven't tried it because I don't have MyFordTouch.  I have to go out and find one.  With an upgrade to the software, you put it in your USB port in your car and the car upgrades  itself.  Jesus.  Well, and you saw Samsung is one of the companies that are considering hardware module upgrades.  So Samsung wants to realize that you aren't going to buy a new big screen TV every year.  But people become used to the idea of upgrading their phones every year or two, upgrading  their software and operating systems all the time.  So they're starting to put things like the DSP chips that do upscaling and other hardware  components in an upgradable module in the TV so that you can buy next year's Samsung  module and plug it in.  And Ford has talked about this.  I talked to Alan O'Loughlin and asked him about it at CES.  And he said, yeah, we're going to do that for cars too.  So not merely software upgrades, but physical hardware upgrades that you drive to the dealer,  they plug it in, and now you've got the 2013.  So it is interesting.  It's where personal computer technology or personal electronics have influenced durable  goods significantly.  That's why you're seeing apps and TVs and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So one of the I work at a research firm, Altimeter, and one of the research themes we're going  to be looking at this year is on around this thing of Internet of Things and big data.  And the research question we're asking, and I love to hear everybody's opinion, is in  who's smarter, a college graduate or tomorrow's refrigerator?  And I think we can actually make the argument that tomorrow's refrigerator is smarter than  a college graduate.  Why?  Well, it can save self-maintain itself, self-clean itself.  It can order in food and feed itself and know what's for dinner next week.  And I don't know if college graduates can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Certainly college freshmen, I would say.  Maybe if you graduate from college, you'll learn how to clean yourself.  But yeah, I agree with you.  My daughter will be a sophomore next year.  I completely know.  Cleaning is not number one, two, three or four.  Wow.  I don't know.  You know, we've talked for years about this smart refrigerators.  In fact, I can remember CESs and even Comdexes where companies, Samsung this year showed  refrigerators with screens.  Remember all this has been going on for years.  The Audrey, remember that was the kitchen computer.  And it's always flopped.  It's always flopped.  You know, I'm back to my.  This is where this was off the air, but I showed people before the show started.  This is how I do a grocery list.  It's called a piece of paper.  Okay.  That were worried.  What you're going to have me ask?  Yeah, but the chat room already knows.  That already knows.  Yeah.  This is you put a piece of you put an adding role in here and you write down your grocery  list.  This works so much better, I have to say, because it's so tedious and time consuming  to enter a list into a device.  As you know that, Gina, that's why you did to do that text.  It's text based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's even a little holder right here for your stylus.  I mean, stylus.  Yeah, right.  Stylus.  Sorry.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where's the stylus?  Where did the batteries go in?  Sometimes I think we can overdo it, can't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well if people are going to buy it, somebody's going to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Actually, this was hard to find.  Only the Germans can do this.  I bought, oh, get ready for this.  I bought a grocery list computer.  A couple of years ago it came out.  You talk to it and it was such a pain in the butt.  Milk, milk, 2% milk.  And your list was just confusing as heck.  So I gave up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a computer dedicated to your grocery list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes.  What was that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it a computer on your refrigerator?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I'm sure they stopped making it.  So which grade level do you think that one was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well it was an interesting idea.  Smart Shopper was called.  And they still sell it.  So if you all want to run out and get one.  Grocery list organizer with embedded thermal printer.  Now you're laughing at me for spending $38 or whatever it was on this.  This was $150 and I bought it.  I think I bought one for my mom too.  And you talked to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, thank you dear.  I'm sure I'll use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It drove her crazy.  You press the button and you say milk.  There's some intelligence.  It could perhaps sort it into aisles of the grocery store.  Is it voice to text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But not very good.  I mean that's the problem.  All of this promises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I need.  I need GPS for the grocery store because the grocery store layout makes no sense to me  for the rare times that I ever shop.  They still sell this.  Well you know, Jeff, the groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I work with some of these retailers.  The grocery stores are designed for you to traverse the whole store on an average.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  They don't want you to go right to what you want.  Anyone in the Vegas hotel wants you.  I was just going to say a Vegas hotel.  To get to the cab line without going through the casino.  Right.  Exit through the gift shop, I believe is the term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you guys want to know another crazy trend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is good.  You know all the secrets of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I work with big corporations all the time.  And so strategizing things like that?  Yeah, I do research and then our company helps them.  Charlene Lee, Brian Solis, we all work together.  I know Brian.  Yeah, he's great.  You should have them on the show.  I should too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You had trouble getting home from South By, I understand.  And it all comes down to this.  We're going to take a break and we're going to find out why Jeremiah Ouyang is now on the no-fly list.  Jeremiah is with the Altimeter Group.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani also here.  More to come.  In fact, there's some actual Google news.  But we wanted to get that.  We wanted to make sure that nobody had FOMO for South By.  No FOMO.  You feel better now, don't you?  It was rainy.  I do.  It was cold.  I didn't talk to anybody because they were all huddled.  Except we hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeremiah, your point is about all the marketing people and company people there, which is what we've seen.  And you know what?  That's okay.  That's where you go.  A lot of executives there.  Wait a minute.  What amazed me about South By was that I never gave away business cards there.  And I think it's more of a business card place now, eh?  Yeah.  It is.  It used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of executives.  I hosted an executive cocktail session.  There's a lot of corporations, a lot of branding.  But this is a sign that this business...  Leo DiCaprio was there?  Yeah, so here's the other trend.  The celebs are here now at South By, interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Another reason I don't want to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we saw Leonardo DiCaprio.  We saw Tobey Maguire.  Really?  I'd like to meet that.  Jimmy Fallon was in the W.  He held the elevator open for my wife and was a gentleman, apparently.  Nice.  So they're all investing in companies like Mobly and what have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're looking at Ashton Kutcher, of all things.  I'm sorry, I'm eating pie.  I thought it was a break.  Ashton Kutcher is a thought leader in Hollywood.  Who would have thunk it?  Who would have thunk it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They all go for interactive and stick around for movies and music as well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jimmy was in for just 24 hours apparently.  Wow.  And then Jay-Z, George Clinton was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  George Clinton, the Funkadelic?  Yeah.  Parliament Funkadelic?  You even know who that is.  I'm so impressed.  I'm so impressed.  See, we're not the only oldsters here.  Jay-Z, really?  Jay-Z was there yesterday.  He was in an Austin state of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the biggest change for this though, Leo, is that the celebrities are not really Kevin  Rose and Mark Zuckerberg anymore.  Right.  Celebrities are actually celebrities and Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're actual celebrities.  No, you're still a celebrity.  Instead of the Erzats celebrities.  Well, yeah, no, Dignation didn't do its big event at Stubbs because they're defunct.  Leo Laporte, Funkadelic.  I think Kevin did not go to South By as a matter of fact.  I didn't hear about it.  He did not go.  No, in fact, I remember him tweeting from the Samovar T-Lounge saying, am I missing  anything?  So I think he did not even go.  Times are changing and I don't know if it's good.  I think it's bad.  Let's talk about...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, you want to make your own South By using video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  We're distributed now.  We have the technology.  We could do it anywhere.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Did you see Zuckerberg?  Was he there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I did not see him.  I know who was there though.  Sean Fanning was there.  I'm sure.  Sean Parker was there.  That's what I meant.  Sean Parker, not Sean Fanning.  Sean Parker was there.  In fact, Sean Parker had a party.  Who was it with?  With another, with like a real celebrity at South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Sean Parker was interviewed by Al Gore and I watched the Twitter feed and it was  like all these controversial interviews at South By Southwest over the years of Mark,  of...  Yeah, it was Al Gore.  That's who it was.  Yeah.  The problem was everybody said, why doesn't he ask a question?  It's exactly the problem with every one of these interview sessions.  The interviewer never asks questions.  Because he's Sean Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's not a professional trained journalist.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Al Gore who was supposed to interview Sean.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wow.  Talk about the world.  So the former vice president of the United States, the guy who was almost elected president  of the United States but missed by a hundred votes was interviewing Sean Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Go to your commercial.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a quick break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Elephants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elephants.  Today I found an elephant can for you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The weather's so much nicer there.  Where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's near Geno.  Yeah, down the road from me.  You can go say hi.  I can.  I should.  I should bring them pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bring elephants pie.  Those elephants are quite something down there.  They have a very nice playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do.  The Safari Park is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like the wild.  And then you drive through it in a specially designed car that repels monkey poop.  It's a poopaphobic car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Five minutes to pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay.  Thank you, Jeff, for keeping track.  We're looking for 159, right?  And it'll be 314-1519.  No, wait a minute.  Should we wait to 1539?  Or should we go 159?  Oh, forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Moving along to another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  No, you were going to tell us why this put you on the no-fly.  It's you not on the no-fly list, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not on the no-fly.  It was late.  It was like midnight.  And you know how Sixth Street's pretty crazy, right, Leo?  And the college students come down, make intermix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because they want to...  That's one of the things that happens at South By is suddenly there's all these college kids  there too.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're a little rowdy.  Yes, very rowdy.  So I was walking by myself to grab some pizza from, I forget what the name of that, Ropolo's.  You know that place.  Ropolo's, oh yeah.  I was by myself.  And whenever I travel, I travel a lot, I always bring this with me.  This is a little LED.  It's incredibly bright.  This is 300 lumens.  I love that flashlight.  So this can blind somebody in the dark.  And there's another feature, which is the strobe on it.  Sorry guys.  But essentially...  Eileen, do you have epilepsy?  I think Eileen just had a seizure.  I always carry this with me just because I never know where I'm going to be.  And I'm a little nerd, right?  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I think it's great to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you can't take a knife or anything on the airplane.  Anyways, so I was walking towards Sixth Street and then I saw this bustling happening.  And then I saw one guy put another guy there kind of drunk in a headlock.  Two other guys came up.  What?  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  I was just having...  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm paying attention.  And these guys, they were punching him in the face.  It's hard for me to tell the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Welcome to Twit, Jeremiah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I'll focus on this.  And then they were fighting and it's starting to get really brutal.  That's not good.  And then the guy was getting pummeled on the ground, kicked in the face.  Oh, Jeremiah.  And so I shined the flashlight on the guys.  And this is the most amazing thing because it's a really bright flashlight and it's as  bright as a cop's flashlight.  And then the guy instinctively, he went like this.  What?  And he put his hands up and he stopped.  And the guy who was getting assailed turned around and threw a couple punches.  Some of them landed, some of them didn't.  So this light in a way turned the tide of the battle.  And then the cops came rushing in with pepper spray and stock theory guys.  And then I just kind of made an exit really carefully.  So the moral of the story is the pen light is miter than the sword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Miter than the bullies.  Although if you'd had a sword, you could have chopped his head right off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not a violent person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which one is this?  This is the Phoenix PD-31.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PD-31.  I bought this.  I bought one for Charlene Benpar, who says hi, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Brian Solis.  I bought some for my friends as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're like the Johnny Appleseed of flashlights.  Of lumens.  Of lumens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very, very, it's a lot of fun to have.  Yeah, no, it's good to have a good flashlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This company makes a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With lumens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I come betting lumens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you guys carry flashlights on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do.  A little one though, not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a little one on my keys.  I have that one too, that 920.  You all geeked me out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why do you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't carry a flashlight.  I can barely remember my keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need one for your keychain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, but the reason I carry a flashlight is because I'm waiting for the  zombie apocalypse and I know the first thing the zombies do is they cut the power.  Oh, right.  And we all live in places, we forget, but because we're civilized, quote, we live in  places that if there is no power, we'll be pitch black, right?  There's no light.  Now here, that's why I cleverly designed the studio with portholes to the outside world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  But at night.  I don't need a flashlight.  You've got that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've got an iPhone light.  I actually, it's pretty funny.  I had a contractor looking, we have some moisture in the crawl space and the contractor was  in there and I said, well, do you need a flashlight?  Because usually contractors usually pull out these big flashlights and he says, no, I got  my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he uses his phone.  The Chilean miners actually got around through the iPhone light.  Really?  The iPod light when they were stuck down there.  Wow.  Just like Jeff.  Jeff, no mining.  So you have the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you held up your phone, it wouldn't have had the same effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No way.  I was 30 yards away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually it might have because you like, I'm, hey dude, I'm going to put this on YouTube.  Might have stopped him as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He might have come and taken your phone.  He said, no, you're not, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a great video though.  Geez, you'd be viral by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could have made some money off of that guy.  You're a social media expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you thinking?  It's pie time.  It's pie time.  Happy pie day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, have some pie.  What would you like?  Would you like a Boston cream?  The one you didn't stick your finger in.  By the way, this is very good.  This is peanut butter.  It has a bananas.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hi.  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a picture.  Pie for all.  The worst excuse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Killing me.  You didn't come prepared, huh?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't.  I didn't.  What?  You didn't come prepared.  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't.  You didn't come prepared.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't.  You didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You didn't.  You didn't.  You didn't.  You didn't.  Why did we not FedEx pie?  Oh, I know why.  Because the last time we FedEx'd you cookies, we couldn't find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I live in the computer.  I live in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They said, no, there's no Gina Trapani in San Diego.  All right.  That's the peak.  For people who want to know, f-e-n-i-x-light.com.  It's the PD31-304 lumens.  And it's powered.  It's LEDs.  It's these Cree LEDs that are so bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have what, the CR123 batteries?  Have you seen those?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's just a regular lithium.  These little dudes.  Oh, look at that.  Camera batteries.  That's a hell of a battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're high output.  These ain't lithium.  These aren't little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are lithium, but they're, wow.  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You carry more than one?  Those are batteries.  So look, so the question is how long does it last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's LED.  It doesn't use much.  They say 200 hours runtime on these batteries.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dual CR123s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Dual CR123s.  All right, there you go.  See, we could zoom in.  Little did I know.  Moving along.  There is news.  Google I.O.!  I bet you we should check.  The registration starts at 7 a.m.  March 27th.  I bet you by 10 a.m.  March 27th it'll be sold out.  That's what happened last year.  It took less than an hour, in fact, to sell out.  This will be interesting though, because apparently somebody told me they've done a  double the price.  To what?  Oh, did I not say what it was?  I didn't say Google I.O.?  I should have mentioned that.  Oh, you did?  Oh, okay.  It's the developers conference, Google developers conference.  And that's the one that Jeff Jarvis feels like he'll be a little old lady to rave.  So, Gina, you and I both got our invites.  We got our press invites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Press pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The reason, Jeff, that you want to go.  Do you go to this, Jeremiah?  I've been to a few.  It's fun.  Last year they had a life-size human labyrinth game that you could, right?  Was there humans in the labyrinth or no?  You were just steered the labyrinth with your Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You steered the labyrinth with an Android device, right?  It was a giant maze, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  They've made in the past, they've made some interesting announcements, none of which have  actually turned into products, and that's always fun.  Well, I'm thinking of the thing where you put your CD.  Remember last year they put your CD on this special thing and then the computer would  know and have all the songs?  You wouldn't even have to rip it?  Oh, God, I forgot that one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  It's a fantasy world.  Yeah, it's fantasy world for geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see that the requirement to register is you have to use Google Plus profile and  Google Wallet?  Are you surprised?  So it makes me wonder, will they eventually announce a developer platform for Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, they need an API.  Gina, you know this.  They have a read-only API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a very limited API, yeah, but there was an invitation to join the kind of the platform  preview, which is basically just subscribes you to a Google group, but it wouldn't surprise  me if there were announcements about that at Google I.O.  It's not for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What else would we like to see besides free stuff?  What else?  Last year...  The glasses.  We want to see the glasses.  We want the glasses.  They also gave out Toshiba Android tablets, 10-inch tablets, and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Samsung.  Samsung.  And then they also gave out a Samsung Chromebook.  Chromebook.  And, as if that weren't enough, a Verizon 4G Mi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's right, the Mi-Fi, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's easy to forget when they give you so much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a lot of loot.  It's typically a lot of loot, which is kind of what the rush to register, I think, is about.  People want the newest stuff, and often the loot kind of almost equals the price of admission,  although I don't know if that will be the case this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, I feel guilty, Jeff.  Should I not accept the loot?  Is that a compromise in my editorial integrity?  If they gave me pie, I'd have no trouble, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, it's all the same to you.  It's all gadgets.  I mean, I did accept this thing free because I couldn't buy it.  I did just plug it and talk about it.  I should have made clear that that was the case if it wasn't.  I think it was.  You did.  Yeah.  We're in such a weird world.  I don't think it's pale at that level.  I really don't, because it's devices you write about as long as you're...  and you're going to be honest about it.  No, I don't think it's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think disclosure is key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I hear that all the time from...  you know, I started with Mike Harrington, but I hear that all the time from people.  As long as it's okay, do anything you want, there's no ethical violations as long as you tell people.  And I still think there's ethical violations in the world.  So we have a policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get lots of free stuff, but we have a policy that we will use it, test it, then I will give it away.  You don't keep it?  Nope.  I've given away thousands of dollars of electronics.  But if I like it enough, I'm going to do the right thing.  I'm going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a good policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I do.  I mean, I owned two Nexus Ones as a result.  Right?  And I gave one to the school, and I liked it, and they bought it.  And yeah.  I bought my Galaxy Note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  God, I bought that.  It was like seven hundred bucks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's funny because you would say, well, wouldn't you love a free phone more?  No.  No, no.  You love your phone if you love it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway.  Yesterday, I have to admit, yesterday I did a session with a big consulting company and  a bunch of major media executives, and then I snuck in somehow, and they were talking  to a certain major technology company, and I didn't get anything for it.  You know, it's the connection, the big guy asks you, you say, OK.  So I did two and a half hours with this group and I thought, OK, at the end, this company  also makes phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I thought, maybe I'll get a phone.  Maybe I'll get something.  Please.  Nothing.  Nothing.  You know, a little thank you gift.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is the funnest part.  And Gina, we didn't have to do this because we got a press invite.  But if you're an actual developer, you have to actually build your invitation.  Wow.  You have to make your own.  So it's almost like an IQ test.  I'll write a passage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I couldn't get this to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, you're out.  Yeah.  Sorry, Gina, we've rescinded your invitation.  Maybe because I'm not on Chrome, should I do this on Chrome?  Oh, there it is.  Whoa, hey.  Hey, it's input-output.  Brush up on your geometry.  Dust off your protractor.  And architect a machine only you could have dreamt of.  Join developers tracking our latest Google experiment for a chance to have your machine  featured at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now, the parts.  Press the space bar play to launch a particle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you're going to, you're building a...  Whoa.  Oh, no.  Try grabbing a redirector from the toolbox to move the particle across to the output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the game apparatus.  Okay, this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a pretty cool invitation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  So do you have like a limited amount of time to do this or you do this now and fit it in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  And then you press play and let's...  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where did the lemmings come out from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Whoa.  Oh, man.  I didn't do it right.  You're out.  No, you get another chance, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please?  Please?  No, Google, no!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You could change the color.  I think you're probably supposed to turn it...  Wouldn't it be cool if...  I think it's got to say Google, right?  If you do it...  I mean, there's no right answer.  It is like apparatus, which is a really fun game.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we've lost Leo now.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's over.  I can't get rid of this thing that I made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elephant time!  Isn't that cool?  Oh, yeah.  Should we check it?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is better!  I do have giraffes.  So, anyway.  You don't have to solve it, or do you?  Maybe you do, to get your invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they kind of hinted at this, right?  That you should brush up on your coding skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at this.  It's got source code.  You can modify the source code.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Somebody's 20% time.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, is that their timer?  That's us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's us violating the copyright of the Jeopardy! show.  A Mark Goodson, Bill Todman production.  Anyway.  You got an elevator, you got a track, you got a wall.  You know there are going to be some wild ones of these on here.  I think this is great.  Are you going to do it, Gina, even though you already have your invite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, heck yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely going to play with that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was pretty dang cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty cool.  But I really want glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, so let's talk about the free stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean the goggles.  These are the Google goggles that have augmented reality.  That as you look around, you'll see peanut butter, banana pie, apple pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will it show the calories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I hope not.  Actually, supposedly it is going to put stuff over people's heads, right?  Like what?  I don't know.  No, but they said they will not turn on the face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm serious, guys.  Should I go?  Yes!  I'm not a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, Gina, I don't think you need to be.  Okay, alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're doing it for this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, he's not saying that.  He just feels like he'll be a fifth wheel because he doesn't speak Python.  It's not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a ton of technical sessions that happen in the afternoons, but the announcements in  the morning are applicable to everyone.  And there's going to be just tons of toys and exhibits and neat things to see.  And candy.  Like that maze thing that they set up last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can go to the Ikea ballroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where is it at this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's always at Moscone, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's at Moscone.  Yeah, so it's the June 27th to the 29th.  They increased it to three days from two days.  I think it's a Wednesday to a Friday, which works for us because the show is on Wednesday.  So we'll do the show probably after the Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We'll fly you out, Jeff.  And then we'll do a show.  We'll go to the keynote.  They usually stream the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They stream all their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we'll have to think about production.  But I guess we could figure out a way to do what we'd like to do as commentary during  keynotes.  But it's hard to do that when you're in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And if you're not in the room, you don't get the goggles.  So screw the commentary.  And then...  No, Jeff, you'll do the commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No! No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  See, now he wants to be the little old lady at the rave.  Now he wants to go!  So we'll figure out a way to do...  We'll stream the thing without commentary and then do a show after or something like that.  We'll figure out a way to do it.  But yeah, if you're out there, it'll be fun.  We could do it from the Samovar tea lounge that's right above there.  You're killing someone right now.  Kevin Rose will show up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And maybe even Ashton Kutcher.  You never know.  The truth is, now that South By and events like that and CES are really dominated by  real celebrities and CNN had the CNN grill and the bald guy interviewing, like all the  people we can never get on Twitter, he's got, you know?  Like Reed Hastings.  And so that's become mainstream.  So now it's the developer conferences that are really where the interest, where the rubber  meets the road.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting too, because apart from the little old lady me, you have to have some cred to  get in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's true too.  Ashton can get an invite to the show.  Which makes it better.  Ashton might not get an invite.  And Vic, please don't invite him because it's going to spoil it for us.  Google is going to do its own...  They've said this all along.  Eric Schmidt said it a year ago.  Its own branded tablet.  According to Digitimes, it will be made by Asus and could be coming by May.  Just in time for Google I.O.  Interesting.  Giveaways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  This could be a giveaway.  I'm a little sad that this seems more like a Kindle competitor than a...  It's pretty low end.  Yeah.  I mean, seven inch.  It looks like just an e-reader more than a full on tablet.  What's the price point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $199 to...  To $249.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Tegra 3, which is a quad core processor, $1280 by $800.  That's pretty high resolution.  And a $250 price point would be pretty competitive.  Asus showed off something similar called the Mimo at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think they want to use it as a media platform, e-reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What do you think they use it as?  I think partly this is because the Kindle drives Google crazy because it is Android,  but at no point does Amazon ever say that or say Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so this could be the Google Play tablet, right?  Yeah.  Oh, play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.  That's why Amazon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  That's why Amazon is the target.  I get it now.  It'll be the...  I mean, in the long run, all right, here's a question for you.  Even though Apple is by far the most viable company in the world and all of that,  when it comes to Google's supposedly bad entertainment strategy,  and we have a story about that today, who should Google be going after, Amazon or Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I think... call me a pie-eyed optimist.  I didn't get any in my eye yet.  But I think that Google should not go after anybody,  but instead just try to make the best damn stuff it can.  And I think that where these companies go wrong is when they start looking over their shoulder  and saying, oh, Facebook, Facebook, we've got to have a strategy.  We've got to do something.  We need a Facebook.  That's where you make a big mistake.  I don't think Apple ever...  This is where Steve Jobs was quite brilliant.  He was aware of the competition, but he did not design his products as a response to anything.  He wanted to lead...  He wanted to lead the pack.  And I think if Larry is going to go wrong at Google,  it's going to be because he says, what's Facebook doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this leads us, does it not, to the farewell letter from the employee today?  Oh, yeah.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is that what he accused them of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of losing... Yeah, kind of losing there.  It was a great day for farewell letters because there was farewell Google,  farewell Goldman Sachs, and farewell the Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I loved the Darth Vader farewell to the Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Andy bowed at one around the Yahoo and the patents too, so there's three today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a great piece.  It was a great, great piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a great piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So where do we start?  So start with the Google farewell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which was posted on a Microsoft blog, an MSDN blog.  Because he got a job at MSDN, right?  Because he works at Microsoft now, right?  So quite a few people kind of brought that up when I posted.  But go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't want to...  I think it was somebody saying that in his view, Google became an advertising company.  It came off a little bit naive to me.  And Google has always been an advertising company.  We complained on the show about Google's lack of focus.  And gee, you know, the good old days when we could just do kind of research for research  and we had 20% time, it sounded like a farewell to Bell Labs.  And I understand every emotion that was in there, absolutely.  But as a Google shareholder, I'm not sure I wasn't happy to read this letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is James Whittaker, who is, according to his bio, a technology executive  focused on making the web a better place for users and developers,  a former Googler, former professor, former startup founder.  And the quote is, you know, the pull quote,  the Google I was passionate about was a technology company  that empowered its employees to innovate.  The Google I left was an advertising company  with a single corporate mandated focus.  Is he talking about that word social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he's talking about advertising, but via social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google Plus gets thrown on and he doesn't like it.  It's a search company, by God.  You know, I've seen this kind of attitude from newspaper people  when the digital people came in. This is the great irony.  Oh, it's not like it used to be. You changed the place.  Well, life has changed, man.  And again, I'm not saying he's wrong about some of the direction.  I'm not saying that I don't empathize with a lot of the emotions  of saying that Google was an incredible place to be, but reality check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nothing can stay that way.  I mean, of course, it's kind of a given that a company  isn't going to stay as it was in the early days,  especially if that company is successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, didn't the executives mandate that the solution to beat Facebook  be shoved down everybody's throats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They did. They said you will get a financial reward.  Your bonus depends on your success in social.  And if not, flogging's at six.  Yeah, until attitudes improve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So with that mindset, it's you have to do this,  and your 20% time, your 10% time, not as important perhaps, making this focus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, somebody spent their 20% on that silly machine, but other than that,  you know, whenever somebody writes a farewell letter to their company,  you know, it's always kind of a mixed bag.  Yeah, it is.  They made the decision to leave, so they're bitter or whatever.  You know, of course they're not happy. That's why they left.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when I read this, I felt kind of sad about it.  We talked a few episodes ago about whether or not Google is as worthy of our love  and trust as it used to be.  That's the question.  We've debated this question a lot here.  I mean, this guy left Google and went to Microsoft.  He started a new blog. This is the only post on his blog.  It seems a little bit kind of like slamming, you know, his former employer,  which makes me kind of question things.  Not that he was slamming them, but you know, this is slamming them.  No, but it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, the whole point of an email like this is,  well, let me tell you what's really going on.  And it colors that because you don't know if it is what's really going on  or just his perception because he's leaving.  Right, his perception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, sometimes, you know, sometimes you're at a job for a long time  and the company hasn't gone bad.  You've just kind of reached your point of, you know.  You're bitter.  Yeah, you've gone through your cycle.  Right.  But he said, you know, the old Google made a fortune on ads  because they had good content.  It was like TV used to be.  Make the best show and you may get the most ad revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  TV was never like that, by the way.  I can tell you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's saying the new Google seems more focused on the commercials themselves.  Instead of making good shows, focus on the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I miss the days of Gilligan's Island, I got to tell you.  Yeah, so you know, he went to a small startup, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, I expect James Whittaker to write a,  Microsoft is not the company it used to be in about a year.  Oh, yeah.  Because I can tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of all companies to go to.  You know, Gina, I think you're way on to something there as always.  The famous peanut butter memo about Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Spreading itself too thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and all that was by someone who was in the inside  and stayed on the inside because he cared about the company  and wanted to write the company.  And was right.  And was right, and all of that, right?  And so I think that that's a key difference.  That's somebody who cares about the company who's saying,  I'm going to give you some tough love here,  and I could get in trouble for it, but by God, I believe in this.  And I have a lot of respect for that, that somebody who says,  I'm gone and everybody should leave with me.  And I, you know, I've been there.  I've left jobs and wished that everybody would leave with me.  Just to prove how right I am.  But companies go on, life goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is read a little bit like the diary of sort of a naive startup employee.  You know, my first job, my first startup job, my first dot com job, I was 23.  And I, you know, it was the first boom and I drank the Kool-Aid  and we were revolutionizing the web and we were making this social network for teenagers,  which didn't make it.  This is pre Facebook.  And, you know, when the first round of layoffs happened, you know,  it just, it just hit everybody because it's like, we're part of this family  and we're part of this movement.  We're doing something bigger than this.  This isn't a company.  Right, this isn't a company.  You're treating it like a company.  Yeah, we're just a family full of hipsters changing the world here.  What do you mean? It's a profit deal?  Right, exactly.  I mean, right.  So it kind of felt like that to me.  You know, that's when I had my, now I was 23.  Right, right.  This person has been in business for much longer.  So he had read a little bit like that, like that rude awakening of like,  oh, this is, you know, for profit.  All right, well, let's look at this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is Greg Sandoval writing for CNET.  Google's entertainment strategy is in disarray.  Google Music no longer exists as a standalone service.  Google TV was an embarrassment.  YouTube may lose music videos next year.  He's talking about Vivo pulling out.  Sources say not everybody at YouTube and Android is pulling in the same direction.  I have to admit this play thing through the, I mean, play books, play apps.  I don't understand.  It really deprecated the app store.  It would confuse the hell out of me.  I don't like that, that new Google Play.  And I think the strategy does look, it doesn't look elegant.  It doesn't, it looks like, it really looks like a me too.  Like, oh, quick, do something.  It doesn't look strategized.  It doesn't look thought out at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you feel like play is, is Google trying to catch up with Amazon and Google plus is Google trying to catch up with Facebook.  And you just feel like they're just kind of imitating.  It's imitative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so that is the criticism I would say.  Yeah, Google is an advertising company.  They always have been.  But they've also been famous for being the smartest guys in the game.  More PhDs than anybody else.  Innovators, brilliant, clever, Gmail, Maps, even Wave, you could argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, Gmail and Maps, those were products that were around.  I mean, MapQuest had the market.  You know, DockerMail and Hotmail were web-based email.  We all thought that just the idea of web-based email was amazing.  Then Gmail launches and it's just like, oh, you know, this idea of unlimited storage.  They did it better.  They did it better.  And search itself.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yahoo was there.  Alza Vista was there.  That's a good point.  So, OK, maybe not innovators, but still smart, right?  They did it better.  And that's what Apple did, by the way.  They weren't the first of anything.  They just made it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And so the key thing that they're not doing right now is maybe not making it better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right.  So copying Facebook isn't wrong.  Just make it better than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talked to somebody this week about Gutenberg.  Sorry.  Drake.  Everybody Drake.  Can I eat pie instead?  The guy who invested in him and took over his business named Johann Foust.  And his great line was, you have to ask yourself, do you want to be first or Foust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're checking your credit.  That is an extremely obscure joke, but I like it.  First, you have to say, you know, by the way, the guy who took over was Foust.  Now, here's the joke.  I Uber geek.  No, it's good.  It's good.  I want everybody to tweet that joke and act as if you don't get it.  You did know that Foust was the guy who took over the business, right?  Google is doing some smart things with Play, the 25 cent movies, 25 cent books.  It certainly draws people in.  I think this is like Amazon's giving away a free app a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Amazon is countering and doing the same thing with the same exact media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to beat Amazon at the merchandising game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Google just needs people to set up their Google Wallet account.  They just need for people to take that dive and make it easy to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Everyone's got that set up with Amazon already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And Google's right to be threatened.  I mean, Vivo leaving YouTube, Vivo was the music label set up a kind of a separate entity within YouTube  for Lady Gaga's videos and all the other videos and drives millions of views every week.  They're going to maybe going to Facebook.  So Google is right to be threatened by some of these platforms.  I mean, Facebook and Amazon threaten Google, don't they?  You know, right where the wallet hits.  Greg says Google might need a content czar.  Is that the solution?  Isn't that what Terry Semel was supposed to be at Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's the exact wrong thing. Right.  It's it's it's it's let's be a studio.  I sat in this in this conference room yesterday with these mockers from entertainment and consultancy and technology.  And I sat there and I thought about you, Leo, because I often do.  It's a little creepy, but OK.  OK. I've been known to say nice things about Leo in front of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really. I'm just teasing you. I love it.  In fact, the main reason I want you to come out to Google, I was going to get that beer.  So we can hug. Yeah, we want to hug a man hug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, man hug. Bro hug.  Anyway, so I sat there and I thought here are all the people who want to stand in between.  And they do stand in between the creator and their public, their market, their audience.  Right. And and they all think they're adding this great value, but they're not.  Right. And I want it.  You know, and they're all thinking about the networks and distributors and the technology and the this and that.  I just wanted I didn't because I'm a wimp and I was hoping I was going to get a free phone.  I wanted to scream. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. You're not adding value. Middlemen don't add value.  Middlemen think they add value. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if they're needed, they think channels are needed.  And I'm saying channels are needed. Well, OK, so the press channels will die.  But there's still always you need channels. No, you don't.  Look at Leo. Look at Leo.  And it just frustrated the hell out of me because I didn't do anything about it.  I ate their free fruit and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And now after the fruit has been digested, you're going after them and remotely.  So the I'm going to do one more story.  This is a feel good story and then we'll get a commercial and we'll talk some more.  I'm having a great time. I hope you want to. Please.  I'm sure you're not. Leo is sugar. I'm sure you're not.  Maybe Jeff Jarvis is here from Buzz Machine Dotcom.  Jeremiah Oyang from Altimeter Group, Gina Trepan.  From SmarterWear Dot Org, the FBI stumped by a pimps Android lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So warrant on Google. Greatest one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In 2005, San Diego's Dante Dears. Do you know him?  I don't know. Sentenced to state prison for founding and running a group called Pimpin' Hose Daily or PHD.  Read what follows that. It's so great. I just wanted to say it.  The name wasn't braggadocio. It was mere description.  Before Dears pled guilty in the middle of 2005, one minor female testified how Dears had recruited her out of a homeless shelter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He told me he was going to help take care of me and be there for me.  He told me what to do and how to do it and said we would make money that way.  I'm tired of living on the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, it's a long, tearful saga.  He beat her up, blah, blah, blah. Of course.  She was only 15. Sad. Sad.  He went to prison. He got out in 2009, violated parole, three separate occasions, went back to jail for a year and a half.  This is not a nice guy.  He released May 2011, went back to the old activities, even though he had a GPS monitor.  He used a Samsung Android phone, great ad, for Samsung to continue pimping via phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Telephone pimping, they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The phone of power. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  An FBI source met with him in his apartment in Chula Vista for nearly three hours during that time.  He watched Dears taking several telephone calls where he discussed the night's prostitution activities, sent multiple text messages.  Really, they do all these ads like the little girl with a lemonade stand making a bit.  I love this guy. Just amazing what you can do with a Samsung phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pimping holes daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PhD.  They used to say, don't make me feel, you don't want to feel my backhand. Now they say, you don't want to feel my backslash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they followed him around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think my foos joke was trying to change the shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know. This is the day of bad.  The FBI put the target under physical surveillance and observed him one night using the phone frequently for a period of nearly six hours.  Despite the fact he denied even owning a cell phone for months to his parole agent, when confronted with the evidence, he said, that's my sister's phone.  Eventually, they got it.  He turned it over to the parole agent, but he didn't unlock it.  He didn't unlock it.  The FBI got a search warrant.  They took the parole agent.  They sent it to the FBI regional computer forensics lab.  There, technicians, quote, attempted to gain access to the contents of the memory of the cellular telephone in question, but were unable to do so because Android's pattern lock.  A little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the FBI couldn't get through Android's pattern lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, what happened is they tried.  They were like monkeys.  They tried and they locked the phone, right?  Ten times.  That's it.  You're out.  And now they needed his Google account credentials and they wouldn't give it to him.  So they get a warrant and they serve.  They serve Google.  Saying we want the subscribers name address, social security number, account login, password, all email, personal contact information for cellular phone, time and duration of every web page visited all text messages sent received from the phone, including photo and video messages.  This is from Google.  I don't know why Google would know some of this.  Any email addresses or instant messenger accounts used on the phone verbal and are written instructions for overriding the pattern lock installed on the phone.  All search terms, Internet history and GPS data that Google has stored for the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, the FBI can't get that from like the networks.  Well, they have to go through Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no reason why Google should have a social security number unless he is a developer accepting payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's actually stunning that these this this FBI regional computer forensics lab.  Yeah, that scares me.  Like monkeys.  They go, well, let's try that.  No, that's not it.  Let's try that.  No, that's not it.  And ten times later, the phone locks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it must be iPhone users kind of encryption secrecy.  No, no, no trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They just subpoenaed.  Google says, like all law abiding companies, we comply with valid legal processes.  However, whenever we receive requests like this, we make sure it meets both the letter and spirit of the law before complying.  And if we believe a request is overly broad, we'll seek to narrow it.  So I guess they'll go back to court and say, hey, dude, we'll give you the password.  But what do you want here?  A U.S. judge.  So there was some debate over whether that phone, since it was still operating, that would have been a wiretap.  Well, yeah, there is a privacy.  So they some people say, well, they should really get a wiretap order.  But a judge disagreed and he said, no, it's a search warrant.  And go ahead.  So unknown what will happen, but that's an interesting.  But just you know what the bottom the takeaway is that pattern is pretty good.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to set that up.  I've been kind of lazy.  I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I always Dvorak always thought because he'd say, well, I could just tell the smudges.  I could see what your pattern is.  So make sure you clean your screen.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Make sure that guy had clean hands, clean hands, pimping, hosed.  I'm sorry that it's a silly story, but I just I couldn't resist.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more with Jeremiah, Gina and Jeff.  Wait a minute.  It's the show.  My name is Geo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeremiah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I like that.  It's got a little certain alliteration.  Jeremiah, Gina and Jeff.  The show brought to you by our friends at carbonite online backup.  You know, I mean, if we're talking about the cloud, you know, the cloud is great for backup,  right?  If you were going to use a backup service with the cloud, what would you want?  It should be automatic.  You shouldn't have to think about it.  Continuous whenever you're online, right?  Encrypted in two ways.  SSL, of course, so that, you know, you could be using it in an open access spot and it  would be completely safe, right?  But you should also be able to encrypt it using your own keys.  Yes.  And it should be unlimited for an affordable price.  Could you?  Is there?  Is it possible?  Could it?  Is there anybody who could do that?  Yes.  Carbonite, automatic, continuous, unlimited, less than five bucks a month for everything  on your internal drive.  You want to use external drives, multiple computers.  I've got plans for that.  Also very reasonable.  Encrypted with SSL and you hold the key for the public key cryptography.  If you want to further encrypt it, they'll do it for you and you hold the key.  No judge can get it.  No, no, no order.  It's secure.  So if you're pimpin' hoes daily, this is...  No, I'm just joking.  Carbonite.com.  Right now, if you try it for free, you just need the offer code twig.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  Just the offer code twig.  Try it for 15 days.  If you decide you like it, $59 a month, less than five bucks a month, and you'll get 14  months for the price of 12, so you get two free months.  You have to use the offer code twig for this week in Google.  These guys know how to do it.  They really do it right.  I was actually talking to David Friend, the CEO, and he said we get subpoenas sometimes  from law enforcement.  We got a subpoena the other day and we said, we don't have the key.  It's encrypted.  Subpoena all you want.  You got to ask the guy because we don't have the key.  I like that.  That's what you're looking for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to get a flood of pimps and hoes.  No.  You know what the issue is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is what came up with Dropbox is, well, if the company has the key, then a rogue employee  could presumably look at your data.  Right?  So you don't want the company to have the key.  It's not about avoiding law enforcement.  Sorry, that was not a good addition to a company.  No, I started it.  I started it.  It's not for doing illegal things with.  It's the eye, the point being that your privacy is protected even at the company.  FTC is seeking Apple's testimony.  Oh, this is good.  In the Google antitrust probe.  This is silly, isn't it?  I wonder what Apple thinks.  Do you think Apple has an opinion about Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's hold Google up and you can punch him in the stomach.  Hey, Jeremiah, we need you along with the flashlight to stop this fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This goes back to not the thing that actually would be relevant, which is Google's use of an  eye frame, you know, hidden form to get around the third party cookie thing.  This has to do with the default search engine on the iPhone.  They've subpoenaed Apple in hopes of getting details about its mobile search deal with Google,  information on the agreement, if any, that has made Google the default search engine on the  iPhone, iPad and Apple.  Why didn't you use Bing?  Yeah.  Why did you do that, Apple?  Did Google give you money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, Safari, the default as I was looking is also Google, too.  So I don't understand how this is any different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's reasonable to ask, did Google make a side deal with you?  It's not illegal, by the way, to do that, right?  I mean, that happens all the time.  Yeah.  And in fact, what they should probably be asking, I don't know if I should help them,  but what they should probably be asking is, do you make money off of using Google as your  default search engine?  Because the answer to that is yes.  Whether they made a deal or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that like Firefox's biggest revenue generator?  That's what keeps Mozilla alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's millions a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They didn't ask that.  The subpoena which Apple did not confirm or comment is part of a larger investigation by  the FTC to figure out whether Google has used unfair or deceptive business practices.  Sounds like a fishing expedition to me.  Yeah.  Or it doesn't ever.  India, not happy about Google either.  Censorship.  Yeah.  That rears a tab.  Yes, exactly.  This is both Facebook and Google are on trial in India over not censoring.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things that are considered indecent.  And there was a recent law that was kind of pulled back there, but it threatens to get  bad.  It's the ongoing fight against the free internet, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's interesting because this is actually a lawsuit by an Indian journalist, a criminal  complaint against Google, Facebook, and 10 other firms saying their lack of censorship  will corrupt minds.  Wow.  It's just a different, you know, maybe it's cultural.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to buy that.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to buy that.  That's a controlling thing from people who want to stop you from thinking the way you  want to think.  And that's universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google and Facebook both say, yeah, we'll block content, but you have to notify us of  infringement.  We'll do it for copyright reasons.  India has an information technology law, which these companies claim protects them against  content added to sites by users.  I would guess it's a safe harbor kind of a provision like our DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We saw the same thing in China with Google and Yahoo just a few years ago.  But they caved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Actually, they didn't cave.  Well, there's a lot of pressure.  They got out.  They said, see you later.  What do you think about this Yahoo Facebook lawsuit?  Tell me about this one.  Oh, you don't know about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you're talking about the patents, the Andy Bio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yahoo says we invented social.  What do you we invented social networking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you read Andy's post, which I think was very clever, he also stated that this was  done during a quiet period before IPO.  So it's a strategic time to raise scrutiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook's IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hmm.  So they're sitting on this waiting for.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's even sleazier.  That's like, oh, we could tank this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You read the piece, the notion of being being weaponized, the patents being weaponized is  just a great.  That's great.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a great headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a great story.  And, you know, Andy's my co-worker at Expert Labs.  He did such a great job on this piece.  I mean, he's basically saying that he, you know, his company upcoming was acquired by  Yahoo, a three person startup.  And he gets a Yahoo and they say they kind of sit down all kind of the new acquisitions,  the new people on the team and say, hey, you know, we'll we want you to file patents.  We want to do this because we'll use them defensively.  We want you to kind of own your own your work and it's good for the company and we'll give  you a little bonus if you do so.  And so, you know, he's kind of a new Yahoo employee.  And he says, you know, sure.  OK, so he files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This was this was upcoming.org was his company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Upcoming.org was his was his.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I loved it.  I'm so sad that Yahoo just clobbered it.  Well, he does so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the patents have his name on them.  And now they're being used not defensively the way that he was told they would be used,  but offensively.  He said, I'm embarrassed.  I'm embarrassed that these parents have patents have my name on them.  They're being used in a way that I was told that they wouldn't be used.  And I will never he he went as far as to say, I will never file another patent again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yahoo had a patent incentive program with sizable bonuses.  If you patented the work that you had done at the company, even if you didn't do it at Yahoo,  all these upcoming patents were when upcoming wasn't yet acquired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was fantasizing whether Andy had a suit against Yahoo for a kind of fraud,  fraudulent acquisition of his patent.  They promised him the patent that he would only be used in this one way.  They use the use patents now in a different way.  Chris promised his own patent wasn't wasn't part of this fight against.  No, but he did file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think he said eight.  He said, I was naive, even if the original intent was truly defensive.  And this is an important point, too.  A patent portfolio can easily change hands and a company can even more easily change its mind.  Since I left in 2007, Yahoo's had three CEOs and a board overhaul.  So it may be that the the intent was at the time this is just defensive.  And in fact, it's good business. You know what?  I think you could say I should probably do it's good business.  We should have patents on this stuff, not because we're going to sue anybody, but defensively.  It's just good business.  But the problem is, and Andy points this out, there's no guarantee it's going to stay defensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about this. What patents could could twit file?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although I think there's probably quite a few process patents we could go after in our workflow and stuff.  Dvorak always told me, he said, the value in your company is not the value is not the content, the values, not the people.  The value is in the workflow.  He said, you'll see if you sell this company, if you make any money on this company,  it will be because you figure out a way to do ABCD in such a way that a company like CBS or somebody would want to buy.  And so he always said patent at all. I'm not in it for money.  I'm just I'm just here to have a good time.  You're into it for the pie.  I'm in it for the pie. I feel so sorry for Andy because he's a great guy and I think he's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was a well done piece.  Glad he wrote that. Glad he wrote that.  So Leo, you wouldn't patent it then, your workflow at Twit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I'm with Andy when he says he he says patents.  This is these are bad. Ask any programmer developing software is as creative and unique as writing poetry.  Yahoo's lawsuit against Facebook is an insult to the talented engineers who filed patents with the understanding they wouldn't be used for evil.  I'm embarrassed by the patents I filed, but I've learned from my mistake.  I'll never as you said, I'll never file a software patent again.  And I urge you to do the same argument for you.  Well, that's what I'm saying is it could very well be that Yahoo did have all the best intentions when this patent incentive program was created.  And it is good business. You cannot deny it's good business.  If the look if you don't like software patents, change the law.  But if the but the but the law is the way it is.  And it in every business has a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders to act within the law in its best interest.  So if we have patent law, I mean, this, by the way, this is me arguing that because I don't believe this because I wouldn't do it just because I don't want to be evil.  But I can it's perfectly legitimate for a company act, especially a publicly held company like Yahoo.  They have a fiduciary responsibility to act in their best interest in accordance with the law.  So the problem is the law, not Yahoo.  Although I'm sad that Yahoo's suing Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is a problem here with Yahoo's behavior.  Yahoo didn't have to do this.  Yahoo didn't have to do this at this time.  This is sleazy and evil.  So I would say that, you know, my joke about this was the Yahoo finally found a business model like a Winklevile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yahoo 360 didn't pan out.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Such a shame.  360. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  Fire Eagle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the Winklevile to join the board.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think there's a new verb.  They're Winklevile.  Who's board?  This is we have to create a new word.  If you can't innovate Winklevile.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah.  Those who don't innovate Winklevile.  I like it.  I think we've done everything.  But we haven't.  We meant you mentioned it, but we probably should read Darth Vader's.  Parody.  His goodbye to the Empire.  We have to give the context first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to maybe Jeff can talk about the Goldman Sachsman thing.  There was another one.  So we talked about the Google one.  There's another there's a Goldman Sachs one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, the coach of the Knicks just issued his farewell letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why he's leaving the Knicks.  Why?  He didn't capitalize on Linsanity.  And now we have a Goldman Sachs executive who said that Goldman Sachs had lost all its culture.  The tone in a lot of ways is somewhat similar to the Google letter.  But I think I'm probably more sympathetic than the Goldman Sachs guy doing it, though, by the way, it was filled with some obnoxious egotistical things about how he was a ping pong champion and another stuff.  Jesus, I am master of the universe.  But anyway, so he wrote this letter and appeared as an op ed in the New York Times and Goldman Sachs stock went down.  It's been wow.  But it's been a lot of money.  And Goldman Sachs stock went down.  It's been the top Twitter and the whole world.  And, you know, at a time when we think the Goldman Sachs and other banks are pretty damned evil, it's truly preaching to the choir.  So it's in that context that George Vader leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I can't you know, for some reason, it's not coming up.  It's a it's you can read it, folks.  It's at the DailyMash.co.uk.  And I don't know if the site's down or did you read the Goldman Sachs response?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Yeah.  So they responded.  And it's interesting.  The response was very cleverly crafted through CorpCom, obviously.  But they didn't mention the person's name.  We do not appreciate people talking on behalf of the 30,000 of us who are very ethical.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So good response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a pretty lengthy response that was well written.  But it was still a little bit late.  You know, this thing blew up pretty big.  So the question is, and I love to hear Jeff Geno's thoughts is, are we going to see this every time we change a job?  Everybody's going to go submit to Mashable or really?  Right. I'm changing jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot beat Stuart Butterfield's great departure.  That's true. That's a classic.  That's the way to do a farewell letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stuart was one of the founders of Flickr.  And I do remember that letter.  It was funny, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just looked it up too darn it.  Let me see if I can find it.  I don't remember.  If you look up Stuart Butterfield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Resignation letter.  Here it is in Google.  Thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did he mention peanut butter at all?  No, this is even better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Tin.  Tin. It's all about tin.  Let me see if I can find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Truthfully, I like to read.  I like to hear the real reasons why people leave instead of all the platitudes about wanting to spend more time with family.  Yeah, that's better than that.  I like it.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He writes to Brad Garlinghouse, who I guess was probably some executive at Yahoo.  Dear Brad, as you know, tin is in my blood.  For generations, my family has worked with this most useful of metals.  When I joined Yahoo back in 21, it was a cheat tin concern of great momentum, growth and innovation.  I knew it was the place for me over the decades as the company grew and expanded first into dyes and punches, into copper, corrugated steel, synthesized rubber, piping, milling equipment, engines, instruments, weaponry and so on.  I still felt at home because tin was at the core of the business.  After the wars, we continued to branch out in electronics, all manner of aeronautical frames, hulls, bodies, computing, tabulating machines, precision controls, and later real estate, brewing, consumer finance, grain processing, lighting and salty snacks.  I took it in stride, for there still was a place for me.  Since the late 80s, as the general manufacturing, oil exploration, refining, logistics and hotel and casino divisions rose to prominence, I felt somewhat sidelined.  By the time of the internet revolution and our expansion into websites, I have been cast adrift.  I tried to roll with the times, but Nari, a sheet of tin, has rolled out of our own production lines in over 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that's the way to say goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nari, a sheet of tin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nari, please accept my resignation.  And I don't need no fancy parties or gold watches. I still have the one from 61 and 76.  I'll be spending more time with my family, tending to my small but growing alpaca herd, and of course, getting back to work with tin, my first love.  What has Stewart done since?  Katarina's been very active. I don't know if Stewart's...  Katarina, yeah. I don't know what he's been doing, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, that's a safe way to exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The way that some other folks are exiting, I think, could hurt their employment options.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You don't want to really be the disgruntled.  Nobody hires a disgruntled employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I always done blog posts when I'm exiting my company's bot. I always let my executive team review it before I publish it.  Oh, that's smart. That's smart.  I want to be gracious. I even offered to help them find my replacement in my last company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just slink off quietly my tail between my legs, my head hung in humiliation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When's the last time you needed a resume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, I don't think I ever have done that.  People like Google, but not what it's doing. Survey says the Pew Internet project...  Privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff has already signed heavily.  Jeff, it's so creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They love it. 83% of search users prefer Google.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's what Apple should say.  Back to that entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's imagine Google's answer to this. Google's answer to this is very simple.  So fine, somebody asks you a question where something bothers you.  Google's going to say, go with the behavior.  The behavior speaks otherwise.  If people didn't like Google, they wouldn't use Google.  And yet the survey says...  It wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  73% said data mining for the purpose of personalizing search results is not okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, and how loaded can you make that question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That is kind of a loaded question.  If a search engine kept track of what you search for and then used that information to personalize your future search results, how would you feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Google could give you better search results for what you actually want, would you be happy?  Based on previous searches.  Exactly.  Do you care about how they did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want more accurate research results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These guys ought to know better. This is a reputable or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We ought to force everyone to watch that magnificent, magnificent video that's on there.  I loved it.  From the search meeting.  Did you see that?  Oh yeah, let's pull that one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From what?  There's a link in there.  I thought they were supposed to be wearing robes and having...  In the right column I said I loved this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'll find it. I'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a video, unprecedented video glimpse into how Google crafts its search results from search engine land.  And it's eight minutes long. We're obviously not going to watch it.  There it is.  It is phenomenal in the detail that they go in for one change.  Sausage making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is an actual meeting at Google?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes. They allowed it. He says at the beginning, if this video isn't any good...  And he said if I look bad, we're not putting it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can you just turn up the audio briefly? Just kind of curious.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Enjoying that. That must be the elephants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.  I'll do it here. I got it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They annotated a lot on the screen so you can figure out what's what.  I think I've got it now.  This is a good place to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they're working on spelling corrections.  Look at the size of this meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To keep our latency low, spelling has...  This guy's back to business.  ...attracted 10 terms in long queries.  He's photo poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Isn't that Sheldon from Big Bang Theory?  I do believe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a lot richer than you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ...who decided that we could be a little bit more intelligent about this.  And so we're going to pick the two words that we think are most likely to be misspelled in the query  and form intervals of five words...  Oh yeah, there's Matt Cutts all the way in the left.  ...and this is just a smarter way of deciding which words to correct.  So your context is the five words rather than the whole 10 words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what's interesting is this sounds like this is a meeting to introduce a feature,  and they're being judged basically by...  They're doing quality assurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this. I cannot wait to watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It looks like a congressional testimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it reminds me of the page one meeting of the New York Times.  It's that kind of meeting where you're trying to prove this, everybody can have their say.  And what I love about that, in contrast to that stupid poll, and Pew is brilliant and they're wonderful,  and I love Pew, but this one they got off, I think, is that...  It's what you're saying to people is, do you want it to be better? Yes.  Do you really care how it's done? No.  If you really care, well, we could show you this. We could show you how it's done.  But you don't really want that, do you? Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This kind of transparency is what you and I are all about, isn't it?  Yes. It's like, stop hiding, no more smoke-filled rooms, and trust the audience to make the decision.  The problem is, of course, nobody does trust people, and frankly, they're probably right,  but I just think putting out this kind of video is exactly the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's wonderful. And from a geek level, it also made me say, is this what it's going to be like to go to I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No. I wish!  But wouldn't it be great if Google, Colleen Kelly, who did all our streaming,  was our chief engineer for many years, now works at Google, is in charge of their live streaming.  I think she's actually been moved to the YouTube division. Wouldn't it be great?  Colleen, from now on, all Google meetings, just broadcast them live. Just put them on YouTube.  We can watch it. Just stream them all. No more NDAs.  No more NDAs, fresh air, transparency. In fact, that's how government should be run.  That's how businesses should be run. No more private board meetings. Let it all hang out, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What would be their competitive advantage to other companies? Ah, screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're spying on you already anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. That's exactly the point. Would you rather be known as the company that has secrets  or the company that trusts you and you have trust in?  Trust the user. Trust your customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on what type of product we're talking about.  So if this is where Google still has a lot of information about us,  so I don't want them exposing any potential security risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's true. Right? That's true. So their security meetings can be private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Eric Schmidt argues that Google is as transparent as it can be. Right. Right.  Which I get why he's saying that. It's obviously not true.  Does exposing how they do this misspelling thing allow a spammer to come in?  God knows. Spammers are clever enough, maybe, but I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And search engine marketers are dissecting that video as you over-pie right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We broadcast almost everything that goes on on Twitter.  We have an hour, a show every week, a weekly show that we talk about everything, including finances.  Really? Yeah, there are very few private...  Your finances. Yeah.  There are very few private things that happen on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I screech, really, what I meant to say is what do you...what's the rule?  Everybody goes in the meeting knowing these are the things you don't talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, the only rule is if somebody says, I don't want this broadcast, we don't do it.  Oh, I see. Okay.  But as long...but my prep...as everybody, much to my chagrin here, knows, my preference is to broadcast everything.  Most people don't want everything broadcast. So we're working on it.  I mean, there are a lot of meetings that we have that I think should be broadcast.  But, you know, whenever I do interviews or whatever, I'd say, can I leave the cameras on?  So we do as much...we're like Eric Schmidt. I do as much as I can.  Yeah.  There's no competitive advantage to anybody knowing everything we're doing.  So when we don't turn on the cameras, it's more about personal...it's more about what you were talking about, Jeremiah,  protecting people's personal, private lives and things like that.  Which always gets in my way. I don't know why people have private lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People and their damn private lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, we do this week in Twitter every Saturday at about...usually it depends.  Right after the weekly daily because it was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Lisa and I,  and sometimes others will come by at 4 p.m. Pacific and we'll talk about what's going on on Twitter.  What's your day off, Leo?  Monday and Friday.  That's weird, Leo.  I know. And by the way, we take questions from the chat room.  Much of that show is just people asking us and we responding to questions in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why do you take Monday off? Isn't that a big media news day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know. Because I work so hard on the weekends.  Our big day is Sunday because our shows are most listened to one day.  You're in Washington.  And I'm here. I'm here almost every day.  We're going to end with a happy ending. We have to have a happy ending.  Right Heaven is a copyright troll law firm, according to Law and Disorder David Kravitz writing for...  actually for Wired.com.  They attempt to make money for newspapers by suing readers for sharing stories online.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Last Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the Las Vegas company to forfeit all of its intellectual property  and other intangible property to settle its debts.  Right Haven was formed with the idea of suing blogs and websites that repost newspaper articles without permission.  U.S. District Judge Philip M. Pro of Nevada, you go Philip Pro,  ordered Right Haven to surrender for auction the 278 copyright news articles that were the subject of its lawsuits.  They've lost the copyrights. They auctioned off the Right Haven domain for $3,000.  Initially, this company won and settled dozens of cases as defendant bloggers paid a few thousand dollars each to make the case go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I heard about this. That's like extortion.  It's extortion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same as patents. It's exactly what Yahoo is doing to Facebook folks.  Trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And in many cases, Right Haven sought the domain names owned by people it was suing as payment.  But now it's lost its own domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little old ladies were putting up a story they found interesting in their town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Disgusting.  It all came because a Vietnam veteran, Wayne Hone, successfully defended against a Right Haven copyright lawsuit.  They sought large damages for posting the entirety of a Las Vegas Review Journal editorial to a small online message board.  They sued him. He fought in court and won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the EFF, I believe.  He fought them, which is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And Mark Randazza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did those bloggers get their money back?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what they're going to fight over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why they're trying to liquidate their assets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if there's any of these bloggers that we know, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Well, I don't know about you, but I didn't know any of them.  It's mostly Las Vegas.  These really are bums and pops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The company was funded by the Review Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And another newspaper company called Media News came in and started using them.  And then my friend John Payton, who's the hope of the newspaper industry, took over management of that company and immediately ended the deal with Right Haven.  Awesome.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So happy ending.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Time for our tip number and tool of the week, starting with Gina Trapani and your tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My tip is actually starts off as an Easter egg.  If you go to Google.com, you sign out and you search for octal or binary, you actually get the number of search results back in binary or octal.  It's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  These are these are different number systems.  And you can see I got an octal 0053066240 results, which is which is really which is kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a fun Easter egg.  Not very useful, but it made me think about the Google Google calculator, which I use all the time.  Like you can you can convert you can do math.  So you can just say two plus two equals and Google tell you four.  But you can also do things like you can say 90 USD and euro and it'll it'll convert the currency for you.  You can say how many bytes are in 170 gigabytes.  You can you can get all kinds of different kind of answers for questions.  How many I use this when I'm cooking all the time.  How many cups or how many ounces are in a cup?  So 10 cups and ounces.  So this is an old tip.  This isn't new news, but this the octal hexadecimal binary Easter egg made me think of the calculator, which is super, super useful.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, look at all the results of binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, nice.  I've actually got a go and I really missed the calculator and I missed this kind of thing.  Duck Duck Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's a smart.  It's smart for them to do things.  And that spell check, by the way, is one of the simplest, best things in Google.  If you mistype it, it fixes it.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have one quick plug, Leo.  I hope you don't mind.  Not at all.  When I went to the White House a few weeks ago and I missed the episode of Twig, actually, the reason why I was there to help plan what's called the Equal Pay App Challenge, which is the Equal Pay Task Force.  The President's Equal Pay Task Force is asking developers to build app to help narrow the wage gap between men and women, which still exists.  And I put together a site called narrow the gap dot com.  It's two peas and which just gives kind of some facts about the wage gap per occupation.  And there's a link there for the Equal Pay App Challenge as well.  So many developers are interested in digging into Department of Labor data.  There's tons of it.  And it's fascinating.  You can do it by gender, age, ethnicity, education level, location.  It's kind of really cool, fun stuff.  So I put together that site real quick and I hope you check it out.  And they're accepting submissions until the end of the month.  So they're looking for smartphone apps, web apps, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good job.  Let me like that.  Let me plus one that.  Yay.  Let me pin it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this.  Really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Women love Pinterest, I hear.  So I hear that.  Yes, I hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I'm going to go.  Thank you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which occupations do women make more than men?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we have any data on that?  There I think there was one I think like bill collectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is great.  I wrote it in its PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wrote it in its PHP back end, but that's bootstrap.  Developers will notice that the front end looks a lot like Twitter and bootstrap is Twitter's kind of front end framework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was going to ask you.  This is very cool because this people are starting to really rave about bootstrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, bootstrap is fantastic.  I mean, for someone like me, who's a developer and completely design challenge and like the last thing I want to do is massive CSS.  Bootstrap is really great.  So the front end is just bootstrap and the back end is PHP.  It's a quick framework I put together, which actually powers ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you were very so bootstraps on GitHub and you were able using bootstraps libraries tools to very quickly develop a fast goods.  By the way, I just found out Twitter is using speedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really great.  Just lay out a page really nicely, very quickly.  I use bootstrap and I use Google Open Web Fonts.  And yeah, that was basically it.  The little Twitter widget, you know, it's just kind of putting Legos together now.  Isn't that awesome?  Yeah, so it's great.  So for people who don't have design sense, it's really easy way to put together a page that looks great.  Very elegant, nice and clean layout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now you're starting to get some tweets too, by the way, I want to point out.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great.  That is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For once, I had a wealth of numbers because of course it is Pi Day.  And I would accuse you of stealing that number, but I have others.  One is 244, which is how many years the Encyclopedia Britannica was printed until today it announced that it's no longer to be printed on paper.  Can you believe that?  Oh, my God.  I said that was a big news and I tweeted about it.  And all the print priests got mad at me.  Oh, you're dancing on the grave.  No, this is good news.  This means that a company like that made the transition from print to become a digital company.  Now gets thirty five million dollars a year in digital revenue.  It's figured it out.  Hallelujah.  That's where the world ought to be going.  And I also think, by the way, the print encyclopedia was a huge ripoff and it was sold on guilt.  And so knowledge is now freed from the limits of the page.  I say celebrate.  Hallelujah.  Praise.  That's what the other number is.  Two, which is the wrong number of wives to have.  When Facebook recommended to this guy's first wife that she should friend his second wife, he wasn't divorced from either of them.  It led to a big of me complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But how good for Facebook's algorithm that it figured out that they should know each other.  You know, wow.  Oh, Lord, I also want to thank the folks of Twig because we as of this morning, I've sold more than five thousand Gutenberg, the geeks.
