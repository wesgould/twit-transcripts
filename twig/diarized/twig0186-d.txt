Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that it's rather irresponsible of you to go into  Facebook has said that a few of its staffers laptops were hacked. They fixed it  No, we use your data was out there. Let's be very clear here  When you put up anything on Facebook or anything on the internet  You better be expecting that it says shared with someone and that someone can share it on so I really think that it's rather  irresponsible of you to come along and say that this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cause for panic around the world  I don't think we're necessarily saying it's a cause for panic  But I do think that people would be interested simply because Facebook hasn't been trying and we recently had you weren't mad at him  Being hacked as well and I got mad later  Is it get worse? Yeah. Oh, yeah  You look like Woody Allen right now any details of what sort of fact took place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You already said a few of the staffers laptops were hacked through a  Malware site and there's nothing that was compromised many sites. No, I disagree with you. This is irresponsible journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is crap and you know it it's irresponsible journalism and I'm carrying on. Okay, Jeff Chavez listen, we do appreciate  click  More than happy to hear it. Mr. Chavez is the nature of your language. Okay, we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Page of Buzz Machine calm  No, I mean wasn't respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude  They called me and said do the story and I spent 10 minutes trying to talk to the producer out of doing the story and said  No, there's not a story here. I mean there may be a story in tech world, which there is but there was no cause of damage to  Consumers there was no cause for panic. There was no cause for worry  It was a non story and I tried and tried and tried and then I said to the producer  I said, you know what leave me out. I don't want to do this only part of your story  No, and then she came back called back and said no, no, we want you to say this  I said I'm gonna say that this is irresponsible and it's a non story and you shouldn't be doing it  So they knew exactly what they're gonna. That's interesting. So it wasn't a surprise to them. You were up front

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was in front with the use the word crap and then and then they got and then yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then then he gets all pissy with me and then you say the word crap and they cut me off  F me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  FML I've been meaning to talk to you about your language myself. Yeah, I know I know  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like that's why I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it's true and mainstream media always makes a big deal out of this stuff now  Does it change your mind a little bit that we now know that that Facebook hack was actually only one of a series of hacks  By in Eastern Europe, but apparently by Eastern European hackers who also got to Apple and Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Well to this extent what number one it doesn't even mind in terms of the moment in time when they did that story  There was no story there. There was no cause for panicking people  There was nothing there. Nothing was compromised there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We probably mentioned it in 30 seconds went on to the next thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The truth is that that these these malware things happen all the time and yes  It happened to some big companies and are finally being a little more  Transparent about it as someone said I've kept it's a famous quote that that there's only two kinds of companies those that have been  Hacked and those that haven't admitted it, right?  and  So yeah now we have something else going on the peers be a little bit more but still it's a story in a technology world  It's still not a consumer story for the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they were playing it as oh my god, your privacy has been violated or it might be yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The producer kept saying to me well all of your stuff on Facebook could be seen by the you know  Could be seen by other people. That's why you put it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not because Facebook in kind of implies that you have control of it there was no right but there was no  We know that we say to everybody if you put it online anywhere including Facebook  You're always running the risk that it's gonna become public Facebook has a bad record of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So so it wasn't a story at the time. It's a bit of more of a story now in geek world  So I expect Steve and you to talk about it. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a story only because it looks like a concerted attempt to do industrial espionage  Hey and B because it takes advantage of a flaw in Java that even the Department of Homeland Security has been warning people  To turn off Java for weeks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a consumer story at a general broad audience world around and and I just got fed up with the techno panic angle  I agree and so  After I got off I just I hung my head and it was late at night and I also said some more things like  I  Forget something like up yours auntie on Twitter  Being the anti BBC no, I said kiss my ass

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I go to bed I'm thinking now I gotta deal with this again, you know  I just wanted to just leave me alone Saturday night. I wake up the next morning and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lot of support I'm sure egg me on folks. Yeah. No, we love it. We want to see I think there's a certain amount of like  What might he do next? Let's watch Jeff blow

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think it's great. I mean, I thought the point was really it was was well-made and I definitely I have a problem with confrontation  So I admire yes folks who can be that articulate and do it, you know  Do it especially on the BBC and it's just fun to see the British guy get ruffled  I'm too nice for that crap, but we need I need to I need to get better at that sort of confrontation  So yeah good on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm trying not to do that and and it's yes, it's in my DNA it's there I try to tamp it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not like crap's not a dirty word. It's not apparently it is in the UK  I've some people that are in our chat room apparently say yeah  It isn't considered okay to say on television than you in on the BBC. Oh, they say much worse on television in the UK

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much worse, but anyway, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like a mild word, but it's all in the ears of cultural. Yes cultural  And as somebody who has also from time to time lost his temper in public I am I completely know how you feel  It's one of those things where it was justified and you're glad you did it  But it's also embarrassing and it's I understand completely. Yeah, I'm a score scobal went

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bat pucky on Matthew Ingram this week when Matthew just said all I'm glad I switched off my iPhone and switched to  my Android because the  Notifications are better and scobal went off on him and I finally came into the scope  I said Robert is this really the kind of conversation we want to have here and he kind of said oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, you know and we need ironically. I just saw a story yesterday that scobals going to an Android phone. I know  Like that by the way, I was like really that's a news story that Robert scobals going to an Android phone. That's like that's like  What is the world coming to seriously I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  IOS versus Android that old chestnut. I don't know  It's an old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tesla versus the New York Times. I'm so tired. Yeah. Yeah, that's so yesterday now, but you were quoted the okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not yesterday yet  Because finally the Times ombudsman  Was burning great the public editor more. What's your name Maureen? Margaret Sullivan Margaret Sullivan. That's right. She's quite wonderful  You guys had a little tweet exchange over the whole it was it was just funny because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know here Elon Musk is just for the background of the story is a New York Times  Reporter drove the car up the East Coast trying to show that you could do it all this way  But he ended up having problems. He ended up got the car towed Elon Musk went completely  bad pukey on him and  I can't figure out what other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Complicated story because David Broder the guy wrote the story is not an automotive critic. He is a  Energy reporter from Washington DC  Tesla went to him and said hey, you know  We think it'd be great if you did a story to kind of match a story we had done earlier on the West Coast  About a road trip in an electric vehicle because we have the large they're trying to promote the fact they have the longest range  he now  Margaret kind of  Punted on this one. I thought I thought so too. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Margaret is very brave and she does great things, but I think she punted and basically said that well, they're both right  Yeah, kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broder did certain things she could she criticized him for not taking better notes and that's of course a serious criticism for a reporter  Notes are what that's your defense those those things you write on a piece of paper. That's your defense and  Everybody ought to take note now that companies have as as Tesla does  They're monitoring it they know exactly what he did so they said here's the data here's what he said he did  This is what he actually did they don't match. I think Musk was a was a little bit  Inflammatory and what he wrote I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I were gonna spend that amount of money for a car and that's the kind of customer service  I'm gonna get when I have a problem is  As I said, it was the Apple equivalent of you didn't hold it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But others pointed out that if he had read the manual  Instead of calling Tesla and saying what should I do because they didn't give him good advice  But if he had read the manual he would know exactly what to do  I think the most salient point is it's an electric vehicle. You shouldn't it's not for road tripping

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it was but again, it was Tesla's that was their idea idea  It was also a very very cold day in the US the stay of the year  The US I mean in the East Coast, right and so you couldn't get up  So anyway, so Margaret Sullivan wrote this piece and she's a really really good public editor respect her a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us about that role because the Washington Times seems to be eliminating their ombudsman post post  Times Times doesn't need an ombudsman. No, we don't  Reverend Moon  What what is that role and when did it happen and why is it going away at the post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the post its money pure and simple that it's it's a body and can they can they get a reporting post in there?  Whereas the Times especially after Jason Blair the faking reporter and other things the the Times is needed one  They hired I think this is the fourth or fifth. It's a fairly recent  Vintage Margaret came in and she's from the Buffalo  evening, whatever  Paper owned by Warren Buffett for many many many years and I thought all a traditionalist comes in  She won me over won a lot of my fellow geeky guys like Jay Rosen and Emily Bell over very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  her role is to not be not represent the Times but to  represent the readers represent the readers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But she works at the time she's changed the role a little bit so she doesn't just try to answer readers questions readers complaints  Instead she takes on issues and she she was a perfect example. Wasn't it? It was a great example  Yeah, so she she said come out right about I don't know what's going on here  I don't know, but I'm gonna watch it watch me  I'm gonna ask she tried to get a hold of Musk they didn't return the call. She made that public  He did back and forth  So then she writes the column that basically kind of says that you're both kind of messed up a little bit and the reporter  On this or on that so Elon Musk that comes on a tweet and says my faith in the times is restored  And so I just retweeted that and said well that was easy and and Margaret came in and just put on exclamation points  you know this  It's been it's been quite the kerfuffle because the interesting thing about this too is I'm gonna get in trouble for saying this it's been  really a parallel of Apple fanboy versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like and Tesla's a new Tesla's a new Apple for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really is so that what happened is that there becomes this this this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Emotional that's right critic being critical of Tesla in any way is considered  To be a posthate you're not you you know you're violating there. You're a heretic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. It's a religion. I saw a picture of Bradley Horowitz with his guys  I'm thinking I ate by one of these things of course the truth is I can't afford one of these things never will be able  To afford one of these things and I see a picture of Bradley Horowitz with his little road trip  And I have to admit I got gadget lost again, and and if only it's were on Kickstarter. I'd be ordering one you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What has to happen is I have to sponsor the show and then provide cars for each of us so that we can talk  Yes during the spot. What do you think deal make that happen, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've driven in the test last one of our  viewers came down and  Took us for a ride, and it's amazing vehicle. I'm very impressed with it, but I think  You know despite the fact it has more than 300 mile range because it's got a lot of batteries in that thing you shouldn't assume  That you could just get in the car and drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but but Tesla put in charging stations. Yeah, I think 200 miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to promote these superchargers fast superchargers right, but that's a little misleading because it takes an hour or so  I mean, it's not like going to a gas station

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Precisely precisely and and and one of them is in a you know a horrible rest stop on the turnpike  Which is you don't want to spend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, any more time than it takes to urinate there our friend David Prager has one he was on the list early on  And of course I've driven in the earlier Tesla's the sports car  and I think they're very impressive they're really that and  They're kind of the as good as you can get with an electric vehicle in current technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I so I don't follow cars at all  I know really very little about this car  But I have to tell you the fact that this person couldn't go for a ride or people were saying that this person should have this  Reporter should have read a 30 page manual turn me off. I was like, I don't want to read a manual to drive a car  I've been driving for 15 years. Well you have bad news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a gas vehicle. So everything you know about driving is different. So you do need to read a manual  It's not a long manual, but it is not a gas vehicle  And so when you treat it like a gas vehicle, you're gonna not well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's gonna happen next of course is you'll get a self-driving  Electric car and then you can go back damn well better read them  At the bottom of other there is a this will only work for video but but there's a  Computer simulation of an intersection with self-driving cars. It is mesmerizing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mesmer let me fire that up while we can and it is really this is a media story and because of Jeff and and Gina my  Interest in media and Jeff's expertise in media. We often talk about media on this show. This has become in a way our  Show so these are this these cars are crossing the intersection. Wow, look at that  This is this looks like this looks like Rome on a busy day. I was gonna say Paris  Yeah, yeah, this is like but do you know it's not even a roundabout they're just going in and avoiding each other  There's no stoplights nothing Wow, and it works because they're smart and they know what they're doing  Unlike us they've even got cars turning left through traffic. Yeah, I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's it but it's yeah, it's just can't wait  So the great thing is people in the comments below it on my post were just saying, you know  We were gonna scream as this is going on  That'll be fun whole idea of a computer driven car taking over and knowing better than you do is so freaky to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? They're gonna have to draw the shades  Yes, because you're absolutely right if you're in that car you're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trauma and if you do hit the brakes you ruin the whole thing, right?  Unbelievable. Yeah crash

Transcript:  We all get used to this wall just kind of be sitting in a car checking our email as if nothing was going on as if  We weren't driving right into I hope it happens in my lifetime

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really do it will happen in your lifetime. Gina. I have no doubt about that  You'll be my age or older  But I hope it happens in my lifetime. I would look you know different from how she looks right now  Of course, she'll look exactly she'll look better. Oh, I appreciate the vote  Anyway, I just thought we had to start with the Jeff Jarvis video cuz that's all anybody's had  In our chat rooms had to talk about all week. I was afraid of that  But I commend you and I think it happens to me all the time it's one of the reasons I'm really glad I don't work  in mainstream media  Is that mainstream media does such a poor job of covering technology and and does tend to sensationalize it  We have a baby even we have a hard time when it comes to things like tracking cookies  Separating the hysteria from the reality. So that I mean it's simple hopeless for mainstream media  We have our own fights over those things yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Gonna sell for on eBay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's it that's what I figured is that I guarantee I can make money on it day one I can flip it  I'm not gonna do that. But if if I had buyers remorse, I could always do that  I could always I could sell to Jeff for 2,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I I don't I don't I don't so people are saying well, Leo, why are you so negative?  I find this hard to believe that's why  And I think it's gonna look really dorky when you wear them  And I it could very well be annoying and it could be like the the Steve Martin invention in  The what is it the the movie the jerk where he invents the glasses with the handle  It's really great. Nobody bends their glasses and then they and they realize later that makes everybody cross-eyed and  He gets sued  Could make everybody cross-eyed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're kidding me it's not  Sorry, you know, I guess you can't see that well, but yeah, but it looks just like that  It's gonna be we're gonna see a whole audience filled with people wearing Google last year 2050 will look back and laugh. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Understand that it's a it's not acceptable in this crowd to poop who any brand new technology  But you know, we should embrace and say everything new is great  But I'm I'd like to try it for a while before I see it  Of course, we ordered one because I want to try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tough. It's tough to pass judgment before you try it  But I think that it's totally reasonable to pass judgment to look at the way people look wearing it and say  This is gonna be a weird fashion thing. You know, the segue was really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People said they're gonna was Bill Gates said they're gonna change the way that or maybe with Steve Jobs  They're gonna change the way they build cities because of this thing and then we got them and we stood on them and you looked  Like the most idiotic dork on one and it's still cool. It's still great  But because you look like a dork riding one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo who people now walk down the street seeming to talk to themselves and no one's bothered by that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's right. There's no I don't think there's a rule  Right, but I but there's the potential there's the high potential  That look wearing these will be considered the nerdiest of nerdy things to do. Well, and that's a badge of honor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's also the dare I say  Creep factor where you're talking to someone  Someone who has them you might feel distrustful of them or say like are you recording me?  Are you taking pictures of me? You know, I mean that's holding a camera up is a social thing  I mean, it's a signal right like I'm taking a picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is something historically Google's never been good at which is because they are such nerds themselves  Understanding how something's going to be look in society and read in the real world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True the effect on norm right I imagine the remake of taxi driver you looking at me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz I mean the presumption is there's this guy is not only looking at me and talking to me  But he's looking at his screen at the whole time. How rude is it if if I talk to you and  I'm holding up my phone while I'm talking to you like this. Is this considered rude? So Gina, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say that you're not having a better conversation than you are with me who's to say where that norm is gonna settle out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know yeah, I do think it'll be okay consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, might be how many how many groups of teenagers have you seen together standing as if talking but not talking to each other  They're on things and that's their norm and who am I to say that's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying it may not be accepted in society  It's not up to us, but it may be people just go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know the new off the record is gonna be like hey, can you take your glasses off? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not allowed in a lot of buildings with a camera phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're not gonna be in a gym with these things on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another one. Yeah, I can't take it in theory. I can't whip out a camera phone in the locker room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but remember that at first I do when camera phones came out get some of my best pictures  In gyms you couldn't carry them in supposedly right that never happened just obviously if you if you whipped one out and started taking pictures  You're gonna get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This it depends on the gym

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's true too. This is about  norms right and adjusting norms, right and I always tell my Kodak camera story of  fiendish Kodakers lying and wait with a fear in the 1890s  But what I did a spiel on this recently about new norms somebody said well  Yeah today if I'm walking with my you know  If you're walking with Edda in a park and somebody comes along and starts taking pictures of her  Freak right there's nothing to do technology  It has to do with the norm the accepted norms that we get to people aren't gonna just take a picture of your daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right nine to five Google says that to get its products into more hands Google will open its own stores by the end of  The year, but I don't think there's a coincidence that that's timed to coincide with the release of glass  I think that's what these stores are for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These stores are gonna be for right for people to come in and try glass no doubt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the timing sounds right and they need it's not gonna be something that you will buy on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but but also Leo, I don't think it's gonna be gonna be fulfillment places my theory about this and it's just a theory  I have no basis for saying this but I think  we're  Physical retail space goes is toward marketing over fulfillment right showroom  and I'm gonna bet that Google is going to look at this more as a  showroom for the world of Google  Than a way to sell you you know a thousand Nexus 4s because they also don't want to end up in channel conflict  with all of their  Suppliers and retail chains their suppliers retail chains for this right they could really piss off Samsung  By doing this but they can say look at the wonders of Android look at it on all these phones  You can play with all the Samsung phones and the Motorola phones next to each other  I just feel that's where they're gonna go is it's not just about selling Nexus 7s  It's in their interest to have you be a better Google citizen. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we were talking about this last night on all about Android and I think I think the thing that I love the most  about the idea of a Google store is if they sort of  Model it after the Apple Store, which is basically what Microsoft did that they'll be you know  the Google geek bar where you can go and  Bring your customer service questions and that is just I mean, it's let's face it. It's funny  I mean Google's never really done imagine Google doing like meet space customer service  Imagine the line of people going like my website doesn't rank high enough anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like they should don't you think that's important. That's a good thing for them. Yeah, I think we're yeah, they need a public face

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do they do. I just I just think it would be funny  I mean you can certainly imagine classes like here's how to live in the cloud  Here's how to like live your life with a Chromebook and an Android phone  You can you can absolutely imagine that the way that Apple does kind of those for those free classes in their stores that I think  They can absolutely use and people with it got plenty of content just to talk about Chromebooks and all that  We were also talking on element in your last night Chad actually pointed out that you know, Google doesn't have that many products  No, it's a Chromebook. It's a Nexus Chromebox

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gladly it has but it has many products virtual products and if you can get help to really learn the wonders of Gmail and Docs and Maps and  Now and all these other things that's in their interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Also  If you if rumors are to believe Apple making a kind of serious commitment to an iWatch or some sort of wearable watch  Does that validate Google strategy and is a watch?  Better than wearing a pair of glasses discuss  Professor professor Jarvis I  Watch your glasses. You're already wearing glasses. Sorry that said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The being near your eye is creepier than being on your wrist, which I think is insane it's more useful  Which is by your eye? I think so. I think it's a lot more useful  And and I think that it's it's a quantum leap ahead of the idea of wearing something on your wrist  But it depends on what it does and why it's there. I don't I think that the fact that they're both wearable is really  Coincidence it's not a  God we gotta try to find trends at everything. It's not a trend in wearable technology. It's it's  both these things do potentially break the notion of the screen and the keyboard and  And and have other impacts but just because you wear them. I don't think is the interesting thing about them  I think they're probably gonna do very very different things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will I have a point to that in that  Your watch is a completely different user experience than your glasses  Because you have to speak to your glasses and when I saw this story on reddit  There was a lot of people in the comments first thing they brought up was what can you say next to someone wearing glass?  And say okay glass at Google search, you know  Mother Teresa and then BAM, you know, it's like  The user experience of you know touching and being able to physically control a watch  Versus the outside experience of needing to speak to your glass is very different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also what we saw that idea of the input of of the glass to you  I mean you have two different inputs you to put this up here and fine  I don't have to yank out my phone. I can look at a screen here or it's there all the time  That'll be interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a hawk says we should get a net connected nose ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So from a fashion perspective I would go watch right because I don't wear glasses it will be weird for me to wear  Yeah, that's just not used to it  Right, like I I mean I wear sunglasses in San Diego a lot, but I just I don't wear regular glasses  So it's gonna change the way I look and that's completely from like a vanity perspective, right?  But from every other perspective, it's definitely glass  I mean for me glass is gonna be about documentation taking pictures  Recording and getting information very quickly and you know  I bought the watch band for the little iPod Mini and you know, it was cute  But it's been so long since I've worn a watch you have to look at your watch  You can't take pictures with your watch as a pain swiping around a tiny little screen as a pain  So the kind of the voice commands and the fact that it's just a heads-up display a constant heads-up display is definitely more  Interesting to me. Although I do wonder just about  You know, when do we have kind of a quiet moment where we  Be in the world without you know, Google telling me the what, you know, like being kind of up in my face  It sounds like you can dismiss the the the the cards. It looks like you can kind of dismiss the cards from your from your glass  But um, it feels like oh great like every time sorry mom every time my mom texts me like it's gonna show up right  So I kind of have that that feeling about it too, but again, I just really want to try it really want to try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before I pass I do talking of course, you know  I was checking my Twitter and my email and all this too because I can't I can't just listen to one person  It's just not enough input

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got my all my stuff going at the same time. I'm gonna go. Okay, start the recorders. I'm gonna go out on a limb  I think this thing is a flop  I think it will come out it will do all these wonderful things. It'll be very very cool  I'm not saying it won't be and people like you and me Gina  May very well want it and wear it just like maybe we rode segues around  But ultimately nobody wants to put on glasses if they don't have to I'm wearing contacts  So I don't have to wear glasses and it's gonna be considered dorky invasive and I think it will be a flop and I think  One year from now you come back here. You could play that recording and then I will either  Eat my hat or crow with  Satisfaction, what do you think you guys want to go out on the limb and say we should do a long bet  I'll do a long bet. I think it's a non-starter. I think Google's making this up at a whole cloth

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody I think the problem here is this little I think that the product itself Google Glass as a brand  I don't know that even Google cares whether it succeeds. I think what it what it is is a harbinger of of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Screenless net coming. I think what it is is a harbinger of  the stock market demanding new products every few years  And if you don't have one make one up and I think that the pressure  From the financial markets and the news media and everybody else to constantly be  Changing the world gets to companies like Apple and Google and they start making crap up that nobody's asking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina what's your bet? I think it's gonna be a specialty item

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's gonna be a lot more common than the segue  But I don't think this is gonna be an everyday thing  So when I go to Google I owe I want to wear glass when I fought flying airplane when I do trampoline  When I'm at the kids birthday party, I'm gonna wear glass on a regular workday. I'm not probably not gonna wear glass  I think it's gonna be one of those things where you know, it's like do I you know my mom vacation?  Do I want to remember this experience?  Am I gonna have that my inner new city that I don't know and I'm gonna need navigation and I'm gonna you know  I don't want to be constantly staring down at my phone. That's when I would wear glass  I mean right now so the price what's it gonna retail for a grand right like 999 they're talking that's expensive  I mean, it's gonna be a signifier of someone who's extremely techie with a lot of disposable income  And and I think that that community of folks are probably wear it as kind of a specialty item at events and things  But I don't think it's gonna be an everyday thing  But I don't think it's gonna be an everyday thing so I'm kind of in the middle  I don't think it's gonna be as much of a flop as the segue all of the segue is a novelty thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He takes the cops at the airport drive around segues all the time  It's far from a flop mall cops and city tour mall cops and city tours

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  More common than the said by the segue but certainly not an everyday thing. I don't think it's gonna be a huge hit  I think that this is gonna be a kind of a slow  thing and  Again, I'd wear them if I'm gonna if I'm gonna be on the Great Wall of China. I want to have glass on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I went to China, I mean, you know from doing anything kind of interesting if I'm going for a hot-air balloon ride  I absolutely want to wear glass wouldn't wouldn't you wouldn't you want to be able to stream it or?  Ice-dream everything I'm shocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I just think it's a bad form factor  You don't want something impinging on your vision, especially if you're at the Great Wall of China. You want to take it in  If you pull out a camera, you'll take a picture with the camera  You don't why do you want it on all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I I spent my entire trip in China with my camera in front of my face or my camera phone taking watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this would make me enjoy the trip more Leo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't have to be like well, it's a camera strap or my batteries and and all that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do people in the chat room are saying I'm jaded. I'm bored with technology  I'm not in the least  I love technology and I see stuff that excites me all the time  But I have to call I have to call it when I see something that's just doesn't make any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me two use cases here two odd use cases first  Well, how did we get to see the meteor falling out of the sky so it's  Dashboard cams, why do the Russians have dashboard cams because they have crooked cops. They'll record it  What does this allow it becomes an amazing constant collection of who would think we are G?  Yeah, we're gonna record you driving around all the time  How boring can you be but there was a single use that ended up with side uses, right?  So, you know, I think there's something like that second a one of my students in the entrepreneurial program this term  We got a photographer named Andy Krupa  I don't want to give away his full idea. But what inspired his idea was that his mother had Alzheimer's and  Had trouble remembering her day and he looked at all this this trend toward trying to record your life  Well rather than being some Microsoft geek who records your life  what if you're somebody who can't remember your day and records your life and  You can get it back. What if you're a cop you can have that on it's gonna freak us out a bit  But you know, hey, it's public. What's this is that I can see individual use cases cropping up like the dashboard cam  That kind of lead the way to other uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we're definitely more bullish than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna see what happens all right one year from now Chad I want you to pull this tape out  Right. This product actually, I don't know if it'll be out of your effect. I pretty here's another prediction  It won't be out of your from. Yeah, that's true, too. We're talking fall of 2014 at the earliest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This product itself will not be a hit. Oh, I well we're in agreement there but but  This will be the harbinger of surprising things to come. I think wearable computing makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not against wearable computing. What's hard to figure out as a form factor  I don't think the y-watch is gonna be a hit either. I think that's for even stupider  Yeah, the look see I have a look see that is really dorky yeah it is I  Bought a look see to try and it's a camera that goes on your temple  It's now the problem with that. It's giant  Yeah, I don't know what wearable computing should end up looking like to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I student went and he ordered  Digital camera lenses from some Hong Kong supplier of some sort and he was amusing came in with the box  They were like to tell him in a bag. Yeah, and they were smaller than little Legos  Yeah, lipstick cams are cheap and easy and widely. Yeah, so you don't need to be wearing whole glasses and things  You know, there's other other use cases. I  think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thought I  Actually think believe it or not. The smartphone is a pretty good form factor  I don't think we've seen the end of the line on smartphones and pull it out when you need it  We could do augmented reality if you really want to look at the world through a screen. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know I still I still have a hard time if this makes me really old I have a hard time seeing especially young  People all standing around together staring down at their phone. What do you mean? That's all they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see you. You don't like it when you see that right? No, I don't it makes me like it  Well, this is the same thing. You're just hiding it  It's just stealthier you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're just your eyeballs are focusing on a heads-up display versus the person another reason that it's not gonna succeed because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think you're bothered by kids looking at the phone? At least you know what they're doing now  They're gonna be looking at you with a glazed expression  How do you feel when somebody's talking to you and looks over your shoulder the whole time? That's what you're gonna see  Well, that's what they do. It'd be anyway  They won't be looking at you. They'll be looking over their shoulder at their Google Glass  Is that now you both got enamored when Amazon when Amazon when Android came out with its its notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm still an iPhone guy. Yes, you were enamored of that love right? Yes, and you but what you have to do  You had to pick up the phone  You had to turn it on and swipe your 40 different ways and then you had to go like this wrong with that  And then you said oh look the notifications right which is fine. That means I'm in control  It was a big step  Beyond what it existed before which was a big step  Beyond what it existed before which was you had to actually go into a program, right?  Well now what imagine if it is suddenly in the corner of your eye you get a little notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I don't have to imagine because I have it on my Apple desktop  So they took the notifications and they put them on your computer. It is the most annoying thing ever  when you I  Turn it off. I don't care whose birthday. It's Kevin Rose's 38th birthday tomorrow  Do I want to see that right now on my screen? I do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The use right exactly and that's why in a world where streams become more prevalent than pages  And there's a constant stream of information. There's gonna be value in a company like Google  Or Marissa Yahoo figuring out only those notifications that truly matter to you and make you actually do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way now the entire chat room is derailed talking about the fact that Kevin Rose is 38  We do not need more distractions  I think that what we need is ways to manage this stuff  And I think in just turning up the push is not a good thing and that's all this is dial up the push

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm alive. I tell you I'm alive  Tell the BBC  Right Leo. I absolutely agree me and the streams of irritating notifications like mean the streams of email and news and everything else absolutely horrible  I think there's a great need for really really smart filtering of your yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why now is kind of interesting because now is really but it's pushed into the pole. So they're pushing information  I think I want but I get to choose when I see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show title it's pushed into the pole. Yeah, I want I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to push pull  Push me pull you  Or something wait, I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on. I think we're talking about a couple different things here. I'm confused  So we're not talking there's there's the context of the notifications like the way that you get them and then there's like the quality and quantity  Right, and those are two separate things. Yes, except I submit I don't care what information this desktop pushed up at me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still annoying that I'm doing something and it's and and and and OS 10  Continually tells me something's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that's pulled push right because you launch now I say yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would feel that way if my if my in fact, I do feel that way  There are some Android things for instance when a call comes in now it has a window that says this call came  What do you want to do about it? I don't know what programs doing that that's annoying  But the idea that I can pull this down or I can tap the now and see immediately what's going on  That's I want it now and you what's great is they have put this together  In such a way that that there and I love this that they're trying to give me information that they know I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's pushed but I'm pulling it but but Gina's still right that for the right notification  You would want to be interrupted. Well, yeah, it's gonna say there's a tornado coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, there's some things but not everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sounds like pretty easily configurable like if the heads-up display is just it doesn't show you anything unless you say, okay glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That that is something I would like but then why am I wearing a dorky pair of glasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you can take a picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right, yeah, no, but I could take a better picture and by the way  I don't know how but think about it. This picture is always from the point of view of your right eyebrow  That's not a good picture  Photographers spent a lot of energy thinking composing moving around waiting every pictures from my right eyebrow. That's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And her but with some cases better to have it than not you can still take your camera out  Nothing's stopping you from doing that. But at that moment that that that Gina's wonderful beautiful little baby  We still haven't met smiles at her she can get that moment  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the opportunity I get to sit down with a mentor and I want to I'm gonna ask for some advice and say hey  Do you mind if I record this, you know, which I yes I can pull out my phone and say hey  Do you mind if I record this?  But it's a little different if I'm saying if I'm like, hey, let's you know, well, here's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't your mentor? I mean isn't the presumption now because they could tell you're wearing a recording device on your eyebrow  That you might always be recording and isn't there this now this a little bit of creepiness coming into this probably gonna have a red  I predict a red light on it. What if what if I carried around a microphone tell you all the time?  Would you sit down and talk candidly with me if I did this?  Jeff if you walked around with a reporter's notebook and a pen poised all the time people would think what is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People when people know what I do they run away sometimes. Yeah, I think there's a high creepy factor  My sister my sister was a minister in in  Princeton the student minister was Jeb Stuart McGruder  Ex White House burger squad whatever mix in White House, right? Yeah after a jail and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're standing in jail. That's right. I'm in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you do what do you do and I say I was well he works people magazine the guy  Weeped back. Yeah, and and practice ran away as if burned  You  Don't have to be having a Google Glass to scare people if you're a reporter. Well, everybody now is a reporter, right?  Right, right every blogger how many times you've been around bloggers and somebody says to them don't belong to this how many times?  Yeah in class we have guest teacher people come in we did yesterday and they say don't tweet that and now imagine this Jeff

Transcript:  You're giving a lecture to your class of  Freshmen and you dim the lights for the slideshow and all you see is these little red lights  Blinking at you from everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beyonce concert, you know, no, no, no, no, no, Leo. No, no you see that  This is like when I give a talk at  At a conference of bloggers and nobody's typing and nobody's I feel hurt. Yeah, I want the red lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, what if you looked out and there's just somebody's glasses cuz they didn't want to stay for the lecture  So they just left their glasses there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good I'll get them later

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now now I'm egging everybody on but but but I the more I think about it the more I wonder really is this something  People are looking for are that and will real people, you know go oh man  I've been waiting to wear a camera on my right eyebrow my whole life. I predict I'm gonna make another prediction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I predict that in about a year and a half Leo Laporte is gonna do a whole special show. Yeah, I'll be wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's true. No doubt. I'm turning it on and it's gonna be live. You're gonna see me in the bathroom  You're gonna be alive, baby  Live well what happened to Justin TV?

A palatable and workable and I think in many ways because I carry this in my front pocket my cell phone is a wearable computer  I mean it really is it's I I don't you know you think about yourself you get up and go to a different room  Don't you bring your cell phone with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is for those who weren't watching the pre-show a pen that draws  with  Melted plastic so you can draw stuff in the air and then hard ways aren't our Arden's  Little program note because we do now believe  That Sony is going to announce a PlayStation 4 this afternoon  We are going to shift triangulation back in our Steve Huffman will be our guest the  One of the founders of reddit we talked with Alexis Ohanian a few weeks ago  And now we're gonna get the other side of the story  And but prior to that right after twig we will go to special coverage of the Sony  PlayStation 4 announcement because we do believe that they will announce the PlayStation 4 according to my sources  Just a little program now. We're gonna take a break come back with more our change log coming up next and we want to give  Credit to the change log composer. Yes, we don't let me forget to do that  Okay, but first a word from Citrix a new product. It's called  pod o p o d i o and it's impossible to describe  But once you start using it as we have here you will never want to be without it again  That's why we're saying go start a free account  Create a workspace and start having some fun with podio. This is my podio workspace  Po look we all went in at work now, but we're all electronic knowledge workers  No matter what you do you've got email you've got documents maybe they're in Google Docs, maybe they're in skydrive  you've probably got spreadsheets and word processing databases and  All of these disparate sources of information just kind of spread out the idea podio is to bring it all into a central  Repository where you can see it. You don't have to give up any of your tools. You're still using them, but podio manages them  Plus you also have this activity stream  Where you it's like an in-house Twitter basically share images links polls files  With other people in your group create as many groups as you need  To do lists there are worksheets in all different categories  You've got all sorts of applications some many by third parties a lot of people are using podio in a lot of very interesting ways  right now  But the problem we're having and I'm having is how do you how do I describe?  What podio can do for you well the best way to do it is for you to try it  That's the nice thing. I have no outstanding tasks. That's good. That's like inbox zero, baby  podi o podio  Dot-com my strong suggestion is created a workspace as soon as you sign up create a workspace start inviting people into it whether it's you're planning  a party  Kevin Rose birthday party or  You're planning a  Something more massive. Maybe you've got a work project. You're working on or you just need better communication in the workplace  Podio comm and now ladies and gentlemen it is time  for the change log  We missed you Gina without the change log this just ate this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no debate anymore. Oh  Seriously that don't you think it's like what it was to talk about of course, they're evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Profit-mongering

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the sense they're evil in the sense that they are a corporation  designed to profit  By selling our attention to advertisers or just like us  And that they are  very  publicly and openly gathering data to improve that  Advertising that might be the evil part. We don't we don't track people. We don't we can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know I just wrote a piece for medium. It'll be up later this week on defining the troll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The troll is somebody says Google's evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for the to get the rise out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All guy you're all trolls that's who you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff how do you been liking medium? Have you been writing there a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my ex agent and I even though I'm mad at her for leaving agentry  Kate Lee is there as head of content and you know, Evan biz are great  And so when I write on it, I wrote last night this piece. I don't think it's up yet and  It's it is a truly elegant  Format and it changes the way you're right just because of the environment of where you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the writing the compose feel essentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it really is it's so elegant and so easy and we're talking about medium comm. This is F. Williams new  Is it business? I don't know. It's yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that Gina Neal  put up a  Google Doc spreadsheet this last week of every new kind of  Content creation tool there is  Broadly defined he included courts in that which I would consider more of not a platform, but just a content site  but nonetheless, there's a lot of activity going on this but I don't think we've really seen anything that the  advances the notion of content creation greatly medium makes it really elegant and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simplistic and simple and pretty so it's out of beta. It looks like I could post to it  You don't it was invite only but now I can write something  It did a new design  Now, let me just get this straight. I write a two thousand word article brilliantly thought-out  Article and I just I give that to them and they publish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're going to in some cases I can be wrong about this  But I think they're I think they're gonna pay some people to write some stuff. I don't know what the revenue in is  That's revenue out  But I think that once an environment of quality. It's taking the model of Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is taking all of our 140 character posts  And and making it long form

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that it could be more like a magazine in the sense that if he  Commissions pieces right if he and Kate commissioned pieces and pay for them to have a quality place where you're around  You know, that's like  The Guardian's comment is free. You could just write for it for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if they commission you they pay you can you comment on these posts or they just they know they need to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the thing about it that's most impressive beautiful user interface is incredibly easy  You just type and then when you mark a word you have a very limited number of choices  To to font sizes bold italic link or quote. That's it  and so it's extremely simple and I wish that  Frankly, Google would learn from that and then Google plus give us a lot more power to do more within a Google Plus post

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it looks like they've added they've added comments allow notes on your posts  Oh, they did okay when notes are on readers can add feedback to your post that you can choose to make public

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you now have come all I think those are the things to the side. They did a different one  Oh, no, I don't that is I saw the little green box last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Jeff you wrote the post but they publish it for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They like hit a hit the publish button in this case Kate asked me to write something this week  And so it was gonna go up but but yeah, I've in the past I wrote a piece about  Help me I've written like four or five pieces for it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was curious about what you thought and how it was I like, you know, I  Love I mean, I love a kneel to him. Everything has a blog. So that that spreadsheet was one problem here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm that I'm looking I don't see a way I could search for Jeff Jarvis's posts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, if you go to  Collections, I mean if I know what collection you're in I'm signed in  If you go to I am H. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I could go to that collection and then maybe scroll down and find you go to medium comm slash at Jeff Jarvis  Ah, so he is his Twitter handle

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sign in with Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see Mike's my you know, I'm I guess cuz I I believe in getting paid for my content I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seems like you're giving them something pretty special. No, you see this is I write for Huffington Post  Why do I do that because they in their case they have a lot of distribution, right?  So it gets more attention. I mean, I love how it looks. It's gorgeous. You know, you know, I don't want to tell you this  But I would do this for free. You are doing it for free. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this  See I feel I would feel bad about doing that. I totally wouldn't now. I'm just kidding  We know that we were the negotiations just back and forth and  Her manager, oh my god  With all those extra brown M&Ms now, but this is maybe what's wrong with me because I wouldn't dream of asking you to do it  for free  Well because you're professional and what is Av Williams a professional? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I see what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If he didn't have a history of taking my content  And locking it into his silo at Twitter I might not be so skeptical but I am  No, I'm turning into a grump. I'm sorry. I apologize. I saw I'm gonna stop it right now. I  Love everything. I think medium is beautiful. It's got pretty pictures  It's nicely laid out its formatting is good  You're gonna have a curation problem, you know, it's kind of like Quora  It's kind of like that's the idea like Quora you just pump in content, right?  It's in response to a question, but it's the same idea. Yeah. Yeah, it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's there's a lot of content on chorus, but people spend a lot of time answering questions  I often have that question that that feeling of like well  Why wouldn't I just write a blog post at least on my own side if I'm gonna work for free and might as well  Do it on my own domain for you know myself, but I think it's the community and I think with with medium  It's just a man. It's very much like the Huffington Post  It's a matter of kind of you know status, but is there curation at all in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand now that it's opened up  There was in the sense that you were invited in right but not anymore right right like subtle so recommend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's recommended and then there's newest  But in this case in the HBO girls  Group it's the same thing. This is only four posts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing right? So I suggested a collection of butter and swarts and there were four posts  Right and I'm gonna do a mic about idea  I started a new collection around those trolls and the Amanda Palmer one which is about redefining rude

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to try to write more on that topic. There's some very good writers out there. You know it's like musician  But if you okay, so let's say I created a site that for musicians  I said post your music here, and we'll share it with the world. I guess that's like SoundCloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well here's another way to look at a Leo myspace  Yeah a blogger what  Another way to look at it is in my field. I've been arguing lately that  We're trapped by thinking that we're in the content business and that all of our value is  Intrinsic to our content and the content itself is has value right now. We talked about this the show before  I get other value about a being on Huffington Post right because I and being here because I get more fame  You know because people recognize me and see me and hear my blatherings, and then I get gigs out of that  There's other reasons to do things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't pay you your worth  Just what we want to pay you I  Make money on you. I make more money than I pay you well you sure that before  That's actually not the case on a lot of our shows  But in this case I'd make more money than I pay you, but we also gave you  Spontaneously gave you a raise as this show became more profitable. We said oh, we're making more money. We're gonna kick in some more I  Don't know I just maybe I'm maybe that's why I'm a bad businessman. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know I wonder it's funny because I feel differently about  Spending an hour doing a podcast versus two hours writing right. Oh, yeah, I mean I guess yeah  I guess there's no I mean the only difference is you know synchronous versus asynchronous time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we demand your time at a specific time of the week every week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's some prep and you know but the same with with writing it takes a long time to write a good piece and to do your  Research and all that stuff. I don't know if it's just the the web and  If there's a difference about written content just feels like it's free  So we're just more willing to post it on reddit or Quora or you know wherever that we gets more eyeballs versus  You know where it gets us paid. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft's scruge old campaign may be working. They say that half of their 80 million  Users on outlook comm I'm sorry 60 million outlook comm users now that it's a out of beta our  Xg former I don't know how they would know this form. I was email. Everybody is a former gmail user a former Yahoo mail user a former

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AOL user. What does it mean? Yeah, I mean I use both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope they're not considering me one of those former well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft is just turning into this whiny little thing like me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead. I dropped this in the in the rundown because I think it's interesting that the marketing campaign is  This is what Google's doing to you. It's the duck duck go approach, right?  Like Google's tracking your stuff  They're using the creek back right the creep factor around Google to sell there  So if this is true if this number is true, it sounds as if this is whatever  What was it 60 million people?  Yeah, 16. Yeah, 60 million people who don't like the idea that if they mention the word mortgage in their email to a friend that they're  Gonna get adsense ads about refinancing  That's interesting. It's interesting if that's if that's truly the reaction  I have a hard time believing that this is really but it's interesting that they hung a whole campaign around that and I wonder  you know if there's an opportunity for competitors to  to kind of  Point out what Google does and what their business model is if it's not clear to people like crystal clear and then say we don't  Do this and this is what we you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About that Gina, I think you're right  I think that's one of what's going on and I think that what bothers me about that is that also gives cooties to the entirety  of the internet business model and  basically  Microsoft has failed Microsoft and News Corp are failing at selling digital ads online  and that's why they're switching to a paywall structure and they're switching to trying to cut down everybody else who's in that model and  the ad model requires cookies and  tracking  And and there's other stuff and so yeah, you can yank down the other guy, but is that really a business model? I?  Don't I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He froze in a very attractive pose I have no other kindly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what I think is interesting is the idea that that if people if everyone really understood how this all works  And it's kind of crazy that at this point we don't I mean  But but if everyone understands how this works right the way that advertising works on the internet where it's it's based on and data  It's data driven based on your behavior  If the if the choice is if someone could pay for for privacy  Versus get free for ads and I increasingly hear from people who say you know  I wish I could just just pay a little extra money and I think that's a good thing  Just pay a little extra money and not get tracked. Yeah, they're gonna say that they're gonna say that but I  Bet on that bottle right you think pay walls are just they're not they're just ain't gonna work people aren't gonna pay if there's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Competition that's as good. That's good enough if not better  Right, I haven't used out what's not come. I have no idea how good it is, but I love gmail. Yeah. Yeah, I do too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's which me off fry gmail from my cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Microsoft might also have said is the other half comes from out hotmail.com refugees  So there oh  I had a good let me go back to it  Sergey Brin  Giving a speech at Google Ventures CEO summit talking about how important it is to fail fast. This is kind of the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Accepted wisdom and startups fail fast move on it's a long story that he tells but it's also a good story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll synopsize it because it is a 10-minute video which you can you can see at search engine land calm  But the story is that before there was Google Sergey and his friends created a pizza ordering site that involved  faxing  pizzas orders to the pizza shop  No phone calls required. However, it turns out pizza shops really don't check their fax  Often so Sergey and his friends are sitting there waiting and waiting for their pizza  He called him later and he was told let me check the fax machine  No, he decided this isn't gonna work  So he got together with Larry Page and worked on data mining and the link structure of the web and Google was born  He said he's glad the fax idea failed quickly  So he could move on to bigger and better things  Wouldn't it be sad if a great man a great mind like his was devoted to making it easier to order pizza  Google now soon with the pizza ordering service pizza order. Okay glass pizza. Oh  You just look at a pizza say I'll have one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Domino's guy we get to watch him going around delivering the pizzas. That's that would be interesting

Transcript:  I do like I do like glimpse where you could you know, that would be a great thing for Domino's to send me a glimpse  Saying here's our driver  He's on his way. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mean if you think that through though, okay glass pizza glass knows where you are at the moment where the nearest pizza shop is  What your address is what your phone number is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will all be 800 pounds because we always want pizza or imagine that you that we're all having this conversation right now about pizza  And we're wearing Google Glass and it pops up a thing that says the nearest shop to you is two blocks away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's just hurt us talking and that's what Eric Schmidt that's the remember that pants story that you'll know you need pants  And it will just say hey, there's a pants shop right there  If there even be such a thing as a pants shop or like I'm you know, I look in the refrigerator  I say hey glass I need milk. That's what we need. I wish the hell the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Refrigerators would start ordering food for us. Yeah, seriously, but then later on when you're walking down the street glass will say hey  There's milk in this store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a coupon for milk down the street  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So glass is paying attention when you look in your fridge is recording everything you eat if it's hummus it sends it to the National Security  Administration, but otherwise  If you're out of milk and it knows that in the past we've seen milk here  We know exactly what brand and the next time I'm walking by Petaluma Market says milk. Here's a coupon  Yeah, hey you need milk you so you think that the violation of privacy involved in recording everything that's in your refrigerator  Add infinitum is worth that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I say okay glass I need milk and glass just remember so I could do that your iPhone right now  Yeah, I can but but you know, I hey I'm making my cereal here Leo. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could say Siri remind me when I get to the market to get milk and it will actually next time you go to the market  We'll say oh you need milk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

So what is hover? Well, they're technically they're an MVNO a  Mobile virtual network operator, but really what they are is a no BS cell phone company  Now they're their cell phone service is they're reselling Sprint. So if Sprint works well where you are good coverage and so forth  This is gonna be a great choice for you  There is no heavy-handed upselling or aggressive women. I'm doing ting. I should do hover  Wonder I got confused same cut  You know why it's the same companies to cows so two cows is doing with ting the same thing  They're doing with hover. That is we saw a better way to do  Something that's being done poorly ting was to replace cell phone service hovers to replace domain management and boy  This is a big improvement. I'm sorry. I got confused, but this is the same company. So it's all the same get ting to  hover comm slash twig is  The place to go for getting your domain names managed and I'll tell you there is no upselling  You get you get who is privacy as part of the deal. They've got a great concierge  transfer service  So that if you have exit and you probably do have names at another site, but you want to move it over  They'll do it all for you  Domains start from $15 a year including unlimited domain forwarding no charge who is and for that you get a whole new  year of  Your domain name.

This is this is  One of my favorite companies Elliot NOS a CEO there really says look there's stuff that's being done so poorly  We see it as an opportunity. I mentioned the phone service and hover comm domain registry made simple  If you've got a domain name or you want to register a new one hover comm slash  Twig and I think you'd get 10% off your new domain name if you do that  All right.
