I'm glad to see I can report that podcasting is  Vital and alive and there's a lot of great stuff going on. A lot of people were there were new to it  In fact, it was kind of fun for me to go to a podcast expo and not be recognized  Which means it's not the old timers. It's these new is new people, which is fantastic  And how big is it? It's not huge. I mean, it's a tiny little conference. I don't know how many people were there maybe a thousand  And the and the booths all fit in a hotel ballroom, so it's not giant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Next week I get to go to the now here this podcast festival in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's gonna be a lot of big shows there too. It's WNYC

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's doing I bought the three-day ticket

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a little jealous  It's super jealous September 8th through 10th  You get to see live  Performances of comedy bang bang and planet money and Larry Wilmore Levar Burton  John love it and friends love it or leave it lore criminal  So you're gonna go see all those shows? Oh  Sense of the place is somebody who's a regular on podcasts  You'd probably look at this and go geez who would want to sit and watch podcasts sit and watch people like us talk  I know but there are a lot of celebrities. I mean you got Lauren Lapkus. You've got Levar Burton  You've I mean, this is John love it. These are very will more Larry Wilmore. These are big name a lot of comedy  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we got to get more money. It seemed to be that was always the intro to podcasts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always associate it with tech and comedy. Yeah tech first comedy came later, but a lot of comedians who are not working  Ended up like a podcast and frankly journalist I endorse that it worked really well  And look at Marc Maron, you know, he is lawyers taken off fact  He's great in the new Netflix original glow highly recommend him in that it's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a couple things on the on the run now that speaking of new kinds of content  One is I just about to finish listening to John Ronson's  Butterfly effect butterfly just downloaded that tell me about that. It's it's an ammo. It's so it's audible. I think six-part  Podcast the thing it's free for which he's best. It's free for all members right now  So and I recommend it highly John Ronson who wrote the shaming book  He he starts with a single event a guy named Fabian who's thought that hey  Why isn't porn free on the internet and then Ronson looks at the butterfly effect of all of those things and it is  Fascinating well reported quite amazing not  I'll give you one example  Don't worry  So he's he sees all the effects of the free porn and how that what that does the industry then goes up to  San Fernando Valley and talks to  producers and directors and and talent and  Any he asked somebody there he said I recognize these women are just get all kinds of work then they're gone and then  They're kind of back there what happened?  well it turns out that that  You have to be either young enough to play a teenager or old enough to play a milf pardon me for that and in the middle  There's no work in porn as we would now see it. So there's a new industry that started in custom porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know that? Yeah, I did know that I had no idea  It's a big industry because people will pay to get stuff made to their particular weird fetish

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For Stacy  Well, so the one that fascinated Ronson was a guy who  Said I want you to take my my stamp collection  I've been collecting for 30 years and I want three naked women to destroy it and burn it  And then mock the guy who's playing basically him the owner of the stamp collection strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that kind of stuff humans will never cease to amaze  So there's a new style of show which is not what we do  Which is right NPR style, but it's produced in that where you go. So Joey liked his stamp collection  And then there's music  But Joey didn't know let me just play a little bit and just see can you get my are you didn't hear my audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you least expect them  This story started for me when I happen to see a man glance as a woman. It's totally that style

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's all the music

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then the other thing the other news  Like that, I think you should yeah. Yeah. He was the voice Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis was a journalism professor  One day when walking to his office. He noticed something odd  Stacey Higginbotham  And I don't know but I just it's funny because it is it is it's basically a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's basically a book and then for dummies who don't read their eyes met and this is what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it started with I'm almost certain it's Ira glass and  Life that created

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The BBC because the BBC does these highly produced radio dramas that these kind of I love their stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really love their stuff. But listen listen to I'll just play at completely random a  this American life  So I was exactly just listen how it begins

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pause a cop in New York Paul Bacon  Officer bacon no jokes, please  And one night he did his regular four to midnight shift  And then he was told that they needed him to cover a second shift in another part of the city and a little security  booth in an area they were protecting from terrorists basically  At 2 a.m. The other officer who's working in this booth with him takes a lunch break goes and takes a nap  And then at 3 a.m. It's Paul's turn for a break  He's exhausted  Remember he had already worked. I should point out Ira glass who has this great, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New York sound  Says that the beats are 40 seconds, so we're at 30 seconds in I'm predicting in 10 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There'll be some music and he decides that he's also gonna take a nap be a payoff  So he gets into his patrol car and he drives it out into the 38 seconds away from the security

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've never heard this car in the one available spot thinking there's no then oh, yeah, then you do sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a real sound then you do sound I could it's just it's a formula  I don't mind it. In fact this I consider for years this American life to be the I still did the best radio show ever done  But it's a radio show  Created for public radio and I in podcasts don't have to sound like public radio radio shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying exactly amen, which is which is part of the podcast festival. I think if they're the non-comedy ones they overproduce it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very good very good. I think there's room for both. What's the debate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm worried because I get a lot of people who are like Stacy you should produce your show more and I'm like  It's just Kevin and I talking about stuff. I don't tell them to listen to this show because it's even worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not storytellers. We're conversationalists in this in this world. The irony is I have enough staff that I could easily do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, but from day one I  Decided that we would want to sound informal and live in fact to do it live here. Let's hear listen to Stacy's

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, guys, we don't need to talk about custom porn anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No more, but I tried to try to distract him but I should write so the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the other thing I found interesting was have you have you watched Facebook watch? No, what's that?  Look is shifting to  episodic serial video  Loyalty video which makes me really interested Leo your reactions to whether or not you would produce something  Ten-minute length a week or a day for Facebook with revenue coming from Facebook or given the amount of money they're spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're they're producing stuff. I mean, let's and so here's their promo. This is  Discover new shows to enjoy with friends and other fans introducing watch  So they show it on a phone which is telling because they clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That show yeah, yes, yes, they they take your phone from you they plug it into the screen  They find something embarrassing and then they say are you willing for me to you know, put this on Facebook?  That's the whole that's the whole game and then they eliminate people one by one until there's a winner

Transcript:  Low-cost I don't think it's even Millennials. I think that is teenagers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not just that Leo  The other thing I realized about custom porn is that we already know those custom content custom advertising when the custom porn  Now anybody with money can make content the skill of making content is completely commodified completely  So there's nothing special about making content. So nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a famous woman life she is you have to turn it up if you want to hear it because it's very low  Can I do it  Talking like that. I mean I can do it  Does it have to be a attractive young woman or can an old man do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The intro I could do it all like Herbert the pervert  Come on in. I'd like to show you something in my basement  So what it's interesting for Stacy Stacey's got a migraine coming on this big I got down  You should always have wine for this show I'm just saying  But it shows that's why I don't that's why I don't celebrate this in this NPR style podcast because it's so formulaic and there's and look  There's so many things you could do and and it'd be silly to copy what we do, too  I mean, I'm coming to be fair. I'm copying kind of the McLaughlin group roundtable style news show  I guess it'd be the closest analog to what we do and I always every time I've you know talked about doing a show  It's always been like this because I like the dialogue. I like the kind of conversation  Could you get me a nice soothing lamp in a we could turn the lights down a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Help Helen smash  Helen smash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New this week. I'm sure I'm there. I guess to get back to your original point. I do see Facebook  YouTube  Apple all looking with envy over the fence at Netflix and HBO and saying  You know the and by the way the reason HBO does it is different than why?  Netflix does it is different than why Apple does is different when audible does it they're not they're not all the same goals Apple  Really doesn't care so much about they want to generate traffic for Apple music  Which helps sell hardware?  Netflix is dying on the vine or was because they can't get Hollywood to give a movie or new movies  So they had to make original content that worked really well  HBO's always you know HBO started with movies right, but they couldn't get the great movies  So this well with movies right right there very beginning movies home box office remember why got all kinds of trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With the CEO of Facebook as I was at People magazine  Reviewing them in the first movies were nothing but an excuse to say hey work cable we can show naked breasts  Right and they were ridiculously stupid movies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's crap it's pretty funny because that's what Game of Thrones did every HBO show in the first  At least pilot has as nudity has sexuality  As if they don't trust the name is enraged they dropped it. Yeah, yeah, and then in this season  There's well that we saw Jon Snow's butt, but there was there was no other nudity, and I thought it was great  If finally it's like let's get rid of this soft core porn that feels like HBO feels like they have to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's my question for you Leo, so there are other things your young Turks is here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the young Turks looks like a television news show doesn't it it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lots of lots of different things are here right lots of different stuff including major major media stuff is here would would you?  at twitch  They say the best length is more between two and ten minutes  But you have anywhere from two to two hours you can do we do short form we do short form for the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's the show for this?  Yeah for enough money money  Yeah, we do we do stuff for the echo that we take right what we do is we take our like for this show and others  And we just take a good little section of something and you know three or four minutes and put it on the image

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My echo is broken. I can't hear it. I can't hear it these voices are really soft

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna regret ever introducing you to internet subculture

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never heard of this did your daughter teach you this or did you how did you find out about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend is a therapist in Seattle and so a lot of her she is apparently very in tune with this because some of her clients  Use this it's apparently a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anxiety so there's it okay. Oh, it makes me so anxious. So there's a serious thing. It makes me anxious as hell in therapy  It's autonomous sensory meridian response

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so it's not actually okay. People are gonna come after me. I think but this is not a legit diagnosis  This was actually part of the dinner conversation that not me but some of her therapist friends were having is this a real diagnosis?  No, it's not it's just an internet diagnosis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I wouldn't call this a diagnosis, but there are people who find it reliant  Well, you know when you I used to do this my kids all the time  We they called it chills I draw I draw pictures on their back with the tips of my fingers  I'm sure you do this did this to your daughter  That's one of the things that they do in this  Whispering soft talking light touches methodical sounds  But I don't think this this is just if you feel good when you're getting a massage  I get a massage every week for that reason right or getting a haircut  You know that great feeling when somebody's kind of playing with your hair  Just gently I think I'm worried the verge of learning too much or Bob. Well, you don't come on Jeff  I know you're grumpy, but surely you know what I'm talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am one of those people who like light touches I'm like, oh don't touch me. Oh, that's interesting  It's a I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Washington Post had a good very long piece today about mindfulness and arguing that it's been that's an okay concept  That's been completely ruined with marketing and all this junk that goes around it and and and you know junk psychology  fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Andy talks like that right and he kind of talks quietly Bob Ross with his painting programs  That's hope that was the whole thing about Bob Ross. You didn't want to be you didn't have to want to be a painter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To to they see do you know who Bob Ross is sure she does Ross was great because he was so forgiving  He was like, oh, I just smudge this don't worry about it. He was mr. Rogers

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brushes are marvelous. They'll do wonderful wonderful things for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the fingernails on a chalkboard do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Torture complete torture sure you we can it's like slow talkers. I can't take slow talkers people just a New Yorker Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He wants to be jazzed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, actually  80d people I  Hope I'm not quoting another bogus thing, but I but I happen to look deeply into this. There's a  Comp a group physical group in Marin County this functional MRIs  they talk about different kinds of 80d, but essentially a  attention deficit disorder, which I clearly suffer from is  oddly enough a lack of activity in the frontal lobe a  Frontal lobe that's way slowed down. I bet you this might be what Jeff why you like that stimulus  And so 80d people are constantly trying to stimulate that  That's why they like a lot of things going on at the same time because they're trying to actually get normal  activity in their frontal lobe  And I don't think I mean I don't think that that's I think that's widely that could be considered to be well  It's a theory but an accurate theory. I don't think I'm making up some some crazy thing when I say that  And that's why a lot of the drugs for 80d. I think all the drugs for a childhood 80d are stimulants  Yes, like a girl which is a very nice vetamin and Ritalin, which is a stimulant  Because the they're trying to stimulate the frontal lobe and what I didn't I wasn't on drugs as a kid  But I would do things you do hyper hyper focus is one thing you do which is you do the opposite you'd narrow everything down  So you have one step that used to play chess for that reason  This is very focused or you like to have a lot of things going on once and I think it's kind of our kids  Now or have kind of a situational 80d because there's so much stimulus all the time  That it almost creates a need for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is another thing I learned from the Ronson podcast, there's a lot of good reporting it  I'm gonna listen to this. Yeah the rate of  What do you call it  Recitalism where you can't get up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Erectile dysfunction or thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So 80 the rate of ed and people under 30 for years in many studies started in 48 with Kinsey with running about two three percent  Now it's running twenty six percent  Because we're overstimulated these overstimulated with porn and other things and yeah  Fascinating and so the so so the belief that  Pregnancies are down  It was oh well good sex education is working and the expert Ronson talked to said no probably because they can't have sex

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I understand Facebook wanting to do this  It's just like YouTube and remember YouTube spent a hundred million dollars and got nothing  They had a Shaquille O'Neal channel and stuff and all the celebrities he brought to YouTube  And I think YouTube learned the lesson that YouTube star people watch YouTube for a particular kind of unique video  That's not like any other kind of media. You can't bring old media to YouTube and make it work  I don't know Facebook's learned that this looks a lot like  kind of a youth youth and youthful not I should may I'll call euthanized a  euthanized network television  Where they're just you know, it's still a game show. Here's you just now you're in the pile  It's still its reality show those sitcoms look very much like regular sitcoms with younger people in younger situations  But I bet you they're gonna find out just as YouTube did that you've got to create content  That's native to your platform. Really. I think so meanwhile YouTube just put out a redesign today

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll still drives me nuts about YouTube  Can't tell the difference it does and and I the problem I have with YouTube is always the irony of being part of Google is  I can't find out what's going on. I can't search there recommending things to me that are four years old next to things that are four hours old and  no way for me to get in and say what the hell's what's going on on the YouTube I can't ever find out because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's YouTube which is purposeful Jeff. See this button on the left that says trending trending

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know but that's that's as fake as the trending on Facebook. Yeah, it's probably YouTube's. This is what we want you to watch. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Surrounded by killer whales

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I you know, yeah interesting yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and so I can't dig in or if I want to see what is this far-right YouTube that's occurring

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no way for me to dig in and find it or my fear. Of course is when I look at one you can search for it on Google  That's true it would come right up I found ASMR like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Stacey has come around on Facebook though, right you after the first of all we should mention  Stacey's in Austin, but your family's in Houston  Your parents and they're okay. You grew up in Houston. Everybody's in good good vibes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and may our own Megan Moroney also grew up in Houston

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And she says it's very chilling to look at these videos because she recognizes these streets  Is that same for you?  So, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is and I'll just give you my little Stacey's quick take on all of this because I really like the way  I'm going to give you my little take on all of this because actually on Monday  I was I was not doing well. I was shook very  My family has lived on the gulf coast forever and when hurricane Katrina hit in 2005  My extended family lost everything they were in Biloxi like literally their houses were all gone  I think I had one cousin who managed to save their pickup truck  and so  It was hard to watch it was hard to recover from it took a long time  In what's unfathomable to me is that's happening right now in Houston  over  A much longer time frame what happened with Mississippi not with New Orleans  But Mississippi after Katrina was you know, very quick  And now my parents have been holed up in their house unable to leave. Oh dear  for like four days now and it's the water's not going down and  It's hard to see  It's hard to see all of these places that you know and love underwater, but it's also hard to realize that  This is this is not something that's easy to come back from and it's  most of the people who were affected in Biloxi a lot of them left and the town is not the same and  I don't know  It is it is tough. So I bet Houston's gonna come back soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Houston's gonna come back Stacy because New York Sandy Sandy hit us really hard the aftermath of Sandy  Is really difficult. I mean it's worse than the storm  You you you weather the storm literally and then you then my god the the carpet you rip out and the drywall and the houses that  Are gone and and the neighbors who leave and all that but then I think some places vibrant is Houston  I'm more worried about the towns that the storm is hitting now  Than Houston. I think Houston it just has Houston's too. It's what America's fourth largest city. It's it's got to come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't it? It will come back incredible. The cost is going to be amazing a lot of there's a couple things  There's a lack of the places that are flooding aren't places that are insured by floods  This is not over there is still water rising and it will continue to rise over the next few days  and  I think a lot of people will leave a lot of businesses are going to be affected and shut down  So the poorest people who work in like the service industry at local restaurants and places like that. They're not going to  Your job's going to be gone for a long time and  The impact of this  I don't think sandy is a great  And i'm not trying to i'm not saying that sandy was not catastrophic. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is beyond in so many ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The types of businesses the types of people who are affected but we'll see and then there's all these tiny towns like  Yeah, that are basically like parts of them are just washed away  And that'll be  That'll be what it is so we'll see it's going to take a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I just put up there's a great washington post column by david von dreil  about the poor  And these kinds of events and he said that he quotes a a a  sports writer from it long many years ago  Who said that everyone gets the same amount of ice in life the rich get theirs in the summer the poor in the winter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh and and and talking about how expensive this is proportionally for people's lives if you're poor and and  Uh, it's going to be awful for those who are rich can afford it, but it's awful beyond belief  The poor this is going to hit the poor terribly stacy what uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What should people do who hear this your story and and I know it makes me feel very empathetic what?  What in your experience is useful to do at this point donate to the red cross? What what would you like people to do?  Take it. Oh, you know at this no, but at this point we'd like to do something. What should we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of good charities. I would also say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is crazy, but keep some keep some powder dry. Um, yeah, yeah, it's going to louisiana next by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, this is  This may not even be the first big storm. However crazy that would be. Um, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's not even this isn't even the first big storm. This is the third  massive 500 year storm 500 year storm in the last few years in houston, I mean  Uh, this is this is almost a punch after two more punches and and you're right. There may be more to come

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ike wasn't that bad rita  Rita was I feel like rita had ripped a lot of roofs off  Houston's actually accomplished and good with floods believe it or not. Um, there but this is just unprecedented the hurricane itself is not  It's the right drama

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like mother nature learned a new bad trick. It's like it's like it learned social media  You know, let me create a storm that just stays forever and that can happen anywhere. You know, it's not just  Southern what you know golf places it could happen the texas tribune

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which by the way, excellent jeff. I'm sure you're i'm sure you're familiar with texas. You're the greatest. They're the greatest  Yes, they're fantastic organization news future of news, but they have a site or they have an article  That's actually very good how to get and offer help after hurricane harvey  and things like i'm a big fan of the  I use the central texas food bank, but houston food bank. There's the texas diaper bank  um  there's going to be I mean if you  If you're inclined you could volunteer to actually come down and do trips after this is done  They need medical workers right now, but later they're going to need construction help. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great. You're right. This is a great article  It's on the front page of texastribune.org  And there's and there's just a lot of places you can help

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, this is this is I mean  Texas is not a place with a great social net. Um  So that's going to make this particularly devastating. I think and I don't know how we're going to  I don't know how those people I think there's going to be a lot of suffering

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ahead the other thing that i'd recommend from texas tribune and pro publica is a  major piece of reporting from 2016 called helen high water  And as you probably know houston is the largest city in the united states without zoning  And the amount of concrete washington post also had a good graphic on this the amount of concrete the the the the  It's it's unabsorbent soil anyway  And then the construction  Uh, the mad construction houston has led to there was nowhere for the water to go  And you know I contrast that with a piece. I just saw yesterday about berlin where they're trying to make literally to make the city into a sponge  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um austin has had  austin has had impermeate so impervious cover is a huge debate in austin which  a lot of people and it's for precisely this reason because underneath of it  So we have eco-create and all of these things that they don't have in houston, but houston has been marketed for decades as being  Developer friendly that's that's what it is. And that's also why it's got incredibly cheap housing. Yeah, and that's important to people  and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's uh, it's it's not to pun make a pun, but it's a perfect storm  um, yeah, it's a combination of all of these historic factors and uh,  and current factors and probably climate change and it is it it is a  disaster  Uh, if you if you're the kind of person who wants to give a donation and kind of have it spread as as widely as possible  I think I don't I know some people don't believe in the red cross  But I think the red cross is a great place to go  The mayor of houston's created a relief fund the hurricane harvey relief fund  And if you're the kind of person that likes to know who you're giving to go  I think this is kind of cool. Go fund me has done something. You know, a lot of people go to go fund me to  raise money  uh, go fund me has compiled a list of all of the  hurricane harvey relief  Efforts some am I a little cynical?  I'm worried about some of these well, you know you should but at this probably not now not the time to worry  If you if you want, you know, I want to go to a big national organization then go to the red cross, but right  Um, it's you know, if there's some of these are not great maybe okay fine  um, but if it if it you know anything anything you can do is gonna  Help a little bit. Anyway, I agree. There's probably scammers in here, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The texas diaper bank i'll throw that out there a lot of people have talked about it. It's a good one. They are  raising a ton of money, but diapers are  And baby supplies are always difficult to come by and they are a reputable organization that has deep ties in with the food banks  so  They they can actually make it  Into the community in a way that's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard to stay see before we got in the air  You were starting to talk about how iot the the effect of iot and how iat could be used in these kinds of disasters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is this is me being a super nerd, but I have been monitoring my parents  So my parents live near a it's called the brazos river and it they're in a mandatory evacuation zone  and so the second I discovered this I went to the hydrograph data from the  the us geological survey  Does this and here i'll put a link to this is  This is the hydrograph data. Let's find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never know where to put things in this. Can I show I mean you tweeted it so I I guess it's kind of public the picture of your  parents street

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and that tweet actually has the hydrograph data too. Oh nice. I can click that link on the tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've they've got this  In its everywhere that's so that's my parents house. Um or the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the the view from their front door to the and this has been this way the streets completely flooded for days  For days, they can't they can't leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they can't leave. I mean it would be risky for them to leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess they could but it'd be very risky for them to leave the car could die a car can't go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a high pickup truck come and pick up my brother. Wow  but so but the water should be going down and so what's cool is there's actually the lcra has  Wonderful data and then the  Whatever the various noah and the us geological survey. You can actually find really good data online right now for  How far the rivers are going and how much rainfall is found fallen?  And that's I think that's really to me. It's really comforting to be like  Oh, they've evacuated my parents because they expected this river to rise to 59 the crest at 59 feet  Yesterday so, you know, i've been glued to this thing for the last couple weeks or last couple days and i'm like  It's not going as high and they keep lowering the forecast. So it's kind of nice  But the other thing  Not internet of things is facebook. My parents aren't on facebook and my mom is trying not to have me worry  So she's not sending me a lot of information  But I found a group on facebook  Where my parents live so someone's on this kind of creepy, I guess no  That's i'm stalking someone who lives near my parents so I can see pictures of the street in the house isn't doing it  Right, and then I also managed to connect. I found out that one of my old friends from high school actually lives near them now  so I connected the two of them so now I feel like  My parents who don't know a lot of their neighbors despite having lived there for like 30 years  They now are part of this community of people who will look out for them and they will also look out for those people and  I found it  via facebook, which weird  Because i'm not very into facebook as your mom is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not into it either. Um, how about facebook safety check?  I I was talking about this earlier this week on the one hand  It seems like a great idea that you if you're on facebook and they know you're in a disaster area  They say let your friends and family know you're okay click this button and then but if you're not on facebook  And your friends and family know you live on the brazos river or if you are on facebook  But you don't have internet because you you're in it, right?  Then people are going to worry about you. I feel like safety check kind of is not the best idea  I don't know. What do you think about that stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a couple of my friends I think because everyone kept asking did do with the safety check, but  Some of them who I knew were in danger  They safety checked themselves, but they gave me nothing else and that was highly unsatisfying. Yeah  Not I mean, this is me personally right like darn it. I want to hear your story  but  I will say the coolest part about facebook  was  Under like what happened in houston is a lot of people were under evacuation orders  But they couldn't get out because the roads were blocked. So it was hard to know where you could go  And so I was watching my friends and random strangers  Who were friends of friends talk about okay i-90 or 90 was closed eastbound, you know, or I couldn't get past, you know  belford on six and all of these like  That would be useful, wouldn't it?  It seemed to be useful and then there were just lots of lots of coordination among people like hey  Does is anyone in sienna plantations? My grandmother's cats are there and if anyone lives in that neighborhood and can go by her house  Please and someone actually ended up kayaking over there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're not going to see a lot of that but we see a lot of like I liked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was heartbreaking to watch my friends, you know on  Saturday be like hey, we're all good. And then on monday to start realizing that oh crap  My life is about to irrevocably change because my business and home are actually flooding right now  um, right  but it was also really heartwarming to see like  How people were treating each other and taking care of each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great great pictures of people carrying each other out  Um the rescues it's amazing seen a lot of those  And now it's not just the rest of the east

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's things like hey the kroger at this intersection is open if you can get to it and they have three  They have three shelves full of milk like  it's not just that's  That's  that's what kind of blows my mind and I know that it's boring but  In the people in houston are actually complaining a lot about the national media coverage, which I don't  They're like it's too  You know rescues and we're doomed and really what would be useful to us is knowing where the grocery stores are  Or which stores are open which roads are open  You know that kind of information in the chronicle the local paper was doing that but facebook was filling a lot of those needs as well  I don't expect cnn to tell me what grocery stores are open, you know in sugar land  so  I don't know. I just  the internet was a really  really powerful tool here that I  Was really glad we had yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other piece too is so when katrina hit new orleans I had started nola.com and I left the company right before katrina hit  But but there were cases of people who?  Couldn't you know, there was no twitter?  Um  And there were cases of people who they could barely get a message out to some relative in in utah  Who would then go on to a forum on nola.com the news site that I helped start  And and and that was monitored by the police to get the rescue here  He saw that you saw the crude beginning of it then  And now you have the fact that that besides 9-eleven besides the fact we have cell phones and we could call  Um, you have new monitoring structures, which I think will only improve more after every one of these natural disasters  There are efforts to try to put it all together and just do one tool then people make 100 tools  But you can see a facebook  and a twitter  Uh creating combined tools that really get to that kind of information more efficiently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's why and you know for people who aren't there  you know  There were people who went and walked around neighborhoods and knocked on doors just to make sure because like  Yeah, even though these were mandatory evacuations you can't mandatorily evacuate a million people  So it's basically like get out now. Here's the routes. We don't know how long they're going to be open  And if they stay put, you know, there's no one who actually knows who's where so in a city like houston  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that was that was well, here's another story. This is from the new york times. This was a picture of a  Uh assisted living center in  Houston look how high the water is it's up to the table. They were told to stay put but the water kept rising  Uh, somebody tweeted it  Another woman in houston. There was some conversation on twitter. Oh, that's fake. Then somebody in houston. No, that's not fake  See that woman with the blanket. That's my sister  They figured out where it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, galveston the galveston newspaper did it so the person who tweeted it was the son of the owner of that nursing home  In dickinson, which is outside of it outside of galveston. I don't know  um  And so yes people thought it was fake, but it was not fake and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The galveston commissioners county commissioner says no no, we knew they were in there  We we were going to rescue him anyway, but I don't think it hurt  Too much to have that picture all over twitter that might have uh stimulated a little bit faster response. That's just terrifying  It's awful, uh to see that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you see I mean like instagram has these crazy posts  um, I guess  Rico did a story on snapchat  What I would have liked to see google had a map that showed the road closures  Uh, let's see. I don't know if  Can bring it up but google harvey road closures and the chronicle had one  but like that was kind of the  That was one of the more challenging things is trying to figure that out and I feel like google didn't do a great job  But it tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it is interesting that facebook really has google has a safety check, but nobody I don't know if people know about it  Um  It does seem like google kind of didn't jump on this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you do google harvey crisis map, you'll see  You'll see so I mean but  It wasn't apparently it wasn't as good as what people needed to actually get out  And the challenge is it was changing all the time really quickly, right?  so that  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where big data should be of value right these companies have spent so much time and money to collect every bit of data  There there is  presumably, I mean  That that collection doesn't stop  With a disaster, uh, you can that there seems like they would have a lot of information that would be useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and also like phone companies are going to know where there's an active phone within a cell, right?  Uh, there's you know, if you want to find out who's what people are around there's other ways to do that  There's a lot a lot more that can be done. Look at all the flooded streets. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's privacy  Issues here. Yeah, so this is I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's ways to handle not publicly but but privately to the authorities to say  You know if I I have zero objection to the cop saying in an emergency such as this  Show me it's like what it'd be like going by with infrared show me where you think there are people phone company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well what we need is a coordinate a more coordinated system where you know all of these data points can be  Shared and uh  Somebody's asking of course we have a regular on our shows Dwight Silverman  He's checked in on safety check that he's okay  But that's one of the problems with safety check that was a couple of days ago. I haven't heard anything since  So that's another one of those. That's a really good point. Yes. He's such a good guy. Oh, you know Dwight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He is a good guy. He was with he was with the houston chronicle tech forever and he was on our shows when he was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then he's he recently about a year ago said i'm not gonna do your shows anymore because i'm not doing tech anymore

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, uh, because i'm dwight we'd have you on no, it doesn't matter. You still have an opinion on tech. I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wrote a story for ours technica. Oh, oh nope. He did not he tweeted a story from ours technica by eric burger  So, I don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dwight did it  So, uh the fat vegan chef on twitter tells me that ways also has a bunch of editors keeping closed streets  Updated in their map for houston area. That's perfect ways knows where there is no traffic moving

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so people people complained about ways and that was that was what I thought I was like, huh?  so I was very curious what ways was doing because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There ways generally depends upon  Manual street closure  And essentially a pain to report a street a closed street

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay, because yeah a lot of people were apple maps was showing closures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it seems like map programs. That's one of the first things they should do especially  Since driving in a flooded area is so dangerous. That's how a lot of people die including houston police sergeant  You would think that don't drive here would be a very high priority

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it changes so rapidly I think that is part of the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's where ways I would think could be really be hugely valuable  That's the one kind of you know constantly updated  crowdsourced information for roads  Ways should have a add a button, you know flooding here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe during a crisis perhaps or and the other challenge is  Rerouting someone as the roads close is really tough, right? Like I can't imagine trying to drive out of  What basically is like scenes from the apocalypse, you know, you're like, oh jebus. Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's harvey harvey. That was our harvey news. Yeah, we've got our harvey  And dwight is fine. He's on twitter and he's active and as you said, he's he's tweeting a lot of houston news  including pictures of the the chronicle newsroom  With a news warehouse in emergency mode many journalists working remotely there's a little bit of water there on the floor  Yeah  But still people in there  I can't even imagine. I just can't imagine what that what that must be like  Are you tempted to go down there stacy? Probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um when I can get down there I will go down there to volunteer but right now good there's no way to  I would not help at this moment in time. I would just be another body in the way  You don't want to get in the way. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well, I think I think you gave us the best resource  Uh, which is that what is it again the texas?  distribution tribune  dot org  And they have right on the front page there a way that you can get help or help  Depending on uh, what your particular needs are. It's a second article down how to get and offer help after hurricane harvey  And that's a really good resource  I think everybody watching this probably wants to reach out in some way. The good thing is you do see all the tech companies  Making it easy to donate apple has always been very good about that putting a red cross donation button on its itunes store  Uh, so it's very easy to you know, give 10 bucks. I saw a great tweet this morning  Ladies, if a guy hits you up in a bar and asks for your phone number take his phone and text 10 dollars to the red cross

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was a good idea. They could do that on the on the new  Facebook show one more here usc waller on twitter says the way who is a volunteer ways map updater  Yeah, so the ways his 50 plus volunteer editors closing roads  We depend on info from user reports twitter government reports, etc. That makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and he or she is map editor and south carolina state manager. Yeah an environmental engineer. So, you know your stuff  awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really interesting. Yeah. All right. I wonder if you could pull in data from the api  I know someone complained during the rain on the weekend to google  that  Austin has a site called atx floods and all the rain gauges  They pull in data to this website that says hey, we're underwater. This road is now closed  so if you go to atx floods, but apparently during the  Flooding that we had in austin, which was very minor, but we were all like, ah, we're getting a lot of rain  Um, it exceeded its api calls basically to to google and so they had to ask for help from google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in the rest of the world google maps now makes it easier for you to find parking  Parking not really a problem in houston, but the rest of the world you can there's actually parking difficulty icon on the destination card  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know when I was in seattle were they testing it a couple weeks ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been slowly rolled out and seattle was one of the places in fact. They're now adding  Cities outside the u.s including amsterdam london madrid mosco paris rome sao paulo at toronto and vancouver  You can find parking garages near your destination when you use maps  Automatically add it to your trip. So you see the button with the p and the plus you can add parking to your trip  It also includes walking time to your final destination  Well, that's what's fascinating  about  This flood thing is we're kind of in this weird world where there's should be ample data stuff like this  And then there's not enough data or maybe the maybe there's silos data silos or whatever  But obviously google's made a deal with parking garages  in fact google's  Well, actually tech crunch is speculating that at some point  Google might add the ability to make a reserve reservation for a parking spot kind of like open table for parking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you can do that for your car if you're on the e-charge network, I think that's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah for the electric cars. Yeah  Yeah  Uh, yeah, it's in uh, it's not in austin  alana boston charlotte chicago cleveland dallas fort worth  dc denver detroit houston la miami  Minneapolis st. Paul new york city orlano philadelphia phoenix pittsburgh portland san diego sacramento san francisco  As you noted seattle and st. Louis and tampa

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google it was it was very accurate in seattle, too  It would be like this is part. This has ample parking and i'm like, whoa, and then I was like, oh it really does

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It did so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, if you if you want to have some fun gaming, uh, google you can game the google translation  Somebody has and uh if it created translation for kim jong-un as mr. Squidward  Of course one of the characters in spongebob square pants  I didn't know translate was crowdsourced  Oh, actually, they're translating supreme leader as mr. Squidward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are we going to talk about let's see ar and ar core because there was surely uh tech crunch, uh  Did they they were playing with some apple ar stuff and so I was like  They were talking about ar selfies. I don't know if you saw that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's one of the things that will be coming in the new iphone we hear  Yes ar core is is google's dumbed down version of tango see google's been ahead of this game  With tango, but the problem is to do tango. You need a certain hardware platform  ar kit so successful  that google has unveiled ar core which is  Similar not exactly the same thing but the idea is it makes it easier  For developers to take advantage and you've seen uh, we've shown this but you may have seen these  These demo videos  Tango requires a significant hardware. And of course you got to talk  phone companies into putting that hardware and to date only the asus zen phone is a consumer grade  Tango platform, but ar core does not  So it would work on almost anything, you know modern the pixels samsung galaxy s8 as long as you're running 7.0 or higher  so suddenly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna ask because I was a little confused. Is every device going to be ar core certified or do you just have to have some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like ar kit. So apple's ar kit goes down to I think the iphone 5 or 5s  Uh, this is kind of similar ar core. You just have to you have to have android 7 which is in most cases means a fairly modern  Android handset, but you don't need any special hardware, which means it's not going to be as good as tango

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but it's a toy to play with learn and here's some examples if you can only get tango on one device or two devices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exactly  Yeah, it's awesome, but you can't have it. It's hard. It's hard to know. I think this is google  It's a little preemptive strike from google because the iphone  With uh, you know, the new iphone will be coming out september 12th or announced september 12th, we think now so that's two weeks  That's a week from tuesday two weeks from yesterday and the new pixel  Pixel we have a date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These monopoly platforms are hoovering up our data have no competition. They're too big to serve the public interest writes nick  shernicheck  Oh  Come on now you gotta do more than

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You gotta tell us why he's wrong as one person said on on on facebook when I posted it, you know  Okay. Well what government takes it over once somebody said how about lichtenstein? Yeah  Which government do you trust to take over the internet folks?  estonia estonia estonia  Estonia i trust estonia to run. I salute the estonian internet the the iceland internet  That'd be all right. I'll take the ice no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Asling has a little financial a little corruption in the financial well, but they fixed it since I think all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's just it's it's the it's the classic absurd  argument taken to  The absurd length which is we don't like them. They're capitalists. They shouldn't be making money  They're stealing from us. They have too much power. They're too big. So let's just take them over  Yeah, yeah, the government's gonna do a great job running  amazon  And google and facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, obviously if you think about it, there's not there's not a good nationalization solution on the other hand  I don't think it's unreasonable to worry a little bit about the scale  To which these companies are reaching and the power that they're aggregating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did you see  The article by cashmere hill a couple days ago about how

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. There's got to be an explanation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, there there is probably an explanation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to explain it so she she wrote an article in which she said it's uh,  somehow  facebook with its unrevealed  algorithms  Figured out a family member of mine that I did not know about and recommended them to me  i'm not sure  Facebook figured out my family secrets and won't tell me how and it won't tell me how this is cashmere writing in gizmodo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um  So I think what's challenging here is right now most of the population is not aware  Of how much information is being quote unquote hoovered up?  About them and how it's being used and there's no  there's no transparency on some of this and people take it as  as unbiased because it's an algorithm because it comes from  Facebook or because it comes from a computer  And we see that trust or that trust in algorithms playing out with like, oh we'll have software to present  predict recidivism among, you know inmates and use that to determine parole, but we don't understand how it's exactly working  So I don't think it's wrong to say  facebook  This is a little weird that you're doing this and giving me these suggestions. How are you doing it?  There was another story about someone seeing an ad for a mini projector  After on facebook, I think it was or maybe it was on instagram after talking to someone about it  And he was concerned that these stories a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That they're my echo is listening to me. And so I don't buy them for a second. I think I think the concerns are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Understandable and I think if companies actually were a little bit more transparent about how they're doing  I agree with that. I absolutely agree with that. That would yes that would help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Allay these asway well speaking of transparency. So  Meanwhile, then google and facebook each took what I think were num nutty moves this week  google  uh eric schmidt supposedly went to the new american foundation, uh, uh hated something that someone affiliated with him had run the new american foundation then reportedly  Uh got rid of that writer and then the whole project which is around monopolies  That was at new america left  This is not a good thing for google to be anywhere near especially when the project about monopolies was involving the eu  So it looks like google and I don't know, you know, maybe google did or didn't maybe new america overreacted or didn't  I don't know, you know where the pressure points are and how great the pressure was but  The worst thing to happen is for google to do that. Meanwhile  Well  Facebook hired the former public editor of the new york times  Liz spade to handle  Transparency now gizmodo called her incompetent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know and and the outline called it worse  I know people didn't like her and we talked a little bit about on sunday and there were some odd things that she did  But I thought i'm gonna defer into judgment until I hear the headlines were cruel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I tweeted that story facebook hired the worst person in media to work on transparency  Is that really her? I mean, I just tweeted that and then a friend of hers  Excoriated me  And I said, okay. Yeah, this is not civil and I said you're right the headline on its own does say that but the piece  Is actually though devastating  um a fair compilation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and I think that this is caris swisher writing a recode and she points out that she as a cub reporter  Worked for liz spade at the washington post when she was the washington post respected the hell out of liz

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do not doubt that for a second, but her tenure at columbia journalism review and her tenure at the new york times was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A real problem. So she had a problem. She was following the most amazing public editor of the new york times and that's one of the new york times  Fired liz they just they killed the position because they killed the job realized there you can't you can't do better than solomon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the worst thing that that in a job that involves how media media manipulated right now. She got manipulated  Uh in a fairly public way and she went on to uh, tucker carlson show complaining about a writer's  Tweets these were unfortunate things. So my only point is this so so these the plat in this case facebook  I think is trying to do the right thing  but  Because the the paradox is this is because they're not being transparent enough to hear people's opinions and voices and get nominees  There are many people who could do this job really well  They I think take a step backwards and and full disclosure again. Remember I took a lot of money from facebook  Uh for the news integrity initiative. I'm independent of facebook and i'm using that independence right now  um, but uh, it's it's  Both are illuminating of the fact  Saying is I certainly don't want to nationalize google and facebook and amazon  But they do have a hell of a lot to learn about transparency back to your point stacy  And these are two examples where they're just not seeing an inch ahead of their nose  In terms of what the reaction is going to be either in the public or in the case of the spade thing among journalists  uh, and it  They're not  Connected enough with the world around them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if facebook actually cares about what journalists think and I don't think that's a terrible thing in all honesty  Um with this hiring, I don't I don't think they're like, yeah, let's find this person. She's good. She's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's ask her. I think I think that's the point of the hiring though. I'll disagree  I think that was the whole point of the hiring if journalists were not we're not on facebook's rear end all the time  I don't think they would have hired this at all  They're doing the facebook journalism project woman. Anya care does a brilliant job with that. They hired camel brown  She's working with fidji simo the head of product to tell uh media companies a lot more about what they're doing  Uh, they invested in nii. This is all I think very good stuff. So they do care about what journalists think is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is not  From my understanding and you're closer to this than I am but is she is internally facing not externally  So she is not dealing with journalists  She's dealing with how journalists see things on facebook internally and trying to explain to them things, correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going to happen at some point is people are going to say jeeve the next time facebook isn't transparent what it should be  They're going to come back to this and say well see it didn't do any good  Or what those two nasty articles said nasty in the headlines at least  Was facebook doesn't care about transparency. They're just doing this to say they care about transparency and I think that's too cynical. I think that's wrong  I think it's an insult to both of those and facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, then they would have hired someone who's really amazing  As opposed to a laughing stock for all journalists if they that's the point that they're trying to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I don't think this is a deliberate attempt to hire someone who wasn't amazing  I think it was it was that they they weren't out of their shell enough to talk to people to find out what the reaction would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, okay. I can see that so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're liz spade, I don't know if she's on the job yet  but if you're liz spade and you're on the job and you read cashmere hill's article at uh,  Facebook should be more transparent. How did it by the way that it was quite a stretch the  Person, uh that was recommended to cashmere hill  Uh was her I think great aunt by marriage but had no other connection  It wasn't like, you know, mostly when I get recommendations for facebook  It's three other people, you know, know this person or whatever nobody  There was no connection at all. Nobody  She knew followed her  Uh, she she wrote to the person person said yeah, I am related to you  Uh, it's a it's a it's a really kind of spooky thing and and I think is often the case  Uh, it was a it was a question  Humans have an amazing ability to detect coincidence and then  It's somehow built into us. I'm sure there's an evolutionary reason for it to ascribe  Agency to coincidences to say aha. Yes false causality that kind of thing  so  But I have to say having read cashmere's article and knowing cashmere and really thinking she's really good  It is a little puzzling. How did uh, how did  facebook know so  If this would be the very first thing liz spade might take on  What would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think you'd go reporting and try to and try to get to the experts inside and try to get  Yeah, how did we find say how could this happen? Yeah, uh, i've told the story on the show before of the of the journalist I talked to who  Got his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis because he was sharing  Symptoms he was feeling and somebody bought those symptoms and advertised to him, right?  There are explanations of how these things can happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh technology lends itself to that. It's it's often such a black box  Uh that we you know, we don't know and if we were shown how it happened it was you go  Oh, yeah, I guess so because you do you hear all the time people say hey  I was talking with a friend about uh umbrellas and all of a sudden I got an umbrella ad  That's a human brain. That's just the way the brain works  You know you think about buying a car all you see is that car on the road?  Yeah, exactly all all I can see were oh go ahead. No, you stay so you go. You go stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, mine was not mine was complaining you go because you're gonna be additive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys are too damn polite we we are just because we we're self-spoken

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're very self-spoken. This is kind of weird. Oh, no more no more. So it bothers you and people talk like that  It does I don't like it. There's a name for that the botter minehoff phenomena. No, I know biter botter minehoff  Is the biter minehoff gang?  the terrorist gang were they the ones who uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trying to remember what what terrible they kidnapped and killed a executive of some sort or government officials and so on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why is it called the botter minehoff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it was I think frau botter and hair minehoff. I can't remember the botter minehoff complex. This is so fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say with uh, facebook. Oh, oh, this is a film

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, wait a minute  All right, never mind i'm sorry go ahead you say something now because i've not her concern was that they were buying data from data brokers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which could make those correlations because  You can see simply and if that's  If that was how it was done and it isn't a coincidence  That's actually really creepy right? I would think I mean like they don't give facebook enough data. It's got to buy all the data about me  too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and well she called she called this woman who she found a great aunt by marriage  uh, and and the reason it was far far-fetched is because um  It her let's see  Her biological southern gothic never it's very southern gothic my biological grandfather's a man  I never met with the last name porter abandoned my father when he was a baby  My father was adopted by a man whose last name was hill the porter family grew up and lived in ohio  You know, she grew up in a florida. So she she'd known there were blood relatives out there, but there's no reason to think i'd ever meet them  Etc, etc, and and weirdly enough she recognized she's a porter. That's I think that's I remember that name  So she she couldn't figure out why she was showing up in her timeline. She called her  She said are you related to my biological grandfather? Yes  she said  Uh, she is my great aunt by marriage  She's married to my biological grandfather's brother met him 35 years ago the year after I was born facebook knew my family tree better  Than I did they had a nice conversation  I was grateful that faith facebook had given me the chance to talk to an unknown relation, but odd  and disconcerted  by its apparent  omniscience  so  I mean, it's hard to even imagine what data broker they might have bought this from then this it could just very well be  Well, I don't know. How do you explain it? So that's liz spade's job now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want that job  Yeah, cashmere is is awesome. I have to say and uh  You know she she does the work. She will not she'll not let this down. I think we'll find out more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think she doesn't treat the whole privacy stuff from an emotional level. She treats it from a from a journalistic level  Really makes it like what's going on? Yeah  Yeah, so so so so the what what ties these three things together because the platforms  Aren't as self-aware as they should be  In how people see them that leads to this kind of idiocy in the guardian of let's nationalize them  Yeah, and and and it goes too far and they've got to get smarter about this  And and they're going to be more and they have to be more open. That's the paradox of this  They do have to be more transparent  They do have to understand better how people react to what they do and recognize that openness and and and they're trying things  They're doing things but then they just lose some steps. Yeah, and I don't know what happened in the google situation  um, but there should be transparency there to figure out what happened and if google did try to muscle, uh,  Opinions against it to be shut up. They should talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five hours ago. Anne Marie slaughter put out a statement  in response to this saying  That I guess the quotes in twitter  She said the quotes were taken out of context and then they put a statement up on the new america page  that says they'd been working with this dude to spin out the open markets effort and  Yeah, it sounds like a cover-up to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds yeah, there were other quotes. She sounds like there are quotes where people said  She said are you kidding? You're gonna lose us our biggest sponsor. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's right a little I don't know six minutes ago. Kenneth Vogel who wrote a new york times story  Anne Marie tweeted this story is false new york times story will issue a statement proudly shortly. We're proud of the  Open markets work then kenneth vogel the new york times reporter said I asked to america to id any alleged errors in my story  Several hours ago. They've yet to do so. Yeah, please id the errors or correct this tweet  So we're going to get a he said she said across this  Uh the thing to do god if you've learned google new america  uh open markets  reveal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have to say even if this story is exactly factually true and I don't doubt that it is  It doesn't necessarily implicate google. It could simply be  That's what i'm saying the director of the think tank thinking  This happens all the time preemptively we have to bend over backwards for instance  Our show hosts know who our advertisers are they need to so that they can be proactive in disclaiming the relationship  But what I have to really?  Kind of over emphasize is that should not have a chilling effect on your coverage  So we don't ever say to our you know, our hosts. Oh, you can't say something bad  I I didn't say that to you stacey when you started to slam one of our sponsors  but  I can't promise that stacey hasn't had it in her head. Oh, I better not say anything bad about ring doorbells  Well, listen, let me hope you know that you can say bad things about ring doorbell stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we I mean we so in the newsroom in various newsrooms that i've been we have joked  About oh this story is gonna kill that sponsorship  Or and I mean and that is that is not an uncommon thing to say we still run the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you still do the story. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As you should be open myself and say that I had to think three times about about the facebook thing  because on the one hand  What happened in the end I was gonna post about it, but I waited so long it wasn't newsworthy anymore, so I didn't  but on the one hand  I probably would have said something about it as i'm saying right now  uh  This is the first chance to do so on this show  Uh, but if I don't do people wonder well jarvis is you know  He's chilling himself because he's not criticizing facebook when he otherwise would it's a situation where he's in and the only answer is transparency  uh to some level  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  So that's why I want it doesn't necessarily incriminate google or one way or the other no, we don't know we just don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could see a case where eric schmidt says  That's that story is stupid and wrong  And then someone preemptively goes and and and that means but that still means that and in fact, that's exactly what happened be aware of their  Right  If that's all that happened even so then you always have to do the caveat don't do it because i'm saying this  I'm just expressing an opinion which I can do. I think that story's full of crap  Uh, but but uh, you know, it should exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes  Hey, do you know google home is going to be built into vacuum cleaners appliances?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even more weirdly that cortana is going to be built into amazon echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know  That is that is just baffling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked a lot about it on windows weekly and the consensus now here's now i'd be curious what you think about this stacy  both, uh, both of our hosts mary joe foley  and paul therotte said well that's because  Amazon and microsoft are also rands in this that in fact, it's google  And apple that dominate the intelligent, you know voice  assistance  And that could be google and microsoft. It's the it's you know, it's like sprinting t-mobile uniting  It's the it's the also rands that are trying to compete with the big guys  I said, I don't feel like amazon echo is is it also ran. I feel like it's the leader in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a leader in market. It's an also ran in actual intelligence. It's like  It's like the dumb jock, right? It's everybody loves them. But you haven't talked to siri much lately. Have you?  Well, sir, okay, so I don't understand why siri is even a contender except for she talked about dumb. She's dumb dumb  Although apple home kids getting better. Um, we can talk about that on another show google. Google's very smart. I'll grant you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the smartest of the bunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And microsoft doesn't have a market. They they just don't have an inroad into the home because they don't have any devices

Transcript:  Somebody made that somebody has a video bless  I'm telling you youtube's got everything man  anyway  A great article by ben thompson on stratechery  We are endeavoring to get ben on one of our shows soon  To talk about it. He says dara very good choice  Um kosro shahi used to be the ceo of expedia  And when and he was before that the cfo so he comes from the finance side. He's not a techie necessarily  He's a finance guy  And ben says that bodes very well for uber, especially the challenges uber's facing  Uh, he calls him very successful very stable and very well compensated  Uh, he I think his uh, I think i'm trying to remember. I think they said something like 200 million dollar golden parachute or  Let's see. He makes 95 million dollars a year at expedia  And I do believe that he's gonna get a couple 100 million, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kara swisher said caro had this she had she had the uh tweets hearing, uh from the um  Heating back to the board room air docked board room. You're kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, that was they were hilarious. I mean, no, she wasn't it was a joke. Okay. Okay that part was a joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think she she had good information. I she I think she said one of them I could be wrong here that bary diller was  Negotiating on his behalf with the board

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He gave a presentation  To the board as I guess all the candidates did I didn't even know that uh, and  In the presentation there was a slide and everybody was quite impressed that says  Don't call me i'll call you to the board  Kara writes it was the best part of his presentation bid to become ceo of uber  What he meant was I don't want to hear from the board  I'll ask you if I want advice that probably is the best advice the board has been very  Very bad in this whole process. There apparently was a lot of infighting over either meg whitman  Or jeff imelt the ceo of uh of ge meg  Whitman wanted it badly apparently was lobbying for it  But uh cara boy, she had the scoop on this wasn't she she's she's I think she stopped covering yahu and moved to uber  Which is a good choice kara  She said that there was a mysterious third candidate  We were talking about this sunday because we we knew the board was meeting during twit and we were waiting to hear  Shortly after twit they announced kosra shahi  so his uh skill  moving  Really rebuilding expedia which was struggling when he took over  And changing their model from a wholesale model to an agency model  I didn't even know that they you know, I had to read all this and try to understand it before I  uh  You know could understand ben's article but ben said this is exactly the kind of guy you need because he  rebuilt  Expedia from the ground up. He didn't do the easy thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did the hard truth. That's true. He did expedia didn't need to be rebuilt and he did rebuild it. Yeah, that's really interesting  Uh, so this is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember yahu. I think actually getting a financial wizard into yahu. Remember yahu. Sorry that was kind of  I was gonna say  But this was their problem they hired a product person instead of a financial person and I think a lot of tech silicon valley companies tech  this was a good move for precisely the reasons ben outlies and because  At a certain point in time  You've created a product and now you've got to understand how you disrupted the market from a financial perspective  And doubled down on that  And that's where I think netflix is going to succeed or fail with its content play. Did it make the right bet?  um with its its content strategy, so I I just thought that was  Kind of there are parallels we see often in uber actually if they recognize this they made the right decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ben says it's clear that kosochahi has demonstrated the patience and resolved to fix problems  At their root and as this year has made clear uber's culture needs a fundamental reworking not simply a fresh coat of paint  Kosra shahi seems an ideal candidate to take on the problem at a fundamental level and has already shown at expedia  He's willing to walk the walk on issues of sexism  in particular  so, uh in the end the board which has been really  Problematic, uh did the right thing and hired probably it's I agree with ben the right person  For the job and we'll see of course what he does with uber. There's a lot of value in uber  There's no question about that  Um, he said so well the cfo left a few months ago  He said  He was worried  Ben when ben learned that uber for instance couldn't say at any any point in time how much it was paying drivers and bonuses  It didn't have a way to accurately calculate the amount of bonuses that uber paid to drivers  As I noted in a daily update at the time ben writes this is staggering  Uber cannot measure the single most important factor in its profitability  On something approaching a real-time basis. The implication of this lack of tracking is that uber may not have a clear picture as to  What its unit costs are  But and this is where I went to lisa and said what the hell's he talking?  Explain balance sheets to me. Can you so but he I think ben's saying there's a real that uber  Is real strength is is in its uh,  Is it's um, you can't not to focus on  Drivers, but let me see if I can find it because i'm going to misstate it  The uber's use of the bonus driver with drivers has the whiff of expedias using the merchant model, which is what kuzkosra  Shahi changed it makes sense in the short term, but it ignores the long-term value of having less  friction  For suppliers to come on board the part-time drivers that overwhelmingly favor lift

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is uh, he says what does this mean? What what what change does this portend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, well for one thing getting the financial reporting in order  Having the information that you of course, you're going to have to have the right strategy  But having information first if you don't have the information you can't create a proper strategy  but ben says that uh,  That there's a virtuous cycle  with uh with riders  Uber wins not by monopolizing drivers, but by monopolizing riders  In other words focus on the demand side not the supply side  Optimizing for demand would suggest giving drivers a bigger cut of each ride such that marginal drivers  Are encouraged to come back on the network and improve liquidity  his point is that  If the best customer experience is going to make more drivers will come to you because they're going to get more work  Because that's yeah, that does sound like that's concentrated on the drivers. No you concentrate on me. No, it's concentrated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's going instead of looking  You're looking where the money is and the money is in the hands of the consumer  So if you're a good driver, the drivers will follow the money drivers will follow the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's the demand the supply will follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that phrase? Where why do you rob banks? Because that's where the money is, right?  Why do you drive every time I take an uber or left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, every time I take an uber lift. I ask the drivers  It's something stacy can't do or I guess you can now can't you I can now we actually have really good conversations in austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About that because nobody rides  We got lift and uber back and nobody uses the other apps now. So really when you talk  Yeah, when you talk to those drivers, they're like  you know  Like what platforms do you get your rides from and they're like, oh uber and lift  I couldn't drive if I were doing right austin see so it's and ultimately if uber is going to beat lift

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to you want to get them to say the same thing ben writes in fact  What makes uber so valuable and still attractive despite all the recent troubles is its position with riders the more riders uber has the more  Drivers it will attract even if the economics are worse relative to other services  Driving at a worse rate is better than not driving at a better one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Given the choice I ride lift because of the reputation of uber  And drivers I talk to tend to prefer lift same reason  So culture at first it's not just the finances. It's culture that will only work though jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you can get a lift ride as fast as you get an uber ride  But if you start looking at that app and your lift ride is a half an hour off and there's a four minute away  Uber driver, you're going to take uber. I agree. That's how they win

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the reason that the drivers go are going to lift the reason the reason that that that  Riders are going to lift. I think was because of uber's horrendous reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but they'll only you'll only inconvenience yourself so much right that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The single best this is what ben writes the single biggest factor that differentiates multi-billion dollar companies is a scale  I had to really think about this a scalable advantage in customer acquisition costs uber has a media lesson  Yeah, it is a media lesson. Isn't it? It is it is everything. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's business today. It's everything it's called back to back to the previous point about about the voice platforms  If the cost of getting someone to remember to ask for cortana, right?  There's a there's going to be a marketing cost, right?  I'm trying to get people to do that and that's a subscriber acquisition cost, you know magazine when I was in the magazine business  I I always wow the students with this, you know  I go through the the economics of a magazine if you have a fancy cunniness magazine like traveler  In the day when it was thick it would cost five six bucks to print and distribute  Um, so six bucks times twelve is what?  72 to two right and then um, um  We would it would it would cost anywhere from round numbers  15 to 30 bucks in marketing as a subscriber acquisition cost so you're now out 100 bucks  What are you charged for the subscription dollar a copy?  Basic rate you're getting 12 bucks. So you're out 88 bucks. Yikes  Uh, but obviously the advertising was so rich  That's what that's the how the economics of american magazines worked for years no longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's you know, what's interesting is the podcast model is similar because every listener costs us money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Yes. I'm apparently doing a crappy job. Well, how do you who pays for your downloads?  I do I I i'm on libson

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so okay libson's unusual because they don't charge you for downloads  They charge you for storage or unless they've changed the model. No, they charge me to host it  So right, but they don't so if you had a million viewers or 10 viewers it would cost you the same  right  See that's breaking that model because the truth is  Libsons hiding it from you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but every download is what costs money as I say, I know how the internet works. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So libson because of their business model  hides that from you  But in fact also probably being subsidized by well subsidies always confuse things  so  but the real cost of a podcast is much like the magazine cost which is  Everybody who listens costs you money. So  All of the same issues kind of in a smaller scale but all the same issues for instance magazines tightly control circulation  You don't want to have suddenly five million readers. You'd break the bank  Because you'd have to print five million. Well, you want actually you want readers for multiple readers per copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't want somebody subscribers. Yeah, right  right  When I started ew they they begged and begged and begged and said can't this be bi-weekly  Can't this please be bi-weekly? I said no  Makes no sense. It doesn't work. Yeah, because the the physical cost of the pass along would be much  well and and  The amount of circ revenue you can get to be about the same, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exactly  Yeah, exactly. Anyway, but see libson kind of hides it. So I don't know  I guess you don't have to worry about it. So that's a good thing  So same thing happens with youtube by the way you google eats the cost of the downloads so you don't have to worry about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think libson also the the pay so what people who get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  600 downloads versus what I pay for my 25 000 downloads  are very  Like oh you do pay for downloads then. No, sorry. I don't what libson pays so  Yes, people who only get downloaded 600 times you're costing lips in a lot more money. Yeah  Right, but they're making it up on people with their other podcasts the vanity podcast because there's lots of shows that don't  Do any I mean they just they have a very small audience. I have a small audience, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so how much do you see advertising for uber and lift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much do I see advertising I don't see a lot that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you're because you just said the subscriber the writer acquisition cost customer instruction cost. Well, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  customer subscription cost  How do they get what you're asking is how do they get more writers? Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it includes things like thinking about uh, I was gonna say latency, but how long someone's waiting. It's app development costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's does uber advert. Well, yeah uber advertises

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do they send out emails to people like go take a ride. Here's ice cream stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What i'm saying is they're gonna hit a point  Where they're gonna have to start marketing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just customer acquisition costs he's arguing about the whole customer experience  So they spend a lot of development which is a marketing cost in essence

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So jim beam is giving away 10 000 uber rides in chicago for the world series  That's an interest to say I think uber wants to do kind of more or less traditional marketing, right? So  If you think about it, this is a great. I don't know how much they paid jim beam or maybe they just gave them free rides  But those 10 000 people may many of them may be taking their first uber ride  And that's a one way to get customers. Oh, this was pretty nice. It was a lot better than a cab  That's an acquisition cost. Yes. Yes, that's what I started. You know kind of marketing advertising they're doing it's just a little non-standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a four free issue offer which is very common and and uh, it's acquisition cost  Right, oh you're the newsstand right you have more copies you want lots of copies there so the the the the waste  Is acquisition cost, right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh  All right, we're boring leo dara

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, I did want to ask jeff's opinion about  This google home vogue thing because to me you're always talking about new ways of telling stories  This does not seem quite like total storytelling, but if you say why don't you describe it to our to our audience  So vogue signed a partnership with google and now you can ask your google home to talk to vogue  And then you can do things like ask what was the interviewee like or you know, what were they behind the scenes?  Yeah, and I I thought that was kind of an interesting way to add to  An existing story or article and but maybe it's just gimmicky. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I I don't know either  I'm sorry. I'm gonna go back to butterfly effect and custom porn  oh lord  because  because what really struck me is is this idea that  It's special that we're storytellers that makes us special you can only get stories from us  No  Everybody can make stories now everybody can buy stories. They want for themselves now every company can build stories now  so I don't know that that's the that that's what I expect from  a voice conversation  Um is that it's about it's too media-centric. It's in general. We always we're always media-centric  We always think you want to know more about us. We should want to know more about you  And that's the opportunity is to hear what people are asking and then to answer that so I don't know  I i'll wait and see i'll keep it in mind, but I don't know who pays for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The vogue behind the scenes content on the google home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That i'm not sure if I assume it's vogue who built something because you'd have to build like a what do they call it?  It's not a skill. It's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does does vogue pay google or does google?  Pay vote or do they give it away?  I'll bet it's neither once google home is working together. So I guess the way it works  In the first campaign of its kind readers will be able to ask the assistant on google home for more information on five articles  Interesting google home. It does it not work on the regular assistant  Once it's prompted with a question the writers behind the piece will share personal tidbits  From their celebrity sit downs including some funny anecdotes first up on our list  Did did jennifer lawrence finish that bottle of old granddad bourbon?

Transcript:  I wanted a beautiful movie star you wanted the fox news personality story and you wanted the tennis star  That's why we make a great team  All right, well having heard that that's not gonna be that useful I don't think that's much I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it adds anything to go home media-centric. I would guess you can't get enough of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would guess vogue paid them for that. That would be my guess after hearing it  Google has decided not to appeal the eu  shopping decision, but in fact  To try to find a way to comply

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this doesn't oh does this cut off an appeal?  I thought I thought they had a deadline. I thought they had a deadline no matter what the company had 60 days to propose

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How it would stop its illegal content and 90 days to make changes on how they display shopping results  The obligation is fully google's responsibility said the european union in an emailed station a statement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, I thought the um, I don't think that cuts off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think that's a requirement google has the option of challenging the fine and antitrust order to the eu courts  Which can take years to reach a final decision  Next week's intel ruling will come some eight years after the eu fine. This is the absurdity of this eight years  So the eu now is doing wrong by the way, was anybody remember what intel was doing wrong?  They were dumping intel said they had they were mystified as to what regulators wanted  The company to do to comply with an order to hand andy halt anti-competitive rebates for chip sales to computer makers  So eight years later, they've they got a 1.06 billion dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, they were really they were dumping all over and it was really sucking. I mean, yeah, they were like killing amd on that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  The eu now has a month to check if google's plan changes will fit the bill  Regulators are also expected to levy fines and separate investigations into google's android mobile phone software as well as  Or possibly soon as next month as well as the adsense advertising service margaret vestaglia. The eu antitrust chief is also  threatened further probes  If margaret vestaglia comes to you and says I have further probes I would like to do just run  On travel or map services  So I guess it doesn't preclude an appeal it's just their attempt to just can't we just get along

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if they didn't make any changes they could get fined up to five percent of gross

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh google spokeswoman said it's sharing that plan with regulators  Before the deadline expires but declined to comment further. This is the one with the 2.4 billion euro fine  Um, but there's you know, could you take years before that money's collected it took eight years to get intel  I would they not get I think they're still gonna get the fine no matter what right even if they comply  They have to fine and they need to comply. Yes fine and they comply unless they went on appeal, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All very exciting. I don't know what to think of this article on medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By alexander muse. Yeah, I couldn't figure it out either because it was it was so speculative  How the nsa identified satoshi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nakamoto the creator or creator. We've been here before haven't we? Yes many many times of bitcoin  Apparently  The department of homeland security knows who satoshi is they won't confirm that they know his identity  But despite these efforts according to my sources at the dhs  S  Satoshi nakamoto gave investigators the only tool they needed to find in his own words. They used something called steelometry  Where you compare texts to determine the authorship of a particular work, you know  I just heard a fascinating interview with the fbi profiler who helped find ted kaczynski the unibomber using the same technique  and he talks about it and it it's this was on the occasion of the one of the networks has released a  A mini series on this the unified fun has already or is coming up. It's coming up. I haven't seen it. I don't know  Through the years satoshi wrote thousands of posts and emails which are publicly available according to my source  The nsa was able to use the writer invariant method of steelometry or steelometry steelometry  To compare satoshi's known writings with trillions of writing samples  And blah blah blah  They put it in a 50 dimensional space. They flatten them into a plane  And now they got a fingerprint  Maybe it's made up. It might be as made up as the other article I read which I don't know what to think of which  Says that google was founded by the cia  In effect as a way to control  I don't know something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my god, I know alexander. I know this guy the guy who wrote the satoshi thing. Yeah  I was wondering I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he uh, is he reliable he's an entrepreneur writing about whatever interests me he says

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's definitely not following journalistic ethics. He's also a bit of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not quite like a troll provocateur, but he definitely is all right, so but this isn't really that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Provoking I mean provocative provocative. Um, i'll tell you something that is more provocative  And this guy is an investigative journalist nafis ahmed who wrote how the cia made google  Inside the secret network behind mass surveillance endless war and skynet  Okay, that's a way to get now. This is two years old. So it already is nationalized

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's already part of the government see no problem guardian

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is two years old and I apologize for bringing it up, but i've been getting a lot of people asking me about it  So it must have somehow  come up  I didn't see a lot of evidence  You know the convincing evidence. We know that the cia has a venture capital fund  And that they invested in facebook at least if not google  I don't know. It's a story. There's a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this guy actually did talk to somebody at the dhs perhaps but he's writing sorry i'm going through his feed he's writing about  Uh license plate monitoring which the eef actually it's a big deal in texas  So they talked about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it what does it have to do with satoshi nakamoto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he says after he wrote that story  While I was writing my post on how the nsa identified satoshi nakamoto my source at the dhs described how the nsa  Subscribes to these private sources of license plate data to determine where you've been and where you are going  So but we kind of knew that was happening already or at least people who follow I just feel surveillance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows everything about me. I don't care. I give up. I'm satoshi nakamoto. Okay  There I feel much better, okay, that would be perfect wouldn't that be funny  But anybody looking at me knows no, you don't have the brains to do that stacey. I'd believe a lot sooner than you no offense  Sonos is uh is apparently submitted to the fcc for approval  The thing you've all been waiting for stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's unclear I I don't want to have to buy a new microphone or a new speaker because because I have a lot of speakers  That's the big problem people who have  If I can talk to the echo then I can tell the echo and then it'll control my speakers at worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sell me a little plug-in device that will voice enable my existing sonos because i've spent as probably stacey has thousands of dollars  on sonos equipment over the years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what i'm hoping for if they make me buy a new speaker  That's a deal killer and i'm going to be very enraged enraged like jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what this fcc filing is for a product model s13 that adds integrated voice control  functionality, yes, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that doesn't mean they can't do it on their old stuff. This is just in putting the echo into this is the other shoe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the drops because a week ago, uh sonos saw asked for  New permissions. They said you must update your software and give us new  Privacy permissions or you won't be able to update in future and your sonos speaker will eventually stop working  upsetting some people  I don't know. I know I just want I want an echo enabled sonos. Is that so hard? Is that so very hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could make it with smart things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually plugged my dot into my sonos speaker via the  Aux jack and it kind of works. You have to everyone's a lot of feedback. Oh  We'll move it farther away

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, no mine was mine. I did that a while back when the dot came out and I was dissatisfied with how that worked  It doesn't also multi-room audio is not supported. It doesn't even support stereo speakers is one one dot per speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least it's a use  It is a use what else we can we can wrap this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a lot of good stuff good because I just got a I just got a google alert with a recipe for potato salad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now i'm hungry you like german style or picnic style americana. I I like both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love I will eat a potato no matter how it's dressed. That's basically it potatoes are good food  Potatoes are delicious. Are potatoes better than wheat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I think so too like oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah a lot of carbs, but you know, you get your vitamin a vitamin c in there a little b6  It's good for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good for you and I have bacon fat, which means my potatoes would be even better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did you watch the hyperloop video yeah, you want to watch it again, yeah, let's watch it mark wattney

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Potatoes, oh I get it. I for some reason john came over  When he started talking about potato salad and pointing his knee and I thought what's that all about and he says mark wattney from the martian  Potatoes remember he saved him somebody living on potatoes not salad just potatoes  Um part of the reason we're talking about this is I had and we won't be able to air it  Unfortunately until november a great conversation this morning on triangulation with  The author of the martian andy weir and oh, yeah, new novel can't air until his new novel comes out. Oh, November 4th 14th  But i've read it. It's good artemis. It's very good. And it was a great interview with someone and he was so fun and  Accommodating he released a big preview of it. I know I don't you know, I don't well, I don't do we have to hold it like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have to hold it we've been told by random house if you agree to hold it you gotta hold it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked him leo hates that leo's awful holding. I don't but that's why I don't do pre-release anything. I I don't  Which is why by the way, I still don't have an essential phone or a galaxy note 8  I'm watching all these youtubers show their reviews of the galaxy note 8  Talking about the essential phone. I haven't received mine  I haven't even received a shipping date even though I pre-ordered it and gave them money essential gave them almost a thousand bucks august 16th  nothing  Did you get fished?  No, I didn't part of the essential fishing scam. Yeah, I don't think that came from essential. I think somehow we still don't know  And essential says yeah, we're gonna we're working on this  See, I don't know if I agree with this verge headline in colossal screw up  Essential shared customers drivers licenses over email. I don't think that's what happened  I think what happened is somebody got some email addresses  And sent a phishing scam to people saying if you want your essential phone you need to send us id  So that we know it's you and people's responded but it was everybody was cc'd  I don't think it really came from essential  Now uh people on reddit say no, it's a misconfiguration  I don't know. I guess i'll have to read that article because  Essential says we're working on we're on it  I have not received an email from essential saying you need to prove that you bought that it's you  And I wouldn't respond. I wouldn't respond. I'd say no, I want my money back. I'm not emailing you my driver's license you nitwits  Yeah, and you got my credit card and took the money. What more do you need?  Everybody else will give me stuff even much more expensive stuff  To the address on my credit card since that's where the money came from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, leo if you want to give me your credit card just i'll send you all kinds of expensive stuff. You see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see what i'm saying?  You don't need my driver's license to rip me. Oh, never mind  Yeah, I don't so I i'm i'm unclear  Dieter bone though knows what he's talking about. Let's see. This is  From uh noon 12 30 eastern. No, this is from this morning  So i've been reading a lot of this stuff on reddit and  Reddit is notorious for getting stuff wrong. So  i'm not gonna  Uh a guy named schnell professor ron schnell  Who was the cto of rand paul's presidential campaign? There you go  Says it's not a phishing scam  It's a misconfiguration the dkid's checkout and the replies are actually going to essential  And then many other people have accumulated quite a collection of collection of dl's driver's licenses passports credit card statements phone numbers and email addresses  This is unbelievable. That's because it's a kind of everybody's cc. It's a reply all  So what appears to have happened according to deter who knows what he's talking about is the essential had a list of customers  It needed to verify to prevent fraud  I'm apparently not on that list so it sent them an email requesting more information  But that email address was set up as a group email  Though which meant replies sent to it went to everybody on the list  It was a misconfigured customer support address on zendesk  Uh overnight  Customers inboxes were filled up with emails  containing pictures of people and their their driver's licenses  I want my money back if this is this if essential essentials merely says, uh, we've taken steps to mitigate  We've where i've been looking into a recent email received by some customers  We've taken steps to mitigate and we'll update with more info soon so far  No other information. So maybe essential did screw up. That is pretty bad  They tweeted five days ago that they were starting to ship out phones. I don't know anybody who's got one  Except for people like marcus brownlee and you know famous people  Mm-hmm  I don't care anymore. I got my note 8 I get my iphone pro  I got my pixel xl2  No, I don't have any of those but i'm gonna  I don't really need an essential phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it is not essential. It's unessential inessential. I wonder if I get my money back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, it was it to reserve it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it paid it paid I bought it I they didn't ask for money to reserve but then they said  Congratulations, you know  Send us your money  That was two weeks ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you if it hasn't been delivered it's possible you could even if they don't give you your money back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could take it up with your credit card provider. I know the only reason that we even mention this is because it's andy rubin's company  He is the creator of android bought by google and worked at google and robotics before he left to create essential  And it's also relevant to you stacy because he's going to make a home automation device

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe  Yes, he talks about his whole idea  He did a great article with bloomberg or an interview with bloomberg where he talks about his idea here is to get us to stop  Looking at our phones  and so one of the key elements  Of that would have to be some sort of contextual awareness in from a home kind of device  So it makes a lot of sense. I can't wait to see it. So there is a new zuckerberg
