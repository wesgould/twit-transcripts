Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Stacey's back from CES.  We'll get a rundown.  She said it was actually pretty interesting.  She found some cool stuff, including some digital kettlebells at ten times the cost.  Jeff Jarvis is going to get very upset, I have a feeling, about an article in Wired  about a ten years later meme.  And we'll talk about a bunch of stuff from Google too, the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all coming up next.  We've got a big show for you on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

The show that talks about anything but Google pretty much.  Joining us, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, BudgeMachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wake up Jeff, wake up.  Before the show, you see, people think they missed things before the show?  No, no, no, no.  You missed incredible boredom.  Homophones versus what?  Heterographs.  Heterographs and Ror-o-pen-sils.  And Fig pens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We thought we gave it all out of the way.  It was all just too much.  Apparently Stacey tells us it was the old fart episode last week because she wasn't here  and we ended up talking about all of that on the show.  We got it out of the way this time ahead of time.  Stacey Hagenbotham is back.  How was CES Stacey from Stacey on IOT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was lovely.  I don't believe I just said that.  Wow.  It was like a tea party.  It was just lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Queen and I got together.  I think she's Mary Poppins of the tech world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually not a bad descriptor of me, I feel.  You kind of are.  Actually, actually, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it does kind of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I'm generally cheerful, but I am stern if I need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's practically perfect in every way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every way, yes.  Okay.  So CES was boring.  I did not have...  So I go and I'm a little different because I'm super nerdy.  I go looking in the chip booths and the weird...  I talk to people about product design, looking for better ways to use battery life  or maybe flexible electronics.  So I go looking for...  I don't go looking for televisions or laptops or anything like that.  And I do go looking for smart home stuff.  And I didn't find anything new.  I didn't find anything deeply game-changing or disruptive.  And that made me kind of sad.  I did see last year I got very excited about a MEMS sensor that Bosch had built  that allowed you to project something onto a...  Let's see, onto a counter and you could actually interact with it.  And I saw that in person.  They turned it into a projector product and it was super cool.  I think I tweeted out or we put it on our Instagram account of the...  It was dividing up cake slices for me.  And it would do things like if you stuck a piece of meat in front of it or food,  it would identify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you push the cake under its camera and then it projects the slice  where you should slice it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then you can run a little...  It has a slider on the bottom and you run the slider and it goes more slices.  You're so clever.  If you go to my Twitter account...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can...  What? You need AI slices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Calm yourself, my friend.  So what this does is this is just a new way to interact with something.  And what they're showing off is when you can project information down  and then also interact with it, it opens up a new user interface, just like voice.  So let's see, if you go to my Twitter account and...  I'm scaling through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was day two, I think, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you should be able, if you just go to my media...  Actually, looking at your Twitter account, it looked like there was a lot...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it is. That's cool.  Looks like there was a lot of cool stuff, actually.  This is nice. So why does this have to do with MEMS?  How expensive is that?  And how expensive is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the MEMS is the light that is projecting down.  It's a new way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MEMS is Micro-Electric Mechanical Machines.  They're very, very, very tiny.  They're not nano, but they're tiny mechanical machines.  There's MEMS in our June Ovens in the feet to weigh the...  MEMS are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always tell people that MEMS are a way to translate the analog world to digital.  So they're basically, you take a silicon wafer and then you put something  that's going to measure analog something.  Your accelerometer is a MEMS in your phone.  Yeah. And then it talks to the rest of your electronics.  So that's what a MEMS is.  But what they did is it's just a new type of projector that when you...  You can change the focal distance and it responds automatically.  And then it also can measure when something disturbs the light field.  And that is a cue to interact with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to be honest, I don't think this is really destined for the kitchen.  I could see this in a lot of industrial applications though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could. I could see it in the kitchen.  So the cake example is fun.  But think about something like if I put a steak on there or better yet,  like a fish and I said, hey, gee, how do I debone this fish?  And then it can print...  Not print. It can show instructions.  On to the fish, yeah.  Yeah. Or my screen that I'm using to work my recipe.  I don't want that to get dirty with my fingerprints.  So I can just tap the counter,  which sometimes is easier when I'm dealing with like a recipe than maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, how long does it take to get deprogrammed after a CES visit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People who come back from CES are often a little like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was excited about this last year.  So seeing it in real...  Like they turned it into an actual product.  That was a big deal.  This is one of the few things I'm super excited about.  For the most part, I was really disappointed in...  We didn't see a lot of awesome integrations in the smart home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been an annual disappointment for at least two decades.  Okay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did see a lot of Wi-Fi smart home devices.  So instead of ZigBee or Z-Wave,  so we're looking at going hubless and Amazon and Google are definitely in everything.  There are a lot more health products that...  I think of them as digital snake oil for the most part,  but some of them were actually really neat.  We were talking about this on Twitter,  but there were some devices that...  What was the bladder device that was happening?  There was this device that measured health...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Father Robert was wearing it during Twitter on Sunday.  And at one point we dosed him...  What's it called, Karsten?  The D-Free.  The D-Free.  It's a little ultrasonic patch you put on your belly  and then on your smartphone it tells you how full your bladder is.  Towards the end of the show we got tired of waiting,  so we gave him a couple of liters of water.  And man, it went to 10 and he ran...  I said, you got to go?  He said, yeah.  Ran out of here.  It works.  It's not...  I mean, we all know if we have to pee, but it's for people who don't.  There are many people who for a variety of reasons can't sense that.  And that can be really a source of social embarrassment  and discomfort.  So this is, I think, a really cool example.  That's an example of miniaturization of existing technologies.  And the smartphone.  Taking advantage of the fact we're all carrying supercomputers in our pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there were some diagnostic things.  And I feel like we need more peer-reviewed articles  like analyzing algorithms, right?  And they probably should come to market a little faster.  The research should proceed a little faster.  Because I saw a lot of things that are like,  hey, we can personalize this algorithm to help stop your headaches  or help you eat less or prevent jet lag.  And they all sounded really fascinating.  And it might be possible, but they also kind of sounded like,  again, digital snake oil.  So I saw a lot of that, but I would like to see,  I guess, a change in how we review that kind of stuff.  Well, it is a bit of a carnival, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the good reporters like you, who know what they're doing,  can contextualize what they're seeing,  throw out the trash of which the majority of the stuff is trash,  and find some interesting things.  It sounds like you did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried.  I didn't walk away with any super interesting things.  So I was a little...  I feel like that every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, you keep up on...  You're ahead of CES.  Right. That is true.  So you know what's happening before...  By the time it arrives at CES, you know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but sometimes I see things that I don't know about.  That's what I go for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  Everybody wants to go to CES and be surprised.  I think that's a very good point, Jeff.  You go to CES to expect to be surprised,  but if you've been following tech,  it's going to be the manifestation of stuff you've been reading about for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's a memory of a time...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, oh, and there was lots of 5G stuff that wasn't 5G stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of that, AT&T putting the E on the end of 5G  and saying on all of their phones that are really connected to LGE,  oh, you've got 5GE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did that.  As a veteran AT&T watcher, they did that actually with HSPA Plus and LTE.  So they called HSPA Plus, which is technically 3.5G,  and they called it 4G, not LTE.  So this does not surprise me.  The world does not come to an end.  It's just marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why I don't like it for two reasons.  One, there are a lot of people who think they have 5G phones  and say, well, this isn't that great, which is what happened with HSPA Plus.  And two, it's lying, which...  It's fraud.  It's fraud.  So it's fraud with a negative impact.  I guess, you know, welcome to the United States of America, boys and girls.  Yeah, well, you could complain to the FDA, except...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  FTC, FCC, they're all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, not FDA, sorry, yes, FTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could complain to all of them. Nobody will answer.  They're not there.  We had somebody in from the EPA on Tuesday yesterday who was on furlough,  and I said, I'm just really sorry.  He says, well, we're all right. I guess he has savings.  He's a reference librarian for the EPA.  And I said, I just feel...  And I would extend that to anybody who watches our shows who's on furlough  or worse, working and not getting paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I looked at the salary of a TSA agent is something like $17 an hour.  There's no way they can have savings.  That way, have a family and work to protect us.  It does. It really does.  And they're in there working. It's just criminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So say thank you when you're traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I think that's a really good idea.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I'm hearing is people are doing that, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for working and keeping us safe, even though...  In most cases, they get paid later, we should point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they may not be able to pay their mortgage or their...  You can't tell your landlord, I'll pay you when I get paid.  Insulin or, yeah, or their child care because they have to have two jobs  because they pay is so crappy.  There's no empathy here for them. No respect for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just tough. It's really tough.  Well, it sounds like you came away.  How many... Do you go to CES? Have you been going a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been to the last five years, but before that I avoided it  because I was, again, deeply nerdy tech and that's not where CES is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is deeply nerdy tech in the basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, there is in Eureka Park, although you have to...  What is it? Filtering through a lot of chaff?  It's a trek. Yeah.  So, oh, speaking of chaff, I spent a lot of time with a giant combine.  That was fun.  And talked to John Deere about their new AI camera stuff.  I love this. Whoa, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was fun.  That is a combine harvester.  So it's designed... What was it designed for? Corn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can actually... So it's designed just for harvesting.  You can use soybeans. Multi-tech.  Yeah, because you don't... Yeah, you just...  But they can actually now tweak the algorithm.  So you download the software or the algorithms for the crop that you are cutting  and it optimizes for that.  And what happens is they have a camera kind of on the facing the back  and they've got an AI that detects too much debris coming in.  And what it does is when it sees too much debris in your grains or soybeans,  it automatically starts changing the filters and the sieves and the shaking  and everything else to get it cleaner.  And beforehand, the farmer used to have to look behind them  and kind of just see what the grain was looking like.  And then they would manually adjust all that.  So it's actually really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, of all the coverage of CES, I enjoyed yours the most  because you did seek out and find stuff that...  It's not everybody else is talking about stuff.  So this is good. You did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No floating telev... Or not floating. Folding televisions or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but to me, that's not that exciting, especially since they showed it last year.  Yeah, well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how sore are your feet, Stacey? What are your Stacey tricks for doing CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I bring Epsom salts or I just actually this year I didn't go bring them.  I brought a little... You bring a little bit of peppermint oil  and then you put it in... You buy some Epsom salts when you get there  and at night you just soak your feet in the tub with Epsom salts and peppermint oil  and you feel amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything peppermint oil can't do?  I love peppermint oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can use it to stop ants. We discovered that when we had little bugs in our...  And it makes your house smell minty fresh.  Like Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you... All right. So there was a reportedly again, Jeff and I weren't there,  but reportedly a battle between the voice assistants, Amazon's Echo, Google's Assistant.  Can you declare a winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we talked about this too. So apologies if you heard me say this before,  but my opinion is the same. Google spent a lot.  They were the up and comer, so they needed to convince people they were awesome.  And you ride the Google ride.  Kevin did. I did not.  I actually did a podcast interview under the Google ride, which I cannot use because it was so loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, just for your edification, Google made a virtual reality version of the Assistant ride.  It's a small, small Google after all.  So Stacey, you said that there's a theme to it. You're trying to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes. You're trying to get a cake for grandma's birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So you're riding these little cars and there is that goofy...  Music. And it really does look like it's a small, it's a very Disney ride.  And this is where was this in the parking lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Google booth was in the parking lot right next to the BMW booth and the NXP booth.  So right out in front of LV, Las Vegas Convention Center.  And it was pretty sizable. And this was kind of on top of it.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what is this?  If it were not a Disneyland, Google would make it. Imagine Google today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Surveillance Disneyland.  Oh, geez.  We know what ride you want to go on next.  Disney is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disney has some excellent technology actually.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, FastPass is amazing. Is it FastPass or their little ID card things?  Carnival actually just put that on their cruises about a year and a half ago.  And that's, I don't know if anyone in the chat room is or anyone listening has taken a Carnival cruise,  but that is actually something I want to investigate further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just take a cruise. Don't worry about the technology.  Is that how you get your drinks?  We were on Anthem of the Seas a couple of years ago. They had a lot of this.  It was a brand new boat and they had a lot of this.  You download an app for the ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It tells you what you're doing and you use it to get into stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, this one has a wrist bracelet.  And when you walk by things, it personalizes screens for you.  It also lets you, you know, you can tap a button or something on it and it will call a server to you.  And that's how you can order drinks and that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to because there's five thousand people on that boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you don't wear the wristband, you're not nobody's going to talk to you.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes I'm thinking I'm turning into a Luddite, Jeff.  Yes. Yes. You have. Yes.  So one of the battles was the battle of the numbers because right before CES,  Amazon announced that they had 100 million Echo devices and then Google just kind of said, well, we got a billion.  And of course, because of all the Android phones, they're always going to be ahead in that regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Google experience is not great.  My pro tip for everyone trying to deal with Google and maybe it's just me.  I'm like I turned off the voice match voice recognition.  I've turned off all this. Yeah, you were really. Yeah, that was not working for you.  No, and it's still you were complaining about that. I saw that. Yeah, because I love I love it in the bathroom.  Love it. Oh, we should talk about bathroom tech.  Oh, yeah. So I was I was trying to call my husband while I was putting on my makeup for the show.  It's multitasking. And it was just like I cannot have access to your contacts until you validate your voice.  I'm like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. What I thought was maybe even a bigger story at CES was finally some of the barriers coming down.  Google Apps are coming to Bixby. Samsung made deals with Apple as well.  Apple's going to have iTunes and add Samsung TVs as well as Sony and other TVs.  So some of the Google Assistant will be coming to Samsung TVs.  Some of the you know, the walls are breaking down, which is interesting.  I'm not sure if that's coopetition at this point that it's still too small a market for anybody to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a lot of talk about money changing.  Somebody mentioned that Apple paid to get iTunes on certain TVs, which I thought was really interesting.  And then Samsung, it makes sense because Bixby is nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think both Samsung and Microsoft have kind of given up on their voice assistants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Cortana could have a place in the enterprise, especially if Microsoft figures out the kind of problems that Google's having right now with like basically it's an admin rights issue.  It's an admin and identification issue.  So if you could do that and it would be helpful.  There was a company actually right before CES, it's called Pindrop.  They got a lot of money funding and they're an older company.  They did voice identification in the financial industry and for like call centers.  But they're not pivoting, but they're opening a new market for voice.  And so for all of voice control, having reliable and good voice identification could be awesome.  So look for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to show you a little connected device that is a new sponsor on the show.  And that is this ring that you've probably seen me wearing for the last few months.  It's called an Aura ring or as a brand new sponsor on the network.  We had him on the new screensavers.  Preet came by to show us what they were up to.  I first found out about Aura from Kevin Rose who is an advisor to Aura.  He arranged for Preet to send me one of these rings and I've been wearing it, I think it must be six months now.  The Aura ring is the most accurate sleep and activity tracker because it's on your finger.  It can sense my heart rate of course.  It tells me heart rate variability, which is a very interesting statistic.  You want your heart rate variability.  That's the amount of time in between beats to be high, not low.  So when you're doing well, it will give you an actual number saying, hey, you're 89 today, go get them.  Or you're 62 today based on heart rate variability, sleep, all activity, all the things that happened yesterday.  Take it a little bit easy.  It is really fantastic.  It gives you insight into what's going on with your sleep, with your motion.  It's got an infrared optical pulse measurement system with a 3D accelerometer, gyroscope and body temperature sensor all in this little ring.  You get insights.  This is so cool.  And the thing is I don't want to wear a watch to bed.  It's just a nice looking ring.  They have a variety of, they have titanium.  It's made of titanium.  It has a diamond hard carbon coating.  So I wear this everywhere, hot tub, bathtub, shower, swimming.  I don't ever have to take it off.  How does it charge?  It has a little charger, but you only have to charge it once a week.  What I do is when I take a shower, I'll pop it on for a few minutes.  I've never had an issue with charging at all.  So it's got a little thing.  I'll show you.  It has a little base that you put it on.  The base looks like this.  And that's plugged into USB.  And then the ring goes on that.  And it connects and syncs using Bluetooth LE.  And by the way, I want to point this out.  There's a Finnish company.  They are GDPR compliant.  Read their privacy policy.  They understand that health data is very personal.  And they are really good about protecting your personal data.  So read the privacy policy.  I think it'd be gratified.  Part of that is because they're in Finland, they have to, right?  Let's see.  This is the one I have.  This is, oh, that's nice.  It's titanium.  It's got the sensors on the inside.  Let me show you, Karsten.  Let me show everybody where the sensors are.  They're right in here.  You might say, oh, well, that looks...  Looks like ball-buried.  Yeah.  And it doesn't...  It's very comfortable.  And it can store data for up to six weeks.  So once every six weeks, you pair to the phone.  It's actually so quick and easy.  There's the phone interface that you...  I pair it every day because I want to know how my sleep was last night.  It is never 92.  I wish it were.  But it's very helpful because it gives me insights.  For instance, it says, you know, on days you exercise, you get an average of 30 minutes more deep sleep, things like that, which is very interesting.  The Aura app is free for iOS and Android.  It comes...  It's updated regularly, as is the Ring.  It gets firmware updates.  And by the way, it works...  If you have an iPhone, it works with Apple's Health app.  So it will import workouts from Health.  So that's very nice, although you can also indicate workouts, you know, in the app.  The daily feedback really helps you better understand everything that's going on with your body, your health, your sleep, and to reach your goals.  Now, Aura is O-U-R-A.  O-U-R-A.  The number of the insights is very deep on the app.  Track your sleep in a way that nothing else can do because, you know, it's on your body.  It's got the temperature.  It's got the heart rate.  It's got motion.  Make the most of your day.  Auraring.com.  They'll send you a free sizer so you can pick the size that fits you the best.  Now, I have the bad...  This is all good news.  The bad news is, since they were on Twitter a couple of months ago, they're crazy sold out.  They're cranking them out as fast as they can.  You'll need to order now if you want to get your ring by April.  Okay?  We are, though, because of that, going to give you $50 off at checkout if you use the offer code TWIT.  $2.99 for silver, a black $3.99 for stealth.  Lisa wants the diamond.  What? There's a diamond?  That's just how much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the most expensive, of course.  It's a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  She's holding out for the diamond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, looking at the picture, I think you're right.  The shiny black now takes my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the silver one, too.  Let me show you this shiny, chrome-ish silver one.  They're very pretty.  And by the way, like I said, I've been wearing it for six months.  Get it wet.  I never take it off.  It wears beautifully.  It's titanium.  It's very light.  It weighs nothing.  So you won't mind wearing it.  And I tell you what, the insights you get, you've never seen anything like this.  I wear an Apple Watch.  I have a variety of sleep trackers and other devices.  You'll never see anything like this.  This is the best because it's right on your body.  I haven't had a gadget envy for quite a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This one...  I'm glad you like it.  This is good.  Let me check.  I think we'll get one sent out to you and Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That way you can try it.  I wasn't fishing, but...  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'd like to send you one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  O-U-R-A, aura, ring.com.  The offer code TWIT will get you $50 off.  But a reminder, you're ordering now for delivery in April.  It took me a few months to get mine too.  And it was worth it though.  And these last...  I was really impressed because I beat the heck out of this thing.  I mean, I never take it off.  So it's getting banged around.  It's, I mean, hot tub, shower, bath.  You don't have to.  Swimming.  Regular hand washing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I wash my hands like incessantly.  I am teasing.  No, it's true.  I get so...  I don't want to hear about the hot tub.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works in the hot tub too.  Wow.  Google shifted $23 billion to a tax haven in Bermuda in 2017.  So this offshore...  I mean, it's not illegal, but remember that they were trying to get the money repatriated.  The new tax act last year was supposedly going to bring a lot of this money back.  Guess not.  This is another one of those Dutch sandwiches.  Sent it from a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in 2017.  It reduces, of course, its foreign tax bill.  Google says we pay all of the taxes due and comply with the tax laws in every country we operate in around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As a Google shareholder, they are following their fiduciary responsibility to me.  Yes.  To minimize tax, maximize profit.  Okay, here's the point.  If you don't like it, you shouldn't change the laws.  You've got to change the law.  You've got to write to Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the point is, to me, you're free riding on a society.  I mean, the roads, the infrastructure.  Google is tremendously profitable, as is Apple and Facebook.  You also need to do your share, not merely inventing new products, but do your share in your tax burden.  I do. We do. We don't have the resources to have a Dutch sandwich.  But you don't want them, here's the problem with this argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do not want a company deciding how much taxes you pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. The government needs to be changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The government needs to do it. So I agree there should be taxed more, but that is the government's job.  I had a Guardian debate with a UK MP about this where she's complaining about it, and I said, Madam, it's your job.  Yeah, yeah, change the rules.  It's either legislation or also diplomacy.  If you don't like what the double Dutch sandwich is, go complain to the Dutch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. And the US, because they're a US company.  So I knew you'd like this one, and I'm curious what you think about it.  We talked about it yesterday.  Google is working with WordPress, one of our sponsors, wordpress.com, to do a new news publishing platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is pretty cool. NewsPak, which has backing from Google and others.  I forget who else is in on this, but Google gave some money to it to create.  The funny thing about the news industry and CMS is I don't think I told the story on the show before, but when I was at the Chicago Tribune, I went to date myself terribly.  Stacey, I don't know what to know how far away from birth you were in the early 70s.  And every newspaper thought they were special and they had to have their own CMS and their own functionality.  And the CMS we had at the Chicago Tribune was so terrible, they assigned their Pulitzer Prize winning task force of investigative journalists to investigate their CMS.  And that's been that's been the history in our industry from the beginning.  We think we're special. All we do is make paragraphs.  They're paragraphs. You can make them.  So now WordPress, which is what? Like 30% of the entire web, every page on the web?  33% according to their last ad.  They're creating something that is targeted toward news.  And I argued years ago that Google should have done this. They should have brought all their tools.  This is when they bought Blogger and all those things they could have done years ago, but they were gun shy about this.  So instead they're supporting WordPress.  WordPress is a great company and they're going to bring a product that's going to work for news sites.  And there is a charge. I think it's like a thousand dollars a month.  It's not much, but it's not free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but what they're also doing is they're inviting people to participate kind of in a scholarship process.  So the other groups are the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, the Knight Foundation.  You should have remembered that, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I should have. The Tao Knight Center.  It's not well, it's John S. and James L. Knight. That's the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same Knight.  And Civil Media, each giving one million, Google giving 1.2 million.  And so News Pack is basically a version of WordPress tailored to low cost publishing, the needs of small newsrooms.  Is that accurate?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because you have for big newsrooms now, the Washington Post's CMS is taking off.  Advance is using it.  The Global Mail is using it.  That's the big end.  I've not used that. I don't know. But people love it.  And it has a lot of the smarts and ability that Bezos has brought to the Post.  So that's happening. The big end, the little guys need help.  And so this is great. I'm delighted that all the parties are doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's newspack.blog. You can apply if you'd like.  There's an application form due February 1st for basically a scholarship.  The effort will be funded by automatic through the development period.  After that, operating fees of $1,000 a month to $2,000 a month will be applied to participating sites.  So you get to go through January 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Stacey, would you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I have a WordPress blog. I'm not producing news.  It's more for a newsroom, I would guess.  I've already streamlined my process because I used to hate every reporter who deals with internet stuff now.  You write your paragraphs, as Jeff so cutely calls it.  You have your headline. You're also responsible for getting your art, which used to not be the case.  You have to write the caption under your art.  Then you have to write your tags, any optimization, SEO optimization that you're supposed to be doing.  Then there's usually some other form of optimization that is special to your particular site or newsroom.  To get up a news article, to fill in all those things, even if you're really amazeballs at writing quickly, like an earnings story or something, it was a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At GigaOM, you used WordPress, didn't you? What was GigaOM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GigaOM was WordPress. Fortune was WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Major newspapers have used WordPress and movable type. In advance, we were on movable type at the end.  It's a pain. Now when I post anything, I post it on my WordPress blog, but I also post it on Medium. I also post it on LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should explain CMS, somebody in the chat was saying, what's that? It's a content management system.  Content management system.  Blogging platforms are essentially content management systems. You type in a web window and press publish, and it will go to your blog.  Of course, if you're a newsroom or you have a lot of reporters, that gets more complicated.  You have, as Stacey said, lots of things to fill in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We would write ours at Fortune because at GigaOM, our copy flow is pretty much like you post it on Slack and you're like, help me edit, please.  That's a good flow. I like it.  We use Trello, actually, as our copy flow, which was really weird, but effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to say that you just mentioned three Twitter sponsors.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Which is great. No, no, it's great. Trello is Atlassian now. They bought Trello. Slack is a sponsor.  WordPress.com is a sponsor. I think there was one more in there, but it just shows you that these tools are really the great tools to use for all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they the favorite tools of a dying industry? I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to add that to all the ads. The favorite tools of a dying industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking about your sponsors, Leo. I don't want to go off here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have good sponsors, don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do. I was thinking about your position in being the early step in for direct response.  Got a lot of startups like Aura.  A lot of those. Mattresses, razors, all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Aura were the first advertising they've done. Helm, which is the mail server that's going to be coming on, will be the first advertising they've done.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're early on this. I was watching TV and there was one I hope is not a sponsor. I'm about to make fun of them a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, let me just say that is part of our ethos also.  If I do make fun of them.  Is that there's editorial and there's sponsorship. We pick sponsors we love, but we never let a sponsor influence our content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been here when you criticize products and things.  So there was there was a new effort that would send you furnace filters.  This is such a horrible pain in the butt.  Once every two years you go to Home Depot and you buy a few furnace filters.  There's people in the commercial saying it's wonderful.  That is not one of our sponsors.  It's just great as opposed to testimonials.  And I'm thinking, man, everything on earth, everything is going to be sent to you and then some monthly subscription.  Well, that's actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And half of our sponsors, we just got a butcher box which sends you meat by mail.  Half of our sponsors are about that, about making it so that you don't have to go out and acquire things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And you're the testing field for this.  There's also you want you. We ought to get to get you after Alexis Ohanian because he's an investor.  And what's the one that sends out the little blue pills to men?  Oh, get Roman Roman.  That's one of our sponsors as well.  Okay. Right. So Roman is solving ED and and and baldness and something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I debated whether we should do Roman because it's kind of an adult topic.  But I think this is actually a really good thing.  We have problems, too. We men.  It's a really good thing. I don't I have no problem doing there's ads because it because if we want to talk about erectile dysfunction,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why would we not show off ads for maybe menstrual cups or something like that?  Obviously, tweet is not a place for that.  A lot of companies have a problem with showing a real depiction of.  And look at what happened actually with sex tech at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we talked about that last week. Yes.  So we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about how the vibrator got their prize got revoked and it was their contention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's plenty of sexuality at CES as long as it's for men.  It's OK. But as soon as it's female sexuality.  Oh, no, we can't do that.  It has to be about health.  I agree. And the truth is, we're not going to get those ads more because we have a predominantly male audience.  Oh, I know. Do you know that?  I'm not sure. I want to know why you know that.  But OK, but I would I would not object to that.  You know, we don't do is E-cigs. We've been approached a few quite a few times by E-cigarette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm shocked that Sirius is advertising Juul. I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's awful. I actually don't think it's awful, but I think it's awful to advertise to kids.  That's the problem. You don't know who's listening. My daughter, my daughter.  We had this conversation because my daughter smoked cigarettes.  Oh, which I know it's so sad because when she was young, she hated cigarette smoking so much.  We actually had to fire a babysitter because she saw her walking down the street, not because she smoked while she was babysitting, but she saw her smoking once.  And she said, well, she can't ever come back.  And then she was studied in high school in France for a year. Yeah.  And that was it. It was all over. And she hates it.  She hates it. She wants to get off of it. And she's going to.  But in the interim, I said, well, please, Juul, that's better.  But you know what? You reduce the damage. It's better.  But the problem is there's such a resounding condemnation of Juul because it starts people smoking in high school.  That's the issue. That she said, oh, well, I don't trust Juul. It's not as safe as cigarettes. It's safer than cigarettes.  Everybody says the CDC, everybody says don't start smoking.  But if you already smoke cigarettes, it would be better to vape.  Yes. And I had a really convincing of that. It was very hard.  So I want to be clear that Juul isn't a bad thing if you're a cigarette smoker trying to cut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And I've been there.  But anyway, anyway, I find it fascinating that we thought that the Internet was going to be about direct response.  You know, buy it now. And you had all these publishers trying to convince advertisers, no, it's really about branding and how they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then everybody wants brand advertising because it's higher spoke value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happened is that all of these companies now on TV are direct response.  They start off with you and then away luggage is advertising every 30 seconds on TV, which was a guest of mine on our podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That does drive me crazy because away was it we helped away become big enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And unfortunately, there's this mentality that you start on podcasts, but once you're big enough, you get off a podcast, which, by the way, work better than any television ad.  And you spend all your money on TV. Wildly expensive on TV. Wildly expensive.  You know, it happened with Squarespace, who we took from zero to 60.  I mean, they when they started advertising with us, we would they they were on every they probably still aren't every podcast in the world.  But we were the first and we really I mean, we we we we really did well for them.  And as soon as they made enough money, they started buying Super Bowl ads.  And it's like, dudes, dude, one Super Bowl ad, five years of twit, which is going to produce more results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But you can't convince them because it's an audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it's true. But it's but honestly, what do you what do you make websites?  What are you in business to do? Sign up people or get a better audience?  It's really about this notion of scale, this notion that you have to be big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was with a whole bunch of publishers today and folks around digital and this idea that you have to get everything to mass and everything to scale.  No, you can do 20, you know, 10 times 100000.  Is that a million? Yes. OK, thank you.  So, you know, you could do 10 things in 100000 or you can do one in a million.  The result is the same. You could if you know what you're doing, you can be more focused at the 10, 100000.  You can be more efficient. You can do a lot of things.  You can know your data better. But there's this this this this prejudice to get to mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, I don't know why everybody just doesn't buy Facebook and Google and go home.  Don't tell Lisa I said that. Yeah, I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But those have to be the most efficient ad buys in the world.  We looked at those political ads on the Stacey when you were gone last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We looked at the the Facebook tool for the political ad archive.  And it's every buy is one hundred dollars to a thousand dollars.  And they're buying 20, 20 B's, but they're tiny buys with huge efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, we we actually use Facebook advertising to promote the IOT podcast occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do we. It's super. Yeah, we do. We do Twitter ads, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, thanks for thanks for promoting my show, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just for you. We buy only buy out Stacey on IOT. Excellent.  But but there is another reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I would just before we end this conversation so I can go home tonight and not be sleeping on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason you buy Twitter, for instance, is because it's somebody you trust talking about a product  that's a very different kind of ad than a Facebook or Google ad.  And I would submit it's very important. It's like word of mouth.  And that is much more effective. It may not be more efficient in the sense that you reach the target audience more efficiently.  But I think they're much more effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I do. The truth is you you give both direct response and branding at once because of that trust.  Absolutely. I do point out Leo rub off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of our advertisers, though, have not turned out so well.  And I'm going to mention two. I'm sad to say Bosch's curry robot never happened.  Yeah. Yeah. But they were funded every penny.  So I don't feel too bad about that. That's too bad.  Yeah. And then we talked on Sunday, but we can mention it here again about Ring.  And I still have my Ring doorbell. I love Ring and I was very happy to advertise them.  I thought Jamie Siminoff was a great guy. He's the founder of Ring.  But they've recently come under some severe scrutiny.  The original story came from the information.  So I'm going to give I don't want to give Sam Biddle the time of day, but I'll give the information credit for.  They're the ones who really discovered it, Sam, as usual, just rewriting their stuff.  But I think what do you think of that? We talked, Stacey, already about it.  But I'm going to give Jeff a chance to talk about what.  So the point was that Ring Jamie in 2016 opened a Ukraine office.  And when they went out there to visit, according to the information's story, the Ukrainians,  one of the initiatives was we need to improve our recognition, our face recognition, our object recognition.  The Ukrainians said, OK, but you've got to give us access to the data so that we can build in some of this machine learning.  And unfortunately, they did.  Jamie left and by the way, Ring has denied that Jamie was the one who said it.  The story said that.  And then as he walked out the door, they were given access to that Amazon S3 bucket with all the videos on the spot.  Mr. Simanov agreed to arrange the team to get administrative access to Ring's web based interface where customer videos could be streamed.  According to multiple people, either present or briefed about the meeting.  That resulted in a real issue because those videos were now available to be shared, to be viewed without customer permission by these Ukrainian employees.  And of course, now some of the story and somebody in the comments said if this had been a British company, would you have had the same problems?  Because of its Ukraine, there's some concern about the security.  The security vulnerability is one of several problems with Ring's Ukraine office.  The engineers hired for the team often had little experience hindering the development of AI powered doorbells.  They got the database of all the video history.  Now, a year later, Ring was acquired by Amazon.  And as I don't know, as best we can tell, maybe, Stacey, you're covering the story too.  Amazon has stopped this practice. I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and I would also caution. So I know, Jeff, you're about to talk. I'm sorry.  No, I asked you, Stacey.  I want to hear more information. Yes.  So Amazon has changed that. I think this might be an issue of, hey, you ask and you get.  It's like a startup. We don't have processes in place for this.  So I don't think it was necessarily nefarious. I do think it's probably careless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I have respect for Jamie. I think Jamie is really smart.  He was a great founder. And I don't think that he did this in any way maliciously or with any goal of kind of breaking security.  They just weren't thinking. They had no process.  A spokesperson for Ring told the information customer videos are encrypted today,  but didn't respond to questions about Ring when Ring began encrypting the video.  So these were unencrypted videos, shareable videos out of an S3 bucket.  Now, for me, it's not a big deal. It was a doorbell. I don't care if anybody looks at my front door,  but there are indoor cameras. Ring makes those stick up cams which you could put inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So. Yeah, I think you've already said it. I think it was careless.  I think that especially when you're a small company, you can't maybe you can't afford to have that executive who's in charge of policing these things, but you need that person.  That's a good point. But it's true at the higher level, too.  You know, when I wrote my post about about Facebook two weeks ago, you know, I've long said they needed a journalist and then I made fun of journalists.  So maybe it's not a journalist, but they need someone at a high level in that company who has the authority to make change, who can make them and keep them honest.  And these companies all need that. I don't think their motive is bad at the get go.  But carelessness leads people into presumptions of panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say I think tech has gotten a pass on this because they've been too nerdy for so long. Right.  If you think about like your typical tech thing, you know, the idea of moving fast and breaking things is one aspect of it.  But another aspect is just like tech. Historically was tech. Right.  It wasn't for everyone else. But that has not been true for like the last two decades.  But we still have that mindset, though. You're right.  But we still have this mindset of it's OK. And I think like if I'm starting a company outside of the tech world, like let's say I'm starting just an escrow company or, you know, a medical billing company.  These are actually things that people start all the time.  There are a long list of regulations and things that you would never think to ignore.  You would actually design your company around, you know, protection of data, meeting these regulations in tech has been given a pass.  And I think it's probably time to stop because the type of data they're getting a hold of and using is I don't know if they're quote unquote innovations really make up for the fact that they have access to so much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the pass is over. I think Stacey, I think the pass is well over, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This year or 2018 for sure.  Yeah.  Everything changed. Well, it started 2018, 2019 maybe. And, you know, books like that Surveillance Capitalism book.  I think that I think in the you know, what was the what was the book before that? Saul. We interviewed him.  But the Gang of Four, this stuff is going to change is changing. This really stuff is people are starting to really look hard on this.  I think they should. They need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they should. I mean, I know, Jeff, that you will talk about techno panic.  I don't think it's panic to say there are some there is a lot of information about individuals that is now collectively available for massive data mining in a way that we've never had before.  And then also say that the implications of that data getting into the wrong hands are being used in ways that we haven't even discovered yet are going to cause a lot of harm to people.  There's the possibility of them causing good, but it's unclear yet if we're the good will outweigh the harms that we're not even talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zuboff's great on that. She says, I think we're talking about it every day.  Well, we do on this show for sure. I think that's what this show has become about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's well in the agenda of the public conversation. So there's nothing wrong with that. That's what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's not. But I'm saying, yeah, it's not.  And Zuboff is very clear to say she's not castigating technology at all.  I love technology. I think it can do amazing things.  Don't conflate that. But what she says, and this is the thing, and I'm still thinking about whether this, she said, you know, at first the trade off was you give them information, you get targeted ads.  We all knew that we can kind of live with that. But then it was starting to predict behavior.  And she said her concern is a future where it is used to influence behavior and that, you know, what we're what we're moving into is this kind of basically surrendering sovereignty to this entity, the big other.  She could not big brother, big other, she calls it. And I think that that's not unfair.  I think that that's that's very much a possibility and certainly something we don't want and something we should pay attention to.  It doesn't mean it's going to happen, but it's something we need to pay attention to.  Here's an example. And I bet you you have different takes on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to use this as my number. I was going to use this one. I was going to put it up here. Oh, yeah, I got something to say about this one.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That woman's thinking is exactly how I think about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to read Surveillance Capitalism, Stacey.  It's a great book, 625 pages, but read it and then we'll debate it.  You haven't read it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we talk about that story? Can we talk about that story?  Let's do the 10 year meme. So this is the Facebook 10 year challenge.  This is complete and utter bull. It is moral panic. Great example.  Oh, yeah. Great example.  If you use social.  Moral panic or techno panic?  I'm going to give you some pack, some moral panic.  I'll give you some facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me give you the story first. Kate O'Neill writing in Wired.  If you use social media, you've probably noticed a trend across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter of people posting their then and now profile pictures, mostly from 10 years ago.  And this year, she said, I put out a flippant tweet.  Me 10 years ago probably would have played along with the profile picture aging meme going around.  And me now ponders how all this data could be mined to train facial recognition algorithms on age progression and age recognition.  I agree with her. That's exactly what this is all about.  You disagree, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, let me. So I went through this today.  So so number one, this is absurd because two years ago, Google showed that they can they can they can compare the same person in photos from infancy to current.  There's there's it's been done.  Number two, this would be a really crappy data set.  Facebook also has data of people who are identified from ages to ages.  This is pure paranoia.  So so I went in and I had a conversation with her and her editor, Nick Thompson, on on Twitter.  And and I said those things and I said, this is this is kind of ridiculous.  Nick came back and said, oh, so then then the response was, well,  Facebook is doing this for money.  Well, Facebook, by the way, says we didn't come up with this.  They didn't do this. Right.  Yeah. And so it's it's it's yeah.  This is moral panic is an example of the kind of paranoia that is now bred.  A simple little thing comes up. People have pictures from 10 years.  This is cute. This is fine. Right.  Few years ago, we all would have joined in and said fine.  So now there is this presumption of some horrible motive and some horrible conspiracy.  It's a conspiracy theorizing.  It is moral panic that's trying to blame everything and find a noxious motive for everything that anyone sees on technology.  And this is the danger, my friends.  The danger is this kind of crap, this kind of fake news will lead to regulation of the Internet for us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow. You could not be more wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a fit. I had a fit.  Well, Stacey, the story is just wrong.  The story is just wrong on every count.  OK, her her thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her thinking on this topic is what I am identifying with, not the entire story.  But I would say this is actually a positive.  This is where we want to get people when they are about to use technology to ask themselves, is it worth the exchange of data that I'm about?  What is going to come of this?  I think that is actually so smart.  Tell me the harm.  Tell me the harm.  Hold on.  It is like teaching people about interest rates, which have a purpose, but also can cause people harm.  I'm not saying usury.  I'm just saying interest rates and associated with credit cards.  Right. Now, the other part of this is she's not saying it's evil or there's harm.  She's just wondering if it's going to be used for image progression.  And Google has shown that they can do this.  Facebook might need that data.  Another company that puts these out might need that data.  And this sort of data has been collected in the past through fun, cutesy apps and used for exactly that purpose.  So it has a basis, in fact, to wonder about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so her boss, who I like a lot, Nick Thompson, I'm trying to find the tweet right now.  This is what I object.  This is what got me going.  OK, what?  Yeah, because you are really upset.  I'm very I was very upset about this because it because it is dangerous.  And I want to I want to read his tweet.  And again, I have immense respect for Nick.  He's an excellent editor.  Wired under him.  Wired has been just great.  And he came back and we had there was an exchange and he came back and said what I said was fair.  Now I'm trying to find it because I'm between like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, this is relatively benign, but I don't think it's a bad thing to alert people to the fact that this kind of data is something these companies want.  And you should be aware that you may be giving them this kind of information.  Might might might.  People are not aware.  I just want to give you one more data point, which is a study that just came out from the Pew Research Center.  Three quarters of Facebook users, 74 percent in their survey did not know the social networking behemoth, according to TechCrunch, maintains a list of their interests and traits to target with them with ads.  Seventy four percent of the Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they know that the New York Times does that?  Why does that?  And time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if they don't think Facebook does it, they certainly don't think anybody else does it.  And they only discovered this when researchers directed them to view their Facebook ad preferences page.  A majority, 51 percent, said they were uncomfortable with Facebook compiling the information.  Twenty seven percent said the ad preference listing Facebook had generated was inaccurate.  Eighty eight percent of polled users had some material generated for them on the ad preferences page.  So the big number, the takeaway is three quarters of the Facebook user survey.  And I think it's probably accurate.  Pew is very good on these.  Three quarters didn't even know that Facebook targets them with ads based on what they give Facebook.  The information.  We go back to the I found the tweet.  So this is so again in a whole lot of saying in regard to this, it's a I think a value to say, hey, you know, this 10 year progression thing.  Here's the kind of thing companies might want to do.  So Nick Thompson, again, wire editor, respect immensely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's great.  His tweet said this.  Let's say you wanted to train a facial recognition algorithm on aging.  What would you do?  Maybe start a meme like 10 year challenge.  Period.  That is fake news.  That is misleading.  That is lying.  So I come back and I say utterly unnecessary.  Google Photos two years ago demonstrated that it already attracts people back to infancy by their images.  Facebook has a better repository of people tagged over time.  There need not be a nefarious motive to everything social you see.  Somebody else came in and said, well, it's not really the article says.  And I came back and I said, yeah, but his tweet said this and I wanted a contrary tweet.  Nick came back and said fair.  And Facebook has now responded that they didn't start.  Also, they could add as the article states that it's not entirely clear that having better facial recognition, aging, AI does anyone harm.  OK, we had to go through this exchange to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you didn't.  Because if you read to the second paragraph of the story, she says my intent wasn't to claim that the meme is inherently dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what happens?  What happened when her own editor tweeted this, Stacey?  And we know people don't read up.  However, it's more it is.  However, defines moral panic because this is trying to panic people about something that is true.  Jeff, Jeff, you're wrong.  You're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we've seen Microsoft do this with that aging thing.  This is the kind of data companies do want.  They have actively pursued.  Google did it, as you said.  And just because it happened once doesn't mean other companies aren't attempting it.  And there isn't the need for a larger data set.  We know Google does this all the time.  They created this would be the greatest that you could imagine.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No tech in half of their brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, the point isn't OK.  The point isn't that the point of this article isn't that it's happening.  This way, the point.  No, no, no.  The point of the article is that people should ask these questions.  Jeff, you're missing the forest for the trees.  You're focusing on the precise data that she's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But really, the largest point is trying to get people panicky and concerned about something that is not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trying to get people aware that giving their data away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aware of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aware of a fun little game that a few years ago, everybody was saying.  It isn't a fun little game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like saying, oh, those.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the point.  It is gathering so companies use these games.  That's what the reporting says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a fun little game.  It's like a few years ago, which Game of Thrones character quiz on Facebook?  That's just a fun little game.  What could possibly go wrong?  Which Game of Thrones character are you?  Or which Simpsons character are you?  There's no harm to doing that.  We know now there is.  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that was the basis of the Cambridge Analytica issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This does a speculative paranoid what if that didn't exist?  Well, we don't know.  First of all, you don't know that.  You don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you don't know what the company.  Facebook is not going to lie to Nick Thompson.  Wait, Facebook's not going to lie what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired.  Facebook's not going to lie?  Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired.  Have you not been paying attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook lies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, it feels like your concern is making you see this as something way.  You're like just too sensitive to this.  You're this is like someone protecting free speech on the Internet.  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that's overblown, too.  I don't think that's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is overblown.  This is panicking everybody.  I'll stand here on this technology show to defend the Internet against this kind of moral panic and idiocy.  All right.  Oh, man.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I say, oh, man, backstates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Yep.  This is just this just this just scared the hell out of me and discuss.  It doesn't scare me.  I'm trying to write a post right now.  There's a brilliant academic I know, and I'm trying to be delicate in this in this pile of papers that I'm reading right now.  Academic papers who's trying to argue against the First Amendment because because too much speech is a bad thing.  That's when you go into research, you look at things like Rasmus Kline.  You look at things like Rasmus Kline's Nielsen at Oxford is very good at saying, give the evidence people.  There's this presumption that everybody thinks we're in filter bubbles.  Right.  Ever since the book was written, we're all in filter bubbles.  The research is not showing that I've been going through tons of research here that talks about the evidence of where we really are.  And so I'm going to be pretty.  Yeah, I'm going to be demanding that if you're going to do a story like this, it is purely speculative.  At least be right about the fact.  Well, what about this?  What about this?  What about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the statistics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw that today and I want to look up the methodology and questioning.  How many surveys do we have?  Ninety percent of people don't know we're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ninety sixty three Facebook users aged 18 and older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to look at the question in the form of the question.  So what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My experience with Pew's research has been that it's pretty good, but pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I've had problems.  I have had specific issues.  Well, sure, sure.  Because it's the James Kerry, my hero in these matters, who says the conversation democracy is conversation.  He says the ruling of democracy is the public opinion survey because it cuts off the conversation that it is meant to inform.  Does it seem starts with the bias and the agenda of the question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it seem impossible, though, that three quarters of Facebook users aren't really aware of what Facebook is doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would put the same question.  Are they aware of what media is really doing?  Why should they be aware of how advertising structures work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Facebook has a very different presence in their lives and much more influence than you're not given the New York Times anywhere near the kind of information you're giving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll point you to New York Times is trying to give you a they do it by your zip code.  They're not doing it by everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll point you to Yochai.  Wait, wait, Stacey.  What Stacey just said.  I'll point you to Yochai Beckler's brilliant new book about this, where he has data that shows the influence of Fox News being greater for where we are right now than that of Facebook.  That's a presumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook is not the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also it's not either or.  I mean, sorry, Fox News is not the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think Facebook and Fox News both could be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And no one would.  Does Beckler say it's not a problem?  I think Fox News is a horrible problem.  Does Beckler say that Facebook is not?  I'm not suggesting that we regulate the speech on a news channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no one is.  Well, maybe they are.  I don't know.  That would be a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You had Congress just yesterday.  Wait, wait, wait.  Congress just yesterday.  Back to Leo's point.  Sorry, Stacey.  There's one point.  Congress just yesterday, various people going against the platforms for the supposed anti-right-wing bias they have and how they ought to be censored by government.  That is against the First Amendment.  Yes, I agree.  And by God, I'm going to stand up and I'm going to defend the First Amendment and speech against that kind of talk.  And that kind of talk comes out of panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about your slippery slope here, because I see that you've got one and I understand why you're you're leaning so hard on this.  But walk me down that slope.  How does this lead to the end of free speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we end up in a world of regulation and we see the beginnings of it in Europe.  So you have, for example, the right to be forgotten, which as a journalist and an academic of sorts, some kind of fake academic, I find utterly offensive to rewrite history,  to erase history.  Europe, of all places, should recognize the danger of that.  And ironically, in an effort to take power away from Google, it only gave Google more power.  The the law that's too long for even me to pronounce in German, that's the anti-hate speech law that has led to the hiring of 30,000 people on Facebook to deal with this.  They get 24 hours to make a judgment.  What happens is that satire is killed because anybody who's sitting there on a low paying job going through this crap, if you have the slightest doubt as to whether or not this is bad, kill it.  And that's what's happening right now in Germany, a country that I would hope would care about free speech and understand the value of that.  But surely you're not being absolutist on this thing because of these clearly misguided, misdirected laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There should be no regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I didn't say there's no regulation.  Number one, we already have laws for most of all the things that we matter.  These are special laws because technology is specially scary.  No, this is about human behavior, no matter where it occurs.  And we have laws that regulate.  It's the other way around, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you an example.  It's the Honest Ads Act.  It's the other way around.  Technology has been given a pass in many cases.  As you well know, mainstream media has to reveal who bought a political ad on television and radio.  Facebook does not.  And any attempt to get Facebook to reveal that has been thwarted, including the Honest Ads Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing that now and they're backing the Honest Ads Act.  It's not the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and thank goodness that people put their feet to the fire.  So it isn't the case that technology is being...  I think that the Honest Ads Act...  Persecuted. It's the opposite.  In many cases, it's the opposite.  Amazon didn't have to pay any sales tax for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, again, who do you blame for that? You blame legislators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just pointing out, you're acting as if, oh, we're all coming down on technology because it's special.  I think you could just as well make the case that technology has gotten a pass because it's special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agreed with Stacey in many ways it has.  And I also said that this is well part of the public discussion.  But I want it to be evidence based.  I heartily recommend Yochai Beckler's book to get a sense of how we end up here.  That a maybe article is not an evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a maybe article and that's probably poor journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what bothered me so much about this.  And it is in an atmosphere of people being panicked about this.  And it used a non-event to stir up more speculative, paranoic panic about this.  And that's irresponsible.  So be evidence based, especially from a journalistic organization.  And again, I like Wired.  Wired is excellent. Nick is an excellent editor.  He's done superb work.  This is a specific criticism.  But this was off today and I was highly disappointed in his tweet and in Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Stacey would agree too, right?  I mean, in that case, it's about journalistic standards.  Articles shouldn't be based on that kind of flimsy conjecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about ethics and gaming.  Sorry.  Don't start there, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to have some real problems here.  You're thinking of problems now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the editorial or these kind of speculative articles are a time honored journalistic tradition.  I think they followed all the rules.  They don't assess that it's fact.  They were very clear in the first lead.  And I know you took issue with his tweet.  People do take issue with tweets.  That's the problem with tweets.  It's not just tweets.  People take issue with headlines.  There's no nuance in tweets or headlines.  We can't presume anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is an ethical thing.  We should not presume anymore that people click and read the article.  So the entry has to be complete enough and correct enough in and of itself.  The AP gets in huge trouble for this.  That is a very different issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've actually had this problem with Wired in the past.  Maybe this should have been an opinion piece and labeled as such.  Even then, even then, it's based on a presumption of something that turns out to be false.  As often opinion pieces are.  She says it.  Oh, it is.  Wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  Wired opinion.  It is an opinion piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of speech is opinion.  Never mind.  This is journalism.  It's not a reportage.  It's an opinion piece based on based on a wrong presumption.  No, it is.  Yes, it is.  It is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's not saying that it's a correct presumption.  She's saying it is her presumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost it's almost a what if could happen.  It's a what if.  But that's a problem.  Could hit us.  I will grant you, Stacey.  That is a longstanding journalist tradition in opinion pieces.  And this is an opinion piece.  This is not a news story.  It's part of the reason that no one trusts us, which is what I battle against out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a journalism school.  Well, maybe.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe Wired, like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, it needs a separate op-ed  section so that you know what you're reading.  That is a big problem nowadays, by the way.  You can't tell.  All articles.  Even then.  Even then.  Disassociated from the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's still standards in an opinion section.  Well, you can ask a what if question in opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't find this as egregious as you, Jeff.  In fact, I find your passion about this absolutely baffling.  But I find your disagreement baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I just I mean, I'm just kind of like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a hotline for Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I stopped the car today.  I stopped the car and I read that tweet at a stoplight in a train, horrible traffic.  When I got someplace where I could stop, I stopped.  I read the article.  I read the tweet again and I stopped right there to the point of responding to this.  I was so upset about it.  Maybe you should.  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, let's talk about something else, because if you want to talk about my hot button issues.  What's your hot button issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need my own ring to see what happened to my pulse in the last 20 minutes.  Your watch says you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the Verizon remind story?  It's in Ars Technica.  Someone had emailed me about it being a net neutrality or no tweeted me about it being a net neutrality violation.  And what this is is basically a failure to regulate not the tech industry, but the carriers.  And it's a fascinating story and it's a fascinating policy issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the Verizon Angers teachers story?  Yes, it is Verizon.  I haven't seen it.  No, Verizon charges new spam fee for texts sent from teachers to students.  Is this in the wake of the FCC's ruling that the text messages?  It is.  What do they call it?  Publishing, not publishing.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are an information service as opposed to something that should be governed by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which gives the carriers like Verizon the right to do this.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It basically gives them.  Why did the FCC rule that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Background first.  It's agit pi.  Two words.  Agit pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who you thought was going to be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm not going to rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to really be upset when I say that what really happened, which is that agit pi felt that.  Well, the ostensibly the idea was we could cut spam if we let carriers decide what spam and text messages give them the power to cut spam.  But the thinking really is that they would like to and they have in the past censor political speech that is not amenable to certain groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the narrow.  Narrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was what happened was I can't remember which carrier banned.  It was Verizon.  Verizon.  It was Verizon.  Again, banned text messages from the right to life organization.  Right.  That's narrow.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  National.  No, no, no.  It's the right to life.  Right to choice.  Right to choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Narrow is choice.  This is such an old debate now.  Right.  But it's coming back.  So they blocked anti-pro-abortion messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's so this is the this is the political.  They blocked pro-abortion messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Narrow is a choice organization.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So first things you think I just want to get background first.  Now, spleen.  So remind is a free texting service used by teachers, students and parents.  But there's a dispute over the fees Verizon demanded for the company that operates the service.  As a result, teachers have been expressing their displeasure with Verizon.  Remind the company that offers the service criticized Verizon for charging a new fee.  Its services, text message notifications will stop working on Verizon unless Verizon changes course.  Verizon says the fee must be charged to fund spam blocking services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we all being charged this fee?  Just remind.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just remind.  So basically Twilio, who is sending out these messages, is being charged.  Oh, the carriers hate Twilio.  Yes.  Right.  Now, here's the deal.  The political reason is a you should be able to not push messages you don't think are right.  Whatever the economic message, which is the real message here, the real rationale for this is they can double dip.  So I pay for text messaging.  These companies already like Twilio already pays to send text messages to get on the Verizon network.  But now Verizon can charge more people.  They can charge them again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Remind has a free plan, but it also has a paid plan.  So it's a typical business where there's a freemium business.  Twilio does have to pay to get access to the Verizon network, but they're hoping they'll make that recoup that money.  Remind's costs right now for sending messages to Verizon customers is a few hundred thousand dollars a year.  It will go to several million dollars a year after this change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There isn't really a problem with the teachers messages.  They're just caught in this vice of this fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're a wonderful test case for this because who does?  And Verizon, they say, hey, we will work with individual schools.  We just don't want to work with, you know, this particular this company and them are still negotiating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, technically, it's Verizon charging Twilio.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Extra.  Now Twilio isn't passing.  They are just passing that fee along to remind.  They are not charging anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it send spam or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Twilio.  They hate Twilio because Twilio basically offers an easier and more developer friendly way to get telecommunication services because the carriers never did.  Apart from text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twilio is basically a communications API.  So if I wanted to send spam, not spam, I'm sorry, broadcast messages to our listeners were about to begin twig.  I would use a service like Twilio to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And to be clear, Twilio has been used by spam.  And actually, when I talk to people in D.C. in the lobbying industry or lobbyists and politicians in D.C., they actually think Twilio is spam because they only only the, you know,  the carriers have the lobbying power.  So they come in and they talk about how they don't hear from everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twilio is great.  In my opinion, Twilio is a high tech solution is something that the carriers never wanted people to use.  They just wanted they want to make their SMS money.  And this is this is a good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So so this is a frustrating story for this is where regulation.  The fact that we have taken a hands off approach here, this is how the other side not, I mean, takes advantage of that.  And there's always going to be someone taking advantage of regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah. And do you think Twilio I don't know this, but do you think Twilio has done a bad job of blocking spam on their network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Twilio anybody can pay to send a gajillion messages over Twilio.  Right. Twilio does not have to my knowledge, they do not.  They don't even look.  Yeah, are legit like remind.  I'm sure has people opt in.  It sounds like they have people opt in to like, I want this via email or text.  So there are plenty of good Twilio customers, but Twilio is a service.  And I'm sure people are using Twilio for all sorts of terrible things.  So here's an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twilio says now that it's switching to a new Verizon service designed specifically for commercial long code messaging.  And that Verizon is adding a termination surcharge of point zero zero two five cents per mobile terminated SMS message.  So they're charging per message, a small amount, but that adds up when you send millions of messages.  All providers, not just Twilio, are impacted equally by this fee that Verizon is instituting.  Twilio has made the decision to pass along the fee without any markup.  But it believes a similar fee may be imposed for terminating long code traffic.  Terminating doesn't mean ending in this case, but using basically right.  Long code traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twilio says it sends our Verizon says Twilio sends more than four point five billion texts a year on the Verizon network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody do the math.  Point zero zero two five times four point five billion.  Chat room.  That's millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that's per year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not doing that math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do they think?  What do they think?  What do the carriers think about Apple and Google enabling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they hate them.  They hate all of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one of the reasons people use Twilio is because it's not just SMS.  You could use messages or WhatsApp or voice and other things.  And it's got APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's easily programmable.  I mean, it's everything the carriers aren't in.  It's everything the carriers wanted to not wanted to be.  It's like the carriers.  I always look at them and I'm like, they're the antithesis of the way tech has grown up.  So tech has always grown up with like we make something easier and cheaper.  People will use more of it and people will buy more of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carriers say let's make it harder and more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I don't I don't it baffles me.  It really truly does.  And they do have actual constraints.  They also I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the carrier.  You and the carriers, Jeff.  This is the fight of the old incumbents against the upstart internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just that.  I mean, look at Intel with their processors.  Intel paid and funded companies to use their silicon so they would actually be able to produce more of it.  I mean, they started the entire computer revolution with things like Moore's Law and trying to produce things more cheaply so people would buy more of it.  It's just a different economic model.  And the carriers have actually they're starting to adopt it with the iPhone that forced them to do a lot to change how they think about things.  But they haven't not everybody's gone yet.  Right. Not all the old carrier dudes have retired.  But I mean, things like software defined networking were such a they had the potential to be such a benefit to carriers,  but they didn't adopt it for almost a decade.  And the idea that they could actually produce telecommunications for like lower the cost per bit.  They they weren't interested in that.  That wasn't what they saw themselves as doing.  Whereas someone like Google or Facebook, you're like, that's your cost of goods sold.  Right. And you want to get that as low as possible.  And they're like optimizing like heck for that.  The carriers never thought that way.  They just think about maximizing their revenue per user like Apple.  Yeah, kind of maybe.  I've never done a study.  I've never done a study of Apple from that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google change log.  RCS comes to Google Fi fits right into this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rich communication services.  This is something that carriers have been slow to adopt.  Google's been pushing hard because Apple messages could do so much more than SMS.  So they really want everybody to use RCS.  I like RCS because I like Apple messages.  It is now available on five and a half.  It is now available on five and compatible phones designed for five and compatible Android iPhones.  If you're using Google Fi.  So Google's crazy messaging strategy.  I put I changed my messaging from Hangouts on my Pixel to Android messages.  Because and then in order to get it on the iPhone, I now have to use a web page.

Transcript:  Isn't that great? See, you can get you'll get suggested responses, which are very good because Google's watching you every step of the way.  Google knows where you are.  Every minute. Read receipts, typing indicators, features that have been in every other messenger platform forever.  Finally, text messaging.  So, you know, when somebody's typing, you'll see the dot dot dot that they're working on a message, things like that.  Messaging over Wi-Fi, which is, you know, very nice.  Here's another one you're going to like, Jeff.  When you pay when you travel with Google Fi, they're upgrading the speed in 33 countries to 4G.  Yeah, Jeff's happy.  Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, most of Europe, basically Europe and Kazakhstan and Israel and Monaco.  Kazakhstan is in Europe.  I guess it is.  What is Europe these days? Who knows?  Israel is not.  So Israel is the only one.  The UK is not in Hong Kong.  That's another story.  Hong Kong. Kuwait is also not.  Kuwait. So there you go.  Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the big L's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it.  And I'm tempted.  I'm constantly tempted to go ahead and switch over.  But I keep on wanting to just irritate AT&T by keeping my grandfather unlimited plan.  I know. Just to bug them.  Just to take them.  I'm sure they sit up there and say that.  Jarvis!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

It's a your related activity.  Only you can see these.  So you can pick up where you left off.  This is going to freak people.  Yeah.  Well, that's why they say only you can see these.  So if you search for eating clean, it will then pull up all the cleaning stuff that you did earlier.  Links to pages you visited in the past, searches you've done, and then you can click back.  That's nice because I often want to search, research something.  I'm like, oh, I what was that?  I what was that?  And so it'll be nice to get that in there.  You can control.  There's a three dot icon in the knowledge card.  You can control what appears in your activity card by deleting an item, by pressing it or turning off cards by tapping the three dot icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it like so isn't it like the Weekly World News or the National Enquirer?  They they would pay journalists like incredible salaries because basically you were ruined after you worked there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a guy who left the Chicago Tribune when I was there many, many years ago and it was secretive or he was quitting.  He was going. We didn't know where.  And then we found out he went to the National Enquirer and we sat Shiva for him.  Yeah, that's because there's no other job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although Sam Biddle managed to work for years at Gawker sliming people like me and now finds good work at the intercept.  So it just shows there's a double standard in tech.  No, I went from the Tribune.

Transcript:  Is it illegal?  I know it's illegal or in some jurisdictions to have a radar detector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New Jersey outlawed finally the speed camera, the red light cameras, which were dangerous as hell.  Why was that?  Because people would would be hyper cautious about it and stop when they normally would would go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they wouldn't run red lights anymore.  That's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, they would they would they would before the yellow, they would just.  And then I got zapped was the only time I ever got a ticket ever was one of these damn things.

So they're saying the car violated.  In fact, the pictures proved I was right.  I was innocent. I was.  Oh, no, they were foolproof.  He said, I know you're right.  Not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a picture of you not running a red light.  Yes. And they sent me the thing.  Yeah.  OK, that's a good reason to get rid of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if the reason that people are more cautious in their sections is a good reason.  I think that's probably not a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, because it was it was it was this is Hudson County, New Jersey,  where they have a different constitution that says people turning left have a right of way over all forms of life.  They're they drive in a special way, which is why you need red light cameras.  No, because it made them even crazier.  You have you have two extremes.  You have people who want to kill everything in their way of turning left.  Then you have other people who who ignore the law and decide they're going to stop and let someone turn or go.  And they don't follow the law.  So nobody knows what you're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just there's reason for rules.  Just follow the rules.  Follow the rules.  Don't be extra nice.  Follow the rules.  Right.  Here is a sign that we are living in the future.  The Play Store Google Play Store is planning to phase out 32 bit apps by 2021.

They are going to have their big Samsung event in San Francisco in February 20th, a week before Mobile World Congress.  They want to jump the gun on Mobile World Congress is thought they will announce the S 10 and their new folding phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do we think of folding phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't.  I'm here for it, man.  Are you?  Because both both both Microsoft and Samsung are widely.  Well, Samsung's announced it, but Microsoft also has there's evidence that it's going to do a folding thing of some kind.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's it's adapting its OS for folding phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so how about this week in dumb lawyer letters?  Bird scooter decided they didn't like boing boing.  Last month, Cory Doctorow writes, don't screw with Cory Doctorow.  OK, I'm just saying you do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is dumb.  This is really should be a course in law school that says don't screw with Cory Doctorow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last month, he published a post discussing discussing the fact that there were mountains of abandoned scooters piling up in city impound lots and the rise of cheap Chinese conversion kits that lets you buy one of these scooters, swap out the motherboard and make it your own without any bird stuff on it.  Bird sent him a cease and desist letter saying that's a violation of Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits the dissemination of circumvention tools.  Maybe they didn't know that Cory Doctorow is one of the leading campaigners against Section 1201 in the world and has some friends over there at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  In response, Cory writes Bird sent us a legal threat of such absurdity, we're publishing it in full along with a scorching response from the EFF as a kind of celebration of truly world class legal foolishness.  It's not a circumvention device, A, because you're replacing the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not in any way hacking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B, he's a journalist and he's writing about people doing it, not telling you how to do it.  And he's protected by something we call the US Constitution.  And C, you're actually sending a cease and desist letter to a guy who says I've pledged myself to killing Section 1201.  Literally, his new project, Apollo 1201.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is his life goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You couldn't send it to him.  Maybe it's a better person, a perfect example of what's wrong with 1201.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How old is 1201? When was it passed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the DMCA.  And it basically meant people couldn't bypass copy protection.  You couldn't do any research, you couldn't do any analysis, you couldn't disseminate.  And so it's a pretty broad, it's a pretty big stretch to say that he was helping people bypass copy protection at all.  One side effect you might have noticed of the government shutdown, but side effect that President Trump's going to have to apparently mail in his State of the Union address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was suggested that he could do it on the Google Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make it Google, tweet it. No, no, no, no, that's not modern enough. Tweet it. Tweet it.  Instagram stories and stuff.  He should buy hamburgers for everybody in Congress and tweet it.  The government, many of the government agencies that are shut down have websites whose certificates have expired.  And as a result, either you can't go in the site or worse, you can go in the site insecurely, including this, by the way, is the Department of Justice, NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these are government agencies that didn't renew their own certificates.  Well, there's no one there to renew them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Now, Steve Gibson pointed out that next time there's going to be a shutdown, they could proactively renew them before the shutdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.  Or say you're not paying me to heck with it.  I'm not going to do it. Get somebody else to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NASA, the Department of Justice Court of Appeals.  But it's important to note that if you in some of these sites, they correctly shut them down.  But in some of the sites, you can go in just insecurely.  Maybe would be just a little reminder, a little public service warning.  You probably shouldn't because at that point you're insecure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, oh, man, so I just went to NASA to see if it was up.  It is indeed up. Big red box.  If you're a currently a NASA employee affected by the furlough, click here.  Huh? What are they going to ensure?  Oh, wait a second.  To ensure you're viewing the latest version of this website, please clear your browser's cache by doing the following.  Bum bum bum bum.  Huh?  Use of government. I don't want to wonder what this is.  Is this because of the certificate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows? No, it looks like it's HTTPS.  They must have renewed theirs because that looks like it's OK.  Is there rocket scientists?  They're rocket scientists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would figure somebody go in on his day off and just say, hey, let me let me renew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man, look at this is fast.  This is this is this is the so FAQ for passport expiration, FAQ for expiring badges.  Oh, credit union and bank assistance during the shutdown.  Important government travel card information.  This just breaks my heart. Oh, my Lord.  Seeking outside employment during a shutdown.  This is this is just yeah, you're right.  It's heartbreaking. Really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, FAQs on retirement during the current shutdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, oh, man.  How to request an activity be accepted because these are scientists who want to do their work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, as long as we're going to piss off the trumpeters, let's talk about Roku banning first approving and then banning Infowars.  Yes, I didn't do this story yesterday because I was decisions was a mistake.  Yeah. Well, yesterday, Roku added an Infowars channel to its channel guide.  And I didn't do the story because I had a feeling that was not the end of it.  And literally hours later, they said they tweeted after the Infowars channel became available, we heard from concerned parties and determined the channel should be removed from our platform.  The concerned parties, by the way, included parents of Sandy Hook students who had been murdered.  Of course, as you know, Alex Jones says that no one was ever murdered at Sandy Hook.  Deletion from the channel store and platform has begun, says Roku, and will be completed shortly.  This is I don't think he could really believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think he really believes that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I always wondered this about some of these demagogues is how much of it is good business and how much of it is pure belief.  He said he himself in his divorce decree said he's just an entertainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which I mean, because that's it's pretty reprehensible to lie about something that's so harmful to people.  But yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that, in fact, actually, last week, the parents of the children who were murdered at Sandy Hook won a legal victory against him.  A judge ruled that the families of victims must be granted access to financial records and other documents in part of the discovery process in an ongoing lawsuit against Infowars.  That should be good reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So could we sue about Trump's repeated statements about Krause at his inauguration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no document. I'm mad about the thousand hamburgers.  There were only 300 hamburgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God, nothing. In fact, we wouldn't even sell them.  I used to work at McDonald's. There's a little.  Nowadays they have electronics.  But in my day, when you put a rack of Big Macs up in there, you put a card on it that said the minute that it was made and five minutes after that, you throw them out because there's nothing worse.  And I've had them. They're horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can now they're all made right in time, right?  Oh, you want them fresh.  What was your job at McDonald's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't. It was my first job. I was in high school. I was 16.  I started as everyone does at McDonald's selling the Orange 8 at the counter and grab a bucket and mop was that I learned how to work there.  They said if you're standing still, wipe down the counter.  You know, you're always doing something and you learned customer service was great.  And then I worked my way up to shake the shake machine.  And then from the shake machine to the fry machine, that's a challenge because there's hot oil there.  You could hurt yourself.  And then I was very proud.  By the end, I worked my way up to the grill and I was closer, which meant that you had to stay till like midnight till McDonald's is closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you have to clean everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I remember from my Ponderosa days, the stainless steel polish you had to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We yeah. And then on the grill, maybe many people don't know this, but here's a little handy tip.  The old pickle juice is great for breaking down the grease on the grill.  That was a process.  I think it was in the manual. Yeah.

Transcript:  And Karsten, it sounds like you've taken lessons.  Why? Why would parents need to learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's two. There's two things you can rent yourself out as.  You can rent yourself out as to train younger children to play fortnight.  Or parents who are worried about what their children are doing and want to understand and be and play with them so they can so they can hear the chatter going on.  Oh, that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you could build.  Michael, our 16 year old and his other 16 year old friends have asked me to start a flat  world on the server for them so they can build a replica of Petaluma.  That's awesome.  Isn't that amazing?  And by the way, they had the skills to do it.  You should see what they build.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm giving you my 15 minute warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm giving you my last ad of the day and you're going to give me the pick of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  week.  But first, a word from WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WordPress.  Love WordPress.  We were just talking about WordPress.  Matt Mullenweg started the company.  I've been a WordPress.com user since 2012.  I actually started even before then with a self-install WordPress on my own server.  What I found was what many people find, you spend more time.  Andy Anaco just was saying this.  He's running WordPress on his own server, getting the database right, fixing mess ups  than posting content.  That's when I realized, wait a minute, I could be doing this at WordPress.com.  Let them do all the technical stuff.  Let them do the serving.  It actually costs less than me buying my own server and doing all the work.  I learned it, which is great.  But if you don't want to become an HTML CSS database guru, WordPress.com creates a stunning  website, very important that you own.  It's your site.  It's your content.  It's nobody else's.  If you're a business and you don't have a website, WordPress.com.  If you're a teenager, don't let your other friends and their posts on social media sites  become your person on the web.  Search results.  When you search for your name, if you get crappy videos your friends posted on Facebook,  it's time to start a website.  I tell every teenager, WordPress.com.  There's a free tier.  You can go there.  It's free to start.  You could try it.  Set up your site.  That way, when people search for your name, they'll find your stuff, your best stuff.  You're never stuck.  You can upload video, audio.  You don't have to put it on YouTube.  Upload video.  You upload audio.  You upload pictures.  You don't have to put them on Instagram.  You can upload text.  It's great for writing.  Publish your ideas.  And any time you want it back, it's all yours.  It's all your content.  You can download it all.  You can move it anywhere you want.  You're never locked in.  WordPress.com is built to grow with you, too, to get you where you want to be tomorrow.  And if you ever have any questions, I love the customer support team there.  They're 24 hours a day, including weekends, to answer any questions you have.  It's such a powerful and flexible site, as we just heard.  Everybody uses WordPress.  Quartz uses WordPress.  Fortune uses WordPress.  It's perfect for big companies and small.  So many people use WordPress these days that it powers 33% of the internet.  One third of all the internet, one third of all the internet runs on WordPress.  So should you.  By the way, there's an advantage to that because it means there's real support out there for WordPress.  Not just from WordPress.com, but from third parties.  Although I have to say the WordPress app is everything I could ever want on iPhone and Android.  That's how I posted when I was on my trip.  Go to WordPress.com slash twig.  You'll get 15% off any new plan purchase right now.  Yep.  WordPress.com slash twig.  15% off when you start that new site.  Don't put it off.  And honestly, it could be a site about your Minecraft builds.  It could be a site about your plumbing business.  It could be anything you want.  That's the beauty of the open web.  And that's what WordPress is all about.  WordPress.com slash twig.  Stacey Stomach, we have that little monitor on her.  It's 30% empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, actually right now it's probably closer to 60% empty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we better get her out of here with her pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  So I talked about this.  I think Leo, you made fun of this and I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How come I am getting beat up for making fun of stuff today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you did. You made fun of it.  So I saw this at CES and I looked into it and I am going to buy it because I think it's that amazing.  It is called the Jax Jocks.  And this is because I spent...  So I love tweets and I've been...  I have done kettlebells for a while.  I'm not currently a kettlebell person, user, whatever.  But this is $349.  It's an internet or rather Bluetooth connected kettlebell set.  So it's one kettlebell and you stick it on the base and then you add more weights to it.  It's kind of like the Bowflex idea.  The Bowflex...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an adjustable kettlebell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing I made fun of was that the whole point of the kettlebell, they were used...  I think they were invented in Russia, is it's the cheapest gear you can get.  It's just a hunk of iron with a handle on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that is not true.  And this is where I wanted to go with this.  So if I wanted to buy a 20 kilogram, which is about a 44 pound kettlebell,  if I go to like some place like Dick's Sporting Goods, they're about 80 to 90 dollars.  Really?  And you need...  Yeah, in a full set, depending on where you get it.  Now, I'm sure I could go on Craigslist and find some non-connected ones.  But a full set of like six, like this ranges from 12 to 42 pounds.  The weight increments, I would rather have five than six, but that's just me.  But that's about three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to promise you that this guy did not spend three hundred dollars on that kettlebell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but that's not the kettlebells that are... I can't get that kettlebell.  If I go to a spot...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from like the turn of the century, the textbook of weightlifting by Arthur Saxon,  one shilling strongest man in the world. And what is he doing?  He's lifting a kettlebell. I do kettlebell workouts.  I like kettlebells. I like them a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the next best aspect of this is you get six weights in one.  But the other thing is it's got the accelerometers and gyros so you can do the workout correctly.  Which, if I ever... I mean, like, seriously, you can really screw yourself up if you do a kettlebell workout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole reason a kettlebell is different than a dumbbell is because the weight is outside your hand.  So there's momentum, which means you swing it, which means you can really hurt yourself,  not just by hitting yourself in the head.  Never let me have one of those.  But you could torque your back.  So, yeah, but on the other hand, if done right, they're really great for flexibility as well as strength.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, so I am very excited about this.  And I'm going to buy one and add it to my weight-begauver team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as you know, anything you buy, I buy. So let me know when they're available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are available now. You can buy it now. It's $349.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't do it.  I do kettlebell with my trainer.  And he's constantly adjusting my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this is kind of like having...  So maybe, you know what, you should contact them for a review.  And I'll check them out when I... I'll check out the safety policies on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really like the name. Jax Jocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jax Jocks. I think their videos are stupid as all get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's just me.  The funny thing about that webpage, it really seems to be more about the model than the kettlebell, which is off in the corner.  What are you selling?  Where's the kettlebell?  I thought at first I thought they were selling yoga pants. I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're marketing is not geared towards me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best of Gadgets, Best of CES.  Sherlyn Lowe was on the show with us on Sunday.  She said best of CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because Sherlyn knows what's up.  She knows what's up.  And now, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to know the record that actually I originally put the 10 year photo thing down here in the numbers because I was just going to make a passing reference to it.  What a silly story it was.  I was the one.  And there it was.  So I just want to know that I was not preparing a psycho fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you know what? I love it when you guys fight. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's the best.  You're what's wrong with America, Leo Laporte.  You're what's wrong with media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We went all Jerry Springer on you there.  That was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. All right.  So here's what I stole one back, which I actually love the story.  I'm fascinated by it because I've been tracking my days as a TV critic way down how over the air broadcast audience has been shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking.  Right. Well, over the last eight years, over the air TV audiences up 48 percent.  Over the years.  But that story is really more about cord cutting, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That the fact that people are getting rid of their cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. It says there are two groups.  There are groups who cannot afford cable.  Right. And that's what we still have over the air and why it's still free TV.  Unfortunately, the quality of what you get free on TV in America has gone down rapidly.  Ironically, because the argument was when we had three networks, well, if we get more networks, look how bad TV is.  It'll get worse. An abundance led to tremendous quality.  But there was some kind of plateau we hit that then came down partly because so much pay TV out there.  So there are 16 million homes that have it.  That's one. So one group is is old people and others who can't afford.  The other group is cord cutters who have a direct account with the likes of Netflix or such and then get news and whatever over the air.  What's interesting about this, though, is if it weren't for the I don't know regulation that enables these odd things,  enables cable to be a monopoly in your market and to have the must carry fees and on and on and on and on and on.  I think that over the air would have gone down to virtually zero.  But it's kind of artificially kept up because over the air has now become expensive because you have to get it in your cable package.  And you can only get it in a cable package.  So when you cord cut from that, you can't get the TV anymore.  So it's an artificial increase in over the air TV.  That's my theory. I missed all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's all well, you're a cord cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm a cord cutter, but I don't have access to digital TV signals where I live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can't actually get over the air.  I have to get over the air. So if I want over there, I have to buy cable.  So I've never been able to get it. I'm not alone.  I thought you lived in Austin.  I live in Austin. I have line of sight to all of the antennas.  I just and I've tried a mohue leaf. I've tried all these.  It's ridiculous.  It's it is not an uncommon problem for people to struggle to get their DTV signals.  It was one of the things when they did the auction.  So when they converted the digital, the analog television signals to digital and then used that spectrum, actually, it became the I think it's a 700 megahertz spectrum for LTE networks.  That was one of the things is it was going to reduce the range for some.  Some shows for some people, and I just happened to be in it.  Actually, all of my houses have been in this like bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The digital cliff area where unlike analog, which degrades digital just doesn't work.  And there is this area. It's a it's this margin where you could get analog signals, not maybe the perfect signals, but signals and you can't get digital at all.  But that's that's kind of shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's it's always been it's always been super frustrating for me because like, but it just shows you a cord cutter since 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People don't do over the air anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it was the last time you watched over the air TV through a antenna.  How many years has it been? Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A long, long time. Yeah, same here.  I can't remember rabbit ears.  That was that's a. Gosh, I miss 20 years, probably.  At least in a long time, and we can't we in Petaluma, where I've lived for more than 20 years, we can't get locals except for Channel 50, which is kind of silly.  You just even the name Channel 50 should tell you something, you know, but because we can't get the San Francisco stations.  But nowadays I don't have to have cable as long as I have data because I can use YouTube TV or I like YouTube TV.  I can watch all the locals. Lisa watches the football games on YouTube TV, even though we don't have any access here in the studio.  So as long as you have data. But yeah, I think the best deal in the world is over the air, high def television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great. So I'm making a list of things that we just don't need anymore that have other significance behind them.  So rabbit ears is one. The phone booth is one. The phone itself.  The tape recorder is going to be a long list. And it's what's weird is how it's adding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's new stuff adding all the time to this list.  You have any to throw at me? I thought, you know, the other day I was talking about this on the radio show, but I don't remember.  House keys. House keys. She doesn't even use house keys.  She's so modern. I actually use house keys, but many people do not. I don't have a car key anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a fob. OK, dude, you should actually keep your key because sometimes you'll park places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they don't. They don't have key. Tesla's. You have a key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have a I have a radio fob thing. Yeah, that's I don't call it a key.  So I call that my keys. Oh, yeah. That's my keys. The Tesla key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fax machine. I know it's a machine. I think it goes to nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I use a fax machine just the other day.  You have to use a fax machine to legal legal stuff and FOIA requests.  Because they want to charge you to print the papers. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about a radio? I have a radio, but it's more in case of disaster. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you actually wake up to a clock radio. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes sometimes I wake up if it's WXXX Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got my whole childhood. I had a clock radio that would come on with WCBS.  I like the news radio in New York.  And it's funny because I mean, I remember RFK's assassination that waking up  and hearing that on my clock radio. I had that for years.  I was I kind of missed that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What made me get started is I wrote a post on Medium a couple years ago  about the death of control S.  For save.  Save. Right. Nobody saves anymore.  Nobody saves anymore. You don't need to save anymore.  You just hit that all the time.  This notion of constantly saving. Right. So I wrote that thing and I thought of others.  That's great.  Oh, you can go on and on.  Any other objects of change?  Oh, god. CDs.  Yeah, CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, records, physical media of all kinds, physical media, except interestingly books.  I think we thought Polaroids.  Those are back. They're back. I know.  Especially among parents of younger children.  Yeah.  We thought that didn't we think that ebooks would completely replace printed books by now?  And in fact, it's quite the opposite.  Behind me. Kindles are gone and everybody has books again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I love my Kindle.  Really? I buy.  I have to buy a Kindle every year or every every few months because I leave them on planes.  Which one do you have, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the paper white.  I like the paper white. I have the Oasis, the very expensive new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it worth the extra?  I rarely use it. No.  Well, I don't know. I got it because of the high resolution, right?  And it's a faster page turn. It's got faster processor.  I never liked that slow page turn animation.  That always kind of bugged me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the old remote controls are called clickers because they used to click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did. Some of them would actually sound like they were they're sighing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how did they communicate? How did the clicker communicate with the TV?  Sound, I think.  It was sound. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a sound cue. It was like the clapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you actually still have sound cues with certain IOT devices to connect them to your network.  It's for authentication purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yes. They call it the chirp.  But they're usually an audible, right?  In fact, Google invented that with Google with a Chromecast, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe. But you also have it still with alarm systems.  Old school alarm systems use sound to indicate the helm.  They use dial tones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, helm doesn't use sound, but it uses Bluetooth to authenticate your phone.  You can't put a helm on your set up the helm unless you can bring your phone next to it,  which is actually a clever authentication.  There's a lot of those.  OK, I have to leave.  Go fill your empty tummy, Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just have I have I have an appointment I've got to get to.  Bye bye. Bye.  Thank you, guys. I almost I almost did the automatic like I love you.  But that's for my husband.  We all love each other. We do.
