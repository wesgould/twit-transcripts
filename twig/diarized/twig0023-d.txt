Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig.  This week in Google, episode 23 for January 3, 2010.  What should Google do?  This week in Google is brought to you by the new voice-activated Sync, featuring hands-free  calling, music and podcast search, and turn-by-turn navigation, available exclusively on Ford,  Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  For more details, visit SyncMyRide.com.  It's time for Twig.  This week in Google, and our guest, as always, the esteemed, the talented, the wonderful  Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, journalist and commentator on Journalists Extraordinaire,  a professor of journalism at the CUNY, C-U-N-Y, Journalism School, and the author of What  Would Google Do?  What Would They Do?  What Would They Do?  Also with us, of course, Gina Tripani from sunny San Diego.  She's the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  SmarterWear.org is her website and one of the founders of Lifehacker.  She's a regular there as well.  And today, because this is our first episode of 2010, and by the way, we are going to call  it 2010, we're going to try to adhere to that, to save syllables.  I'm in on that campaign.  No 2010 here.  I think we could talk a little bit about the future, mostly because there's really not  much news because everybody at Google was home with family and friends this week.  We could talk a little bit about what should Google do.  So if you're watching our live stream, which we do every Saturday about 2.15 Pacific, 5.15  Eastern on live.twit.tv, just use the hashtag pound twig with your ideas of what should  Google do.  And I know Gina also tweeted this earlier, so you have quite a few responses to what  is this year and this decade, what is it going to bring Google?  But before we do that, there is one news story.  January 5th, it seems absolutely clear now that the Nexus One will emerge from Google.  They're having a big event, an Android event, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh yeah, press events, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's got to be, it's the same date everybody predicted.  It's got to be this new HTC handset.  We're seeing a lot of pictures of it now and there's even benchmarks on YouTube.  It's kind of stunning, a graphics speed, beautiful screen.  So Gina, you were smart, you held out and you are celebrating your intelligence right  now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I'm patting myself on the back for not giving into the droid.  I don't know about that yet.  I haven't seen it yet.  I've seen the videos look really great.  Gizmodo has a fantastic video, Nexus One.  I don't know, it still remains to be seen what the prices are going to be and the plans.  There are lots of rumors, that will be interesting to see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How much?  $599 with no plan, I think $199 with a two-year plan.  So very similar to what you have for the iPhone except that you can use it in Europe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  From T-Mobile, it'll be a T-Mobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It'll be T-Mobile but you can use it in Europe too, it's a lot.  But yeah, why they didn't add in the frequency to be able to swap in my iPhone sim from AT&T  is beyond me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It strikes me that they're still treading a little cautiously, that they don't want  to piss too many people off at once.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So with the unlocked phone, you couldn't pop out your AT&T sim from your iPhone and put  it in?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll miss the frequencies, you get it on Edge on AT&T.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't work on AT&T's 3G network.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I see.  So you would get Edge, so it would work with Edge?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It would work with Edge and I am going to Europe next month so I hope to get it and  I'll take it with me and I can use it there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's so frustrating.  I guess T-Mobile is okay.  I mean I'm using my N900 on T-Mobile right now and it's okay but it's just not, you  know, don't we all want Verizon?  I guess that's why the Droid is still maybe a good choice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want a GSM phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  I had to give the N900 to my daughter when she went to France for two weeks so she would  have a unlocked GSM phone.  So I don't even have the N900 right now but no, that's a good point.  So Gina, from what you saw in the videos, maybe you're not the best person to answer  this because you don't have a Droid but does it look different than Cupcake or Eclair or  whatever, 2.0?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it looks a little bit different.  It looks like they added a little, some kind of smooth transitions.  First of all, it's super fast and the video that I saw...  That's the big story.  That's the big thing.  And because it's so fast, because I think it has the CPU to handle it, it does nice  sort of things kind of fly in and you can touch your wallpaper.  If your wallpaper is, you know, in the video that I saw, the wallpaper was sort of like,  looked like water and if you touched it, you know, the...  That was cool.  ...the ripples go out, which is really cool.  Yeah, it was very responsive to your touch.  It felt like this living thing.  And the menus flew, everything flew.  Playing video, taking video and playing it back, all much faster.  I mean, I'm still using the G1 and to me it just looked like, I mean, it just looked  like absolute lightning, although compared to the Droid, Gizmodo said that it is faster  than the Droid.  Yeah.  That seems to be the consensus.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, are you going to do it, Gina?  Oh, yeah.  Pull the trigger.  No doubt.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  She can't wait to do it.  Happy New Year to Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there was that rumor that you had to get an invitation, but I haven't heard that again.  That seems like an odd thing to do.  I don't think they're going to do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't heard that either.  So now Gizmodo was saying like $580.  I guess the prices are very close to what Jeff said.  It seems like the prices are, there's rumors, but it's not for sure.  But it sounds like the T-Mobile deal is going to be like $80 a month.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, T-Mobile was very smart.  Getting ready for this, they created this, a couple of new, I think very innovative account  plans that are kind of bring your own phone and unlimited call everybody, all the data  you can eat and like that.  I think there's a 79 and a 99.  And I thought these were very interesting.  They're the first US cell company to do what companies in Europe have been doing for years,  which is to say, bring your own phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So how does this work?  You purchase the phone through Google and then you walk into a T-Mobile store and say,  hey, book me up.  I don't know.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like, but it does sound like you buy the phone through Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I imagine you could buy a T-Mobile too.  It sounds like it's so tightly connected to T-Mobile.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  Well, no Tuesday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, no soon.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leo, did you get an invite?  Are you going to go?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  An invite to the event?  No.  Yeah.  Did you?  No.  No.  Jeff, did you?  No.  Well, we just host the only one and only premier show about Google in the entire Googleverse,  but okay.  No, I'm sure it's an oversight.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting ready for...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Matt, Kelsey, if you're watching, what do we do wrong?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Matt, what did we do?  I'm going to be getting...  I couldn't go anyway.  We're getting ready for CES the next day we're leaving.  But I think what we're going to end up doing...  First of all, there is an Android event Friday night at CES in Vegas, so we're going to cover  that live.  And I think what we'll probably be doing is kind of do some sort of coverage by proxy  on Tuesday.  What time is the event?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I thought it was an all-day thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All day?  I feel like it started...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's just say it.  I saw the invitation somewhere.  I think we may have linked it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  All day, huh?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, let me see if...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The thing that I've been reading everybody is that it's now going to be a shrug, unless  everybody's been wrong about what they were saying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have to do something now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  It's 9.30 to 1.  Well, lunch is at noon.  That's a long time.  9.30 to 1.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's why they didn't invite us, because of lunch.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The presentation is basically from 10 to 11.  And then there's a Q&A, 11 to 11.30, demonstrations, 11.30 to 1.  Oh, okay.  With lunch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you probably, if you go, you get a free Nexus One.  You get a free phone, you think?  Sure.  Why not?  They're Google.  They got a lot of money.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  For the press, though?  It's your press.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, who better to give it to?  The developers.  Okay.  You're both, Gina.  You win.  Hands down, she should get a free one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So they gave out the G1 at Google I.O., right?  Which is primarily a developer event.  It'd be interesting to see if they give them out to press.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Gadget had a story this week that said that T-Mobile, in its internal documents that  I guess somebody saw on the net or whatever, say that Google is scheduled to launch a new  Android device in early January.  Okay, that makes sense.  T-Mobile says in this document that Google and HTC will be directly responsible for support  on the handset, bypassing T-Mobile for everything other than wireless service.  And again, we're all reading tea leaves on this, but this is something on a T-Mobile  news website, TMO news website, that I think is intended for internal use only.  It says, I'm looking at this.  Google, with support from T-Mobile, is scheduled to launch a new Android device in early January.  The Google Android phone will be sold solely by Google via the web.  And this could be, again, a fake.  Looks pretty good, though.  Support for this device, including troubleshooting exchanges, will be managed by Google and HTC.  T-Mobile will offer service support, including billing, coverage, features, and rate plans.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  See, if this were Apple, they'd take down the entire Google site at 9 o'clock on Tuesday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google is closed.  Come back later.  That's good.  I like that.  We're counting spoons.  Come back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, they won't do that.  So we're going to, I think that's the one and only story of the week.  So are you going to buy one, Leo?  Oh yeah, I have to.  I like my Droid, and I think that the Verizon network is a really compelling selling point,  to be honest, because it's such a fast network.  But I do like an unlocked phone.  I love GSM, and I love the idea of putting that SIM chip in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So at the end of the day, though, what's the big deal?  Basically, it's like getting a Droid, except that you can use it in your room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the big deal, at least for us, is that it's a Google platform, a solely Google  platform.  So when you buy something from Verizon, they strip out stuff.  They limit it.  And I think the Droid doesn't feel too limited, but there's no tethering in it, for instance.  If you get a phone that Google Designs supports and does, then presumably you get the full  Google experience.  So for me, the chief interest is what is that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  What is the full Google experience?  What happens when Google Designs a handset, essentially, or has a hand in designing this  handset?  Although people have said that they had a hand in designing the G1.  Well, they did.  I mean, obviously, this is a successor to the G1, G2.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is from the same manufacturer.  Looks like a really nice screen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the other question.  Does this start to break up the hegemony of the telcos in deals?  Is this the first of other bring your own phones to come?  I want that to be the case, too.  I'm just not sure I figured out how this gets us there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think the I kind of read those tea leaves when T-Mobile announced that they would  do a bring your own phone plan, because to me, that was saying, well, they're going to  be phones.  And if you think about it, T-Mobile is a week fourth in the cell phone business in the U.S.  They need something.  So what better thing to say, well, we'll be the geek phone.  We'll be the GSM phone of choice.  We'll be the one who supports those unlocked phones so you can get the Nokia and 900, which  is not supported by any other carrier in the U.S.  We don't even directly support it.  But you could buy it if you really cared and you could put our chip in it and we'll offer  a plan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If they'd made it AT&T compatible, then you could bring your phone to either and they  would have broken up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  AT&T doesn't have a bring your own phone plan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think they would have that.  Well, no, but I accept.  I could take my SIM out of my iPhone and put it in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you wouldn't get you'd get a limited experience.  Really?  I think so.  Oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, so maybe that's the difference.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, from a purely academic point of view, it'll be interesting to see what this Google  phone means.  But we might find that out five minutes into owning it and then go back to the droid.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be a lot thinner than the iPhone or not a lot, but noticeably thinner  than the iPhone, which I think is great.  It's very expensive.  I don't know.  How many?  You were talking before we started and you were saying, I think, Jeff, that somebody  was saying we don't use Google like normal people use Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One of Gina's responders.  With Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's very unusual to see people buy an unsubsidized smartphone for five or six  hundred bucks.  Definitely.  That can't be a common thing.  That's crazy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I think the subsidy is going to come from elsewhere.  The subsidy will eventually come from advertising and not from phone fees.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  This could be the less than free phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where this gets to go.  I think it's something that speaks to the netbook.  The thing I wonder is if Google in the Chrome OS model, which is where they'll go in general,  is saying everything's a web app, everything's a web app, then does this also kill app stores?  Why buy an app?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm a believer in apps.  I don't know why.  the notion of having a standalone app is just something people like and they didn't like  it on the iPhone and that's why Apple had to do it.  They didn't like the web app thing.  That's why Apple had to do an app store.  If you're Apple, this is your secret sauce.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But don't you see Apple swinging back into web apps with like pastry kit?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's where they'd like to be, but I don't think customers want that.  I think that's what Apple wants.  Well, what about developers, Gina?  prefer to be doing a standalone app that you can charge money for so there's this deliverable  thing.  It's not a web page.  It's a deliverable thing that you install.  Isn't that more desirable to a developer?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, the money is certainly desirable.  But the idea of developing once and having it work across all smartphones with modern  web browsers, like a web app, that's pretty desirable too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Of course we had that with Java.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, right.  Look how that worked out.  That didn't work out so good.  It didn't work out so well.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, certainly the market is making money from your app is a big draw.  And you can still do things with an app that you can't do with a web app.  But I'm interested to see what happens when mobile web browsers with HTML5 and offline  capabilities, when you can create an app which has a very close to a native app experience.  How many of those, maybe just the free apps turn into web apps?  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there's going to be a hybrid model where there's a little bit of both.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're right.  But I just still wonder when you get to the point where you have a Chrome OS machine that  basically looks like a bloated phone and operates only with web apps.  Or because I haven't heard any noise about there being kind of an app store or ability  to run separate apps on Chrome OS, right?  Right.  So what makes a phone pretty soon that much different from a tablet or whatever Apple  is going to come out with or anything else?  To me, the line is going to blur and disappear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The URL supposedly starting at 9 a.m., I don't know if that's Pacific or Eastern, on Tuesday  will be google.com slash phone.  It's a 404 if you go there right now.  Although according to Gizmodo, there's a JavaScript countdown hidden in the HTML of the page.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No way.  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google.com slash phone.  It's a 404 now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But google.com slash support slash phone.  Let me see if I view source if I can see the HTML countdown.  That would be pretty funny if they left that in the source.  I don't know.  Have you?  Okay.  Google.com slash support slash phone.  That seemed like there's an awful lot in here for a not available message.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  JavaScript, urchin's in there.  The urchin tracker goes to the same page.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's interesting.  We'll see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll see.  I don't.  We'll see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm excited.  That's going to be the big story of the beginning of the week and then of course at the beginning  of the month I should say and then at the end of the month the Apple tablet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which may make all of this moot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any chance you're going to buy the Nexus One and then regret it because the Apple  tablet sucks you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you asking me or just in general?  In my case, yeah, I regret every purchase.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do you really?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I bought the droid.  Or does your wife make you regret it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It doesn't have to go through her.  It goes through my CFO.  She makes me regret it.  She says, what did you buy this month?  No, I have to buy it.  I have to buy it.  But at the same time there's always the next thing.  No matter what, it's always just the way it is.  There's nothing you can do about it.  That's life.  So we're going to talk about, in fact, Gina, you got some great tweets.  What should Google do?  Not what could or would, but what should Google do in 2010 and beyond?  What would you do if you had all that money and all that power?  A lot of people are doing predictions and I'm very curious what our audience predicts  and what you guys predict.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  I can make one prediction and I know this is going to come true.  Come Thursday I'm going to be driving down to CES.  Actually, I'm flying.  But we're going to drive down.  We've got a Lincoln MKT with a Ford SYNC installed and we're going to drive down with all of  our gear and we're going to start our live coverage of CES, which will include, by the  way, the Android Party, which is on Friday.  It's going to be a blast.  The Consumer Electronics Show.  Lots to see, lots to do.  And we want to thank the folks at SYNC who've made this possible by sponsoring our trip  down there.  In fact, they're getting us the CEO of Ford to talk to and the guy, the designer behind  SYNC.  Because I understand there's some big announcements for SYNC.  SYNC is, of course, the hands-free Bluetooth calling music and podcast search turn-by-turn  navigation system that comes in new Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.  It is amazing.  We're going to find out more by going to syncmyride.com.  That's the site for owners of SYNC.  So I go there and I download updates to my software.  I download my vehicle health reports, things like that.  It's all there, syncmyride.com.  But you can go and just take a tour.  They have lots of video up there.  We are going to be there.  Paul Thurotte from Windows Weekly, Dick DiBartolo from the Daily Gizwiz, Ryan Schraut from This  Week in Computer Hardware, Scott Wilkinson from Home Theater Geeks, and many others,  including Ryan Block from GDGT, Will Harris.  Dr. Kiki and I will be doing coverage of the parties on Wednesday night and Thursday night  and all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday at live.twit.tv.  So if you can't make it to Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show, come to twit.tv for all  the coverage.  We have podcasts you can download or watch live at live.twit.tv.  And if you're in the area, come by and say, hey, I'd like to see that Lincoln and the  SYNC in there.  And I'll give you a little tour.  Or you could just go to your local Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer and say, I'd like to test  drive the SYNC.  SyncMyRide.com, thanks so much to SYNC and all of our sponsors.  We cannot wait to bring you CES live brought to you by SYNC.  SyncMyRide.com.  So before we get to the thoughts from our listeners, do you, Jeff, do you have some  thoughts about what should Google do in 2010?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, not really.  Are they on the right track?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are they doing exactly what they should be doing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's more about prognosticating what they're thinking.  It's like trying to see behind the man behind the curtain in Oz.  And I think we're going to see a lot more mobile data, a lot more efforts to get a tremendous  amount of data about local, and that that's going to be a huge thing this year.  And I think we're going to be surprised about what comes out there.  I think we'll find one size fits all search disappearing more and with it some measure  of the dark art of SEO.  And I think that's probably a good thing.  It starts to make search a little more valuable again.  It ruins business models along the way.  And finally, I think we'll see an emphasis on web apps given the Chrome OS and ways that  they will try to support that.  One of the predictions that I saw on where was it?  The Google operating system blog was that they will likely come up with a more framework  for creation of web apps to make them better.  I think that all makes some sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think search is even that important to Google going forward?  I guess they're not transitioned away from it, but ultimately search seems to be less  and less important to them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't exactly drop it.  No, no, it is the majority of the business by far.  91% of their revenue is advertising a lot that's based on search, not all of it.  No, but I think strategically they know they've got to go beyond search.  They have to maintain preeminence in search.  It would be really stupid to let Bing come in and take over too much turf.  They've got to keep developing that.  But no, I agree.  Strategically, they're going to go more toward, dare I say it, once for the start of the year,  the hyper personal news stream.  They'll go to things that are more live, more customized for you, more trying to make sense  of the world that you live in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd go even farther than news stream, the hyper personal info.  I mean, this hyper personal stream.  I mean, the more Google knows about you, the more everything it does is tailored around you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And not just stream, but locale.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Look at the stuff we talked about last week, the whole idea that you look around yourself  and Google knows everything about where you're standing and in the context of you and what you're doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  Gina, what are your thoughts?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I hope in 2010 that Google delivers on a lot of the promises that I kind of put out there in 2009  and promises in terms of the things that they rolled out.  You know, Wave, Android and Chrome OS and Chrome, really, are early beta products that,  well, Android's not beta, officially.  But I want to see these apps really grow up and become what Google set out to make them to begin with.  I think the other thing, this is my wish list and this is totally from sort of a product point of view.  I think the other thing that I want to see Google do, and this kind of hooks on what we talked about last week,  which was their treatise on the meaning of open.  It kind of really occurred to me at that point that Google is running on, I mean,  their business is based on user trust.  Like we have to trust Google in order to give them our data.  And I want Google to earn my trust.  So I want them to be even more open.  They need to earn my trust.  And I want them to be more open and more transparent.  And I hope that that treatise on the meaning of open wasn't just the statement about how great Google is.  I hope that it's a call to action for the company in general to be more transparent  and to explain more about what they know about me and how they're using it and how it benefits me and what the actual risks are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And give us more control over it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and give us more control over it.  I finally got a chance to see that CNBC special, the Inside the Mind of Google, it ran this week.  And it was interesting.  They talked a lot about being open and transparency and all that.  But when CNBC asked the executives, how many times had Google been subpoenaed and had to have handed over user information,  user specific information to law enforcement because they were compelled to legally, they declined to comment about that.  You know, so I mean, maybe this is asking too much, but I want to know what those numbers are.  I want to know relative sort of to Google's whole entire user base.  You know, what cases did they have to give up information to law enforcement because they were subpoenaed and what happened?  So, so, yeah, I want them to earn my trust.  I want them to be even more open about how this all works and what benefit the risks of my privacy for the convenience of the service.  And and I want them to work to earn users trust more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say, yes, I agree with you 100 percent.  I'd actually take it the next step farther that Google is going to have an unusual challenge in 2010.  You know, they have already started this crazy acquisition spree and and they have a lot of cash in hand.  And I think that they're feeling pretty cocky right now.  Probably rightly so. They have a lot of things to celebrate the success of.  And the real risk of all of that is Google could really make a big misstep in 2010.  I think it really should use this.  I would love to see Google use this year to do exactly what you just talked about, which is to kind of focus its business.  It you know, in the 10 years gone by, it bought so many businesses that it didn't use, didn't take advantage of.  Let fall like dodgeball or let waste away like Jaiku.  I would like to see it be a little more judicious in its acquisition, maybe kind of absorb what it's done and and you know, and and make it somewhat more integrated.  Google doesn't feel integrated in any respect.  And I think that hurts it. And I think as part of earning back trust, I think I'd like to see Google spend this year actively pursuing initiatives,  not just to earn back trust, but to to open the kimono a little bit to let us know just as you said, what they're doing, what are they up to, what are their plans?  If they're not evil, let us prove it.  This is the time to prove it. And the temptation is the temptation for Google this year is going to be to do the exact opposite,  which is to start buying spree, acquiring stuff, growing in all different areas.  And the real risk is that the public is going to see Google is extending tentacles out into so many areas that they're going to start to literally feel like we've got it.  We got it. This is a problem that we talked about last week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has enough would be enemies in media that they're going to jump on that and start to set that as a tone.  And I think Google has to get aggressive. Yes, we are.  But the way to get aggressive and pure moves to exactly what she has said, which is to prove how good they are and show their stuff.  And, you know, we'll see if they can do that. But you raise something else, Leo, in terms of the integration of Google.  I think what you hit upon is a problem they have within the company. It's that it is too damn big now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a corporate culture, too, though, isn't it? I mean, don't they kind of encourage that kind of governance by committee,  which, of course, lends itself to that kind of crazy fraction, you know, fractionalization?  I wonder if they have that if they even have the corporate culture to do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do you sacrifice speed, though, when you integrate all the different groups in the company?  I understand that Google sort of like Microsoft and they try to create like small companies within a big company so that those small groups are more nimble and compete with one another.  So I assume that this is Google's kind of same structure.  And what you get with that right is speed.  You know, groups can roll out new products faster than if it had to worry about integrating with everyone else or getting everyone else's approval.  I mean, I don't know. I have no idea what it's like to run or organize a structure or company Google size.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now that I have eight employees, I realize how hard it is.  It's just crazy. I don't know how you do it with 100,000.  But that's actually that's a question for Jeff, who's really studied this.  Clearly, Google has decided on a kind of unusual corporate governance structure with that very goal to avoid the pitfalls that maybe Microsoft fell into.  But this governance by committee has its disadvantages.  And I don't know, should Google think about other metaphors?  What is Google? Are they trying not to be Microsoft?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah. But the problem is, it's not just by committee, it's by committee of two.  It's Larry and Sergey still that at certain levels, what I hear is that if they don't like it, it doesn't happen.  And so the committees are there to prepare it.  It is rather a mogul company still.  And having worked for task force companies and mogul companies, the advantage of mogul companies is that you get decisions.  The disadvantages of those, you get some crazy decisions.  Well, I think decisions that are based on on kind of as much as they argue that they're all based on data at Google, they're still based on taste and will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A number of people have quit Google publicly.  There was the designer and another one who wrote and written these public letters.  And one seems one complaint was just that it's too hard to get anything done.  And I don't think it's Larry and Sergey necessarily.  It's this whole thing of you have these this management level.  It's a committee. And I mean, that's the sense I got.  It was very difficult. You know what?  I think you need to it's a very tough thing to do.  You need to do both foster the auteur, which I think they try to do with the 20 percent and so forth.  But at the same time, create an integrated product that doesn't scare that doesn't scare people and also doesn't leave things behind.  And there's so much stuff that's Google's acquired that they've never integrated.  That's maybe those are opposite needs. I don't know.  They do seem like they foster the auteur.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's every signal this year that they're going to buy more if they were close to getting four square.  There's a lot of things out there to buy, which leads to another question.  What do you think? Why?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's let's go through Kevin Kelleher in Giga has a Google to do list for 2010.  Maybe we could go through these and see what you think is one is make me make me click on display ads.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, this is kind of from a business perspective. Right.  What Google needs to do in order to make a lot of money. Right.  This is the list. I disagree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I say throw out display ads. We know they don't work.  It's not an effective strategy.  There's got to be a better way than display ads.  Number two, forget hardware.  This is exact opposite of what Google's doing with the Nexus one.  Focus on the Android market.  I do agree that Android market really needs some fixing.  If your app store is not competitive with Apple's app store, you do have a problem.  I know we're going towards web apps and so forth, but you've got to have an app store that's easy to use,  that's got compelling applications in it, that the apps aren't like buggy and crashy.  You've got to do something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Once again, doesn't that go back to your integration point that if that's the way Android operates,  it's the way the Chrome OS should operate. Right.  But that's not what I hear. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're not going that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, so that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Finally, he says make enterprises pay.  Ask Eric Schmidt what second act Google has planned to supplement search,  and he's likely to mention Google apps.  He calls the enterprise market the next billion dollar opportunity with apps leading the way.  How important is enterprise to Google?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the only other revenue stream they can see.  They're 98% advertising and Schmidt loves that.  But the board says, you know, damn it, diversify, find some diversification.  And enterprise is the one thing that they've talked about because even mobile is going to be an advertising based thing.  Web apps are never going to be a huge revenue stream.  So the only thing that's there is enterprise.  Is that the kind of business Google can really be in?  They're pumping it. They're advertising it.  Are they really ready for the enterprise?  I don't know. I'm, thank God, not an enterprise guy anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. Yeah.  It's never attracted me. I don't even understand it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it does. I'm not either.  So I should preface this by saying that.  But I think we're at a point where, you know, you start a company or you can have a smaller, medium sized company.  You just don't want to pay the IT guy to set up the exchange server anymore.  I mean, you just want to tackle, you know, spend your money in different places.  So I do think enterprise is probably a revenue stream for them.  But, you know, I was thinking, like, all Google needs is like one bad, like, breach, like data breach or security problem or information leak.  You know, like kind of what happened with AOL when they, well, I mean, AOL released that search data, you know, on purpose.  But it's not like Google hasn't had kind of minor embarrassing leaks of internal documents and stuff.  Right. So all Google needs is like kind of one event where, you know, user data is improperly revealed.  And I think that it's just kind of this the trust house of cards just kind of all falls down because the media will jump all over that.  And, you know, I just kind of feel like something is going to happen like that eventually.  Right. I mean, doesn't it happen to every company?  It seems inevitable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Has it ever happened to Salesforce or to Amazon Web Services?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question. I don't think so.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is a good question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can bet that they've got a lot of people making, working their butt off to make sure it doesn't happen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure the most brilliant minds in the business are worrying about Google security.  No doubt. But they're also the biggest target on the Internet.  Exactly. The biggest hackers out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I just bought a scale that tweets my weight and which is stupid.  But anyway, I did that. And among other things, it uploads to Google Health if you want it to.  And I thought, oh, I've never used Google Health. So I took a look at it and I thought, well, this is kind of interesting.  But I wonder what kind of adoption it's achieved because here this is ultimate trust.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the problem with Google Health is that it's not about us adopting it.  It's about the health industry adopting it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's one thing for me to put everything in there.  And I have very little. Well, one thing I know is I would love to download my health data.  But the very limited choices of who will let you download health data into Google Health.  So you're right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Another way to look at this enterprise thing is what I've been arguing they should be doing in the news business is rather than trying to make friends with big old newspapers,  they should create the very open framework that enables anybody to do news.  And I think that enterprise can in essence be that it's the very open framework that lets anybody do business.  And if they thought like that, you know, it's a Microsoft killer.  It's it's a revenue stream because it's got to have professional support.  I think there's opportunity there. But, you know, the funny thing about Google is the one hand, people say, oh, it's a one trick pony.  All it is a search. Of course, it's really two tricks.  It's searching, advertising. And on the other hand, you could say, well, that'd be just distracting as hell.  And that's trying to stretch out too far. I don't know strategically what I do.  But I think that there is a way that Google is big enough now and has enough services in there.  But the problem is they're all messy. They don't feel professional.  Not that Microsoft is a very odd view of professional.  It means confuse the hell out of yourself and scratch your head a lot trying to figure out what Bill means.  But Google has another flavor of that.  And I think if you compare it to something like Salesforce, that really knows how to serve a business and what a business needs.  And they're in the guts and brain of a business to do that.  I don't know if that's in Google's DNA to do that or not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we're agreed that's one area that Google will expand in 2010 is enterprise.  That does seem like a good place for Google to go. Yeah. Yeah.  What else? OK, let's talk about Google acquisitions.  What are their acquisitions? It seems like Google's done a lot of location based applications and it hasn't really done anything well with location.  I'm sure one of the reasons they bought Jaiku was because that was an early player in locations based applications and they got the two principals there,  Yuri and Petri, to come in as engineers.  And I would expect them to be working on location.  But if Google Latitude is the best Google can do with location, that's a little disappointing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And they could have had Foursquare. They just pissed off the founders of Foursquare.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that what happened? So they came close and they...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, in the sense that the people who created Foursquare created...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Dodgeball. That's right. They chased them away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're right. They had Dodgeball and they didn't do anything with it.  And yet it's very clear with Google Goggles and in general, the Google...the location is huge for Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what has been a really successful acquisition by Google?  You know, that's the hard... AOL killed companies, Yahoo killed companies. They've all done it.  We watched things like the founder of Feedburner is now at Twitter as CEO.  A lot of people have left. Is it possible to be acquired by Google and be happy?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe not, huh? Blogger was a successful acquisition, but Ev went on and left. Most of the team left, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Was Google Analytics an acquisition? Yeah, that was an acquisition.  Wasn't it from Adaptive Path? Yeah. Was that...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know how much of that team survived. I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe that's the greatest management challenge they have. They cannot do it all themselves.  They've proven they can't do it all themselves in certain areas like social, like the location apps.  But acquiring, though it looks easier, maybe in fact be more challenging.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even what would arguably be their most high profile acquisition, YouTube, hasn't been a success in the sense that they've monetized it yet.  They're on the verge. They're on the verge. Is it going to be, Jeff, that they get the networks to start using it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where it's going to... The interesting battle that's on just this week,  we have Fox was threatening to pull its stations from Time Warner and other cable operators, demanding a dollar a month per subscriber.  And to me, that's News Corp just trying to eke out the last drops of milk from dying Bessie the Cow here.  Because what it's really going to do, I think, is it's going to increase the cost of cable. Those fees will get shared.  They will then get passed on to users. Users will scream. The FCC will come in and finally demand a la carte TV.  And that will kill all kinds of cable channels that are subsidized by bundles now.  Long-winded way to get back to the point here. I think that Hulu and YouTube then become even better positioned to be the future of television.  And News Corp knows it too, since they, you know, co-founded Hulu.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. But I think that they want to use Hulu rather than YouTube. I think they want to do... Hulu is the model.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, it is. But YouTube has too much audience to ignore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got the audience, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's what you said before we got on the air, quote-unquote air here, that you were talking to somebody and as Eve was dropping, that you're getting new viewers on now that we have video up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Putting Twig on YouTube, I think, has actually increased the audience considerably.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the key there. So that's the beauty of what YouTube did, was it got the huge audience. That's what it has to be reckoned with now.  And it'll figure out the models to go around.  But to your point about integration or acquisition of YouTube, it's not integrated at all. It is a separate company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. I'm looking at the list. This is actually a great list on Wikipedia, thanks to the chat room for pointing me to the list of acquisitions by Google.  First acquisition, Deja News, which became Google Groups, right?  Then Blogger in 2003, Deja News was 2001. Outride, Nectonic Software, Applied Semantics, CalTix, Sprinks, Genius Labs, Ignite Logic, Baidu, that was the Chinese search engine.  Picasa, that was a good acquisition. They've done well with that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My goodness, that was a good acquisition.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know if they're making money on it, but it's given them really a very credible entry in the photo sharing space.  Zipdash, Where To, Keyhole, there's a good acquisition. That gives them all the maps of Google Earth.  Urchin for the web analytics. Dodgeball, Rick Wireless, Current Communications Group, Android was an acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? It was?  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  It's my memory that Android wasn't very far along when they acquired it.  Wow, I forgot that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or never knew it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. A lot of companies nobody ever heard of.  DMARC, MeasureMap, Upstartle, Last Software, Orion, TwoWebNevin, YouTube was 2006, JotSpot.  Oops. That one didn't go so well. Just going through. DoubleClick. DoubleClick went well.  DoubleClick's important.  That's a very important part of the puzzle.  FeedBurner. $100 million for FeedBurner. Grand Central, $45 million. I love Google Voice, but it's still not public.  Postini, that basically kind of helped fuel Gmail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the behind the scenes ones where they got Teams for good costs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Infrastructure, yeah. ReCAPTCHA, AdMob, we don't know yet if that's going to be very valuable. They bought that last month or two months ago.  Gizmo, they bought a couple of months ago.  You know, if you look at these, there is a little method to the madness.  They bought a lot of infrastructure for search.  Then they kind of started doing some interesting things around ad sales and advertising.  But of late, the 2009 acquisitions, ON2, that was video compression.  ReCAPTCHA, I don't know why they bought that.  AdMob, that makes sense. AdMob was doing very well in the iPhone ad space.  Gizmo, I guess maybe they, I don't know why they would buy Gizmo.  Terascent, which was more online advertising.  And AppJet, which is Etherpad. Those were their acquisitions in 2009.  None of those, could you say, really made much of a difference yet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They were light on acquisitions in 2009. They're going to get heavy again in 2010.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  2008 was even lighter. They only bought two things in 2008.  Wow.  Yeah. Two things I never heard of. Omnisio, which is online video.  That went to YouTube, I guess more infrastructure.  And TNC, Tatter & Company.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Weblog software.  I don't even know. What's TextCube.com?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's what they say it turned into.  Text, oh, it's Chinese or Korean.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's Korean, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Korean. Connection through content creation.  So boy, 2008 was even weaker.  So this is the year that they go crazy, I guess, with buying stuff.  And I think there's such a huge risk with Google trying to absorb a lot of more stuff.  I'd sure like to see them retrench maybe a little bit and try to make sense of what they've got.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You think there's any chance they're going to try to buy Twitter or Facebook or something big?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They don't have anything like that, do they?  I mean, they have or could.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That went well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was internal. That was internally developed.  It's huge in what is it, Brazil? It's huge somewhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Brazil, I think it was also big in India, but now I think it's getting beaten in India by others.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny. It just shows you for a long time, they used to say the first mover advantage.  And I always thought that was a little suspect.  And I think if you look at social media, Friendster or Cut, both of which predated Facebook.  Facebook, right time, right place and somehow did something magic.  It wasn't the first mover by any means. And you see that time and time again, actually.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just joined VKontakte today, the Russian one.  You have expected.  I bet Yuri Milner, who's the guy who invested in Facebook, who got the huge investment.  He's also a big investor in VKontakte.  And they have an English version of sorts, but I can't make any friends there because I don't even understand the alphabet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you think about it though, somebody said this in the chat room, it's true.  Google might be the only company that could figure out how to monetize Twitter and Facebook.  They might actually have something intelligent to do.  All right, we've got a lot of tweets. I know, Gina, you got a ton of tweets from listeners who have ideas.  Before we do that, I just want to show you one thing.  If you go to Google.com on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and still if you go today,  and without entering anything at all, just press I'm feeling lucky.  Google will do a crappy little JavaScript fireworks display just for you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's very 1999. I did it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is so 1999. I'm surprised they don't have snowflakes falling.  In fact, it's not even well done. It overlaps. It's like, this is so crappy. Come on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If we're in HTML5, it'd be good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, maybe for all I know it is, but it doesn't.  You'd think they could do something a little more interesting.  I did test it though. It goes forever. Just in case you're curious. It never stops.  It just keeps on going.  All right, Gina, you tweeted earlier asking people, what should Google do in 2010?  I have some too. I tweeted as well. I've got quite a few responses.  Do you want to go through a few of them?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. I think my favorite of all the responses I got was from at Luke.  He said, I want an implant chip that projects search results onto my eyeball when I pointed at something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Heads up display. That's what I want.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Heads up display inside the eyeball. I like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm with you on that one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Got a lot of iPhone users wanting Google Goggles and wanting Google Voice  and wanting turn-by-turn maps on the iPhone, which were pretty much all of Android's advantages over the iPhone.  A few people mentioning they want a tablet.  I suppose an Android tablet.  Gizmodo reported this week that HTC is working on an Android tablet with Google.  That'll be interesting to see and how it compares to the mythical Apple tablet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Hold right there.  An Android tablet as opposed to a Chrome OS netbook?  Yeah. I know. Does it make sense?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's touch. That'll be touch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's a big difference between Android and Chrome OS.  Chrome OS is just a browser. Android has apps.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why I keep coming back to that. I'm very confused by that strategically.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because you could have a big phone or a little computer. Right?  And who's to say what the difference is?  Right. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's in their interest to get past this idea of the phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We have to get past the idea that what we're carrying around is a phone. It's not. It's a computer.  It's an incredible computer. It's always connected. But it has all the power of computer stuff.  Because that's where Google is going to really win.  And if we keep on thinking of it as a phone, that's too limiting.  So anyway, I'm sorry. I'll get off this horse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I'm with you. In fact, I was hopeful that Google would actually completely disintermediate the wireless industry.  I mean, Google could. It's the only company that could do this.  But could if it had got some spectrum. Still could, I guess, as an MVNO.  Just kind of destroy the wireless industry.  And I don't think there's anybody who would shed a tear over that.  Except maybe the people who run Sprint and T-Mobile and AT&T and Verizon.  I mean, it would be a very interesting play.  Because then the freemium system really works. If you control.  I mean, maybe also that's when the Department of Justice shuts them down.  But if you can control the distribution, you know, give away a phone.  And then it seems to me this is just such an obvious model.  They may just be scared that it's just too monopolistic.  At this point, I feel bad for Google because I think they are now at this point.  They're large enough now that they have to tread very carefully with regulation.  They're seeing that in the EU, of course.  What about Wave, Gina? What's 2010 going to bring Wave?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, lots of people are hoping for Gmail integration with Wave.  I mean, I think people want Wave to be something, you know, really useful.  It's not right now. So people are saying, I heard from a lot of folks saying,  I want Wave to integrate with Gmail.  I want Wave to, you know, be something that, you know, that I really, really want to use right now.  It just seems like kind of a fun toy with an interesting promise.  I mean, obviously, I really hope that Wave does well in 2010.  And I think it's going to. I wouldn't have written the book if I didn't.  But it'll be interesting to see how that happens.  I think Gmail integration would be a really good way for Wave to get in front of a lot of eyeballs.  And get people playing with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Hexvox says. He says, I want an option in Gmail to have Google Wave be the default client.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that would be sweet.  Although, you know, the way folks are kind of opposed to, you know, they kind of are like,  ah, email, you know, spam, and it's so old and we're doing a whole new thing.  I hope they can kind of get over that and work in some sort of integration that, you know,  pushes the new protocol forward, but still gives people, you know, that degrades gracefully, you know,  that gives people who want to just use email some sort of option to communicate via Wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  McCant says, I want to see as an educator, I'd like to see Google develop a learning management system  because Blackboard is so terrible.  There's Moodle, which I actually like quite a bit.  That's an open source learning management system.  I could see Google acquiring Moodle and using that to make something more powerful.  They already acquired. What's the name? Oh, crap.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You mentioned a few minutes ago, the Wiki company that they acquired.  Jotspot. Jotspot. Thank you, Jotspot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess you could do it with Jotspot. Sure. I use PB Wiki for my classes.  Yeah. In fact, that would be, you know, you mentioned enterprise,  but there's a whole other category that they could do, I think, quite well in is education and schools.  You know, Google Docs. I'm sure a lot of schools are using Google Docs and interested using Google Docs.  Has Google made any outreach to education?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. They bragged about how many universities are now using Docs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. Because that's why I think that would be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Once again, I don't think they're packaging it as well as they could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think a number of universities are at least testing Gmail instead of the traditional email server.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A number have gone over to it. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I would like to see Google really focus on that. I think Google could do a great job with it.  And there's a lot of reasons to do that. You want to win over young people.  So, you know, Apple and Microsoft both fought that battleground trying to get young people using those computers  as they, you know, grew up so that they'd be fans when they did grow up.  I mean, I think that's where Google should be aiming right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think you can go beyond this and change the very structure of how we educate.  And that's, you know, getting a little too highfalutin here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think that's exactly what Google should do.  That's what Google has the power to do. Exactly. I mean, Apple's making little noises.  And Apple with iTunes U has in a very subtle way kind of encouraged universities to start publishing courseware,  publishing lectures, and it is a little bit undermining the model for universities.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we go to a model of a lot more star lecturers and then local tutors.  Yes, I'm with you on that.  And that will happen in the sense of, I think, university classes.  If you want a great physics class, you'll get the lecturer from MIT,  and then you'll have somebody around here who can explain what the hell it means to me.  I'm about to, I think, join the board of reading for blind and disabled.  And what I've learned there is that I think almost 90 percent of their client base is not blind,  but has learning disabilities of various sorts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Fascinating. And what it really amounts to at some level is a form of tutoring.  And so there are new tutoring platforms, things like that, that you have,  if you dissect education into its core components of the information, books, whatever,  the explication, lectures, and then the education, the tutoring,  I think Google could do amazing things of creating a new structure around that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a huge opportunity there.  My dad, who's a college professor, for a long time, I think,  thought that the future of the university was almost in a way the past of the university.  Universities originally were kind of collegial in the Middle Ages,  collegial environments for scholars to get together and discuss.  And it was much less hierarchical, much less teacher-student.  And he's of the same opinion, going along the lines of what you talked about, Jeff,  that the lectures are distributed universally, globally,  from the best lecturers in the world who give the lecture once,  and it's recorded and distributed.  And then these small collegial environments spring up, which are really more discussion groups.  It's kind of an Oxford model.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oxford, exactly.  What did your dad teach?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Earth Sciences, he's a professor of geology.  He retired about 10 years ago.  Yeah, I think he's, it's funny, we've had this discussion for literally for 15 years  about what would happen to the university.  And it's getting more and more clear that the current university model,  I get in trouble when I talk about this.  Don Tapscott really got in trouble when he wrote his article saying the universities are dead.  But it really does seem that universities are, and as you and I, Jeff,  have kids who are going off to very expensive universities next year, God willing,  you have to kind of ask the question, is this really the best thing for a kid to spend the next four years doing?  What would be the best thing to do in the new world?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think it's worse than that, Leo, is that I get pangs of guilt saying that, you know,  have I wasted the last four years of my son's time and the next four years to come?  Is the system that we have the best or not?  My daughter, who was a wonderful writer, I now read what she puts into schools because they tell her to.  I read her assignment yesterday, and it was a long, big assignment,  and it told you to do it in three paragraphs.  The paragraphs were this big.  You know, the paragraphs were just three paragraphs, damn it.  Only three?  It made no sense.  You just stamp the kids out as if they're on an assembly line, and it's just wrong for the Google age.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and who better to reinvent this than Google?  I wonder if they've got anybody thinking along these lines.  Or maybe, again, I hope Google is not getting gun shy, worrying about getting government regulators involved.  I hope not.  They have this great opportunity, but they may have many great opportunities, don't they?  Google says Gibran-Namia, Gibran-Ramia, I'm sorry, Gibran.  Google should start making TVs for free.  Eventually, every company in the world will be run out of business by Google.  It's true, though.  They could do freemium or cheaper than for less than free of a lot of things, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised that Google hasn't gotten into, like, project management app or like a task.  I mean, there's Gmail tasks, but it's still really kind of limited.  It's terrible.  It's useless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a lab feature.  Yeah.  They should hire you and Merlin and do a decent task manager.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I really think it's kind of needed, some sort of organization app, productivity app.  It seems like this big gaping hole in their offerings, especially if they want to go enterprise.  I mean, with Outlook, the three things you have, a calendar, email, notes, and to do, and they don't really...  They don't do anything.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gmail tasks isn't quite...  I should know this, but I don't.  They don't manage tasks within Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just a list.  One, two, three, four, five with a checkbox.  That's it.  That's it.  There's no productivity features at all.  No, I don't think...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But you mean, Jeff, were you asking how do they manage projects within Google, within the company?  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, internally.  Oh, internally, I'm sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's an excellent question.  They must have something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  An excellent question.  Well, the rare moments when I visit, I try to stick my nose up over the hidden area so you can see the screens and whiteboards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's whiteboards is how they manage tasks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's it.  Put it on a whiteboard.  I think they erased the big whiteboard that they had about world domination.  Remember that?  In the lobby of one of the buildings, it was like a 100-foot long whiteboard that was like  the business plan.  It was hysterical because people would write...  The kind of things we're talking about right now, let's see, dominate the network television  industry.  The surf was on there, a lot of people, and I think they got rid of it.  It should be a shame.  I hope they took lots of pictures before they did.  Evidence.  Yeah, evidence.  Maybe that's why.  They didn't want the DOJ to come in.  Discoverable.  C.C.  Heath on Twitter says Google should buy Spotify.  Should they get in the music business?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw folks say that they should not only buy it but make it free.  Make it free.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's not going to happen.  Google is not the destroyer of industries.  That's not their aim, is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's the point you raised, I think, last time, Leo, when you said, oh my God,  it's a revolution.  No, that's not their aim, but what happens...  Side effects.  Google abhors waste.  The internet abhors middlemen.  When you let the internet do what it's supposed to do, and if you enable it to do what it's  supposed to do, which is what Google specializes in, you are going to kill middlemen, and you  are going to kill the waste that went into their pockets.  It's going to stay in the marketplace.  And so everything gets cheaper.  If not free, cheaper.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's a good one.  I don't know why Google never did this.  Hello D. Lo says Google should do a job board.  There's no Google jobs thing, is there?  That's a very lucrative sector in the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to put the last nail in the coffin of the newspaper business.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They don't get it.  Rupert, what they're doing is they're dangling this over Rupert's head.  We still haven't done a job board.  They will soon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They'll have real estate up on local.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are they going to do real estate?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have to.  You're going to see, if I'm going to look at my world around me and say, oh, that place  is for sale.  It's inevitable.  It's data that's already up there online.  All they have to do is curate it and present it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Acquire Zillow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  I love Zillow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Zillow's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had someone say...  I went to a meeting of realtors, and realtors generally hate me because I said that they're  middlemen and they're not worth 6%.  Right.  But they had me at their meeting.  And Zillow was there.  What I didn't realize is Zillow is very Google-like.  If you come in and start pricing your home and seeing what your home is worth and what  your neighbor's homes are worth, guess what?  The odds are you're going to be selling your home.  Oh.  So Zillow knows homes that are going to go on the market before they go on the market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh.  Isn't that cool?  That's smart.  Intent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Predicting intent.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's all intent.  Predicting intent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Speaking of acquisitions, I had someone say, buy Fever, buy Skype, and buy Zoho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think about them buying Skype?  What is Fever?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Fever is an RSS reader that it's kind of an RSS reader with smarts.  It's an independently developed PHP.  RSS is dead.  Yeah.  I mean, it would kind of give Google reader smarts that it doesn't have.  Do you use readers still?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I stopped using reader.  I tried and tried.  It's over.  It's too much.  I use Twitter and FriendFeed to let me know what I should look at.  So RSS, wait, wait.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go back to that Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  RSS isn't dead.  I know Dave Weiner hates it when I say that.  Only Dave Weiner right now.  It's not dead.  It's an infrastructure though.  It's not, it's going to be, it's used.  We use it.  It's used for podcasts.  We use it for all the time, and it's going to be used in a lot of ways.  What I really should say, and I think what people mean when they say that is readers  are dead.  Aggregators are dead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like launching your RSS reader is not something people are going to do.  Jeff, do you read in RSS?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I, I got to tell you, what I actually read first is all my ego feeds.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because that's how that's, that brings it together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People will say something to you.  They'll say, Hey, Jeff, you should see this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So when it is valuable for the conversation and my ego, I use that.  I look at a few things because they're, it's just a convenient way to do it.  I read paid content in RSS because I like the formatting better probably than the site.  Other than that, no, I, I, you know, my RSS reader has a legacy of hundreds of feeds.  What will happen is on a quiet Sunday night, I'll end up going back through and seeing,  catching up with people, which I could do by going to their site.  It's a little easier doing the reader, but it's not, we're not really using it the  way it's meant to do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So no fever.  How about Skype?  Should Google, I don't think, should Google, Skype's proprietary.  I think Gizmo made sense because Gizmo is a SIP and is open standards.  Skype is such an unopened standard and it would be so expensive.  But Google already has Google voice as a VoIP, right?  As, yeah.  It's kind of weird VoIP.  It's very late in VoIP, but it, but it does have VoIP.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they even do have video on Android phones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use Fring.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does it work only on Wi-Fi or does it work on the, on the Teleco network?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good question.  That's a good question.  Probably.  I don't know.  That's a really good question.  That's a really good question.  On the iPhone, you could only use Skype on Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's limited.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  On Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a really good question.  Of course, Google voice works on, on Android.  Do I even have Skype on Android?  I don't see Skype on here.  I think I use Fring, which gives you an interface to your Skype.  Well, that's an interesting question.  I can't see Verizon allowing people to use Skype on its network.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Google wouldn't care.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, Google, that's exactly the kind of thing that you might see on a Nexus One that you would never see.  Right.  On a Verizon phone.  So they already have Gizmo.  What was the third one?  Zoho.  Zoho.  Do they need Zoho?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I mean, Zoho has a heck of a lot of products that Google doesn't, like Project Manager, CRM.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would let Zoho remain independent just so that you can say, hey, there's competition.  Yeah, exactly.  Same reason Microsoft didn't swallow Apple.  There's competition.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I like that there's competition for sure.  But Zoho does have some pretty cool stuff that could add to Google's enterprise offering.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  I wonder if they should buy Salesforce.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  CRM.  They don't do CRM.  But boy, that would be a natural for them.  Boy, would that be a natural.  I'd like to see that.  How about Steven F99 says elance.com.  Elance is a neat site.  I mean, talking about job sites, it's kind of the opposite of a job site.  You're a freelancer.  You post on there.  And if people need somebody to do, say, some graphics or web design or whatever, they go to elance.com and hire you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And in a post-employment world where we're all independent agents, that's what's going to take off.  And that's the infrastructural play for that change.  We all get fired.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Google be nicely poised.  It seems to me jobs and elance, that kind of thing, that's a really good place for Google to play.  Because again, intent.  Somebody starts haunting elance or haunting a jobs board.  You kind of know what they're up to.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if you make it so they don't buy Facebook, then they buy LinkedIn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  LinkedIn would be a great acquisition.  Because, yeah, better than Facebook.  Reid Hoffman would know how to navigate.  Yeah.  Well, Reid didn't read work for Google.  Where did he come from?  I forgot.  I've forgotten now.  Chrome OS tablet.  You mentioned that.  Let's see.  Any other good ideas here?  Google should design a home theater PC using Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brian K. Woodward says four words.  Refrigerator powered by Android.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm seeing some kitchen appliances powered by Android came up as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think when we were talking about Zillow, you said something that was really very interesting.  I guess this is something we've talked about before.  But the idea of what Google really wants to collect is intent.  Intent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is, keep that in mind at all times.  It's intent.  The more that they can predict what we want and give it to us before we even ask, the  better position they are in both from the content perspective, the service perspective,  and also especially from the advertising perspective.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What about Google killing the cable business?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody would complain about that.  Yay!

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I think we're seeing coming up.  Because look at this string now.  So you have News Corp getting up to a dollar a month per subscriber from places like Time  Warner.  Time Warner is going to pass that on.  Every other broadcaster is going to do it.  Cablevision, out my way, just dropped script stuff because there was a similar fight going  on.  So what's going to happen is the cable networks, which are now more desperate for advertising,  News Corp has basically surrendered advertising as a business.  And if you think about what they're doing with newspapers and paywalls and with MySpace  and NotPerforming and now with TV stations.  So that's going to make the cost of cable go up and up and up and up.  And go back to what we said about Hulu and YouTube.  I think they're perfectly positioned and cables the next big media play to disaggregate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  TJ Simmons would go one step further.  He says Google should turn on its dark fiber and give America cheap or free access to the  net.  Not only kill the cable industry, kill the internet service, do the whole thing.  I think they'd die to it away.  Gosh, that would be great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When they did own for about two hours when they were the lead bidder for that spectrum  at the auction, when the founders talked about it, they practically giggled maniacally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  They'd have all this bandwidth, wireless bandwidth.  Just say, hey, they're kind of doing that.  They're nudging along with the free Wi-Fi in the airports and free Wi-Fi in cities.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're going to look at prime directors of Google, one, as Gina said, is intent and  the other is the more people use the internet, the more Google benefits.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We get a sum percentage of everything as long as you're using the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the more ways we'd have you use the internet, phones, tablets, devices, whatever, and the  cheaper we can make it for you to use the internet and the more reasons we can give  you to use the internet, the better off we are because we are the internet.  We are Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the one thing I think Google should do in the new year is they should do exactly  what Gina Trapani did.  They should ask the public, what should we do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  That's a great idea.  Put it out to crowdsource it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tell us what to do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  Well, it's great.  We thank you all for all of the tweets and the feedback.  I think it's really fun, really interesting.  If you do a search on Twitter for pound twig or for at Gina Trapani, you'll see a lot of  those.  There's hundreds and hundreds of them.  And I like her and Ann-Rie's tweet.  He said Google should sponsor twig.  But I wouldn't take the money.  No, no, no, we wouldn't do that because there'd be no question that we'd.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Dang, that whole conflict thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Would you take it from Bing, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be pretty funny.  By the way, while you're searching, you might want to check out bing.com.  Then we would be completely objective, right?  We'd know we're objective.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You have a choice.  You have a choice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have a choice.  Use it.  All right, time for our tool number and our tip of the week.  Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.  Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a pretty cool tip.  I got this from my friends at Lifehacker.  One of the readers wrote in with this.  We all know that Google's suggest to drop down in the search box has gotten  really good lately.  And you can use it to kind of find alternatives for things if you use the V.S.  the versus shorthand.  So this worked really well with software, right?  So if you're looking for an alternative to iPhoto, say you just type into the  Google search box iPhoto space versus or V.S.  and you get kind of a drop down and you can see it.  And you can see it actually.  Leo is looking at screenshot now.  This is the Lifehacker article with Notepad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Text editors.  If you're like, hey, I like Notepad Plus, but I want to see something else.  What are other people using?  Type in Notepad Plus V.S.  And you kind of get this list of, you know, stuff that other alternatives to that  software.  It works very, very well for software alternatives.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this something Google did or is it just kind of an artifact of their predictions?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is totally just an artifact of search.  It's just, you know, people writing, writing about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So a lot of people have written articles about Google or let's see, I'm looking at  Photoshop, Photoshop versus Illustrator versus Gimp versus Lightroom.  And it does.  It really is a great job of giving you alternatives.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's just kind of a, you know, happy accident.  That's great.  Let's see.  So not that way.  And you can kind of use it for products, too, though it doesn't work as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Doesn't work for Twitter because I get Twitter instead.  Twitter versus Facebook, Twitter versus Facebook versus MySpace, Twitter versus RSS.  Well, this is kind of interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You do iPhone versus Blackberry, Droid, Android, Blackberry Storm, Prompey, Promprey.  It's kind of, it's kind of an interesting way to see what, you know, what people are comparing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I typed in Democrats versus the first one is Republicans.  The second one is wigs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I joined kontakta.ru, the choices for political stances included communist and monarchist.  Ah, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bring back the monarchy.  I'm in favor of it.  Very clever.  So just add VS to your searches.  It's so cool what you can do with Google's suggestions in general.  I just keep coming up with fun things.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you didn't hit it this week.  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I stayed well away.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  7.56, which is what Hitwise says was Facebook's market share on Christmas Eve versus 7.54 for Google.  What?  It makes it sound as if, my God, Facebook is bigger than Google.  But as search engine land, Barry Schwartz said, points out, Google is not just Google.  Google is Gmail and all kinds of other things.  And these numbers don't include that.  And we can obviously get results and get things like search suggestions without even going to Google.  Nonetheless, give Facebook their credit that they are now as big, at least as Google.com, for a day or two.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pretty exciting for Facebook, I guess.  Yeah.  Pretty amazing.  I guess everybody's posting pictures or wish.  I noticed on New Year's Eve, I got a lot of people saying, Happy New Year.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you see the video from November?  Married couples stood at the altar.  And as the minister was saying, husband and wife, the guy pulled out his computer or pulled out his iPhone and started changing his status.  So maybe on Christmas Eve, people were changing their status.  That's it.  That's it.  They got and who they were and all that stuff, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You just need an excuse, don't you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's life hacking.  I mean, it's life streaming.  It's part of your life, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody suggested we type in Tiger Woods versus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty normal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or Tiger Woods with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tiger Woods versus.  Yeah, with might be interesting.  My Google tool of the week is, as I mentioned earlier, Google Health, which I had never really paid much attention to until I got this Wi-Fi scale that tweets.  And posts my weight to Google Health.  So I kind of went to my Google Health account and I started putting stuff in because it's it's kind of cool.  I mean, it's a way to store things like drug interactions, conditions, medications, procedures.  What's missing, unfortunately, is the ability to import your medical records from a lot of places.  There's a few some drug stores.  Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts.  Harvard's Pilgrim Health Care.  But really, it's surprising the dearth of health insurance companies that let you import into Google Health.  And I think this would be of this is what's missing.  What a what a useful tool this would be.  And I'd like to encourage my health care provider, Kaiser, which is very computerized.  My doctor, when I go into the doctor, he doesn't look at me, just looks at his computer the whole time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you allowed to email your doctor?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am. And he responds like that.  Wow.  And no, they really are moving in that direction.  And of course, President Obama, this is part of his health care initiative is the the computerization of health care records, the portability of health care records.  Again, I think a lot of people go, I don't know if I want to tell Google that.  But I do think the there's a certain advantage to having this stored in a single place.  And and I like the idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Doc Searle's co-author of Clutrain is working on vendor relationship management, the counterpart to customer relationship management.  And and this is a key part of what he goes into.  He had an operation a while ago that he puts it as he and his doctor didn't make the best decision because they didn't have easy access to all their data.  Exactly.  And it's a it should be a right for us to have access to our own stuff.  And, you know, he said what you have is this huge paper file and you got to go rightfully through it and you can't find anything there.  And it's just it affects our own health.  It's this is not just about efficiency.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. I need to collate my information.  I want to know this stuff.  There are services that like this is kind of funny.  Your health by Unival, you fax them your paper medical records and and they say have expert nurses quickly and accurately convert them to a format that can be imported into your Google health profile.  You have to pay for it, of course.  That's a shame that they have to do that.  But I think, you know, there's something the sad thing is my Kaiser stuff.  I can go to Kaiser and I can see it all on my Kaiser page, but I want to get it into Google health because people change health care providers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google should institute kind of an I want my MTV camp.  Yeah.  Take this. I want my Google health and go to our doctors and demand it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. I just I think this is this is a huge potential, but a potential that's completely unrealized because of the lack of support from health care providers.  And maybe this is the time for all of us to say, Hey, doc, let me let me control my records.  I'd like to I'd like to store them in Google health.  Well, that's our show for the first episode of 2010.  I keep wanting to say 2010, 2010.  They got me every time I am going to put a little electrical buzzer in my seat.  Maybe I can train myself out of it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to get an Arduino advice.  Whenever you say it's my thousandth.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They get an Arduino.  Gina Tripani is online, of course, at her website, smarterware.org.  And you can read her on the places like the Harvard Business Review, Lifehacker.com.  And don't forget her book, which is now available online at complete Google wave.com.  No complete wave guide.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Complete wave guide.com.  Thanks, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got it once last week.  Oh, you did great.  Oh, well, complete wave guide.com.  Is it selling well?  It is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's doing real well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm very happy.  Six dollars.  Go buy it.  Just buy it.  Buy 10 of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got to get greedier.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm working on the print edition right now.  That'll be out this spring.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
