He's actually on a plane stuck somewhere over O'Hare Airport.  But good news is, of course, our very favorite Gina Trapani is here as always.  Hello.  From SmarterWear.org.  She's also the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave, a completewaveguide.com.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi.  How's it going?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Going really well.  You're not doing any traveling.  Only one of you is allowed to travel at the time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I try not to leave San Diego in the summer.  I don't blame you.  It's perfect here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perfect.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  And sitting in for Jeff, we're so happy to have Pete Cashmore, the man in charge at Mashable.com.  Hey, Pete.  How are you?  I'm really good.  How are you?  Great to talk to you.  Mashable is a great site for people who are following.  Would you say it's the new internet?  Is that your beat?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah.  We try to cover consumer internet.  So anything that's happening on the web, we got it covered, particularly social media  stuff, you know, Twitter, Facebook, all the social sites.  That's really our focus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the place.  It really is the place I go to find out what's going on online.  And in fact, you have your top story.  We're very happy about this.  I don't know how you feel.  Pete's from Scotland.  Was Scotland even in the World Cup?  No.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  So if you're Scottish, the tradition is to support anyone who's playing against England.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, good news.  England did qualify, but so did the US.  And by beating Algeria, thank goodness.  And according to this story, you've been watching the Akamai, or Adam actually has been watching  the Akamai Net Usage Index, it could set a new internet traffic record.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  There's also another game going on at the same time.  So it kind of doubled up on the traffic.  Is this people streaming the game or is it?  Because everyone's going online to check out what the buzz is on it right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At its peak, 11 million visitors per minute to the World Cup site.  Is that where they went?  The World Cup Hub?  I don't know.  That's pretty remarkable.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah, and everyone's tweeting about it.  It was 6% of tweets about that.  So it's pretty crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have a meter.  If you go to this site, they have a meter that says, you know, the world news consumption  and there's light, normal and heavy and it's pegged.  It went all the way to 11.  190% above normal.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, and of course, it's causing Twitter to go down quite a lot these past weeks.  Oh, what a surprise.  So that's more problems for them.  What a shock.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Their status blog was down today.  You're kidding.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's a Tumblr blog.  So it's really must have been Tumblr getting a lot of, but yeah, I tried to check the status  and it was like, not available.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Talk about a cascading effect.  So Twitter's down so people go to the status blog because they've learned now that you  go to the status blog and they bring that down.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It started linking to the status blog from the like, Farewell page.  That's probably what it was.  The Tumblr couldn't cope with that sudden rush of people coming from the Farewell page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they need a status blog for the status blog.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you need to put that on Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody with a lot of bandwidth.  That's pretty amazing.  I've never seen Tumblr go down.  That seems kind of unusual.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, me neither.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they're pretty reliable.  They may get a little bit of a brain drain soon.  I see that this is kind of interesting.  Postorous, which I love a lot, was originally, it's a Y Combinator startup, pretty well financed.  P-O-S-T-E-R-O-U-S dot com.  And I started using them when I was in China because you could email posts.  So you could use an iPhone to mail a picture because I couldn't get to Flickr from China,  Facebook from China, or Twitter from China, but I could always get to Postorous.  And then you can send, so you email to Postorous and then Postorous feeds out to your other  social media sites.  So I never thought of as a blog or an endpoint.  I always thought of as a pipeline.  But apparently they would like to become the next endpoint.  They'd like to be Tumblr.  In fact, they say over the next 15 days, Postorous is going to announce a different service daily  that you can transfer your account from.  So today it's Ning.  So what you do is you enter your Ning credentials in at Postorous dot com and it sucks everything.  Video, audio, pictures, it posts and makes a Postorous page with everything automatically.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But Ning and Postorous are kind of different, right?  I mean, Ning is like...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an interesting choice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Those are not two services that I would have said, oh yes, I should transfer from one to  the other.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ning might be vulnerable because they recently decided to charge.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, definitely.  Low hanging fruit, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Postorous is free, but you got to think that the next one is Tumblr because that's the  most direct competition.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I really, I love Tumblr.  I've been using Tumblr for a while.  Me too.  I can see your reasoning though in China for wanting to email.  Yeah, I got in a Tumblr pretty early and I just never tried Postorous, although it seems  to be very popular.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do Tumblr and Postorous and in fact I was having Postorous update Tumblr.  So I was using Postorous completely as plumbing, almost like Yahoo pipes kind of.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I want a workflow diagram from you, Leo, for like all the places where you actually input  your status updates and blog posts and then all the places where they pipe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's impossible.  I tried once.  I sat down with OmniGraffle and I started and there's so many loops and infinite circles  and oh, it was terrible.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was terrible.  You should have one of your fans do it.  Kind of go through all your sites and figure out what's posted.  Who posts to what?  And then yeah, Google Docs is a good drawing tool.  You don't even need OmniGraffle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you really just draw it.  Do you ever have that problem, Pete, with just like you've got too many presences online?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  You know what?  I just go to them manually and do them that way.  I remember Scoble did that for a while.  He linked them all up and he'd end up with dupes coming through when it went through  one system and into another.  Oh yeah, he'd make some enemies real fast that way.  It's kind of not ideal.  It's kind of slightly annoying.  And really, I don't know, the big ones are really Facebook and Twitter for us.  So we just, from Ashable at least, we just focus on manually updating all those things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait, you're huge on Buzz.  You're the number one subscribed to feed on Buzz.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Huge.  We use Buzz still.  It's not top of mind for us, I don't think, at this current time.  I think it's a little bit of sheen.  We're getting a lot less engagement.  It kind of drops after the initial hype.  So for us, Facebook's a big growth place for us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It might be, to be honest, it might be, I was following you on Buzz and what was happening  is it was basically a feed of Mashable.  And I already get Mashable in my RSS reader, so I actually unfollowed you because it wasn't  about engagement.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  So what we do on a lot of those is we ask questions.  I love that.  So we kind of engage the audience around it.  One of the problems when we do that on Buzz is it completely floods everyone's feeds with  the replies.  So it's kind of a catch-22 for us with Buzz.  But we're definitely trying to do that engagement piece where we ask questions.  It works really well for us on Facebook when we don't just kind of update with headlines  because we're doing it manually anyway.  So it's not like it's actually a feed going in so we can do whatever we want with those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an interesting, yeah, that was actually probably what happened to me following Mashable  on Buzz was not so much the number of posts but the engagement.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Are you still using it actively though?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you like reading up on it?  In fact, I don't tweet anymore.  I buzz and then use Buzz to tweet, to tweet.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Did you get rid of your Facebook account ever?  And Facebook's dead to me.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And really, literally, it's dead to me.  I'm going to Foo Camp this weekend and Dave Recorden's going to be there and I think Dave  Morin and I don't know if I will be shunned, but I would love to engage in a dialogue.  You know the thing that put me over the top, I was talking about this on Net at Night  on Tuesday, they just did one thing that really pissed me off which was take all my interests  and make me join groups with those interests.  I just, public groups, I thought that was just, and there was no way out of it.  I thought that was unforgivable.  It was like-

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  We had the option to delete them all there.  Yeah, thank you.  And through your options.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, later.  I could go back and delete them, right?  But for a moment they'd be public.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, I think the choice was basically we'll delete them or you can make them public and  and that was part of a string of issues they had around that privacy stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know, you think I'm crazy?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I think from, you got to do what you want to do.  I think you're definitely, Facebook is really a big opportunity for you personally and for  Twitter and it's your call if you think they've got some kind of ethical issue that's completely  up to you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're saying this is very valuable to you.  See, there's two prongs to this.  For me, there's the personal disconnect that I really feel blackmailed with because there  is nothing to replace Facebook.  So all those people who were connecting with me socially, my old girlfriends, old friends  and stuff, I had to disconnect from.  So that was one, that was painful and you're absolutely right from a business point of  view.  Although it's my opinion that's less detrimental because there are lots of other ways we engage  with our audience besides Facebook.  We can put ourselves out there and frankly, I don't want to appeal to Facebook users.  To me it's like-

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Facebook users is everybody now though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's too bad.  It's like AOL.  I don't want to appeal to everybody.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah, your audience Leo is pretty savvy and they're more likely to be on Twitter or  Buzz or on the blog or an IRC for example than Facebook.  So I think it's probably less of a lost opportunity for Twitter.  But for Mashable it seems like a no brainer.  There's no way.  I mean that Mashable couldn't be on Facebook.  I think it's important that there's someone in the tech community who did what you did  and kind of made a point of it and is going to have a conversation.  I think that's good.  And you know, food poop camp is one of those kind of contexts where you can have kind of  an off the record frank discussion.  You know what I mean?  I'd be interested to know how that goes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll have to tell you off the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's true.  I was going to say, is it ever off the record with you, Leo?  I don't know.  No.  No.  Are you going to bring your broadcasting stick?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The first time I got invited to food camp a couple of years ago, I said, great, can  I bring my microphone?  And they said, what?  No.  And they uninvited me.  And then the second time I didn't respond fast enough.  So this time I said, because I work weekends, I have a job.  So I'm going to have to take the radio show off and it's a big deal.  But I really wanted to go, partly because I did want to engage with these guys.  Do you think that Facebook's benign and then you just got kind of caught in the crossfire?  They misunderstood what they were doing?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Me?  Yeah.  I think Facebook does what's in Facebook's business interests and occasionally that's  not necessarily in the interests of the user.  Yeah.  That seems pretty obvious.  You know, and I think they maybe did cross the line, particularly with that privacy  last year where it was, you know, that dialogue box that kind of popped up and was like, hey,  we're about to set all your stuff to public.  You do this.  Which is a little bit kind of pushing it.  But I think they'll, you know, I really think the mainstream users don't necessarily either  understand or mind too much the stats that they're showing in terms of growth.  They didn't really experience it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, obviously not.  And that's exactly why I don't feel like it's good for me to promote it.  Because I have a lot of, you know, believe it or not, because of the radio show, I have  a huge number of over a million listeners to the radio show every week who are not geeks  or lesser geeks.  And I don't feel like it's right to encourage them.  I was more concerned about them.  People like you and me and, you know, the listeners of this show, they know better.  They know how to use Facebook without getting in trouble.  I'm not worried about them.  Oh, anyway, enough.  I think we should talk about Google.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Let's talk about Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about Google.  So it looks like Google's won its case against Viacom.  This just came out 23 minutes ago.  This is from the official Google blog.  Today the court granted our motion for summary judgment.  In Viacom's lawsuit with YouTube, that means the court has decided that YouTube is protected.  This is such good news, not just for Google, but in general, that YouTube is protected  by the safe harbor of the DMCA against claims of copyright infringement.  It validates the safe harbor rule, which is critical.  The choice, really, of the court was to treat YouTube as a common carrier or as a publisher.  And if they're a publisher, if they're responsible for the content on YouTube, that's a problem.  With 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, there are not enough people in the world to  vet all this content.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  That's huge.  Really important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pete, you must have known about this because your finger's on the pulse.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's awesome news, actually.  I was kind of surprised that it did resolve in that way.  Obviously, everyone's on the side of YouTube there.  But it was kind of, I don't know, sometimes these court battles seem to go the wrong way  just because of lack of understanding about the new technologies.  We saw it in Europe, and I don't know if that one was resolved.  Do you remember the Italian situation where there was like a video?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Three YouTube executives are going to go to jail, as far as I can tell.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  If they go to Europe, yeah, go to Italy.  So, I don't know, sometimes they're a bit backward, but I'm glad that at least the US  is seeing the light on that one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  YouTube says, actually, it's Kent Walker, Vice President and General Counsel of Google.  This is an important victory not just for us, but for the billions of people around  the world who use the web to communicate and share experiences with each other.  This is the kind of rhetoric I often hear from companies.  Our victory is your victory.  But in this case, I think it's kind of true.  We're excited about this decision and look forward to renewing our focus on supporting  the incredible varieties of idea and expression.  Millions of people post and watch on YouTube every day around the world.  This one case, you know, they might actually be true.  Now there's an ongoing court case which is getting worse for Google, and this is the  Street View issue, the collection of data from unencrypted Wi-Fi hotspots.  It started in Germany.  The EU is upset, and now the State Attorney General in Connecticut says, we're investigating,  and he hopes that 30 other state attorneys general will participate in this.  This is getting worse for Google.  There's no way Google loses this case.  This one's pretty straightforward because there's clearly no intent to use this stuff.  It was the default setting on Kismet, the software that they were using.  There's no valuable information, and most importantly, there's no demonstrable damage  to the people who are suing, and you can't sue unless there's damage.  But it sure is a blow to Google and the court of public opinion.  Go ahead, Jan.  I was going to say, I mean, have they figured out, I mean, what law did they bring?  Have they figured out what law they're looking for?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Maybe that's what they're looking for.  What is the, you know, besides, what did they say, violating a reasonable expectation of  privacy?  I mean, there wasn't any demonstrable damage.  Was it France that the government who started looking through the data and found that, you  know, they found some passwords that had been transmitted?  That's right.  Sometimes people transmit passwords over their wireless network when they log in.  Stupidly.  And they kind of, you know, flipped out about that.  Google wasn't collecting passwords, and it was like fragments of usernames and passwords,  and you know, as the street view cars rolled by.  I don't know, this seems like such a weird thing for people.  There's no law.  I just want someone to say, they broke this law, and this is how they did it.  And no one's been able to say that yet, but everyone's getting all up in arms, and we're  going to keep investigating.  So it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talked, you know, we always talk about this with Jeff because he's a, you know, this  is what his new book, Public Parts, is about, and he's kind of up on what's going on in  Germany and how the Germans feel about all of this.  I got an email from somebody who said, you know, you often act as if it's the Germans  who don't like this.  He says it's a few German legislators, court people.  A lot of us listen to this week in Google in Germany, and believe me, we don't have  a problem with street view.  It's government that has a problem with street view.  So, enough of that.  I think that they will see victory, but it sure is.  I think people who don't know better are seeing this as another example of Google violating  their privacy.  We're going to take a break.  We've got Pete Cashmore from Mashable with us, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  We're talking about Google in the cloud.  Before we go too much farther, though, I want to talk about a great way to do meetings in  the cloud.  Online meetings with GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting is a fantastic product from Citrix.  It has simply put the easiest way to meet online.  I can understand.  A lot of people believe that the best way to meet is in person, and I understand that.  But believe me, you can't always meet in person, especially nowadays where we're doing business  all over the world.  GoToMeeting can take a conference call, which is kind of a necessary evil, and make it something  visual, engaging, as powerful as meeting in person.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  That's a $49 value.  With it, you will get unlimited meetings, as many meetings as you want, as often as you  want, plus absolutely free teleconferencing through VoIP or phone.  And I use it on my iPad.  It's so cool.  There's a free iPad app.  Here's how easy it is.  You're going to go to GoToMeeting.com right now.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  You'll have the software installed in 30 seconds.  Just a little tiny Java program.  And now, the next time you want to have a meeting, it integrates with Outlook and so  forth, so you can send an invitation very easily through the mail.  Or even while you're on the phone in a conference call, you can say, I'd like to show you this,  and give them the meeting ID, a little nine-digit number.  They just go to the website, enter that ID, and suddenly, 30 seconds later, they're seeing  your screen on their computer.  Not only that, they can flip it around and show you their screen on your computer.  So it's great for training, collaborating, as well as sales.  128-bit SSL encrypted end-to-end.  So Google Street View will not see your meeting.  You're completely safe.  I love GoToMeeting.  We use it all the time.  I know you will, too.  Try it free.  Do me a favor.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  So Dell announced this.  Well, you know what?  The big story.  We should talk about the big story.  We should.  What is it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  DroidX, right?  Oh, I was going to say voice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But okay.  Okay, voice is a big story, too.  Okay, we'll do DroidX, then we'll do voice.  Okay, let's do that.  Those are both, you know what?  Huge.  I buried the lead again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Damn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the Motorola DroidX, the announcement was today, and they say July 15th, it'll be available,  It's just like every other smartphone.  It is a big phone.  It is a 4.3-inch screen.  Kind of reminds me of the Evo a little bit.  Although it's bigger, I think, than the Evo.  It will support vCast, which is Verizon's video service, has HDMI out, DLNA compatibility.  It may be just a little too big.  You said, Gina, about the Evo that it was as big as you could get and not be uncomfortable.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  It's bigger than the Evo?  Same size screen.  I think Pogue said in his Evo video, it's just like having a baby iPad to your head.  And it does kind of come close to that.  So if it's bigger than that, it looks like it's 4.3 inches.  Isn't that what the Evo looks like?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the Evo screen, but I think physically the handset is bigger.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What's with this trend of all the Android phones suddenly getting bigger and bigger  and bigger?  Is it something there's any demand for?  I feel like I much prefer iPhones, right, of just increasing the resolution of the screen.  So you still have a same size device, but you get more stuff on the screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an interesting choice.  Now, you're young with good eyes.  So for you, more resolution means more real estate.  It doesn't for me because I can't read tiny print and see little icons.  So you have to make the stuff bigger anyway.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's kind of an obvious selling point.  I think you can walk into a store and they can say, hey, this phone is bigger than the iPad.  And that's your kind of normal consumer will be like, I want a bigger one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Evo resolution is the same as the old iPhone.  It's not bigger resolution, just bigger screen.  I think it maybe is a response to the iPad, right?  It's kind of like an iPad Nano.  I don't know. What do you think, Peter?  You're an iPhone guy, right?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Actually, my main phone is still a Nexus One right now.  I will be switching probably to a four iPhone 4 next week when mine comes.  But I think both are phenomenal operating systems.  I think it's really great for the consumers that we're having that choice.  But honestly, I think Android is going to be the bigger in terms of pure numbers.  I think they will eventually overtake the iPhone.  Some numbers say they already have.  It's kind of debatable, but they're certainly selling at a fast rate.  Here's what I don't like about Android and iPhone is that people kind of treat it like religion.  So when we write about iPhone, we get all these people being like, oh my goodness, you're on the Apple side.  Or we write about Android and they say you're on Google's side.  And I think I'm kind of on both sides because I think they're both kind of moving.  They've kind of sped up the pace of innovation here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And at least for now, let's remember that you don't have the choice of an iPhone if you're not wanting to get AT&T.  So I think it's great that Verizon keeps coming up with compelling handsets.  So now you can use an Exus 1 and AT&T.  Now you travel, Pete, and you travel to the UK and so forth.  So you have to have a GSM phone.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's just no question about that.  But if you're a US user and you're not going to leave the shores and you want Verizon or Sprint,  you've got two very good choices that I think are pretty damn close to an iPhone.  I haven't used a new iPhone 4.  Maybe they'll leapfrog, but they're certainly as good as the 3GS.  You know, I was impressed.  You know, you told me that HTC was good on returns.  I got that experience.  My top switch, I don't know if you've had this problem, Pete, with your Nexus one, but I got it right when Google came out with it.  And, you know, this is the one thing I really don't like about Android is you're always pressing that top switch to wake it up and put it to sleep.  It's not a good switch.  And it's the same on the Droid, on the Evo, on all of them.  It's just this little reset switch.  I don't like it.  And it died eventually.  And for a while, I thought that my non responsive Nexus one was software because I'd press the switch and then I but it wouldn't wake up or I press a switch and it would wake up.  But I couldn't do my pattern to unlock.  And I thought this thing I wanted to throw it.  And now and then it got to a point where I couldn't I took out the battery, put it in and I couldn't turn it on.  So, oh, it's the top switch.  It's not software called HTC.  No hold time.  Maybe I was lucky, but it was a Monday morning, which is notoriously the worst time for calling support.  No hold time.  They said, oh, well, what's your IMEI number?  And I said, oh, I can't turn it on.  They said, oh, it's in the open and up.  Take out the battery.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  I gave him that number.  They said, oh, hi, Mr.  This is Mr.  Laporte.  I see yours is engraved.  Now, if you want to preserve the engraving, you'll need to send us the phone.  We'll fix it and send it back.  We'll pay shipping.  It'll take about seven days.  But they said they were so nice.  Do you have a handset to replace it?  I said, yeah, I'm using this N900.  And they said, well, if you want, we can just send you a new phone.  We'll authorize a charge on your card.  And then you ship us back the old phone.  And as long as the damage is not out of warranty damage, as long as you didn't flush it down the toilet or something, we'll just make a swap.  And that's what happened to you, Gina, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep, exactly.  It was great.  I couldn't believe it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the phone is on the FedEx truck.  It's going to be here today.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  That's pretty phenomenal.  It's pretty phenomenal because you remember when the Nexus One launched, most of the complaints were on Google not having any system for dealing with complaints.  So that's pretty cool.  That was my concern.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was really concerned.  I thought, oh, no, who do I go to?  I didn't buy this from anybody.  I bought it from Google.  I bought it from a Python script.  How am I going to get this fixed?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, they're Python powered.  Custom service people are pretty good.  Well, I call Google and they transfer me to HTC pretty quickly.  I mean, HTC actually took care of me, right?  Yes.  That's how it works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, what I did is I Googled Nexus One support or something like that and it came to an HTC page and said, no, we do that.  I called that number.  No hold time.  I should have done it immediately.  I was just thinking, oh, I don't want to go through this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  I did the same thing.  I hung onto my phone with all the dust under the screen for weeks, like feeling sad about it.  And then it took five minutes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So kudos.  I know that Google got a lot of heat for support with the Nexus One, but I was very impressed.  And they're just going to basically swap it.  Oh, and now is this what happened to you, Gina?  You get to keep your old battery and cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was really surprised about that.  So now I have two batteries.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they said take everything out and right, right.  So you just sent back the shell, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The shell.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I lose my engraving, but I gain a battery.  Yeah, there you go.  Great.  Now, because the only qualm I have about Android phones is battery life.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  How's that EVO doing for you on battery life?  Or you'd lend it to a friend.  I lent it to a friend.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who fell in love with it and is keeping it.  Oh, sorry.  That makes me happy.  No, that's cool.  Bye-bye.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You didn't want that anyway.  All right.  The other big.  So DroidX, look for it, the 15th.  There are now, I'll get one just to review it, but I would say the EVO is an excellent  phone.  I would say that if it had battery life, it would be 100% from my point of view.  Just tip top.  I love the Nexus One.  I'm going to stick with the Nexus One because I can put 2.2 on it.  Although I keep hearing that they haven't pushed 2.2 at all.  Did you get 2.2 yet?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No, and it's point of contention for me.  That's bizarre.  I haven't had it yet.  No.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's definitely a delay with over the air updates.  I'm definitely getting emails from listeners and from readers who are saying, okay, so  when does it come?  Well, I just did the manual update.  Yeah, I did the manual update and I don't even think that zip file is available anymore.  Oh.  I don't think it's where it was when we did it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought maybe I screwed it up with a manual update, but of course I didn't.  It was hardware.  So Pete, you're not going to do a manual update.  You're just going to wait.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Oh, I might, but I'm probably going to get 4G and then use that one a lot.  But I don't know.  We'll see.  The EVO.  No, the iPhone.  I'll probably get a 4G and then a 5G.  Oh, the 4.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't call it the 4G.  That's confusing.  Oh, the iPhone 4.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  We thought it was going to be the HD.  What happened to that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Apple.  So I don't know if this will change the availability of 2.2 or not, but today Google did open source  What does that mean, Gina?  You're the developer.  What does that mean?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I mean, I think it just means that they, I think that they work on, I could be wrong  about this and so the chat room should correct me, but I think that they work on the new  version, kind of not in public and then they publish the code.  So it's kind of done.  At a checkpoint.  Yeah, so like, right.  So it's done and now it's out there for folks to grab it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Including OEMs like HTC and Motorola who can now take it and make it their own.  Exactly.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Speaking of HTC, there's reports today that Apple's suing them again for patent painting  infringement.  Right.  So that's how many times now?  I don't even know.  Is the old suit still going too?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's just more, right?  Piling on.  Poor little HTC.  They didn't have the guts to go after Google, so they go after HTC or is it the HTC sense  that they're not happy about?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  As Technica says, a new lawsuit filed against HTC and several US subsidiaries, Apple claims  HTC's smartphones infringed on four more of its smartphone technology payments.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was like the lock screen, the slide to unlock thing.  Apple, just make a better phone.  That's all.  It's not hard.  Don't have to sue.  So good news.  2.2 open source.  All right.  Now, Gina, the big story of the day.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is the story that made me very happy this week.  Well, two stories made me very happy, but most people will be really happy about the  fact that Google Voice is now open to everyone in the US.  No invitation required.  US only.  Yeah, US only.  So you can go to Google.com slash voice.  You can sign up for a phone number.  I think I believe you can pick the area and Google Voice is really awesome.  And it's been my exclusive, my primary phone number actually for more than a year.  And it's literally, if you haven't gotten Google Voice and a lot of people are like,  what is it again?  Now that it's open and I can use it, what does it do?  It's basically like, I kind of feel like it's Gmail for your phone calls and your  voicemail.  It'll, it'll, you get a phone number and it can ring multiple phones.  You can create rules about who's calling.  If you set up, say, for instance, a business number, you can say, ring my phone.  If the call comes between nine and five, send it straight to voicemail.  If it comes after five before nine, you can have, you know, yeah, it's great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can have contact groups, contact groups, different voicemail for each.  This throws my wife because after my wife leaves a message, I say, hi, I'm not here.  Leave a message. Love you.  And she says, do you tell everybody that you love them and your voicemail?  She doesn't understand it.  No, that's just for you, honey.  So great. So great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got stuck on some like call, caller list.  I, you know, somebody, I was getting all these not prank calls, but, but telemarketing calls.  You can make a list, you know, a black list, basically.  They go straight to voicemail.  It's fantastic.  So it lets you just create rules and it manage multiple phones.  You can, you can hop between different phones without changing the number.  It's great for us because if you have multiple phones, as all three of us do, all of them ring,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  or you could just say this one rings or that one rings.  It's really nice.  I don't have to worry about what my actual handset number is anymore.  And you read your voicemail.  I hate listening to voicemails.  It's like one of my biggest pet peeves.  You get a transcript.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The transcripts are usually last minute.  So you can just, you know, you can just, you know, you can just, you know,  the transcripts are usually laughably off, but they're good enough.  They're getting, they seem like they're getting better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have you noticed that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they are getting better.  And I'm, there's no doubt in my mind that Google is, is making its algorithm and its algorithm is learning as it goes.  So it's a fantastic project, a product that I'm really glad it's open.  I'm sorry to everyone outside the U.S.  I had a lot of very upset international.  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have, you know, almost half of our audience for the show is international and they're gnashing their teeth right now.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We may be better not labeled at the point then we actually covered it.  We were like, you know, Google Voice now open to everyone and then instantly had like, you know, not everyone.  Not everyone outside.  Well, you want to know better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're in Vancouver right now where it's not available and you and you make your home in Scotland much of the time where it's not available.  It's true.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It's kind of frustrating.  Actually, it's one of the things with Google TV coming up, we're going to have this a lot of things, you know, iPhone release that you kind of have to work around a little bit.  If you're not in the U.S.  Most of the time.  So it's a little bit challenging this international stuff.  We kind of wish that these companies would, you know, consider the rest of the world because it's a big market out there.  But I think it's, you know, with phones, especially as those challenges of like international, it's kind of the old systems they're battling against rather than them actually being like preferring the U.S.  in any way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I give them a pass on this just because it is phone related on the international issue.  Right.  I'm sure that it's complicated with numbers and prefixes and all those things.  So, so yeah, I feel bad for the international folks, but I kind of give Google a pass.  Normally, I would expect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, we will never know what Gina expects because she's there.  She unfroze.  That was good.  I would expect what would you expect?  What?  No, of course, it's phones.  It's not, you know, when you talk about publishing music or phones, all of these things don't respect the borders are like TV very soon when Google starts getting into that.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I have the same issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if I will.  I don't think I really don't think you're going to say, oh, gosh, I wish I had Google TV.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I do actually.  Maybe I'll be based in the U.S.  But then I think, yeah, I want to try everything.  You know, it kind of changed my attitude.  I'm kind of like, yeah, I just want to try everything because you never know.  You never know.  You never know.  What's the harm in like trying it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I agree.  I will certainly try it.  I just don't think it's going to be.  I don't know.  First of all, I don't even know if it's going to come out.  You know, they they have these relationships with Sony and Dish and all that.  But doesn't mean you're going to see a product.  And if you do, I don't know if it's going to be, you know, something you really want.  I'm skeptical.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  You know, I really think the TV is the next screen for this whole app platform to come to.  And I think if Google doesn't do it, Apple will do it.  Steve Jobs was kind of he kind of overdid his denial.  Remember, was it the d-clippance?  He was like, no, TV will never work.  And listed like a bunch of reasons why there's no way that Apple would ever get into TV  and that, you know, Apple TV is just a side project and that kind of thing.  That usually means they're going to do it.  Yeah, it protests a little too much on that.  And I think they're probably going to get into that next.  It would be so obvious for them to do so.  Why not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they already sell all this stuff and so forth.  They have the app store.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  So that's just huge.  I mean, if all the developers could just recode their apps to suit that really big screen, then why not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Google did announce last week Google Music.  So they're already kind of in this space a little bit.  It would be great for gaming.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I mean, I'm using my iPad for gaming as well.  And she just bumped that up to, you know, full TV size and it would be fantastic.  So why not?  I mean, they're building their own game platform.  You're getting Zynga and all these other social gaming developers getting onto the app store.  It's one of the most popular app types on the app store.  So, you know, why not take on the console makers?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that reminds me, Farmville just came out on the iPhone.  I'll see you guys later.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Someone on Twitter tells me that the manual update for the Nexus One Froyo was an internal build and the official Froyo is not going over the air to the end ones just yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I probably shouldn't install the phony Froyo.  I just like saying phony Froyo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's phony Froyo.  Internal test build. Interesting.  So what's going to happen?  Is my phone going to explode when the actual official update goes out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this was one of my concerns is that when the update did come out that it wouldn't update because it would say, well, you already have it.  Yeah.  And I would like the final one.  Now, of course, Cyanogen has already announced now that it's open sourced that they're going to do Cyanogen mods for Android 2.2 for Nexus One Desire.  The G1.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Nice. Old school.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rocking it old school.  My Touch, My Touch Slide, Evo, Hero, and Droid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, we, you know, it's like carriers, whatever.  I want Cyanogen to get a hold of the 2.2 code.  Like that's what I'm excited about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's interesting.  So you wouldn't hesitate to put the Cyanogen ROMs on there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At this point, Cyanogen has earned my trust.  Like I've used his stuff a few times.  In fact, we should get him on the show.  Okay, deal.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's probably 12 years old, but do you know, Izzy?  I mean, he probably is, right?  He's probably a kid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I got my first G1, okay, I hacked it.  And it was cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  This is going to work great for getting him on the show, Leo.  Yeah, no, no.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I shouldn't have said that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love you, Cyanogen.  You rock.  I think he's like in his twenties, as I remember.  I just like to make fun of people under 50, which means all of you.  Anyway, so what would you do, Gina?  Because Cyanogen cannot distribute the Google apps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, but he's figured that out.  I think that he's figured this out, right?  I think actually he worked with Google on this.  Oh, so there's a tar ball or something that gives you the edge.  Yeah, there's a way that you can kind of like back up the apps that you have, install his  ROM, and then re-, you know.  So I believe that he was able to navigate the distribution issues.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'll do it if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, let's do it.  Okay, we're going to do it.  Will you do it too, Pete?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll do that.  Oh man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pete, you're getting corrupted.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's like, I don't care if it's my Android phone.  I'm going to have my iPhone.  Oh yeah, he doesn't care, does he?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe I'll wait until July 15th when my four comes.  Oh, no, I want to, you know, now you have to root it to do this, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, I mean, speaking of which, that kind of relates to the whole like, okay, Android's  more open deal, but there's reports this week, and I don't know if they've kind of been,  I think they were kind of debunked a little bit.  I think this is BS.  But there was reports that maybe up to 20% of Android apps were possibly spyware.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This comes from S-Mobile systems.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah, they sent us a press release.  I'm kind of skeptical on it.  I think it's kind of an overestimate, but I think that's something to it where when you  have a more open system, you have a lot more opportunity to take advantage.  Well, that's for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, we've seen malicious apps in the app store because nobody's vetting them.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Right.  It's kind of remarkable how this whole setup is echoing the whole Windows versus Mac setup  with Android.  I mean, that's been said, but even on the spyware side, on the exploit side, it would  appear that Android is lining up to be the Windows.  And I wonder if that will eventually cut into their popularity if, you know, people are  trying to avoid apps to take advantage of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you want secure.  I think it's probably you could make a good case that something like the iPad, which is  completely locked down or the iPhone.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I don't know.  There's some kind of Safari issue, isn't there?  Hasn't been updated.  Oh, this is a big issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, because Apple pushed out updates for all of its platforms with iOS 4, except the  iPad.  And in that push, there were 65 vulnerabilities that were, I think half of them were critical.  So you've got 30 plus critical vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which allow for remote code  execution, which is as bad as it gets, unpatched on the iPad now.  Right.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Which is kind of the counter argument that closed systems are just as vulnerable to whoever's  managing the system, making a mistake and not noticing.  So it's that, you know, half dozen, one, six, the other.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Gina, it's my understanding that when you root a phone that normally you unlock the  bootloader.  Yes.  And this is a bad thing because then they can tell you messed with your phone or what?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Who can tell?  Like, the Google police.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Google police.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody's saying it's going to void your warranty, but if you don't mess with the bootloader,  it doesn't void your warranty.  And apparently there's a way to do the rooting without messing with the bootloader.  Oh, really?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's been a while.  I rooted my G1 back in the back in the day and then I was like, I want to have the full.  I haven't rooted my Nexus one.  So I'm not, I'm not, I'm actually not sure.  I mean, the reality is you can reset it.  From what I understand, you can reset it to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Without a problem.  Just do a full erase or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This report about spyware is.  Focus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's based on permissions.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Based on permissions and other attributes.  a key logger.  You know what I mean?  I mean, there's, there's, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Android phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  to take a call.  And I think it's good to give people information.  You're right.  It's a little scary for somebody who doesn't know.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah.  actually interested in your location.  It's not like you're interested in your location.  It's just like, I don't know.  You're interested in your location.  You're interested in your location.  I agree with you, Leo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I've become sort of desensitized to it now.  Me too.  I don't read it.  I've installed so many apps.  And the other thing is that when the app tells you, I need network access, I need this, I  need that, it doesn't explain why.  So I find myself asking, what does this app do that makes me, and can I opt out of that  feature?  I wish it was just a little more informative.  I don't know.  Some people would argue that maybe it's a little too much information.  But I wish I could say, oh, I know that this app does this thing, and this is why it needs  access to my network.  This is why it may pull data.  So I think it could be refined a little bit so that you can make a more informed decision.  Because right now it's either yes or no.  Right?  And now I just tap, yeah.  I mean, I just…  What are you going to say?  No?  You downloaded it.  You want it.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Okay.  yes, no matter what it says.  It's like, it's like the, Apple pushed a 45 page updated terms of service for iTunes  Forty-five pages.  You're looking at it on your iPhone and it says, it says, would you like to read this  or just accept it?  And it's what you, I'm going to sit here, read 45 pages on my iPhone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What are you crazy?  Right.  It's ridiculous.  down to the end.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's funny.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Done.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I read it.  I read it all.  We're going to take a break and come back with more, lots more to talk about.  I'm so glad Pete Cashmore is here from Mashable.com.  Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org.  Again, if you just tuned in, Jeff Jarvis is in the air, midair.  He was flying in Chicago.  He's speaking in Chicago tonight.  We had hoped to get him on, but he was stuck as always.  Chicago's a tough airport in the winter, it's snow.  In the summer, it's thunderstorms.  You can't win.  You can't win.  So, Jeff's not with us.  He'll be back next week.  Meanwhile, I would like to tell you about backup.  You know, this is so important.  One of the things I really love about the Nexus One and the Android operating system,  when I get that new handset, I log into my Google account and boom, pow, wow, all this  stuff is immediately restored.  I don't have to worry about backup on Android.  I wish all devices were like that.  If you're using a Mac or Windows, you know you're responsible for backing up.  If you're going to back up, you've got to do it right, automatically, because nobody  remembers.  Don't be one of those people who says, oh yeah, I'll back up every week.  Look, I've got this great external drive.  I'll do that.  Three months later, your hard drive dies and you go, oh, I forgot.  It should be automatic.  And by the way, you find a backup to an external drive, but that's not the end of it, because  what if there's a fire or a flood or you're living in the Portola Valley and there's an  earthquake and boom, you lose it all.  You got to back up offsite.  Carbonite does that too.  128-bit encryption, SSL, backs it right up to the cloud.  You can use AES 256 to encrypt it before it's sent and only you have the password to that.  So you really have privacy.  I'm going to do this on my daughter's.  She's taking a MacBook to college.  You bet Carbonite's going on it so that I don't get that call middle of the night.  I lost my paper.  I lost my notebook.  I lost my hard drive.  It's always backed up.  Anywhere you can get online, you can get that data back.  There's even an iPhone app.  Try it free, 15 days, no credit card needed.  Carbonite.com offer code twig, T-W-I-G.  And if you decide to buy two months free when you use twig as the offer code, carbonite.com.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right with Carbonite.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Good news from Twitter.  Several people say that those of us who manually installed the Nexus One update to 2.2 will  get the over the air update because it is a different build number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, fantastic.  So I think I kept that zip file.  So I should be able to, I'm sure I kept it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you won't even, you won't need it because you'll get the over the air update  and it'll be the official build.  And I'm also told that you can get around unlocking the bootloader on the N1 when you  flash it.  Twitter's amazing.  I know Twitter is amazing.  It is amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All we have to do is say one thing wrong or ask a question and boom.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know it's fantastic.  There are even a few people urging Cyanogen on Twitter to accept when we ask him to come  on the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They don't mention the thing, the little 12 year old snarky.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hopefully they won't say anything about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Man, Leo was so snarky about you.  You ought to come on and set him straight.  I probably could beat my ass.  Okay.  Moving along.  Microsoft going after Google apps with a switchers campaign.  We were talking before the show started, Pete and I, he said, you know, you're smart to  do a Google show because Google's taken off.  Yep.  It's Google.  These days it's Google, Facebook, Apple.  I said, what about Microsoft?  What did you say, Pete?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah.  Microsoft's kind of out of the game right now in terms of mobile OS at least.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've got a new Xbox 360.  That's it.  They got Kinect.  Big deal.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Kinect is the last big thing they did that actually got some coverage and looks pretty  innovative.  They do have.  The deal is kind of not going anywhere.  They do have.  You have the kin, Leo.  You're going to get a kin?  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought the kin was kind of cute.  If I wanted five phones, I guess I'd get a kin.  It would be the fifth though, right?  the Nexus One, the iPhone 4, the Droid X.  Maybe then a kin.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  What OS does the kin run anyway?  Wasn't it?  Microsoft was kind of mocking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's betwixt and between.  It's not Windows Phone 7 yet.  It's using this Zune interface.  You know, this.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Really?  Because wasn't it Ballman that was like, oh, Google has so many operating systems.  I can't keep track.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was called, talking about the pot calling the kettle black.  Microsoft.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I didn't even know what kin was running.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not 6.5.  It's not 7.  It's 6.75, I guess.  Anyway, the kin looks pretty cool.  I like the idea of social on a phone.  I think it's aimed at people your age, not my age.  So Microsoft does have, and I don't think that they've done a very good job marketing,  a fairly credible cloud solution.  Office for the web looks great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Office 2010, right?  Just got released.  It's kind of a big deal.  And it talks to, you know, you can save files to the web, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've got SharePoint, which a lot of big businesses use instead of Google Docs.  That's the thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of people in big business and corporate situations are really excited  about Office 2010 and Windows 7 and kind of the new thing, those new things.  I think that we just, we don't, you know, because we're kind of freelancers or small  business people, we don't use those things.  But Office 2010 is pretty cool, I hear.  And it's kind of nice.  It has like live typing, kind of like WAVE collaborative typing.  You could set up SharePoint.  Exactly.  SharePoint installation and collaborate that way.  So you know, that's something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're working on an enterprise show because I know we need to cover this.  We do cover it a little bit on Windows Weekly.  But have you ever heard of BPOS?  Anybody?  Bueller?  No, this is what it is.  This is what Microsoft's pushing.  Business Productivity Online Standard Suite.  Well named, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  BPOS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This Google or Bing BPOS, this is what Microsoft wants you to use instead of Google Docs.  And I again, I presume, I would hope if you are in, oh look, they want to chat with me.  No, no, I don't think so.  Welcome to Microsoft.  I can assist you with your questions.  I think Clippy is in BPOS.  Would you like to make a list?

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  No.  It looks like you're trying to switch away from Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It looks like you're trying to switch from Google.  BPOS is a set of messaging and collaboration solutions hosted by Microsoft.  It consists of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications  Online.  Maybe this is the kind of marketing that works in enterprise.  Maybe that's all I can think of.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Well, it's super safe, isn't it?  So it's safe to continue on with Microsoft products.  I think it's a battle they need to win because right now what is Microsoft?  It's the OS and it's Office.  And they've definitely got no play in the future of the OS, which is mobile.  It's going to be Android versus iOS.  So Microsoft really needs to fight that battle against Google on the whole Office space thing  or they're going to lose every battle that matters to them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they need better marketing than a switcher campaign, to be honest with you.  That's just, but that's what they're doing.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Honestly, I think that product is more of a problem than marketing right now.  If you look at Bing, really hard marketing drive on that one.  They're spending a lot of marketing dollars.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you like those Bing ads, those TV ads?  I find them very bizarre and upsetting.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Bing is a sponsor.  I think.  Oh, we love Bing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  God bless Bing.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I think it probably is on some level as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't have to moderate your opinion because they're a sponsor.  That's not.  No.  I certainly wouldn't.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I think Bing has done better than most people expected it to do.  If you'd said a few years ago, Microsoft's going to make a real play and get a few percentage  points of the search market.  They haven't really taken it off Google, though.  They've been taking it off other people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tell me what this is an ad for.  Just watch this or listen to this ad.  Tell me what this is an ad for.  Oh, it's a private video.  Oh, please.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Their ads private.  Never mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's innovation right there.  That's innovation.  Let me see if this other one is private as well.  Hey, Dad, did you pick me at a cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cell walls are thicker than plasma membranes and were originally discovered by Robert Hook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in a sample of cork.  Okay.  So I guess that means you didn't find me a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thousands of telephone poles are destroyed each year by woodpeckers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woodpeckers also nest in the cavities of trees.  Do you not find this disturbing?  Which celebrity mom has another one on the way?  What?  Sucker mom.  Mom jeans.  Moms who wear jeans to match their teens jeans.  I hate these ads.  They scare me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hate these ads.  They scare the hell out of me.  They're like the Stepford wives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The search overload.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The premise is that, and it's by the way, not at all obvious, typical bad Microsoft  marketing.  The premise is that these people are responding with what they would have gotten had they  searched for those terms, but you can't tell.  It just seems like they're cracked.  Here's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, did you ever find tickets to Hawaii?  Hawaii 5-0.  Book them, Dano.  Aloha.  Mellie and Kaliki Maka.  Surf Lingo.  Bro, I was stoked when I caught that tasty barrel.  Seriously.  Did you price out tickets?  How to beat a traffic ticket.  10 proven methods traffic courts don't want you to know.  What are you talking about?  Talk turkey.  Talk live with hot singles in your area.  They're waiting.  Who's waiting?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, I guess that's the thing.  But we love Bing because they are a sponsor of Mashable.com.  They do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They sponsor a lot of cool things.  I have to say, I see that they sponsor The Soup, which is one of my favorite, like it's  a, you know, cable clip show.  Love The Soup.  Love The Soup.  Yeah.  So whenever I see the Bing ad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It might be just me because the chat room is saying, love these ads.  They're great.  They're wonderful.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Ah.  They're trying something a little bit different.  They're trying something a little bit unusual.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I was ripping them because of BPOS, which by the way, could you pick a worse acronym?  It's wrong on two levels.  First of all, it could be the British Petroleum Operating System.  Bad.  Or it could be a big POS.  Bad.  There's no, there's no good interpretation of BPOS.  But you know, that's fine.  They're not known for great marketing and that's just the way I think it is with Microsoft.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Their PC campaign did pretty well.  Did you like that?  Well, they did well according to the numbers.  I mean, it was kind of a reaction to the whole Mac ads with the whole Switch campaign.  They did need to respond.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did need to respond.  All right.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I'm not going to respond.  It did well.  I mean, in terms of, I think it was like price perception, young people were perceiving,  well, PCs to be more affordable and better value for money.  You know, we discussed that on the previous show.  It worked.  Yeah, it worked.  So it worked for them.  Sometimes it works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see here.  Google Maps Mania.  I love this real-time London Tube map.  This is a really interesting.  That's so cool.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  People should check that out if they haven't already.  So I don't know how you do this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is using Google Maps, but this actually shows where the trains are in the London Underground  in real time.  That's awesome.  I guess you could fire this up on your phone and see how soon before the train arrived.  Oh my God, I need this for New York.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I tried it on my iPad and it wasn't working.  Oh, it didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's using flash.  But look at these.  These trains, you can actually see them moving.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It could have just been overloaded though because it was on the day that it got a bunch  of coverage.  I wonder if it wouldn't be flash, would it?  I don't think so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so cool.  You can click on the stations for a local map of that station.  You need this in New York, don't you, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I would love to see this in New York.  Although compared to London, New York's subway system isn't so good.  Is this a little more complicated?  It's a little more complicated, yeah.  They won't tell you how many minutes until a train arrives or anything like that.  This will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bakerloo train to Elephant and Castle.  I just love British stuff.  Left Baker Street Station.  Expected Regent's Park Station in 2.5 minutes.  I love this.  That's awesome.  It's great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Metropolitan train to Uxbridge.  Left Baker Street Station.  Expected Finchley Road Station in 6 minutes.  Hammersmith and Circle train to Richmond.  Left Westminster Station.  Expected St James Park Station in 2.5 minutes.  You know, if you really want to do this right, you do it in the accent of each of these regions.  Aye, Piccadilly train to Piccadilly train.  Left Cologne at the Alledonian Road Station.  I didn't realize Australia was in the station.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I have a limited repertoire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They all sound the same to me.  I'm sorry.  I apologize, Pete.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  London accents are super challenging.  Even if you're British, you need to be a Londoner to be able to speak.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just do the rhyming slang.  Yeah, that's a really neat aspect of mashups.  I've never seen a real-time one like that.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to talk about Google CL.  Okay, Google CL.  You're excited.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We got to talk about Google CL.  It is a command line interface to a bunch of Google APIs, which I really dig because I'm in a terminal all the time and I wrote this kind of command line to do task manager.  Yes, I love that.  So this is kind of like right up my alley.  So basically, once you install it, it's Python.  So you can install it on a Mac or PC.  With a PC, you'll need something like Sigwin.  But you can type out a command line, something like...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You download this.  It's a download.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a download.  You have to download and install it.  And then you can also, if you type Google at a command line, you get kind of a bunch of options.  You can access Picasa, Docs, Calendar.  So you can type something like Google Calendar Lists, and it'll give you a list of events from your calendar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is awesome.  And so you get all kind of the shell scripty goodness that you get in any script.  So you can cron things.  You can echo and cat things.  You can edit a Google Doc in VI.  You can...  You're kidding.  Seriously, you can.  In fact, on the Friend feed, I linked...  Lifehacker did a great feature, like five ways you can use Google CL.  You can cron backups.  You can say, every night, go through my document list and save them in Google Docs, for example.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, you can pass the Google Docs command an editor parameter and specify the editor you want to use.  It definitely works with Vim and Nano, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, it's super cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what do you need?  Do you need Python?  Could you do this on Windows?  It's easy on the Mac, because Mac has Python.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can totally do it on Windows.  If you have something like SigWin...  SigWin would let you do it.  Yeah, you can do it on Windows.  So yeah, it's really neat.  I actually have it.  I use GeekTool on the Mac, which is like a heads-up display.  It can embed text.  Oh, it goes on your desktop.  So are you geektooling Google?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are you putting on there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I geektool like today's events on my calendar.  This is great.  Yeah, it's super neat.  I'm actually going to build an extension to my task manager, which lets you add a command to your to-do list and also schedule it on your calendar in one shot.  So yeah, really neat.  I mean, not obviously useful to normals, but certainly to your listeners.  To us.  Yeah, to us.  We're not normals.  Anyone who is in a terminal on a fairly regular basis will really kind of enjoy this.  I also have it.  I set up my bash profile so that when I launch a terminal, it actually shows me my events for the day.  Oh, neat.  Yeah, the prompt.  So you put in your prompt?  Yeah, so it's in my prompt.  Yeah.  I kind of...  Would you post that on SmarterWear.org?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to see your prompt.  I did.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did.  It just says next 24 hours and then lists the events in my calendar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So every time you hit return, it does that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, just when you launch a new window.  Just when you launch a window.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not your prompt.  Right.  It's not my prompt.  It's just the first thing that happened before on my initial prompt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is so funny.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's really...  It's neat.  It's really pretty neat.  I haven't tried...  I haven't messed around with the docs editor yet, but that in and of itself is...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and it makes sense.  This is how they came up with it.  They say in the blog post that we wanted to upload photos to a folder on Picasa without  launching an application.  We want to do it from the command line.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's great.  And so it gives you access to the full API.  What do you have access to?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you type Google...  Once you have it installed, if you type Google at the command line, you get into an interactive  command line.  So you can just type help and it'll show you all the commands that are available.  It's Picasa, docs, calendar.  Wow.  And then you can say calendar help.  And then you can see all the calendar specific options and parameters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could probably do searches too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not sure if search is in the list.  Let's see.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just seems like there's all sorts of ways you could use this with scripts and stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  No, search isn't included.  It's Picasa blogger.  So you can actually write a blog post at the command line, which I don't know when you'd  ever want to do that, but you can.  You can fetch blog posts.  You could have a blog backup script, for example.  You can post to YouTube.  So docs...  Oh, contacts.  You can also export your contacts to a CSV every once in a while.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you're using Google Voice, this would be very useful.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And calendar.  So hopefully...  You can post to YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, this is actually good because we do currently post to YouTube programmatically.  Yep.  You can totally use this.  I'm sure they're doing some sort of weird scraping thing.  I don't even know how they would do that, but this would make that much easier.  Wow.  So if you have Python, is it 2.5 that you need?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Probably.  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Very cool.  Yeah, it worked really well.  I just installed it on my Mac, just the Google part.  I think that's what the Mac comes with, 2.5.  Yeah, I think the Mac does ship with 2.5.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's Apache license.  And there's a Debian or a Tarball you can get.  Look at that.  This is so cool.  And it looks like they're...  What is this CL, this Q code?  What is that, QL code?  What is that?  That's the file download URL.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Q...  Oh, is it the file download or is it just the MD5?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I was wondering if it was the check sum, but when I hover the mouse over it says  the link.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I guess you could install it on your phone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no command line in Android, is there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, actually there is.  Isn't there like an Android scripting environment, the ASE?  I would like that.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So really dig in the Google CL.  Okay.  I want more.  More, please, Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that wasn't even Gina's tool of the week.  Wow.  Very geeky stuff.  Good, though.  I like it.  Anything else we want to talk about before we get to our tip tool and number of the week?  Dell is looking at Chrome OS for a future Dell...  What?  Tablets?  Notebooks?  What?  That's an interesting thought.  It was an interview with Dell's president for Greater China in South Asia.  He told Reuters, quote, we have to have a point of view on the industry and technology  direction two and three years down the road.  So we continually work with Google on this.  Amit Midas says he also expects Chrome and Android to be part of a new form of computing.  So Dell isn't doing a smartphone, but I wonder maybe the Dell Streak, which is...  I think, isn't that the big phone with the big screen?  The Dell Streak is huge.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It's massive.  Just like in between an iPad and an iPhone kind of size.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that will run Android.  That would be very interesting.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I think the real loser in this is Microsoft again with Dell obviously shipping a bunch  of Microsoft PCs right now.  And suddenly everyone's jumping to Chrome to replace the full Windows 7 experience,  or they're jumping to Android on the phone.  So it's really Microsoft's loss is Google's gain right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this is Android.  Oh, this is sweet.  Very sweet.  The Dell Streak.  Got to take a look at that.  Looks like Asia only, but...  Oh, now wait a minute.  This story says Dell Streak will probably be sold by a US carrier at some point.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I'm going to imagine that Chrome is going to be more of their netbook OS.  Right.  And that Android is going to be their mobile and tablet OS.  It would make more sense to echo what's already happening with iOS on the iPad and the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Dell said at the D8 conference that they in fact would sell it unlocked in  the US and via a wireless carrier.  $500 on dell.com.  That could be a very surprising sleeper product for Dell.  Could be a big deal.  All right.  We got another show to do in a few minutes and I want to get our guests out the door  because I know...  Oh, my Nexus One came.  Thank you.  And I have something else to do.  I've got a phone to charge.  Before we get to our tip and tool and number of the week, I'd like to welcome a new sponsor  to the show.  Very excited about iStock Photo.  Oh, cool.  You know about them.  Yeah, I've used them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're great.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  I love iStock Photo.  Yeah, we use them for a lot of our images.  They're really good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anybody who blogs knows about them because it's a great way to get affordable images,  licensed images for your blog.  In fact, if you go to iStockPhoto.com slash twig, you can get a special deal on royalty  free stock images, media and design elements.  Oops, don't do TIG.  Do TWIG.  I don't know what TIG gave me something odd.  I guess that's a person.  Oh, here it is.  Welcome all twig listeners.  15% off credits if you join right now.  They're the original source for high quality stock images, design elements, all royalty  free, used by bloggers like Pete and Gina, by designers, by advertisers, entrepreneurs.  They offer not just photos.  You know, the name really is a little deceptive.  Illustrations and vector images, videos, music and sound effects, flash files, 3D renders  and logos coming soon.  Incredible visuals.  They make it very easy and you can get 15% off bundles of 50 credits or more right now.  By going to iStockPhoto.twig.  And I don't know if I should mention this on this show, but they do have a Microsoft  Office plugin that makes it really easy to use.  And coming soon, an iPhone app.  I love this idea.  You'd be able to use an iPhone app to get to your iStock photos and get some royalty  free illustrations.  iStockPhoto.com slash twig.  Twig.  Yeah, they really are a great company.  They're kind of the company for doing this.  If you're in the business, do what Pete and Gina do.  iStockPhoto.com slash twig.  Gina.  Oh, Gina, time for your tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have two quick tips.  Yes.  First one for Android users.  I just discovered this this week and I blew my mind.  I had no idea it was there.  While you're typing on the default Android keyboard in Froyo, if you swipe your finger  up above the keyboard, it will extend two more rows with numbers and punctuation marks.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't have to tap the period to switch to the parentheses or the one, two, three.  And it took me a couple of times to get it right.  But now I have it every time.  That's awesome.  Swipe your finger up and it extends two more rows.  You can see I have a picture of it there on my blog that Leo is up on screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You must have 2.2 to do this though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's only 2.2.  Yeah.  Especially for question marks and exclamation points.  I use it all the time.  Just swipe up and you keep your finger on the screen and then you just release when you  hit the key that you want and it adds it to the...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How does that... doesn't it conflict with the swipe up to record thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you swipe left to right to start like voice to text.  That's right.  It's left to right.  So this is up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  So this is up.  it extends out actually over your text, your word suggestion list.  But it's just numbers and a little common punctuation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will it stay there or does it go away?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It goes away.  When you release...  Swipe up, hold, you release on the key that you want and then it just snaps back in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This might be a reason to leave swipe behind.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It might be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you still using swipe or...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I actually switched back to the default keyboard.  Just because of this?  Because of this.  Yeah.  So I'm giving it another go this week.  Tip number two is for iPhone users who have iOS.  You can now sync your iPhone's notes to Gmail.  I haven't tried this myself but Google Operating System wrote it up and I linked it on the  front feed.  In your Gmail account information you can turn syncing on on notes and it actually shows  up in your Gmail account under a label.  So before it was apparently really difficult for iPhone users to sync notes, but this is  notes to cloud solution.  So that's for iPhone users because we're always talking about Android users here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I see why they wanted me to keep the battery in back.  They didn't include one.  So you don't have two batteries.  You know, I don't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  When you said that I was kind of like...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought I would get a phone with a battery in the back but it doesn't have one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was kind of hoping for you.  I was kind of like, hmm, maybe I did ship back the battery.  No, I didn't.  No, you only get one.  That's right.  They just sent me the body.  Sorry about that, Leo.  I was kind of like, I don't have two batteries.  I wish that I did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google has busted my bubble.  HTC busted my bubble.  Two great tips.  Thank you, Gina.  Sure.  Just the greatest.  We let Pete Cashmore do a number today.  I do.  I have two numbers.  My first number is 160,000.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  160,000 times 30,000.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  160,000 times 31.  Let me see.  Let me do the math.  That's almost five million handsets a month.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Sure.  And that's versus the 100,000 that they were getting activated per day when they announced  at Google I.O.  So really good growth rates for Android activations.  I feel like eventually Android's going to win out in that battle of just the sheer number  of phones that are running Android versus iOS.  They're just going to win on volume.  That's no kidding.  Wow.  It's on the volume of apps, so they're growing really fast.  So that's the same number.  It's 68,000.  That's the number of apps now in the marketplace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now Apple's got what?  A quarter of a million.  But the point, if you've got 68,000, that means usually you have enough to cover the  bases.  All you need is the one app that you need.  You don't need five Fart applications if you've got the one.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting, and I appreciate Gina's view on this.  The thing we see about Android app development is while in theory you're eventually going  to have a lot more devices running your apps, the disadvantage is that people really don't  seem to be paying for Android apps to the degree that they're paying for iPhone apps.  There was a report out this week about there was some tiny percentage of Android apps are  paid versus people are really paying for things on the iPad and iPhone.  I'm interested to see if that kind of hurts developer interest, because obviously developers  are really gung-ho with more devices, more openness, more freedom.  But if there's less revenue, I wonder if that might be a counterpoint.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the revenue conversation is definitely something that comes into play.  I think that Android attracts a certain kind of developer, which is an open source developer,  who's used to releasing things that are generally free.  But I also think that mobile app developers who want to make money, whose goal is to make  some money, are going to go to the iPhone because of the bigger market share, market  distribution, but also because I think that there's this perception that people don't  pay for apps on Android.  I have to tell you that...  I wonder if that's fair though.  Is that fair?  There's tons of apps on Android that I would pay for if I could, but they don't have a  price on them.  I think that developers generally make their apps free because that's just part of the  open source culture.  I think that's just a cultural thing for that kind of development.  I think that's the case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you can make money on Android, absolutely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I actually would encourage Android developers who make great apps to charge for them.  Charge a buck or two, make some money, enjoy.  Enjoy, live.  Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so lucky.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  The advantage the iPhone and iPad have there is that everyone's so trained with iTunes,  they've got their credit cards.  It's like a behavioral thing.  The whole world is trained now to put their credit card into iTunes, and then they get  their iPhone or their iPad, and they're just already set up to go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although, once you know, you Google checkout on Android, so I have the same experience.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Does anyone really?  I mean, I consider myself a heavy Google checkout user, and I really am not crazy for the user  experience there.  We buy a lot of our like on Google apps and that kind of thing.  I don't know if I don't think it's as important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll make a counter argument.  One of the things I really like about the Android store is if you would download, if  you buy an app, download it and don't like it and delete it, immediately you have, I  don't know what, 48 hours to get a refund.  It will refund you the money automatically.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really great.  The iPhone doesn't do that.

Speaker: Pete Cashmore
Transcript:  One of the reasons you don't necessarily try masses of paid iPhone apps is exactly that  reason, like it's risk.  There's no way to try it.  Yeah.  I mean, you want to try something out and 99 cents is a good price to try something out  without having a big commit, but yeah, it's obviously better if you can get a refund.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you haven't had that happen to you, Gina, but I frequently download applications and  go, oh, why did I buy that for?  You delete it within a day, you get the money back.  I didn't realize it.  That's great.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people don't know about that.  Two good numbers, at least good numbers if you're a Google, two very encouraging numbers.  My tool of the week, very simple tool, but something new added to Google Docs.  It allows you to do kind of in a primitive way, a little OCR now in Google Docs for images  and PDFs.  So details, I apologize for this on ReadWriteWeb, but you can also go to the Google operating  system blog.  They've been playing this with us for a couple of months and you'll see when you upload PDFs  or images, there's a new checkbox convert text from PDF or image files to Google documents.  And ReadWriteWeb says that it does work better with PDFs than JPEGs, but I think that's kind  of a nice feature.  So you'll see that in the upload area when you're doing the upload, you have a checkbox  that can turn that feature on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google CL needs a parameter for this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Then you'd have command line OCR.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But you could scan business cards and like cron them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, cron them.  I'm just going to shut up.  It's just a cron job away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why I like Gina.  Gina's always thinking, where is that to do the command line to do thing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  ToDotext.com

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  ToDotext?  No, T-E-X-T.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, dot com.  And that'll redirect you to the page.  Yeah, there we go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There it is.  The to do text command line interface.  This is a Merlin man kind of a thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Totally.  This is totally like early life hacker obsessed with text files work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We still are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We still are.  Text files, they never get old.  They never go out of style.  They're like black.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And soon with Google-ish features.  Did you write this in Python?  It's shell.  It's bash.  It's all shell.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, shell.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know why I made that decision.  That's nuts.  If I were to do it again, I would have done it in Python.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Has anybody's written any shell, the bash scripts?  It's just weird.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it is weird.  It is weird.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've moved.  I mean, I now install Z shell whenever I get a command line, the Linux or Mac.  I just put Z shell on it.  I just say, I'm not going to mess with this.  Although the shell scripting is just as stupid.  And you can find her blog, smarterware.org.  Her book is The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewageguide.com.  She's a great regular on this show.  We always love to have her on.  And how is the...  I would thank you for the beta invite, by the way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, sure.  To think tank.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To think tank.  Really neat.  Now, are you going to open that up?  I guess you're just running it on your own server.  So people are supposed to install it on their server.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm getting folks with interesting data on there so I can test.  So thank you for trying it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I gave you a lot of data, probably.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you gave me a lot of data.  Absolutely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do I do with it now, though?  Is there anything I can do with it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you should ask some questions and see what kind of replies you get back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do some queries.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, do some queries and see how far your retweets reach and that kind of thing.  So I'm going to add a few more features.  I'll write you about that.  It's extremely polished.  I mean, it's really beautiful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really nice what you're doing.  Thank you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thank you for the OAuth tokens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love knowing geeks because then you get emails like that.  Hey, thanks for the OAuth tokens.  It's really been great.  Pete Cashmore, he's a geek.
