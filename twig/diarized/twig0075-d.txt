Well, happy holidays and welcome to our best of this week in Google.  I'm Leo Laporte and we thought for the holidays, we'd take a little time off, give the Twig  crew a break for a week and put together some of the best moments from 2010.  And that's what you're about to see.  Actually, as we went through it, we realized that Twig is much less about Google and much  more about Chipotle, Glee, you know, just kind of silly things.  No, there's a little Google in here too.  So Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis and I, and many of our wonderful guest hosts, you're going  to see some of the best moments in just a little bit.  Thank you for joining us all year long.  Thanks to our sponsors for supporting us.  And here's a cup of a cup of Michigan cheer to next year.  I know I'm going to hear from all my friends at the Ohio State University and everywhere  else.  Clemson.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It was the biggest mug I had.  All right.  Let's get on with it.  The best of Twig.

Transcript:  So cute  So cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm either squealing or I have tears in my eyes  watching Glee, I really get into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You really do  Wireless carriers should be allowed  to do basically anything they want  Including tier  Differentiate services  Charge more for some, less for others  Essentially, completely abrogate  any idea of net neutrality  And build  in effect what some critics have called  a dual internet, a public internet  And then a private  telecom based network  for value added services

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just the fact that  We're using the term public internet makes me want to  kind of stab myself in the eye  Because that implies that there's  another internet, which is exactly what Jeff  wrote about, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a couple of internets, right?  It's that, yes, you have this old dog  internet showing you cat videos  on YouTube  But, oh, you're not in your house  right now? Oh, that's not the internet  I said in my post, that's the Schmitternet  as in internet Schmitternet  And so, oh, it's a  new service, it's a  you know, an education service that didn't  exist before, oh, sorry, sir, that's the Schmitternet  And on the Schmitternet, we'll take you  through all of our new fees and  restrictions and regulations  Please hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me be the devil's advocate here  There's  some precedent for stuff like this  In the early days of  cable, for instance, cable  internet, the FCC gave  cable companies a lot of concessions  for instance, the power  of monopoly  saying, in order to justify  the cost of building this out  we believe the internet is important  we're going to give you some concessions here  Isn't that what's going on?  It's clear that  anybody who's using iPhone  understands that  when it comes to wireless internet, it's a  different beast, and  so doesn't it make sense that there be some concessions?  Well, yes and no, you know, I mean  It's not something else we're doing now  Sorry, Stacey, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, I was just going to say  so the wireless stuff  I will 100% agree  that you cannot have the same  exact network management  practices for wireless  They're just not enough bandwidth  But  the way that they've phrased this  instead of fighting for  as much as one could hope for  in terms of  getting some kind of reasonable network management  and coming up with some ways  to define that for wireless  that may be different from wired  Google and Verizon have  hijacked the whole process  taking it outside of the realm of the FCC  and what's likely is  Congress is going to listen to this  and say, oh yeah  and the FCC is already in a position right now  where Congress is looking a scant at it  and saying, whoa, you don't want to regulate the internet  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Stacey  I think that the problem here is that  this was not the FCC  or the government giving concessions  this was the companies asking for their own  concessions and saying this is their ideal  and you have Google  which only a year ago was pushing  for the white spaces around broadcast  to be freed  from regulations so that  they could become, quote, Wi-Fi on steroids  in their words and could provide  competition to  the wireless providers  and  the whole idea of mobile  and wireless becomes an oxymoron  it becomes ridiculous, it becomes meaningless  so I walk with my iPad  which I don't have, imagine I did  I walk with my iPad from my home when it's on Wi-Fi  I walk outside it goes to cellular  oh, sorry, you've just gone to the Schmidernet  now you can't get this  and this and this, now you have to pay for this and this and that  and if that  wireless so called  that mobile so called  came from some new provider  like white spaces  like  new technologies, where does that go?  the internet is the internet is the internet  damn it  and if we end up with multiple internets that sucks  what Stacy's really quite right about is  the problem is these guys  I still don't understand why Google did this  I do not get why Google did this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it feels like capitulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it really does and the problem is that  these guys negotiated the future of the internet  without the owners of the internet sitting there  and the owners of the internet are us, damn it  and we've got to  yell and scream and have a fit  because the internet is not Google's  it's not Verizon's, it's not the FCC's  it's ours  and I hate to plug this old post that nobody cares about  but this is why I wrote this  Bill of Rights in cyberspace  because if we the people don't stand up  on principle and say  butt out  ass swipes  get out of here, this is not yours, this is ours  yeah we pay you for the broadcast  but what we want is more competition, more choices  more openness, more development  more people on the internet  and if we start doing this, it's going to clamp down on this  and it's going to clamp down on our economy as well  sorry, end of spiel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Axel Librius  in our chat room  quotes a past Google statement  that says  there's no network problem  allegedly solved by prioritization  that cannot also be solved  by additional bandwidth  Google in the past has said just throw more bandwidth at it  now I guess that you still haven't answered  my devil's advocate question  which is  because of the bandwidth constrained nature of wireless  telecommunications, is it not  unreasonable to say  it should be treated differently than  land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by that logic then shouldn't fiber to the house be treated differently  from copper

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all right go ahead Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well I was going to say carriers can treat it  differently in a way that's  perhaps competitive  so things like congestion  pricing, and I know people hate  when, I mean people hate cured pricing  I'm against it  as a principle, but  if you're worried about congestion on your  network, don't limit people  to you know, five  gigabits or gigabytes per month  just charge them more  during times when you're experiencing  peak usage, recognize  the fact and tell consumers about the fact  that if for some  instance like a hurricane hits  yeah, their  video, their YouTube streams are going to be  you know, be prioritized below  voice calls, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had never heard that before Stacey  is that a solution that people have been proposing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's what, I mean, Eric Schmidt  will talk about that, I mean when he was  at the, oh the thing in Tahoe  last week, he talked about  you know, figuring out  how to prioritize traffic  and he made it sound like what Verizon  and they were agreeing to  was something like that  and the carriers will also say that  that's kind of their friendly face of this  but there's no rules  in place for that, and it's hard to  write those rules into legislation  without them being kind of  subverted later on  and that's why this is such a contentious issue  I don't know if you guys want nuance or not  but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we do want nuance, we're absolutely  that's kind of what the show is about  we feed on nuance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nuance is our middle name

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I think that that's, to me  you know, what you're going to see is a very  and we already have seen, is very black and white  I'm again, or  I don't know if anybody was in favor of what  Google and Verizon have done, but presumably somebody  is AT&T anyway  but I think there is more than just the yes or no to it  there is, that's what I'm trying to get at  it seems like there's some rationalization for giving  at least temporarily  and maybe that's the mistake here that this  doesn't sound like a temporary measure  but temporarily giving wireless companies  a little pass, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there's  a place  for doing  real case by case  adjudication, that's probably the wrong word  at the FCC for  net neutrality kind of rules  the problem is right now the FCC doesn't actually  unclear if they have the authority  actually  enforce any of that  which is what this whole process is designed to do  so  implementing some kind of network neutrality  in talking about  reasonable network management  on wireless networks, by saying that  you at least get something down  and then when cases come up  the FCC actually has the ability to go in  you know  say, hey carrier, don't do this  right now that doesn't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, isn't that part of that  is that the FCC of course as of right now  does not have authority over this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well there's some question about it after the Comcast  reversal  although I've talked to  a number of offline conversations with people  who say, well you can't  interpret the Comcast reversal too broadly  the court  didn't say the FCC doesn't have the right to do it  they just said it wasn't doing it correctly  in this case  so it's very unclear  what the FCC's mandate is  and of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do you want to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would love to know  what does the FCC think of this  I guess they'd be another group that's against this  because it's undermining their authority

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so my sources at the FCC  are  they're staying silent on it  they don't want to comment basically  on this because it's something that they  they feel like talking about it  condones this as a legitimate solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they don't want to legitimize it at all  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there is a clear power vacuum  there's a clear lack  of leadership  from the FCC right now  because of the whole  reclassification debate  which is what you're talking about after Comcast  where they're trying to figure that out  and net neutrality is actually  tied to that because  if they don't have the authority to  legislate net root  or regulate broadband  they can't implement  net neutrality  so they're really closely tied  and the FCC is trying to work this  from all angles  I personally think it's failing miserably  and that gave Verizon and Google  the ability to step up and  propose this and get so much  traction

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google says  they're proposing a blueprint  for legislation  it sure would be nice if Julius Genachowski  or somebody, you know somebody  at the FCC Gina, you were talking about  if somebody stood up and said  hey wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  there was a comment  there was an official comment by Michael J. Copps  he said, some will claim this announcement  moves the discussion forward  that's one of its many problems  it's time to move a decision forward  the decision to reassert FCC authority  over broadband telecommunications to guarantee  an open internet now and forever  which is my favorite part  and to put the interests of consumers in front of the interests  of giant corporations  that was the most heartening response I could have possibly  I mean that was like, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's just one of five commissioners  sorry, he's just one of five commissioners  I think that's the point  I think that's the point  I think Stacy you're right, there's a vacuum  I think Gina you're absolutely right  that what Copps says is what they should all be doing  but the problem is, he's basically protesting  against the FCC from inside the FCC  well that's  there's a long history of that  by the way  of division among FCC commissioners  that's not at all true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the point  I think that's the point  division among FCC commissioners, that's not at all unusual  I'd like to know where Genachowski stands on this  because he's the one  who needs to take a leadership role here  and he's been very outspoken  for internet  net neutrality  I think he had a lot to do with the broadband plan  that the FCC put forward  he did have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when the New York Times had that story  on Monday saying that  they had reached a deal and presented it  somewhat differently than this  Genachowski did say that basically he was pissed about this  and that there would be no more meetings under their ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's right, they did call off that  the conferences, that's right  Stacey, go ahead, your concern

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well those conferences weren't going anywhere  and so Genachowski called those off  because  they weren't making progress  so  once this whole thing became public  he knew he was going to fail  you might as well just fail  and he didn't make a deal without  being castigated for having all these secret meetings

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is what we sense happening  so instead we've got this backroom deal between  two major corporations with  what we thought were different interests  but apparently are maybe not so different

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well it's not really a deal  I mean it's not policy, right?  Verizon and Google don't create policy  it's a proposal  and also let me just say  the wireless thing broke my heart  but the rest of the document is  great, like I'm with them the whole way  the new services part, Gina?  no  the wireless part  okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what is the new services part?  let's hear that story, Jeff, what is the new services part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe Stacey's probably a better position to say it  but it's another carve out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, there are three big, I mean there are three problems  one, it emasculates the FCC  actually one would be wireless but we've talked about that  and then there's a carve out for  managed services  they don't call it that, they call it  additional network services  and that's things like  U-verse  or FiOS TV  or anything that the carrier  and the FCC has been  all the way back in October and September  was worried about this because  it's a way to say  in the worst case scenario  this may not happen  I may be crazy  but I'm going to say  we're going to develop  our broadband infrastructure  and we're going to allocate X amount of it  to our advanced network services  which cost extra  which you may have to pay as a consumer  and if you want to get on it as a service  like a web service, maybe you have to pay  maybe you don't, we're not sure  and then what happens is  you've got just like public ghetto

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, but what's wrong with that  if Verizon has a vCast service that lets you watch  broadcast television, what's wrong with them saying  that's fine, but here's the problem  it's a big open door

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a hanger door sized exception  because it says, in fact the example they give  is that if an opera  wanted to broadcast in 3D  and it used a lot of bandwidth  that's new and then that's outside of net neutrality  well so anything new  is the Schmidernet

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and that's definitely a problem  so the EF-5 makes a really good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  go ahead Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to say, the additional online services  is very vague  we don't really know what that is  they're trying to future proof, they're trying to say  new things are going to come out, we don't want to squash innovation  we want those new things to happen, we don't know what they're going to be  but we're just going to call them additional online services  that's troubling  also the definition of reasonable network management  you guys all seem to agree, oh yeah, mobile networks are different  I mean  yes, they're technically different, but are they really different  what is reasonable network management  what does that mean exactly  I felt like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it could be as much as blocking YouTube over wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right  so network  wireless networks  the constraints that they are under  you've got a certain amount of  spectrum, right  and you have a certain amount of bandwidth that fits into each  megahertz of spectrum  and the issue is  you send that to  towers and people are rooting in  and out, it's actually  really complicated to keep track of  and so  there's  the limited amount of spectrum, right  which kind of limits the capacity at any one place  and point in time  and then there's also the issue of tracking  these users as they're trying to like  stream, which is really hard and like intensive  over the wireless network  while other people are trying to do  voice calls  and maybe we shouldn't be prioritizing voice calls  and in all, like a 4G network  we won't have to because they're all IP  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  see we talk about serious stuff, net neutrality  actually a big topic of conversation  all year long and I'm sure  going into 2011 as well  we'll get even more serious in just a moment  with our conversation about man boobs  but before we  you think I'm joking?  I wish I were  Joel Johnson from Gizmodo will join us in just a little bit  but first, this is our holiday  episode in case you didn't notice  but first I want to talk a little bit about my friends  at Ford and the great  Ford Sink  that was the best thing Santa brought  me last year, it was right around this time  last year that I got my 2010 Mustang  and discovered the wonders  of Ford Sink, the whole idea  of Sink is that when you get in the car  you shouldn't be disconnected from the world  but you should still be safe  with Sink, you keep your hands  on the wheel, your eyes on the road  and yet your car is connected  you know, one of the things  Ford very intelligently realized  is that these smartphones we bring  into our cars these days  are improving at a much faster rate than any  automobile can, so by connecting  to your smartphone you get the features  of the smartphone added  to the car, that was one of the brilliant  insights behind Ford Sink  let me explain how it works  you have a button on the wheel  you press the button, the lady says  what do you want? and you tell her  and it can be everything from  setting the cabin temperature  to playing a song, playing an  artist, even playing more like that  particular song that you're listening to  right now, play next, play previous  pause, you get complete control  of your music, but you also  can get turn by turn directions  really good ones, they'll reroute around  traffic problems because it's always watching  what's going on, you also  get 911 assist which I think is  really really important, it deploys  if the airbags are deployed, it calls 911  sends them GPS coordinates  plays a message, then gives you a chance to speak  it has  let's see, direction  things you wouldn't even expect  like sports scores  you can find out how your  favorite team is doing, up to date  live sports scores, movie times  gas prices, it's a complete  informational array  weather forecast, all available  just by voice, it really  understands your voice very well, it's very effective  I've never used anything better  and I've tried them all, this is  what you want, in fact I know  a lot of people now that get emails all the time  people who said, you know, I actually bought a  Ford because of  Ford Sync, it's available in some  Ford Lincoln and Mercury vehicles, standard in  others, best thing to do, go to your Ford  dealer and give it a try, have them demonstrated  every dealer has a Sync  specialist who can show you what's going on  and  you can also go to the website  Sync My Ride  podcast.com  and they've got lots of videos there so you can kind of  see, but really the best thing to do is to test  drive the car, now before we get back  to this week in Google, I do want to mention a  contest that's about to run out, there's only  a few days left, December 31st  2010 is the deadline  if you go to twtfordfocus.com  you can enter, what they're asking is  a two minute video, the winner  will get a trip to Madrid  with a friend to test drive  the all new 2012  Ford Focus, what a car  this is, and Madrid, I mean  how nice is that, this contest is available  globally by the way to all our listeners, anywhere  in the world, you'll also get $10,000  US dollars to donate to the charity of your  choice, which is pretty special  as well, so if you want to enter this  go to twtfordfocus.com, it's a Facebook page  all the details are there, you'll be making a  two minute video saying why you should go to Madrid  which charity you support  Ford's going to donate a total of  half a million dollars in all, this is a really  really great deal, twt  ford focus dot com, I want to make  sure you knew about that, and make sure you do it  before the end of the year, available  worldwide, now  hmm, let's get back  to the important matter  at hand, Joel Johnson of Gizmodo  and  Man Boobs  that's always what it looked like, the iPad  looked like its success was that it filled  a lot of niches  yeah, it's not good at anything  yeah, well  I'm not sure I'd say that, I mean it's good, it's great  it's great for watching movies, it's great for  it's actually pretty good for reading, you're right, it's not as good as a Kindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's not, you know, it's  better to watch on a TV than an iPad, and I  love the iPad, I think it's a great platform, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you were going to buy, Joel, if you were going to buy  a device  other than a phone, well  that's even the wrong way to say it  if you were going to buy an iPad, given the  current choices, do you think you'd go for  the 7 inch Android  or Dell's 5 inch Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  oh gosh, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dell's is a joke, wait, look at that  Ad, have you seen the Dell Streak Ad?  it looks like they're holding something  that's swole up  it's just wrong, it's  like a big candy bar, like they're holding a Hershey  bar, it's just terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but it's funny that you say that, because it's still smaller  than, you know, in some dimensions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's smaller than the iPad  too, so there's a, but what I'm saying is  it's almost like uncanny valley, there's an  area between  two decent areas, which is a phone  you know, the 4.3  is as big as you can get, right, the Droid X  or the Evo, and the  iPad, which is the right size for the  iPad, and there's this, those two work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, the thing  to me, and this is  tenuously about Google, but I  do think there's, when I hold an iPad  and I use it, I feel like it's right  on the edge of being too small  like there's times where I'm like, oh, I wish this was just  a little bit bigger, but  I also don't want it to be bigger  because I want it to be portable and to carry it  around and all of that stuff, so I think a lot  of the magic in any device's  screen size is finding where that  point of tension is, where it's like  okay, this is, I wish it was  a little bit bigger, but I'm glad it's no bigger  and the iPhone does that very well  and the iPad does that very well  and all of these other explorations of  screen sizes, I don't think there's a magic number  but I think it's, there's  probably a magic zone that Apple's  probably somewhere within it and there's  not a lot of room to play there. Yeah, so Steve was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, Steve was right. Gina, are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you tempted by any of these tablets yet?  No, not yet. It's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  be a while. They gotta work it out. What are you waiting for?  I'm not going to be tempted until Google says this is the  right version of Android to run on a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know what they're saying now, and 3.0  is imminent, right? Gingerbread. Yeah.  Although somebody said 2.3  is out, coming out soon too. I'm  very confused. So there's 2.3  maybe an interim thing, then Gingerbread, because they already  got the Gingerbread man  and then  but it turns out that  it's Honeycomb, really, is what  you want. I'm very confused. Google's message  is not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It isn't, and this is an Android problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hurting them though. Well, they're selling a lot  of phones, God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At some point it becomes a generic device, I think,  is that yes, there's the magic to  the iPhone, fine,  and the iPad, but then beyond that  I went to the quadrangle  force-query conflict. So, you know, wait a minute, just real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the phone in her hand.  They need to hire, this is the Dell  StreakEd, they need to hire  models with bigger hands.  Yeah, they do it, we talked about this one.  Basketball players. Yeah. Because look at that,  there's something just  not right about it.  It's like, look how big that is.  I don't know. She carries it well though.  She carries it well. And then he's got  one, and look, they both have weird chocolate bars  in their hands.  You're meant for each other.  Yeah. Oh, you're one of the three  other people who have this phone. We must be true  love. So that's the Dell Streak,  that's a five-incher.  Seven-inch is not quite right.  Part of this also is really, the  operating system and apps have to,  this is what Steve actually  said in that  earnings call. He said,  it's a developer issue. They're not thinking  like developers, they're thinking like, how are hardware manufacturers?  We can make it. He says, but we're software  guys, we think, yeah, but how's it going  to look? And can you make software  that fits on a  three-and-a-half, four, five,  seven, and up  screen that works on all of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also though  pocket size, right? I think  that the Streak is the largest possible  thing that will fit in at least a man's  pocket. Will it fit in your pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll fit in my jacket pocket. Your coat pocket.  But you know what, Jeff, you're the last  man who still wears a jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It fits in my ironic overalls front pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Osh kosh, bagosh,  there you go. But no, I think it  has to fit in the breast pocket of your shirt,  doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who even puts a phone in  the breast pocket? Phones are for pockets  at best. Maybe belt clips  if you must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he got rid of his pocket protector, so just don't make fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of him. You're telling me  that you think it's superior to have  a belt  carrier than having it in your  front pocket? No.  Like thigh pocket. Hip pocket, no, because  I have keys in one and wallet in the other  and I don't want to sit on it so I can't put it in my  butt pocket. So it's got to go on the front.  And really, am I nerdy for putting my phone  there? I don't think you're supposed to put anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in your front pockets. I think  except for  handkerchiefs is like the only thing that is  possibly supposed to go in there. You want to know the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  truth? Half the time I got two phones in my front pocket.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, we're all outliers, you know, like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you've ever looked at a Scott  Evest and been like, well, maybe, then you're  like really fashionist kind of. Joel,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Joel, that's all I own. This is a Scott  Evest shirt. I like Scott Evest

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  stuff, but I'm just saying if you're at that point  where you're looking for cable runs in your shirt,  like you can kind of  work within. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why I keep it in my front pocket because I have a hole  there that can go right up through here to the headphones  and go around my back and it's never

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mine. All I'm saying is you're part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just feel that  it camouflages my man boobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And not accentuate them. You take on geek boobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might accentuate them. I never

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  thought of that. Well, that's the thing. Accentuate  just once. You're like, you know, you got the  like pretty boob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This really has changed  my entire perspective on it. So  I'd like to rescind everything I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  said before. No, you were right. They're agreeing  with you. Don't put it in your breast pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I think to get back to the size  of things like it's  you're never going to put an iPad in your pocket, which  means it might be the right size,  you know, and all these other tablets  anytime they should. This is  so typical. I mean, I've seen it hundreds  of times over the years as a gadget blogger.  It's like they'll show you these model  pictures of people using it.  And it has absolutely no relevance  to the real world. So  you have to actually look out in the real world and see  what people would do with it. Or  what I often do is take stuff  and show my friends like at a bar or  something and say like, what would you do with this? And  if they wouldn't put it in their pocket,  then, you know, it's not, nobody else is going.  We're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about Android, some Android sales  numbers out. We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Gina's got a, but you haven't set  it up yet, the Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not yet. I haven't received it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have mine. I've talked about it already  a little bit. Yeah.  You've got to ruin me. You know, I'm really  tempted to unhook it, but I'm waiting until  Gina, you know, here's, well, we'll talk  about it in a second. There is a deal.  Have you seen this?  This is the new Windows Mobile Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I saw you showing it off. I was watching  your demo a little bit before the show. It's Windows. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mobile. You know, it's sad. It's  slidey. It's actually very snappy.  Had this come out  before the iPhone and the  Android phone, you'd be going,  this is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would that have come out before

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android and iPhone? Oh, well, I guess not.  Not in that way. I guess not.  But you like it. Well, it's fine. But  we already have Android and iPhone.  And BlackBerry,  if you want to be really generous.  Is there any logic to it? How's the UI?  It's fine. I love it.  It's a nice UI.  It's very usable.  It's very, I'll tell you  what. There's a lesson for Google in a couple of  areas. First of  all, because Microsoft  said this is the hardware spec  and you must adhere to the hardware spec,  all of them have  the same 5 megapixel camera, the same  gigahertz processor.  There is a varied amount of RAM  and storage, but  essentially you're getting an  800 by 480 screen. There's a certain  consistency across the hardware  that is a good thing. And that's one of the problems  Android has. But of course, Android's  open. I was thinking about this this morning.  Google, of course, knew that  that would be an issue, but they chose  from a philosophical point of view,  we prefer to open source it  to keep the open handset alliance  to let the manufacturers  do what they want with it because, and it's worked  for them, we're going to talk about those numbers in a bit,  but on the other hand, I think Microsoft can  quite reasonably say, yes, but look, this is a very  consistent experience across the board.  This is the Samsung focus, which  is very much like the Captivate,  the Galaxy S that Samsung has  Android on, so just think of it kind of as a Galaxy S.  Are you taking Pilates?  Yeah, every three times a week.  You should see my core.  I'm working on my, it's all about the man boobs.  So,  these are the tiles, you see, and you can have your friends  in the, you know, you can have these, everybody  has a tile. It's very people  focused and socially focused.  So, you see how quickly that works though?  So, you can see, I mean, there's just,  these are recent calls. Gina, I don't  see us there. We don't have tiles. Well, you don't,  you would have a tile if you would tweet or  Facebook more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every company learns this. At the beginning of AOL,  very back in the early days, they made breast  a bad word, and the breast cancer  community was, of course, properly  up at arms. Not to mention Foster Farms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  How are you going to search for chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't search for Jeff's penis  posts either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now that's a disservice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's bad. Wait a minute. Let me just search for  J-E-F-F  apostrophe S  P-E-N-I-F-F  Well, I got small penis jokes,  Ignite Airport Meltdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it goes blank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm so sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're going to have parents  kind of looking over the shoulder of kids from across the room  going, I see that screen is white.  What are you searching for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kids? What were you thinking?  So, if I search for B-O-O-B

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  B-O-O-B  There it goes.  It's going to be a new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we have a new dictionary of  white words we'll call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  White words.  All right.  Well,  we took ten minutes and we've discussed the whole thing.  Is there anything more to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's some subtleties to this.  The thing is that Google has  said in the past that 20% of queries  are unique and at any given time  are unique they've never seen before.  What?  Wow.  That's a stat that they published several times  and I can find science.  One in five. Wow.  Because there's diverse number of things that people type into it.  Which makes some sense.  This was always their point about serving the long tail  and not just doing the top few queries.  And that was a Google in-depth thing  that helped them compete with others.  But this is going to change that because  you're going to get a lot closer to other people's queries all the time.  There's a subtle effect from that.  Which is that you're gradually being  pushed into the things that other people have searched for before.  We've had a bit of that with the autocomplete already  but this is going to make that much stronger.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  That sounds like a bad thing.  I think it's a bad thing.  It's suddenly Google is very normative.  I read a long post about this last night when I was playing with  the Google scribe thing.  Which we can maybe talk about in a bit.  But that was like  I'm trying to come up with a search that nobody's ever typed before.  Baboon frenzy inside my pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, there's a search.  Put that in quotes.  Alright, let's see.  I have to pluralize.  Remember when we used to play the game Google Wax?  Leo, add Piers Zador to it.  You'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No results found for baboon frenzy inside my pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to pluralize.  I have to pluralize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to pluralize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to pluralize.  I have to pluralize.  I have to pluralize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No results found for baboon frenzy inside my pants.  I have found the end of the internet.  Piers Zador, baboon frenzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to be the first time.  It just stuns me.  Sorry, it does not sound credible that one in five searches  are something Google's never seen before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of the stats that has stuck with me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it is so striking.  What are people searching for  that's so bizarre and weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just that language is generative  and it's hard to put words together to make a phrase  that no one's ever said before.  Well, you can, but it's usually nonsense.  Well, no.  That's the way that language is structured.  It isn't.  You have clusters of ideas.  The only interesting thing they said in response to that  was that when they watch people using it,  we were talking about, well, this is going to mean that  you don't have to just get on the first page.  You have to get on the first three results  for the first two letters.  But they said people will keep typing stuff  and try and bring the one they want up to the top,  even if it's like forward down.  They're going, I want it further up.  I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they move it up the screen.  Kevin, I think you raise a really important point on the industry here  is that for various reasons  we see the defrocking of the SEO wizards.  Number one, because we see  how much more personalized search is.  And so it's hard to say, well, I rose you up  ten stops from Gina  you didn't, but from Kevin you didn't.  And also, I think you're right.  What you just said is that the first page isn't even the issue.  The first three listings  are the issue.  Right.  And back to your other point, Leo, about going to all the same.  It's not just that you go to the same that  everyone else goes to.  Because it's personalized, it's going to go to what I've gone to all the time before.  And someone on Twitter said to me,  I don't want to go to what I've gone to before.  I want to be surprised. I want to go to a new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, the chat room is explaining to me  why one in five has never before  been seen in Google.  And the second thing is misspellings.  And languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially generative language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, I think people are idiots. That's really the reason.  But now Google does  of course the spelling corrections.  And these work as well in this instance search.  So if I start typing  C-A-L-A  calendar, properly  spelled is the first item on there.  So the spelling suggestions  get now kind of  incorporated into  the search results.  It doesn't even say  did you mean calendar.  So this is  I think this is helpful. I'll be very curious.  Somebody asked Marissa,  well how many people in your testing  said they didn't want it?  And she said some did, but you could turn it off.  I'd be curious to see what the  results are in that regard. If a lot  of people turn it off or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What else?  Justin Bieber has J-U.  Not only does the guy have his own  racks at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that? He's got like three or four servers.  That's a myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's got J-U. Does he have J-U for you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope.  Somebody's been searching a little  too much for Justin  Bieber. I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Justin TV I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I get Justin TV. But J-U-S gives me  Justin Bieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Interesting. I really don't search for Justin Bieber very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Justin Bieber tattoo.  Now that's what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in the early days.  I was one of the Jeffs on the first page.  But I can't even find myself now.  But you make a good point because I was typing in Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I show up very well  if I'm logged in.  But as soon as I log out,  it's that stupid  Deutsch English dictionary.  leodict.leo.org  that beats me every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You win Leo space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Leo in my own Leo space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Life of Leo is top  result for Leo.  And Leonardo da Vinci.  Pretty good company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not Leonardo DiCaprio.  He's there too.  TMZ searches are coming through, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just going to  shut up. I'm going to stop revealing my own.  It's revealing, isn't it? That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very revealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm reading it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to shut up now.  Leo gets me first.  Then Leonardo DiCaprio, Leonard Cohen,  Leona Lewis, and Leo Laporte.  But that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I get you number five.  That's the normal search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I log out,  and I type Leo, I will be sixth  down on the list if I log out.  So it really is paying quite a bit of attention  to your search history, obviously.  Which it should.  Now, where does that happen?  Is that happening in the server side  or the client side? Is Google sending to the browser  my search history? I guess it knows.  No one knows it because it's in the server.  Yeah, they have it on the server side.  That's one of the settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the feet of engineering  right here.  Not to be a total Google fan girl.  I am already. Sometimes I feel bad about  being so far up one company's butt.  But this is a pretty good butt to be  because this is really amazing.  This is like a feet  of engineering, what's going on here.  I'm starting to just get a little experience  with non-trivial data with ThinkUp.  It's hard and it's slow.  It's incredible what they're doing here.  I want to just  acknowledge that.  What's going on is really kind of amazing  at the speed that it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what saddens me is  I'm watching the chat room.  During Mac Great Weeklys, I'm talking  about the fact that this is  a bad trend towards a closed  ecosystem.  They're going, oh, you sound like such an old man.  There's a great  comic, XKCD comic,  I'll see if I can find it,  in which  the open source hacker guy is saying,  I'm fighting to keep this stuff  open for you.  But I like it closed. I like it.  It's good. Then of course it closes in  on the normal guy.  The hacker said, I told you.  We're fighting  for you, baby. You got to understand.  It feels good now, but it's not going to feel good  in the long run.  What are we going to do about it?  Damn it. Well, I'm doing everything I can  on this network to raise people's awareness.  You are. Unfortunately, the people  who watch this are probably already aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all have the same email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're preaching the choir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  We need to save the link and save cookies, t-shirts.  Jeff, you really are  doing a lot. I mean, you're really  getting out there. Did you say you filed  with the Supreme Court in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they came to me on this case  because I write about the link economy and the value of the link.  These lawyers recognized, they were smart enough  to realize that what could happen here is the degradation  of the value of the link.  So  I gave them a bunch of my stuff and I filed  this little affidavit. I  amended what they wrote for me. They interviewed me, then wrote it.  They used words like  verily.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love it. And so I  added something in there about how  doing this to the link would put a chill  on free speech. And they said, oh, oh, oh, no, sorry.  That would be very cheeky to say to the Supreme Court of Canada.  I said, I'm American. Of course I'm cheeky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm cheeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're out of the East. This is the  XKCD cartoon.  2003. Did you get my essay?  Yeah, it was good, but it was a doc.  You really should use it more often.  Give it a rest already. Maybe we just want to live our lives  and use software that works, not get wrapped up  in your stupid nerd turf wars.  I just want people to care  about infrastructures we're building.  No, you just want to feel smugly superior. You have no  sense of perspective and are probably autistic.  Flash forward  seven years later, 2010. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We handed control of our social world to Facebook  and they're doing evil stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see this? It's the world's  tiniest open source violin.  It says it all right there.  I love XKCD.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The smallest open source violin.  I love that.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The world's smallest open source violin.  I love that comic.  Actually, people, I got an email the other day  from somebody who said, you guys talk too much about open,  so I sent him a link to that comic and said,  it's important. It's important.  Even XKCD says so.  So we're going to come back. We've got lots more.  This is our holiday special.  This week in Google, some of the best moments  from 2010 with Gina and Jeff  and the gang, and we're glad  you're here and hope you're enjoying your holiday  season. We decided to take this week off  so we could spend time with family  and friends for the holidays. But we'll  be back next week with more this week in Google.  We do the show live every  Wednesday at 1 p.m.  Pacific time. That's 4 p.m. Eastern  on live.twit.tv.  And we do invite you to join us live. We  watch the chat room and often have feedback from the chat  room so you can chat along with us as we're doing  the show. And also, there's stuff before,  during, and after that gets edited out.  And it's a lot of fun, too.  I think watching it live is always best if you can.  Live.twit.tv.  And who knows, maybe I'll get another Chipotle bowl  before the end of the year.  Let's, oh, we're going to get back in just  a second with more from Twig. But before we do,  I want to talk a little bit about anti-spam  filtering. You know, if you use Gmail  for your mail, you don't have to worry about spam.  But there are many of us, I include  myself, who run our own servers. I run  leoville.com.  Some companies don't want Gmail to have  access to their email for  security reasons. Maybe they can't  for legal reasons.  HIPAA and so forth.  For those people, people who run their own servers,  finding spam is a big  deal. And that's where MailRoute is  such a blessing. I've been using it since 2004.  Very low.  One in 250,000 false positive  rate. I find it even lower  than that. In fact, I've never had a problem  with false positives. MailRoute just gets  the spam and leaves the rest.  And it does it transparently, easily.  If you can change an MX record,  you can use MailRoute. Find out more  at mailroute.info. Very affordable.  A great deal. My friend Tom Johnson  does this. And I love giving him a plug,  because he's been doing such a great job fighting  spam for me since 2004.  mailroute.info.  Use that URL. You get 10% off  the life of your account.  Now, back to this  week in Google.  Jeff, Gina, and  me. And what are we going to talk about on this  episode? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That desktop app for Google Voice.  Well, I'll let Gina explain.  If you don't have a Google Voice account,  go and get one. Because  it's open to the world now. Everybody can have  one. Well, in the US. Yeah.  I'm sorry. Did I say the world?  The US. I got in big trouble for that.  So you're right. Just walk now for you.  Right. Because, you know, a third of  our audience is outside the US. So a third of you cannot  get this. Yeah. Oh, yeah.  This. That's what the best.  Yeah, you should do this show  in German, because we have a huge German  audience. A lot of Scandinavians,  a lot of Brits, Canadians, Australians.  It's, you know,  it's the nature of the internet  broadcasting is not national.  And that throws  everybody, including all of our advertisers for  a loop. And us, right? Because we  would say, go out and get Google Voice  and they, no, can't.  Stop telling me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't realize what a big fat American I was until  I started writing online. It's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exactly. It's really good for us  to remind us we are not the only  ones. We are not the only ones. Well,  if you live in the US, do get Google Voice, because  it's really a great. And if you have, if you're  in fact, it's like I said at the beginning of the show, this  is the reason you use an Android phone. It  becomes your voicemail on your Android phone.  It's so much better.  I know people love the Apple visual voicemail.  I like the, I really  prefer it because I can get texts. I get  the emails. I can listen. I mean, just better  all around. Anyway, so what  is this petition  to do something different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on Google Voice? Well, to make a desktop  app, because it's become religion  in Google, according to the founders,  that they will only do browser apps.  And now you have people saying, no, we,  it's not good enough. Browser is not  ready. We want a Google Voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  desktop. Well, the problem comes from  the fact that they acquired Gizmo and promptly killed  the Gizmo app. Right. And that  was a great app.  It was a SIP phone  that you could use. There are other apps out there,  but I thought Gizmo was the best of them all.  So they  already have the app. It's almost like  you just release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, it's really interesting. It's really a very  hard stand, you know, that their platform  is the browser and they want to  stick to it. But, you know, Google has  some desktop apps,  Picasa, right? I mean, there are  some installable Google desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Earth, Google Desktop, Picasa.  What a smother. Don't kill Google Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd be furious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there are just, there are some apps  that just, you know, work better on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the desktop. But what happens if you go to  a Chromium world  and the Chrome browser  is operating system? Right.  Are they going to have apps that won't work then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for once they're thinking  ahead in that way. But I think what's really cool  here is the opportunity for Google to be  the anti-Apple.  No one would ever think of telling Steve what to do.  Ever. Right.  But thousands are  ganging up to think, well, Google might listen to us.  I think they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google should listen. Yeah. I think they should.  If there's a demand for it, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel like Google's had been really good about  having this, about showing that they listen  and having this sort of continual conversation with users.  Right. You know, unlike  the sort of letter from Steve Jobs on  high, it seems like Google's been doing  especially a good job in the past couple of years of  blogging and responding  and changing things when they didn't work. You know, when the background  images rolled out, they pulled them back  immediately. I mean, you know, they're  Although you can do it now. You know, you can  do it. You opt in. Right. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks so much like Bing, but I actually did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some of the images are really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beautiful. I kind of like having an image  on my Google.  See, I've got the, I don't know what that's the Casbah  or something. I don't know what that is, but it looks so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like Bing. Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlike Bing, though. Bing, it changes every day.  On this, you have to change it  by hand, which I think is not good.  I mean, it's pretty.  I can remove it.  And then you click change background image  and then they give you some choices.  But you could do it from your own photos.  There's some really pretty images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't see why they  wouldn't just have a desktop app and a  browser-based Google voice.  You know,  all their desktop apps have  sort of web counterparts, right?  So like Google Earth is Google Maps,  Picasa is Picasa Web.  Even Google Desktop kind of integrates  web search results with your desktop  search results. I don't see why they  couldn't do both, especially like you said, Leo.  They have the app, right?  They have the Gizmo app.  It would just be a matter of rebranding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen this Chrome  Fastball game?  Did we talk about this last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We did. It was down when we tried it last week.  Is it back up? I hadn't tried it since we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We couldn't try it before.  This is because they build Flash  now. Yes, it's up!  They build Flash now into the  browser.  It comes with Chrome now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What am I supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's going on?  Help! Help! What am I supposed  to do? Is it just doing it? Am I supposed  to click on anything?  Oh, I see.  Choose the fastest mode of  transportation between point A and point B.  A straight line? I don't know.  Huh?  Bicycle!  Biking. Five minutes.  Get there faster.  Car! Four minutes. Yes, that's it.  Chrome Fast.  That's kind of a stupid game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's happening? I don't know what the hell's  happening. Tweet the fastest ball you can  think of.  A cheetah ball.  Cheetah ball.  That's the fastest ball. And then what is this  tweeting? It's not a ball I recognize.  Fastball.  Fastball.  Fastball.  Okay, there, I'm tweeting it. That speed depends on you,  my friend. We'll give you an average speed this time.  That's an average ball penalty of five tweets.  I don't even know what's going on!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh,  jeez!  Have you played this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I haven't, but  now I'm scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, translate text.  Translate that. That looks like it's in  I'm going to say Hungarian.  Translated into English.  Translate. No, close, but  try again with fewer options.  If you get everything right, you get a job at Google.  It's not, it's finished.  It's finished. That's it.  I think the ball was lost in translation. Oh, jeez.  Oh, Icelandic.  It's close. I know, it's making me crazy.  It says a ball in motion will stay in motion.  Do you think it's different every time?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get it either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very postmodern, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choose an artist.  Selected artist. Bridge. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Help the ball by spelling bridge out of  band names. Beatles.  You guys aren't helping me at all.  Rihanna.  I didn't spell the other services.  I didn't spell the other services.  I didn't spell the other services.  I didn't spell the other services.  Artist Iggy Pop.  Daba.  Daba?  Daba.  D, it has to begin with a D.  Oh, D, I thought it was Rihanna.  No, no, no. D, D, D.  Danger Mouse.  Danger Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, doors, that was better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, G.  Gorillas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gorillas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With a Z.  With a Z.  Did I spell it wrong? Oh, two L's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, two L's and a Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, and finally  an artist that begins with an E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elton John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enya.  This is very revealing.  It is, it's way too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  revealing. I hope they don't collate this information.  So my time is two.  Wait a minute, there's more. Search for three things  that have decreasing search results.  Jeff Jarvis.  Okay.  Leo Leporte.  Yes, so far so good.  Okay, who's less than us?  Jeff.  Dan.  Jason Calacanis.  Jason, there you go.  There you go. I like your thinking.  And we win!  No!  There's three minutes and 25 seconds  of your life you'll never get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As they used to say on David  Letterman, network time wasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My final time, hey, I was pretty good.  I ranked 11,853 out of  39,449 players.  So, and they give you, the record  time on the tour to Twitter is five seconds.  Map lap six seconds.  But see, I think next time I'll do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Next time you'll be way faster because  you've got it down now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't even know what the rules were at first.  I couldn't figure out what the hell I was doing.  I'm amazed I finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like, incorporated all these other  services, you know, like Twitter and LastFM.  You know, these were their competitors  essentially and they're promoting them.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My initial concern with Twitter is I thought that I would be tweeting  whatever I said. It wasn't clear.  So it's just a phony Twitter.  It was fun.  I liked that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now time.  Gina Tripani for your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quick tip.  If you are logged into Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but you don't love going to sites like  Yelp or Lifehacker or different places  where it says, your friend Leo  has liked this.  I hate that.  If that kind of creeps you out a little bit,  there is a Google Chrome extension.  It is called Facebook Disconnect.  And I think this is kind of funny.  This extension was developed by an engineer  at Google who works on the Chromium project.  But this extension doesn't have anything to do with Google.  It's not endorsed by Google.  But the like button goes away.  The Facebook connect button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of that stuff goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All that stuff goes away.  So it blocks the flow of traffic  from third party websites to Facebook.  So it's really kind of a privacy protector.  So if someone has a direct link to Facebook,  you will still see that.  It blocks those JavaScript embeds that say,  that list your friends faces and say,  they like this or instant personalization is turned on.  So once you install it,  and Leo is doing it right now,  if you go to sites that have that Facebook integration,  you won't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me try it now. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's go to Yelp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it when I go to Yelp and it says,  hey Leo, how are you doing?  You know, your friends. Oh, nothing.  Nothing. Up at the top. I love it.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kind of nice. So it's kind of like a condom for Facebook.  It does work on Chrome.  And it's a Chrome extension.  You know, I really didn't plan to say that.  And I'm kind of regretting what I did.  Think of it as a latex sheath to protect you.  It gets Facebook out of all your other third party sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you'd like to keep your activity there private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  And I'm going to stop blushing now.  I'll continue, Gina.  I just saw a tweet that the person who  posted the tweet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was a Facebook fan.  I think it was a Facebook fan.  I just saw a tweet that the person  doing the Canadian suit  or involved his name, John Newton,  and it's the P2Pnet  is his case.  So he just tweeted, oh, we're talking about the case, his case  on there. And I look at his feed  and I see this from four hours ago.  Google Android, a little bit open source,  quote, sort of like a partial circumcision.  So there, Gina, that's the theme of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.  It's always about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  penises. Jeff's on the show.  All right.  That's what we'll do. It's Rob Houghton did  it for us.  Because we were talking  last week about wearing  our slankets,  which look like monks robes,  and walking down the streets of Austin,  humming the glugorian chant.  I'll tell you, I'll just play a little bit of it,  and then I'll play the full version for you at the end of the show.  How about that?  It is, it is  dramatic. It is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is  very,  very googly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very good.  It goes on for a couple of minutes and it gets very

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  jazzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People have been complaining, and I don't blame them,  about this silly music that I started  this show with.  Some silly classical thing.  I had this notion that there would be the three of us  and it was kind of like we were fuging  with each other.  I should do some counterpoint.  It just was a bad idea.  I was like, I'm going to do this.  So we'll fight a better theme.  And this might be ending.  It sounds very cloudy though, the classical theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the idea.  It was Google in the cloud.  It's exactly right.  You introduced it as like not just about Google with the cloud  too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with theme music  is unless you use real music,  it all sounds like bad  local news themes.  And now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the action news team.  Gina Trapani with Sports,  Jeff Jarvis with the Weather,  and Kevin Purdy with the News.  Doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's feeling very Anchorman right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screw you, San Diego.  No, I wasn't quite like that.  Stay classy.  Stay classy.  I'm going to do my best.  Well, that's it for our Best of this week  in Google. Hope you've enjoyed it.  I hope you're enjoying your holidays.  I hope Jeff and Gina are enjoying their Chipotle  bowls right as we speak  right now because they're getting a week off.  We'll be back next week though with all new material  for you  from this week in Google in the cloud.  I'm Leo Laporte. Have a  happy, happy, happy, happy holiday.  And we'll see you in 2011.  Cheers everyone. Bye bye.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have a few tweets.  People telling me Chipotle  barbeque is made from beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does taste, I can't tell the difference.  It's barbeque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like pulled pork.  I've never had that.  Yeah, I usually go for the chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This steak's pretty good too.  Well, I didn't know. I just, that sounded

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the most exotic. I wish I should have asked you  for consultant.  Oh, this won't be your last burrito bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There'll be more.  There'll be more opportunities, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay. You know, we have all these  like real Mexican. Oh, yeah.  By the way, the selling point, it's  not owned by McDonald's anymore.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good. Whoa.  Oh dear.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's Chipotle everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I love Twig.  It's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lunch edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CBS this ain't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  It's getting less so all the time. People say, oh,  we don't want you to move to that new building because you'll get all  professional. I say no. No, it's true.  Fear not.  Although, there's a rumor  which we will talk about.  But first,  but first, let me begin the  program.  And then we should save all the good, all  this good stuff for the show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that is quite good.  There's something about it.  Yeah. It probably put something in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's the beef?  It's a crack

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  burrito. Yeah.  I can see how you get addicted to that. That's quite good.
