Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis is in an aeroplane. Otherwise he would be here.  But filling in for him quite ably, our news director, Mr. Mike Elgin, host of Tech News Today, every Monday through Friday on the network.  It's good to see you. And a rabid Google-plusser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. You can just call me Jeff Jarvis and I'll try to support the Chromebook Pixel and Rip Verizon.  You like Chromebooks.  I love Chromebook Pixels.  But you're using a Mac right there.  I was on the fence. I needed, after trying a Chromebook Pixel for a month, I went on the Chromebook Pixel diet.  I just couldn't give up that high-quality screen. So I was between a MacBook Pro Retina and Chromebook Pixel.  Went with the Retina. And now I regret it.  It's a tough one. You regret it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of.  I long for the simplicity and assurance of knowing everything's in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike has 3.3 million followers on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Popular man.  Wow is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little point about that that's kind of interesting because there's been controversy about whether Google+, is waning, whether they're going to kill it, all that kind of stuff.  I sort of measure the rate of getting new users as a metric for incoming new users for the service itself.  Because I'm on the suggested users list.  And it hasn't changed a bit.  The same number you get every week.  I get 2,000 additional followers, circle friends, or whatever you want to call them, a day.  And that's been consistent, give or take a couple hundred, for two years.  Wow.  And in recent days it hasn't changed at all.  Wow.  Still getting new users.  Still getting new users.  And those are people not accidental users.  Those people are signing up to get, to follow people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the key because somebody's not going to circle you unless they're actually actively going to try to use Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to take action as a knowing user to do that.  Right.  So that's pretty cool.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also here you heard her, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  She's of course at ThinkUp.com.  They're in the offices right now.  And we will talk the Google, if you don't mind.  Starting off with, well there's a couple of interesting stories, but it's really interesting.  Everywhere on Google+, you saw pictures of the self-driving car.  The one without, the new one without the steering wheels or brakes.  Where you sit in the back seat and there's no driver in the front.  And I thought, you know, I'm seeing this a lot on Google+.  Let me just check.  I wasn't on Facebook at all for me.  So it's something Google folks are very interested in.  Everybody reshared it.  Kara Swisher got a ride in the car.  And there's a promotional video that Google has put out as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see anything on Twitter for you, Leo?  I saw a few of my friends on Twitter talking about it.  They were actually referring to the car.  There was one of my friends made up a little symbol for it.  It was like, you know, a zero, underscore, underscore, underscore, underscore, zero.  And uniformly on Twitter, people were making fun of the design.  And uniformly on Google+, everyone was just like, want, want.  So it's so interesting to see how different communities respond, particularly to Google.  I think particularly Google is and their sort of Google X products are very polarizing, I find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's almost too soon because the first reaction I have, first of all, it's Kara called it a clown car.  It's a tiny little two seater.  And the first reaction I had is that looks just dangerous.  Yep.  I think the idea of an actual human sitting there with his hands near the wheels, I can handle.  But you're sitting in the back seat.  This is straight out of the TV show Silicon Valley.  You have no control and no override.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this particular prototype has no controls.  The real prototypes, which are coming, they're going to build about 100 of them, will have controls.  They'll have brakes.  This is just a demo.  I think that's probably more complex to have dual controls.  And they have a bunch of safety features.  For example, they limit the speed to 25 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like they were just driving in the parking lot pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were in the parking lot.  I found the video kind of fluffy, I'll be honest.  They're in a parking lot driving around 25 miles per hour.  They had like a young kid and an older couple and someone sight impaired, vision impaired.  It felt like, I mean, it was certainly a marketing video, but there was no explanation about, you know, my question was like,  oh, so no one can hit the brake or who's programming where they're going.  There was no interaction with the car.  It's autonomous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nobody at the controls at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But to Gina's point, there isn't even an obvious mechanism for people to say where they want to go.  There's a single button which starts it and stops it.  And that's it.  So it's like, OK, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I've ridden in autonomous vehicles at CES.  Chevy, I think it was Chevy, had some urban, I almost want to say urban assault vehicles,  but they were designed for crowded urban areas.  They were same thing, kind of a pod.  One, it was a one person, or maybe it was a two, yeah, I guess it was a two person pod.  You had no control.  The hood came down over you.  And the idea was they could daisy chain them.  One could follow another and you'd say go to school and so forth.  And that didn't scare me because we were in a parking lot.  I don't know.  There's something about 25 miles an hour is not, you know, if you get in a wreck with a tree at 25 miles an hour, it's not safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in the defense of the car, what they're actually trying to do here is accelerate the development of self-driving cars.  So right now, if you put this electronics, these radar and lasers and stuff, that circular thing on the top, on top of a Lexus.  Lidar.  Right. So you're kind of it's a half halfway point with a car like this is a purpose built car.  You can have sensors built into the sides.  You can have the front of it is very snub nose like the front of it just goes down immediately.  That actually has a safety benefit and a navigation benefit because you can the sensors can see right down on the road.  So they're trying to sort of step ahead of where self-driving cars are going to be so that they can accelerate the development of it.  So that's a that's a laudable goal.  They shouldn't be raising expectations that these things are going to be on the road in a couple of years.  But I think part of the goal here is to sell this to lawmakers and to the voting public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like I said, all I got was queasy.  And by the way, here it wasn't a Kara.  Kara was a ride along was Liz Gaines, who called it a clown car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's missing messing up the metaphor, though.  Clown car is a car where lots of people get a small car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say it's the opposite of a clown car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this this makes me think of when they inevitably have a recall.  All the cars are just going to autonomously go in en masse back to the mothership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said, of course, you don't tell it where to go.  Google already knows where you want to go.  They just find the Google Now card and steer the car that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just tell your phone like Google will drive me to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they know.  It makes me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of an obvious idea at the same time, like the fact that there's no overrun.  Why don't we just create cars that are self-driving from the start?  So it's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also that was the fictional comic idea they had in Silicon Valley, of course, where in that scenario,  Hooli, which is the fake Google, the guy got in the car and he ended up in a shipping container and then in the middle of the ocean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said, let me get your car.  We'll take you home.  And he got in the Hooli car and he says home and the car says, OK, here we go.  And then all of a sudden, for no reason at all, the car says, Whoa, wait a minute.  We're rerouting.  And it has a big U-turn.  He gets in a shipping container.  He can't get out.  And he's suddenly on an island that the Hooli founder is building.  It's actually probably reflects a little bit of the real world thinking about the fear, the fear, the fear about the robots taking over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's the thing.  That's a huge cultural uphill battle from a marketing perspective, right, for Google to get consumers to accept this and get excited about it.  And I think this kind of video is the beginning of that.  I just I don't know.  They have a lot of work to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason that works is comic writing is that we've all had that experience with Google Maps.  We feel that way.  How many times has Google Maps led you into the middle of the ocean or something like that?  Well, you know, it's a good thing that my car isn't directly tapped into this thing or I'd be mighty wet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the idea.  You know what Ford always said to me is, well, we're going to start by driver assist and we're going to get you used to it by helping you.  People. In fact, that's what Alan Mulally said.  People like to drive.  We're just going to give you tools to make you a safer, better driver.  Yeah.  My car does that.  You know, it knows when there's somebody in the in the blind spot and it tells me if I try to go in that lane, things like that.  Yeah, I think that's good.  That's that's useful.  I just don't like the idea of it not having any pedals or there's just no override at all.  Right.  Presumably a real a real self-driving car would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that was the thing about the scene in Silicon Valley.  Right.  When you say no, stop.  I mean, clearly any car that does this would be designed to have some sort of override by the person.  And you know, I had the impression that the person back at Hooli had had said to the car, OK, now we're going to the island.  Right.  And then and then it changed route and he wasn't able to override that.  And you know, whatever.  I was like, this is clearly not how it goes on.  And then he got to the island and there's no humans there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all robots.  It's all just androids.  It's all androids.  You can't get home.  Here's a 25.  Somebody sent me a Chevy Camaro crashing at 25 miles.  That's a Volvo.  OK.  Crashing at 25 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's not terrible.  You're not dead.  You're not dead, but you're pretty hurt.  And your front end is pretty smashed.  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty smashed up to the front wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a conversation about this with a BBC reporter who wrote about this on Tech News Today this morning.  And Google is actually designing the navigation and the crash features for to to to maximize human life, whether it's yours or someone else's.  So theoretically, their system will will deliberately kill you if it saves.  No, really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was this we talked a little bit on this too.  If there's a driver with a motor a motorcyclist in the left lane with a helmet and one without a helmet in the right lane and you have to quickly swerve, do you go for the guy with or without the helmet?  You're saying there will actually include programing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What what they seem to they're vague about it.  But what they're saying is that they take into account all the people around pedestrians, how many people will die?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many people can we save?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so but what's the kill you to save a lot of other people?  Apparently.  My car.  I should survive.  Is that the answer to that?  I paid for this car.  I should survive because I'm in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that's the decision people make when they get when they get an SUV.  That's essentially what they're saying.  We're going to if there's a crash, we're living every human makes that decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why people buy cars.  Exactly.  They want to win.  That's why people aren't buying smart cars, because it looks like you'd lose for sure.  So the I guess the if you if you if the premium non ad supported version, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  I expect that you prioritize my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm willing to pay more for my car to prioritize my life.  Wow.  We're just by the way, this we're being silly.  But these are the kinds of things that are going to crop up more and more as we get towards an artificial intelligence world where the machines are going to start making ethical decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's funny about that or what's actually not funny about that is the fact that we're comfortable with the status quo.  We're comfortable with the fact that cars are so dangerous because people are such bad drivers.  Yeah, we're willing to sacrifice those victims.  But when a machine is making those decisions, even if fewer people die, we don't like that and we don't want it.  This is thanks to the chat room and Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is known as the trolley problem.  Thought experiment and ethics first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967.  The general form of the problem is this.  There's a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks ahead on the tracks.  There are five people tied up and unable to move.  The trolley is headed straight for them.  You're standing some distance off in the train yard next to a lever.  If you pull the lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks.  Unfortunately, you notice there's one person on the sidetrack.  So you can either hit with one person or do nothing and the trolley will kill five people.  What's the correct choice?  See, most of us would do nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to choose.  They need to pull a rendition on Snidely Whiplash.  Why are people tied to the tracks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that wasn't the original formulation.  It had to do with a judge and jury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Humans tend to empathize with the individual, right?  Yeah, that's tough.  And you could just do nothing and say, well, that's what was about to happen.  That's what I would do and say, hey, I'm washing my hands of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But because this problem was expressed in the 60s, they weren't dealing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's even a greater level of weirdness when you're writing algorithms to make these decisions.  If you're actually preemptively, I mean, if you're in a trolley and you have to make a quick decision, that's one thing.  But an algorithm is easier because it's detached from the reality of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can write an algorithm that says optimize for minimal life loss.  Yeah.  And that is ethical and rational.  And nobody's losing a life when you're writing the algorithm.  And you can see in advance what it's going to do theoretically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just say maximize for minimal life loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then hackers are going to go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, soldiers at war make this decision all the time, right?  I mean, people commanding people in combat have to make decisions about.  Oh, crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple just bought Beats.  Did they?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three billion, not 3.2.  It's just crossing the wire now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couldn't they have done this during MacBreak Weekly?  I was wrong, wrong, wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from Peter Kafka, who works at Recode.  And there's the link to the Recode article.  Is there an Apple press release?  That's what we really want to know.  Financial Times also has the story.  Yeah, they were the ones who broke it.  Is there any confirmation from Apple?  Chad, do you see anything there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the Financial Times broke the story.  And yeah, it's, you know, I really don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Verge says Apple has confirmed it, but I want to see Apple's confirmation.  The thing that Beats provides us is a head start, says Tim Cook.  We could build about anything that you could dream of, but that's not the question, he said in an interview.  The thing Beats provides us is a head start, and it provides us with incredible people, kindred spirits.  Apple says it will keep the Beats hardware brand intact, as well as the Beats music streaming service.  It also says Beats Electronics co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join the company as full-time employees.  Wow, I would have never guessed that.  In fact, I just didn't believe it at all, but apparently it is true.  And Apple is confirming.  What was that article from, Chad?  Was that The Verge?  That was Recode.  That was Recode.  I don't see it on Recode's front page.  I hope we're not being punked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, I mean, maybe.  There it is.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to see this on the Apple site before I'll submit, before I'll give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the thing is we've talked about this story for, what, a couple weeks now, at least two and a half weeks?  Yeah.  Three weeks.  And there isn't much more to say other than it appears that the price is $3 billion rather than $3.2 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's actually what the leak last, yesterday or the day before, said is a little less than they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple probably got a little bit, got a cheaper price because of the video, the Tyrese video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the story was that because Apple found out that there were only 110,000 subscribers to the Beats music streaming service, which is very small compared to, say, the 10 million of Spotify.  Yeah.  So it's interesting.  It's interesting.  You know, one of the things, if you search for Apple buys Beats, you find the April Fool's joke in the left, left sets letter, which is a great letter for people who follow the music industry.  Apple buys Beats.  But that was apparently a joke.  This is not a joke, at least as far as we can tell.  Apple has bought Beats.  There's been a lot of that.  I'm surprised.  I really am surprised.  And now it made sense that they would confirm this before WWDC so that they can bring Dre up on stage.  Here's the press release from the Apple website.  Apple to acquire Beats music and Beats electronics.  Total of three billion dollars consisting of a purchase price of approximately two point six billion and approximately four hundred million that will vest over time.  Those are the handcuffs that keep Dre and Iovine in the employ of Apple.  Jimmy Iovine said, I've always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple.  The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple's unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.  Apple's deconcentration to music fans, artists, songwriters in the music industry is something special.  Wow, that's a shocker.  I really didn't believe it.  Music is at EQ.  Music is such an important part of Apple's DNA and always will be.  The addition of Beats will make our music lineup even better from free streaming with iTunes radio, which already existed, to a world class subscription service in Beats.  And of course, buying music from the iTunes store, as customers have loved to do for years.  Subject to regulatory approvals, Apple expects to close in fiscal Q4, which is the next quarter calendar year.  That would be sometime in the third quarter calendar year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Walter Isaacson, who's Steve Jobs' biographer, predicted that Jimmy Iovine would run Apple's content business and that acquiring Jimmy Iovine was a major reason for this.  And he also pointed out that Iovine and Steve Jobs were friends and kind of had a shared vision for music.  And the reason for that was that Iovine, when the music industry was choking on the growing dominance of the iPod and iTunes in the early days,  Iovine was saying all along that Apple is the future of music and that's the right way to go and that's the way to monetize music and so on.  So he kind of won over Steve Jobs for that reason.  He supported the iPod and iTunes in the very earliest days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm frankly did not. I'm shocked. I didn't think it was going to happen.  I thought it seemed like a very odd marriage.  It's the first time Apple's ever bought cool instead of inventing it.  And it is the biggest acquisition Apple has ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another piece of news is that Beats Music iOS app just dropped their yearly pricing to $99 and now it's a free trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in other words, they dropped the paid subscription on Beats.  But is that only on iOS? Let me see if I can get a free Beats subscription on Android here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They lowered the price from $1,1988 to $99.99.  Oh, so it's not free?  It's not free. I think there's a freemium version but then they have a subscription upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was part of the story. Of course Beats is the newest streaming music service.  Beats acquired Mog some months ago, which was a very good streaming service.  But they hadn't really gotten much traction even though AT&T offered it as a family plan for people who bought AT&T phones.  $16 for unlimited users on a family plan.  I broached that with my children. They said, no way, we've got Spotify. We don't want Beats.  Interesting. Interesting.  Of course Beats is on Android. I just don't know if the deal will extend to Android.  That would be an interesting move by Apple to say, yeah, we're going to make this cheaper if you're using iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple is paying for the deal with $2.6 billion in cash and $400 million in stock.  The New York Times is confirming that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there you go. I guess we'll cover this tonight on Tech News Tonight.  And as time goes by, maybe we'll get some people on who can comment on it.  Very interesting. I'm surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Since the time passed, I didn't think that was going to happen. I didn't think it was going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't think it was going to happen from day one. It just doesn't make sense from my point of view.  But obviously it makes sense to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have what you said about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, play it. We recorded this because I knew I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, here we go.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the exchange law. There we go. Rewind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a rumor created by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine in an attempt to sell headphones in stock or whatever.  This was 17 days ago, Chad.  I have some interest in a company that is actually failing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Failing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, all right. No need to rub it in.  Actually, I asked them to make a recording because I thought, you know, if it really does happen, then you can mock me endlessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And certainly a different Apple than the one.  Gruber did this great post on Daring Fireball about how, like, back in the day, I guess it was like 2000,  there was a leak about an ATI Radian getting included in the new Mac at the time.  And that Jobs was so incensed and Apple was so upset that they basically ripped every single mention of it from the keynote at WWDC.  They took it out of the machines.  They were punished terribly for just the leak.  So then when the leak happened and then all that time passed, it was like, oh, maybe this really isn't going to happen.  But Leo, you didn't think it was going to happen because you don't think that Apple needs to buy cool or that Apple wouldn't buy cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really understand what the benefit to Apple is.  It's not the headphone business, although the revenue for Beats Headphones was one point three billion dollars last year.  It's not the streaming music business because it's a crappy streaming music business.  Nobody would say that Apple couldn't duplicate 110,000 subscribers streaming music business.  Easy. In fact, Apple's always eschewed streaming music.  They've had this opportunity for years and always turned away from it.  So it ain't the headphones. It ain't the music business.  It's got to be Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre and whatever brand value Beats has.  And I guess it's a very, very successful brand.  But I don't know how it enhances. Does it enhance Apple's brand?  You know, on Sunday on Twig or Twit, they said, you know, you're too old, Leo.  You think Apple's cool still. But young people, people in their 20s and earlier, don't think of Apple as cool.  They think of Beats as cool. So this would make them think Apple was cooler because they own Beats.  I find that very hard to believe.  But I also have to point out that a number of companies have owned Beats and dumped them almost immediately.  HP owned Beats and dumped it. HTC owned Beats and dumped it.  If it's such a great deal, why did HTC and HP get out of the business?  It doesn't make sense to me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're probably concerned that they were probably concerned about the future of Beats.  But being owned by Apple means that Beats has a really bright future.  They have, you know, obviously the most successful retail store chain ever.  Apple does. And they'll continue to sell Beats in those stores, but now more tightly associated with Apple.  They own 65 percent of the high end headphone market.  That's the kind of thing that that's the kind of position that Apple likes to be in.  And you say, does this make Apple cool? Well, Apple is now Beats. Beats is now Apple.  It doesn't make the Apple brand cool.  It means Apple is now in possession of the cool Beats brand.  So I think that's the next best thing to a halo effect.  You know, financially, it doesn't matter because this is a pocket change for Apple and it pays for itself in three years.  And I just think that it's it's kind of a no brainer. It's highly profitable.  These things are extremely profitable. You can build these headphones for fifteen dollars and sell them for two hundred.  So, you know, it's a business wise, it's a fantastic business.  You know, that's a really good point, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's my problem with it. Apple has never done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's always and this is to me, this is a sad day for Apple.  Apple has always said we don't we're not building products to be cool.  We're not building products for high profit margin.  We're trying to build the best products possible.  And I don't think anybody can argue that Beats headphones are in any respect a good product.  So it does it to me. It's a complete mismatch.  And I don't think Jimmy Iovine or Dr. Dre. I mean, it must be for that.  And I don't know how much they bring to the table.  Surely any deal that Jimmy Iovine negotiated with the music industry is is off the table as soon as Apple becomes a part of it.  That's a very different deal. Apple dominates the music industry.  The music industry hates iTunes at this point because they're terrified of them.  Apple's been trying to make content deals with Comcast and and other television companies.  And there's some supposition that maybe Iovine can walk into those boardrooms and make a deal.  I don't think these companies are swayed by personality.  I think they're swayed by the business.  And if the business doesn't make sense, they're not going to do it.  However much they love Jimmy Iovine. Yeah.  So it remains to be seen. I mean, just because a company buys a company doesn't mean it's a good idea.  Just to witness Time Warner AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I got to believe that there's something to the idea that they what they purchased was membership in the tight knit community of the music business.  You know, Iovine and and and and Dr. Dre are now part of Apple.  And these folks are the you know, these these these people are inside the music way insiders.  Right. So so that comes across in two ways.  First of all, when it comes to making deals, it's not just the fact that Iovine himself can negotiate deals, but it's the fact that, you know, these Apple people are one of us when they go and you know, this is the perspective by the music business.  The other thing is that I believe that beats music is viewed has some of the some of the dynamics of a social network.  And if you look at how Twitter, you know, part of Twitter's secret sauce is that so many celebrities, so many famous people are constantly reference referencing Twitter.  And I think they want to have the celebrity obsessed music service streaming music service and and social streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So not the Apple I know.  This is it's not that it's all about surface, that it's all about appearance, not the Apple.  It's all about quality. Look at product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How quickly Apple changed when they fired Steve Jobs and when Steve Jobs left initially.  Yeah. And how quickly they changed when he came back.  This is actually a very, very subtle change.  But the Apple that you know is Steve Jobs's Apple.  And he's been gone for a few years now.  And this is the new Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just to repeat, the breaking news is Apple has bought beats for three billion dollars, 400 million of its stock options.  It'll vest over time.  Jimmy Iovine and Dr.  Dre will become Apple executives with the deal.  They expect it to close pending regulatory approval in the third quarter of this year.  We know what we'll find out on the on the course.  Apple's got a big event coming up on Monday.  We're going to cover this live.  You and I'll be here in the studio and Andy Anakko and Renee Rich.  You'll be at the keynote at WWDC and then come up here for Mac Break Weekly.  So Monday we'll be covering this starting at 10 a.m. Pacific.  That's where you're going to see.  I think the reason they've announced this is you're going to see Dr.  Dre and Jimmy Iovine take the stage along with Angela Arens, maybe Jay Blahnik, the new team, right?  The new Apple celebrity star powered team.  Maybe Johnny I will step up there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is it too much to hope for Eminem?  Who Dr.  Dre produces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does.  He discovered Eminem.  He discovered Snoop.  50 Cent?  Bring Snoop and 50 up.  Although don't let Fitty show throw a baseball.  No, no.  Whatever you do, because that guy, he's wild.  Yeah.  I just I think I think it's a terrible, terrible idea.  And I'll be very there may be some interesting stuff that we'll learn later that makes it make sense.  But I just don't think it makes sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, do we think Beats Music is better than Ping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's all this.  Oh, Ping.  Yeah.  It's not better than iTunes radio.  It's not better than any of the other streaming services.  Basically, I think all of them are seen as commodity services.  When Jimmy Iovine launched the Beats Music service, he said, Oh, no, this is going to be all about recommendation.  We're going to get major celebrities and their playlists.  And I didn't see any of that happen with Beats.  It was it was no better or worse, to be fair, than Spotify, RDO, Rhapsody, all the other services.  I subscribe to Google Music.  I'm sure you do, too, because we got that seven ninety nine deal.  Same 20 million songs.  In fact, I like the Google service because I've uploaded twenty five thousand of my own records to it.  So it knows my music as well as all of these other songs.  I think it's a better service.  I just don't see why.  You know, I guess if it's Apple branded beats, you know, Apple's been doing iTunes radio for how many months and no one knows about it.  Right. That's right.  It has no presence.  I haven't even tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I launched iTunes recently after a long time and I was I I didn't know how to use it anymore.  Right. I tune in the desktop app.  I was like, I don't what is this?  It just changed a lot.  And things are buried.  It was hard to find playlists.  So, yeah, I didn't I haven't tried iTunes radio.  I didn't realize it was a new thing or relatively recent one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very, very odd, very odd indeed.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back and get the Google changelog here for you.  True Crypt is gone.  And there's a very big story there which we'll talk about and a whole lot more as we continue with this week in Google, which is really about anything we want to talk about at all.  Our show today brought to you by hover.com.  I just registered a bunch more domains names with over time.  I love hover.com.  Hover is domain name registration and management made simple, main clean, main clear.  I love I'm a big fan of hover.  As soon as as soon as I could.  I had hovers hover.  I had transferred all my domains over to hover.  They actually have a concierge service, which I should have taken advantage of.  It'll do it for you if you want to move over to hover.  Then the domain management is as simple as can be.  They do allow you to do email, which, by the way, if you say, well, I'm never going to have to do that.  If you say, well, I'm never going to want a web page.  What do I need a domain name for?  You need a domain name so that you can have a professional email address with your business name or your family name that that you can then forward to Gmail.  You're not giving up Gmail, but you could then forward to Gmail.  And if you decide someday that, you know, Yahoo mail or some other mail is better, you never have to change your address.  It's your address for life.  That's a very good reason to register a domain name at hover.com right now.  Of course, they've got all the top domain name extensions.  Dot com dot net.  But they've also just got the dot club, which I really like.  If you're, you know, I don't know, the international order of odd fellows here in Petaluma, you could have Petaluma odd fellows dot club.  You know, I think that. Yeah.  Don't you think that's cool?  I'll tell the rest of the members.  Gina Trapani fan dot club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mickey Mouse dot club.  Don't plant any suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mickey Mouse dot club.  I like I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And hover, you know, when you register a domain name, they do not give you that, you know, 50 click upsell or anything they're going to give you who is privacy free on every domain that supports it.  That's really important.  Most people want that.  And they know that they've got great service.  They're no hold, no transfer phone service means when you call a live person is ready to help and is empowered to help and get you on your way without putting you on hold.  And they're really great people.  They're Canadian.  Of course, they're nice.  Hover dot com.  I want you to register your domain names there.  Get that new dot club domain name.  Florida Rotary dot club.  Instead of Florida Rotary club dot com.  You know, that's cool.  Dot club.  We got I got a bunch of dot clubs the other day.  What do you got?  Let's see if we get twit dot club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, a twit fan club.  I like that club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Baby seals dot club.  Stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pete already owns that.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a twit fan club?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's twit addict dot club.  Mm.  Admirer dot club.  I like it.  To hover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, one other thing I tell you, if you decide to buy, please do me a favor.  Use the offer code TWIG and the number five and you'll get 10% off your first purchase.  Hover dot com.  Play the trumpets, my friends, unless we use the trumpeters up because it's time for the  Google change log.  A lot of buttons to push for Chad.  First, take down the hover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll fix it in post.  And now Gina Trippani has the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a couple of things this week.  Google finally launched a mobile web version of the Play Store.  So if you navigate to play dot google dot com and any mobile device, you'll be able to actually navigate the site instead of getting the big stretched out desktop version on a smaller touch screen.  Of course, normally on an Android phone, for example, a Play Store link would launch the native Play Store app.  But the mobile web interface comes in handy if you're on a non-Android device or if you're looking at an app or an item that's not compatible with your current device.  The new mobile web version looks really nice and a little overdue, got to say.  Google releases virus total uploader for OS 10.  This is a virus scanning app, which Google acquired, I think, back in 2012.  And the uploader for OS 10, Google's hoping to get more malware submissions to beef up Mac security.  Basically, you download the app onto your Mac, you run it, you can drag and drop a file to the virus total uploader in order to scan it.  Over 50 antivirus solutions.  You can drag and drop a folder.  You can drag and drop a Mac application.  Or you could do the open with and, you know, beef up security on your Mac desktop.  Finally, Google is the Chrome team is taking a hard line against malicious extensions, speaking of malware, for Windows users.  Google is now blocking Chrome extensions not listed in the Chrome Web Store for only for Windows users and only Windows users.  And they're disabling current extensions Windows users have installed that aren't listed in the Web Store.  Yeah, this is a little crazy.  So your Windows user, you've got Chrome installed, you've got an extension installed that's maybe local or you didn't get from the Chrome Web Store.  And it's it'll be disabled in the current the stable version of Chrome.  So this new policy only applies to Windows users running the stable and beta versions of Chrome.  It doesn't impact people using Canary or Dev or Mac Linux or Chrome OS users.  So just Windows users.  So I don't know.  We're all safer for it.  If you're if you're a Chrome user on Windows, do check out your extensions and make sure that nothing got auto auto disabled.  Hmm.  I use encouraging developers to upload their extension to the Web Store.  Chad. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chad. Yeah, I'd use an extension called YouTube Center because for our job, I need to download a lot third party.  Yeah, you go and you like download off of GitHub and then you can drag and drop it onto your extensions page and it'll install.  But it's only locally risky.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I have to trust the source.  I guess they just don't trust users to to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish that it had an Android like, you know, trust unknown sources checkbox that you could say, hey, look, I know what I'm doing.  You know, let me let me run this because I mean, look, you know, I don't know.  There might be a reason why a developer might not want to upload their extension to the Web Store.  A legitimate reason, for example.  So, Chad, what did you do?  Did you wind up installing like the Dev, the Canary channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is actually the first time I've noticed when I normally have to do it is on Fridays for a show that I do.  And it's I'll have to deal with that on Friday to figure out how to get around it.  Probably can installing Canary is what I'll have to do and.  Yep.  And yeah, work around it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the Google change.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Play the drums slowly.  Thank you, Gina Trippani.  I don't know what to make of this.  I don't know if this is a hack or if something serious has gone on with TrueCrypt.  TrueCrypt. We've recommended TrueCrypt, whole disk encryption and file encryption for a long time as the best choice, open source choice for disk encryption.  In fact, there was a crowdfunded project to audit TrueCrypt for security, which has already got underway a little bit.  And phase one is complete.  And there is a report.  TrueCrypt because it's open source, I've recommended it as a long favorite choice for encryption because you can see if the NSA or anybody else has a back door in it.  But if you go today to TrueCrypt.org, you're going to be very surprised by this notice.  And I you know, there's two possibilities.  One that this is a legitimate notice from TrueCrypt or the other is that it's been hacked.  And I don't know which is the case.  And nobody's reporting this yet.  Warning using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues.  This has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? But this is SourceForge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could it be hacked?  The development of TrueCrypt was ended in May 2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP.  They're encouraging you to migrate from TrueCrypt to Microsoft's closed source BitLocker.  I have to think this is a hack.  But it's something we're going to watch with interest.  Steve Gibson is tweeting about it.  He says he's seen an unsubstantiated rumor that it has something to do with tonight's interview with Edward Snowden.  Brian Williams has an exclusive interview with the NSA leaker.  I've got to think this has been a hack.  This just doesn't even look right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because Snowden has talked about TrueCrypt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's recommended it, as have I, as has Steve, for years.  I think this is a prank.  But I'm just going to point it out and we'll wait and see with interest what happens.  It doesn't seem like if this is how an open source project would terminate itself with a recommendation to use BitLocker.  I think this is almost certainly a prank.  It's not very funny.  I'm not laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and then there's got to be other places where TrueCrypt has a Twitter account or another page.  TrueCrypt.org redirects to SourceForge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TrueCrypt.SourceForge.net.  That's a good question.  Let me see if there's a Twitter account.  Because maybe they're saying something on the Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is TrueCrypt audited yet?  That's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually a real site.  That's the crowdsourced project that we're talking about.  And as they say, in part, there is a thread going on at Hacker News where people are talking about it.  And in order of likelihood, defaced site time just grew up a big announcement.  Rogue code maintainer or phase two of audit turned up something rather bad.  I don't think it's the case.  I think it has to be a prank.  There is a new binary on there which I would not recommend downloading.  It's a .exe file.  Do not.  It's dated yesterday.  But the signature matches, which is a little concerning.  That's not how an open source project would terminate things, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been hacked, I would almost certainly say.  Which is kind of sad.  Could it be, you're an open source expert, Gina.  Could it be a bad commit that would include a page change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't used SourceForge so I'm not sure how that works.  But I know that on GitHub, yeah, you can manage the site.  You can manage the actual pages for the user-facing website in GitHub.  So yes, on GitHub that would be possible.  Someone could, if they gained commit master access to the repository,  could actually update the website to say, use BitLocker instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve's pointing out, as I mentioned as his pension on Hacker News,  that the .exe is signed by the same key as the normal TrueCrypt sign.  The signature is correct, but that means just more of a bigger hack, if you ask me.  I don't think that that's...  I mean, I don't know what this means.  This is not how things would normally end.  But with any open source project, things can go south in odd ways.  We'll follow this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any software project.  I'm sorry, any project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. That is just weird.  We'll follow that, continue to follow that with interest.  And again, so now there's two big stories for Tech News tonight.  If you want to go to breaking news, Mike Elgin, please be my guest.  Wow, what a day this has been.  What a weird, weird day.  Let's take a break while people can gather their thoughts  and we can figure out what's going on here.  And come back with more.  We'll have some Google stuff.  I'm sure.  We will.  Although the next big story is Yahoo planning YouTube rival.  Okay, that's Google.  It's an anti-Google story.  Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital with Personal Capital.  You finally can get everything about your financial life in a single spot.  Know exactly where you stand.  Personalcapital.com slash twig.  And you can find out more about it.  Here's the deal.  I think I need to kind of explain this.  I've talked to Personal Capital folks.  In fact, I've known them for two years when Bill Harris,  the founder of Personal Capital, was on triangulation.  He was on triangulation to talk about a lot of things,  including money, authentication, Bitcoin, all of that stuff,  former PayPal CEO and Intuit CEO.  And he mentioned just kind of offhandedly,  and I'm starting this new thing, Personal Capital, and we talked about that.  I joined it at the time.  There's a couple of routes you can follow if you're planning for your future.  One, you can, you know, and most of you probably do this, I hope.  You invest money. You save it.  Maybe you have a brokerage account with one of the big online brokerages,  and you just kind of do it yourself.  And I bet you don't pay as much attention to it as you ought to.  The other choice people have, of course, is to go to a bank  or to one of the storefronts and get a broker and let him tell you what to do.  I never went for that myself.  I kind of like to do it myself.  But in both cases, you may not be getting the best advice.  You may not really be managing your money right,  and that's what Personal Capital is all about.  It's about empowering you to do the job right.  Not more time on your part, but more information, better information.  What you'll do is you'll go to personalcapital.com.  You'll sign up for this free, free, free account,  and I'll explain how it can be free in a second,  and you'll get a dashboard that shows all of your stuff,  what you own, what you owe, what your investments.  It'll show you how your portfolio is performing.  And this is really important, and let's not gloss over it.  Allocation of your portfolio, that's very important.  How much is in equities, international equities, United States equities,  how much is in bonds.  You'll learn all about that with a single click of the mouse.  You'll figure out what you're paying in fees for advisors and investments.  They'll have a 401k fee analyzer.  It'll tell you if you're wasting your money,  it's possible to really throw away your 401k.  You don't want to do that.  You'll get a mutual fund fee calculator and a lot more.  Now, here's how they make money.  They are certified financial planners,  and not everybody will get this treatment,  but if you wish you can have advice from them,  they're not selling anything.  They're not salesmen.  They're there to give you that advice.  But if you want to just use the software, you can.  It's kind of the best of both worlds.  Unbiased, useful information, all the data you need, and this is free.  This is free.  Personalcapital.com slash twig.  It's wealth management for the digital age.  I invite you to try it out.  No risk, no obligation, and I think you'll find it useful.  And we love our fans.  We want them to make sure that they're not eating Alpo once they retire.  We want to take care of you.  Personalcapital.com.  I did it immediately, and I love it.  Personalcapital.com slash T-W-I-G.  We heard this rumor before that Yahoo was going to build its own YouTube.  Adage is now confirming it because Yahoo, I guess,  is approaching creators and advertisers,  so you can't keep this kind of stuff secret for too long.  What do we know about Yahoo's YouTube?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we know that they are...  Expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The ad rates are 50 to 100% higher than YouTube.  Yeah.  YouTube is not expensive.  According to Tube Mogul, which Chad always is recommending,  the cost per thousand is under $10 for YouTube,  which is actually...  That's what radio is.  It's not what we are.  We're a lot more.  We're about $70.  Yahoo's not commenting, of course,  but they have been apparently approaching some big names on YouTube saying,  hey, when you want it, we can give you more money if you come over here,  because along with that bigger ad bill, they would also be able to pay more.  They're ramping up talks, according to Adage, with video producers.  They plan to debut this summer.  They wanted to do an upfront in April.  That's where you go to advertisers and tell them what you're going to do  and sign up long-term contracts.  That did not happen.  They're telling YouTube creators more generous revenue sharing deals  or fixed ad rates that are higher,  so you know exactly how much you're going to make.  Creators will be allowed to establish their own channels,  host their videos in Yahoo, just like YouTube,  and just like YouTube, Yahoo's video player will be embeddable on other sites.  Publishing dashboard.  Chad, you're a YouTube guy.  Yeah.  Would this be compelling?  The key is it's not exclusive, I think, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have to not be exclusive, especially in the beginning,  unless if someone wants to take a really big risk.  The biggest issue that I see is YouTube is just the portal that a lot of people,  a lot of younger people, use as...  That's where the people are.  That's where they are.  They go to it like their homepage.  They show up there almost like Netflix to find out what's going to entertain them today  and getting and changing that behavior is by far the hardest thing that Yahoo would have to do.  I'm excited to hear that there might be competition.  It's good to have competition. That's what's good.  Right now, on the YouTube creator side, YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue.  And if Yahoo is to come in and say, not only are we charging our advertisers 20% to 50% more,  you're also going to get 20% to 50% more from us, from our ad revenue.  That would be some amazing competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like that's the opportunity, right?  It's to treat creators better than YouTube has been treating them.  But then, like Chad said, getting viewers to switch over, right?  Because viewers aren't finding their videos embedded on web pages, right?  They're going to YouTube.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, there are going to be a lot of creators on YouTube who feel like they're just not getting any traction.  They're not getting the traffic they want.  I mean, there are a few stars, and we always focus on the big stars.  But for every star, there's 100,000 people who are not able to really become famous.  And they'll be happy to jump ship and try to become stars in the new network if this in fact happens.  Of course, Yahoo failed to acquire Dailymotion for $300 million some time ago.  So Marissa Mayer has basically been talking about building a YouTube-like presence for Yahoo for a long time.  And essentially before Yahoo, her only job was Google.  So she's been sort of aggressively trying to recreate Google at Yahoo to a certain extent.  And this is a big, big part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it funny how she's just doing the Google roadmap one after another?  That's probably why they hired her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because every time Yahoo tried to compete in the new world where portals are no longer a relevant cultural phenomenon,  Google is always there eating their lunch.  So I think that to a certain extent, they failed with multiple CEOs.  And when they went with Marissa Mayer, they basically said, you know, let's be the new Google.  Let's compete with Google on its own terms.  And she's been aggressively doing that, mostly using the old model, which is just keep buying things and keep shutting things down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's going to be the problem.  She's got to face that reputation when she goes to creators and says, please come here.  As long as it's not exclusive, I could see people doing it.  They're not going to lose their YouTube presence.  And they have the potential to make some more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing Yahoo has that is pretty powerful.  Tumblr.  Exactly.  There's a huge network of a lot of young people.  And it's a distribution network that's got a pretty good reputation among certain crowd of people.  And it's viral.  It's a highly viral social bloggy kind of service that is perfect for video.  You can't right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you post video on Tumblr?  You used to be able to.  You can still.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And it works with a couple of different sites.  I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who would love to make their living making videos.  And if Yahoo can enable who maybe couldn't do that with the YouTube deal, with any deal they get with YouTube.  If Yahoo can offer that to them.  And I don't know that Meyer is rebuilding Google.  I mean, this makes sense because it's content.  Right. And that's what Yahoo is.  It's content.  It seems like she and the company is committed to making great content.  And this is this is what this you know, this seems like that's this is the direction it's going in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does fit what Yahoo has been all along, which is a content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And boy, there's no better way to, you know, play the game than to create a video site.  Although let's not forget that Yahoo Broadcast dot com, which was also many moves ago from Mark Cuban, made him a billionaire and shut it shuttered it within a year.  Well, you know, a good like you said, Chad, let's have some competition.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yep.  A great idea.  Speaking of competition, Google, I have to admire Google.  You know, when they started Google Fiber, they always said this isn't a business for us.  We just want to show the path.  And what's happened is in almost every market where Google has announced gigabit fiber, the other incumbents in the market have said, oh, we can do that.  At first, the reaction was, who is that from Time Warner?  Oh, we don't think our customers really want space like that.  Yeah.  But now everybody Cox is going to start its gigabit rollout in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Omaha, Nebraska.  AT&T is starting gigabit rollouts as well.  This is good. Google did the right thing.  Yep.  They kicked everybody in the behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they have the best service out there.  They really Google Fiber is if you're in a Google Fiber area, the cost per speed or whatever.  No matter what metric you use, they just have the very best service.  And it's just fantastic to see them driving competition.  I just hope that they get into all these cities.  There's a long list of cities that they intend to get in.  As of today, they're only in two cities, which is Austin and Salt Lake City, I believe.  I'm sorry. No, it's Kansas City.  Kansas, they started in Kansas City.  And Provo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they moved to Provo.  And they're looking at Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Austin's probably next on the block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although Austin now has a number of choices, according to Brian Rushwood.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So exactly as you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this really bugs me because all of these companies have said, oh, we can't do that.  It'd be too expensive.  Nobody wants it.  And as soon as Google comes in the market, wait a minute, we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but to their defense, essentially what AT&T's position was is that all these companies have wanted to lay fiber,  wanted to do all kinds of things.  And cities have been dragging their feet saying, well, you have to go through this process.  You have to go through that process.  And Google did something really bold.  They said, we're having a contest.  We're having tryouts.  Make it fast.  And they had everybody competing against each other.  And that competition, behind the scenes of that competition was city government saying, you know what, we're just going to green light all this stuff that normally we're going to get rid of all the red tape for you.  And we promise you we're not going to give you any obstructions.  And then Google cherry picked those markets.  And once they've got those all that red tape swept away, other companies can then come in and say, well, if that's how we're doing it, then we'll do it, too.  So Google, I think the genius of this was the sort of DARPA Grand Challenge approach where you have a contest and you have city governments competing with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the city governments woke up and they're going to do the same thing, I presume, for these other gigabit providers.  Now, maybe Google will do exactly the same thing for open Internet, for net neutrality.  They've said publicly at Google Fiber, we don't charge for peering and we don't have fast lanes, that we think this is good for customers.  We from the blog post, we don't change.  We don't charge because it's really a win, win, win situation.  It's good for content providers.  I'm going to raise my hand here because they can deliver really high quality streaming video to their customers.  It's good for us because it saves us money.  It's easier to transport video from a local server.  They're talking about caching, local caching, right?  A co-location.  And Netflix has offered this, the Open Connect system for some time.  Now, we had a great conversation.  I want to point people to the conversation we had yesterday on security.  Now, Steve Gibson brought in Brett Glass, who you probably know.  We've all known for years.  He was a long-time writer for, you probably worked for you at PC World at some point.  I think he definitely wrote for us.  He's also worked for Infoworld and I think he writes for PCMag.  But he's also an Internet service provider.  He does a wireless Internet service in Laramie, Wyoming.  And he was very adamant that any kind of Internet regulation would be a bad idea, not just for him but for customers.  And that the idea of net neutrality cannot in any way be pursued reasonably by the FCC without causing huge problems.  And he actually, I think he made a very coherent case why the Title II regulation that we've been calling for,  the Telecommunications Act regulation that would say the FCC declares the broadband provider's common carriers.  He said the kinds of regulation that would bring in would really become a problem.  Then you've got the government really with its hands in the gears.  So he made a good case there.  I'm not sure he made such a good case for why Internet service providers should charge edge providers as well as its customers.  But it's a good conversation.  I highly recommend Security Now yesterday for that.  And thank you, Google, for making the world a little bit better place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny that they step forward in a blog post as an ISP, Google Fiber as an ISP, and said,  you know, we don't believe in this payment for access because guess who the number two is?  It's YouTube.  They're the payer.  And that's a much bigger equation.  That's kind of what Brett said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very easy for them to say this as an ISP.  But you know what?  Frankly, their business is on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they've never admitted to paying, but they almost certainly do.  They have to.  And they do believe in colocation, which is where you essentially mirror everything.  You mirror everything that Netflix has in your servers to deliver it to the last mile.  And that's a good thing for everybody.  And we need to constantly remind people that whenever we talk about net neutrality, we're talking about the last mile.  We're not talking about peering relationships.  At all.  That's a totally different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's about your driveway we're talking.  That's right.  The information you covered this, I'm sure, on Tech News Today a couple of days ago.  Yep.  The information said that Google is thinking via its Nest division about buying DropCam.  We love those DropCam wireless cameras.  We have them all over the studio.  They're Wi-Fi based.  They're good to be a nice appliance to add.  But do you think it would raise, Gina, any issues with people to know that you have a Google-owned camera in your house?  I don't think it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, with Nest and whatever.  I now have a child of the age where we're now talking about nanny cams and that kind of thing.  Get a DropCam. You'll love it.  Yeah, it's a great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see our DropCams.  I don't know how many of them are up.  Let me see.  Twit.tv slash DropCams is the website.  And let's see if any of them are up.  Because we take them down, right?  Because why?  Because they break?  Oh, OK.  So you see we have there's only one offline.  That's my office.  I think somebody comes in and unplugs that.  But you can see Chad at work here.  You can see we actually we use it to monitor our reception desk because we don't always have somebody at the front desk.  So we monitor the front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, once again, Google tends to line up with the rational argument and expects the public to be rational, which they never are.  So it's an emotional argument to say that we don't want Google cameras in our house.  In fact, we all have them already.  Google's looking at us right now.  You have a camera right there.  And you have Chrome open, right?  You have an Android phone.  You have a tablet.  These things have cameras in them.  They're already pointed inside your house, at your life.  So it's, you know, it's but you know, this is this is going to be a great couple of years from now for the next couple of years.  And coming up on Google I.O. and WWDC, we're going to hear about this.  We're finally getting to the point where we have consumer level home automation.  And that's going to involve cameras.  It's going to involve sensors.  It's going to involve gadgets.  It's going to involve, you know, APIs.  And that's what really I believe we're going to hear about at WWDC and also Google I.O.  Lots and lots of APIs.  Remember, like two years ago, Gina, was it three years ago?  Two years ago when Google was talking about Android at home, Android at home.  And then silence.  Right.  Nothing.  So I'm certain that that's coming back this year.  Everybody's going to talk about home automation.  This DropCam is a play for home automation.  Now DropCam also makes a little inexpensive device that you can just attach to anything and it's a motion detector.  So if that little device moves, you get a notification and the notification can tell you anything you wanted to tell you.  So you it has a sticker.  So you put it on a window.  When the window opens, you get a notification that somebody opened the window or you put it on your phone.  Or you put it on.  I think this is great.  You know, it's sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, you know, of course, we heard the rumor that Apple would be announcing something on Monday at WWDC having to do with home automation.  I think that's going to get overshadowed a little bit by the new news.  Yeah.  Maybe they will do that.  Maybe they won't do that.  But I think a lot of attention is going to be paid to Beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the press.  But that's a developer's conference and the developers won't care about Beats.  Developers don't care about Beats at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They very much care about home automation.  Exactly.  Mary Meeker could just I'm going to put on a wig here and just call me Mary.  Every year, Mary Meeker does a presentation.  She's with Kleiner Perkins, Caulfield Buyers.  She is considered before that she was a Wall Street analyst.  She's considered probably the person to watch when it comes to Internet prognostication.  Today, she did her annual State of the Internet speech.  And thank you, Mary Meeker, for she puts her slides up every year.  I'll tell you, these are the slides.  They're rich with content.  So I haven't had a chance to look at these.  They just went up.  But we can talk a little bit about them.  The high level user usage trends, the big one to me, mobile data traffic is up 81 percent.  Hugely accelerating growth.  And she says the video is the driver here.  That's to me interesting.  It's interesting for our business, but it's interesting in general.  Tablets, 52 percent early stage rapid unit growth.  She says tablets are very hot.  Not a surprise.  Although I predict we're going to see a drop off in tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really think that we're not already seeing a drop off.  I thought Apple already a job.  Apple. They did.  Yeah, Apple did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that was one quarter.  So I don't know if that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's shifting away from the high end Apple disposable income people to the low cost  global inexpensive Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the takeaway from that slide is mobile usage growth is very, very strong.  Eighty one percent over the year.  Smartphone users.  Now in the U.S. it's something like 80 percent are smartphone users.  But globally only 30 percent of the potential 5.2 billion mobile phone user base.  Only a third is smartphones.  So there's a big upside, but the upside is not in the U.S.  And you can see the trend is really growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of the U.S., she has an interesting stat here.  She says that 97 percent of smartphone market share are made in the U.S.  operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows Phone and so on.  Interesting.  Ninety seven percent.  Remember when...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that Nokia is a U.S. company, it's not that surprise.  Not that that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that their market share is a huge...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Globally, OSHA and other platforms are pretty big.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're now also in the Android business.  Look at these tablet sales graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The green line is desktop PCs going down.  Blue line, notebook PCs going up.  But the yellow line, the one that just appeared all of a sudden in 2010,  is already growing faster than PCs ever did.  52 percent of the market is tablet.  We're definitely in a post PC era.  I wonder though in the next three years what that graph is going to look like.  If it might just look like a big spike.  And I think the reason I say that is because I agree with her.  Mobile is where it's at.  Mobile phones are the...  That's where the big growth is going to be.  But she says tablet has a lot of growth ahead of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She says 66 percent, which is two thirds of tablet owners surf the web  while watching TV.  Two thirds of tablet owners...  That's true in our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two thirds of us watch when they...  I'm the only one sitting and actually watching the TV.  Isn't that true?  It's true.  I watch the show.  They're doing their tablet thing and every once in a while they say,  what happened?  What just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about at your house, Gina?  Yeah, 100 percent.  100 percent were our phones and tablets and notebooks.  It is so disconcerting to me.  And now I know I am old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because nobody pays attention to anything anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, that's not true.  Your baby isn't using a tablet.  There's two thirds at your house too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She is not, but she demands Elmo's song on my phone.  So she sees my phone, she demands Elmo.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Internet advertising growing and mobile is up 47 percent.  Still a lot of room for growth there.  That's huge growth.  And that was the question.  How do they monetize mobile?  Well, apparently somebody's figured out how to do that.  Print remains way over indexed.  I think that means it's not good.  Mobile app revenue still trumps mobile ad revenue.  You want to make money on mobile, sell an app, not an ad.  68 percent of mobile revenue is apps.  She talks a little bit about cyber threats.  This is depressing.  A vulnerable system placed on the internet today will be compromised within 15 minutes.  95 percent of all networks are compromised in some way.  Wow.  Let's move on, shall we?  This is a really great slideshow.  You've got to kind of parse through it.  As you can see, she loves dense slides.  I would love to be at that event and see how long she spends per slide.  I'd like to see Edward Tufte review her charts.  Yeah, no, Edward would not be happy.  Not be happy.  She's talking about education.  There's reason for optimism.  Eight in 10 Americans say they care about education.  Graduation rates are rising from high school.  That's good.  Online courses making a big difference here.  For instance, year to year, Khan Academy's YouTube channel has grown 69 percent.  iTunes UOpen University downloads up 59 percent.  Seven million students enrolled in Coursera courses.  This is good.  That really makes me happy.  Here's comparing Duolingo, which is a language platform we highly recommend with Coursera.  It's very much international.  The red is North America on both these pie charts.  You can see that 29 percent of users for Duolingo are in Latin America.  30 percent are in Europe.  11 percent are in Asia.  It's actually pretty well distributed in Coursera.  This is kind of cool.  25 percent of Coursera users are in Asia.  23 percent are in Europe.  11 percent are in Latin America.  6 percent are in Africa and Oceania.  That's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although they're wasting their time.  The technology for simultaneous translation is getting so good.  Did you see that Skype demo that Microsoft did at Recode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll play it for you.  I'll sort of give a preamble to it.  Microsoft demonstrated a future version of Skype that they said is coming out soon that simultaneously translates your conversation.  So you talk in one language and you say, okay, translate this into German.  Within a second, the translation is on the screen and then it's read by a computer.  Then that person talks in that foreign language and it's read back in English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now don't feel bad, Google lovers.  I'll skip ahead a little bit.  But don't feel bad because you know that Google is going to show something like this at Google I.O.  Because Google's got this core technology.  But this is very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead and turn up.  And that's the gentleman who demoed it.  For over a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is not the demo and I want to find it.  But he's talking to a German colleague.  He's speaking English.  She's speaking German.  And Skype is simultaneously translating it.  Let me see if I can.  This is not the clip that I thought it was.  The demo at Recode is perhaps better than this.  Let me go back and find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a it's a it's a we're entering into a new world of translation where so many different apps are getting really great translation.  Technology.  It's still not perfect.  Even this isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn good and very fast.  Yeah, really neat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll show you, Gina, because you'll want to see this.  Let me get out of the ad.  Darn advertising.  There's a Microsoft ad.  Don't you hate advertisements?  Here you go.  Yeah.  So he's he's speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, Diana.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that's that's that's actually a translation.  So let's go back a little bit.  He's going to speak to his German colleague in English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you doing?  Hello, Diana.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was about a second, second and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, my friend.  Hello, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even I understood that.  It's kindergarten German.  That's right.  There's actually some complex sentences that little later on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually, the English transcription isn't perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Germans in the audience said that the German wasn't ready.  It wasn't perfect, but understandable.  That's the key, right?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still going to be better than if you take six weeks to learn a foreign language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine us doing shows with international contributors who don't speak English sometime in the near future?  Wouldn't that be amazing?  We should do that on purpose.  They say this will be available in a beta test later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We were often on the Portobello street and in Camden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Her German, on the other hand, is excellent.  Yes.  Very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But really, I mean, we're 10 years from now.  I mean, come on.  It's going to be so great to have all this, you know, on the one hand, it's going to be great to be able to translate everything.  On the other hand, it's really going to suck the wind out of everyone's motivation to learn a foreign language.  Because what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really cool.  That's really cool, I have to say.  But, you know, doing a show like that, I mean, there's a reason why on TV they edit it so that the translator is speaking kind of over the person, right?  Because it's just so slow.  There's those long awkward pauses.  If there was any crosstalk whatsoever, it would get weird.  That's why I really like that app.  I don't know if it's a Glass app or if it's a phone app where you point it out, you know.  Word lens.  Word lens.  It just changes it and it's in the same file.  Like, that feels really seamless and magical to me.  Like, that Skype demo was pretty cool.  But that would be a long, tedious conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But of course, Google just bought the word lens.  And I think Google, if anybody is well-situated, the best situated to do this.  That's right.  Google Translator is already phenomenal.  And I imagine they'll have this kind of capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I believe in a category of computing that is really just barely getting off.  And I call it hearable computing where you essentially have an earpiece where everything is language.  So you talk to it.  Have you seen her?  Yeah, exactly.  But did you see her yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen it yet.  It's on my list.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone loved it.  That's why it's been on my list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's where we're going.  That's where we're going.  And think about that for translation.  You talk and it tells you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Keanu Reeves.  I'm sorry.  River Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Joaquin Phoenix.  His brother.  Joaquin Phoenix is an attractive, good looking guy.  Yes, he wears high water pants, but apparently everybody in the future will.  So that's okay.  That's the most depressing fact.  Yeah, we're all going to be wearing high water pants.  But he is a little lonely.  He's just gone through a divorce and he buys the new operating system, OS1.  And you turn it on and you boot it up and it says hi.  And you say hi.  And then it's amazingly enough sounds just like Scarlett Johansson, which I personally  would like.  And she's very cute and breathy.  And he does things like he says, why do you do that?  She says, what?  You take a breath in between.  You don't need to breathe.  You're a machine.  She said, what are you?  You're pissing me off.  She says, that's how humans communicate.  That's right.  And he says, but you don't need to breathe.  She said, you're hurting my feelings.  Eventually she does in fact become more and more human.  He falls deeply in love with her.  And then it turns out he's not alone.  His neighbors are falling in love.  Everybody's falling in love with their OS1 computer.  There's a whole business apparently of surrogacy.  We'll get into that later.  But I thought it was fascinating.  The issues it raises are fascinating.  And the UI is great because you're just talking with it.  Right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what you mean?  That's the human.  That's what I mean.  That's the user interface.  But basically, imagine traveling.  You were recently traveling in Turkey and elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about the Babel Fish now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So imagine being in Turkey and just talking, just saying out loud,  computer or Scarlett Johansson, whatever the command is to wake it up,  and say translate from Turkish.  And then you walk into the bakery and it tells you what to say.  And then when the person talks, you hear the English in your ear.  That's a fantastic user interface for translation.  The thing that they got wrong in her is that, yeah,  Scarlett Johansson is the default voice.  But in the future, we'll be able to easily choose any voice,  including Scarlett Johansson's, including anyone's.  Didn't he get a choice at the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he?  Yeah, I think he did.  You get the, you know, someone.  Yeah, would you like a man, a woman?  You know, Waze.  He didn't get that choice?  A man or a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you'll be able to choose from any celebrity.  In fact, Waze has a feature where you can choose Elvis as the person.  And we were using it the other day.  And it's like a coming up on the right, turn left.  I did not spoil her for anybody, believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was not a spoiler in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I pitched this movie to my wife a few times.  Like, a dude falls in love with an operating system.  And she's like, no.  Oh, no, you've got to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, it's a beautiful movie.  I mean, it's really a beautiful movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it looks beautifully shot.  And yeah, I just got to watch it on my own.  I just don't think it's going to happen jointly.  Did you like it, Lisa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Lisa didn't like it.  But she was working on her iPad the whole time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Life is part of the 66%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  You thought it was a little slow, a little slow and boring.  Depressing.  And it is depressing.  You know what?  It is depressing.  Yeah, she found it very depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's depressing because that sort of thing is definitely going to happen.  There are going to be a lot.  In fact, it already happens to a certain extent.  I want to know where I sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys marry their pillows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their pillows and stuff like they carry them around on the subway.  That's a little weird.  Yeah, it's weird.  But you know, it's people are lonely people will have options, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was great and I didn't spoil it because there's a lot more after that.  In fact, it gets even really weird.  And by the way, spoiler alert, Apple bought Beats.  Okay, we're moving on now.  Let's take a break when we come back.  Our tips, our number.  Actually, before I do that, any other stories?  There were a lot and we didn't get to cover all of them.  But I know Gina wants to get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been combing through the TrueCrypt source here, which has been very depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is almost I'm going to absolutely say it's a hack.  There's just no way this would be how it ends for TrueCrypt.  And the fact that it's signed with a hash that works just means it was a deep hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, certainly the latest commit.  I mean, the source code was changed.  I mean, there's just a bunch of abort process in secure app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely do not download that.  Right.  It's a lone exe file.  As we know, TrueCrypt works across many platforms, including, of course, Linux and Macintosh.  So the fact that I think there's something bad happened here.  It could be just a could just be one of the one of the I don't know the committer rules are for for this project,  but presumably there are a few trusted committers if one of them went rogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's usually the case, right?  But there's a couple of good trusted committers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's weird is we're not hearing from anybody about this.  And in fact, the guy who is a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins has been tweeting about it.  He says he's immediately contacted the developers of TrueCrypt and has not heard back from them.  So there's a mystery here.  And we'll continue to cover that.  Very strange. If you go to Trinidad, it's really weird.  And here is a picture, by the way, now crossing the Twitter of Dre.  Of Dre and Iovine riding the one infinite loop elevator with Tim Cook and Eddie Q.  So there's some happy people and Raps first billionaire.  Dre has a quarter of beats.  And so that means he's just got seven hundred fifty million dollars.  It's good work if you can get it. Nice work if you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. But is he a billionaire? Does he already have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he has several hundred million. OK.  There you go. Yeah.  All right. He was it was Tyrese.  It wasn't him who said that, but I think it's probably pretty close.  And by the way, he doesn't get all seven hundred fifty million right away because there's four hundred million in invested stock that he'll get after sitting in a few board meetings.  I just can't imagine him as a full time employee.  He's going to at some point, he's going to say, hey, it's been fun, but I can get back in the studio.  Don't you think? Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does that seem strange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, what's he's going to be in the cafeteria and you know, no, I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Android now has touchless reminders.  So when you activate voice, you say, OK, Google, you know, remind me to feed the dog at four p.m.  You can now say, you know, Google kind of pops up a confirmation box that you can you can tap and say, yes, remind me.  Well, now you can just say yes.  And the reminder will be set.  So fewer taps.  You can control completely by voice.  And this, I guess, was kind of a silent rollout, but is working for should be working for most users now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just love Google now gets better all the time.  All the time.  I just got the new Google Plus app on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Took me a little while to get used to it.  I couldn't figure out how to use it like how to get to photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, I know they kind of they change things around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  No more hamburger.  The hamburger is now deprecated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hamburger is on its way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I keep seeing designers say, oh, no, don't ever use a hamburger.  Nobody knows what it means.  That's nobody even knows.  We mean we say hamburger.  You taught me.  It's or the basements, the lines where you slide.  Yeah, Facebook uses it still on their app, but it's surely on its way out there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then those photo stories are amazing.  I really love the one that you posted, Leo.  Yeah, really nice.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I know I know I know Google's going to take over the world and we're going to be really sorry.  But I for one am welcoming our new over.  Yes, I just love them.  Yep.  I just can't get enough Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, the performance of this app is really good, too.  The new Google Plus Android.  Yeah, the Google Plus Android.  Much better than the old app.  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because of Google Now, I know that the Giants are five innings into a no hitter with the Cubs.  So there there's that.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  What do you want to share with us?  I have an app.  You got an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  You have an app.  Google within the last hour updated its Google Camera app and has a bunch of new features for Android.  The Google Camera app for Android.  OK.  It's available now on Google Play Store.  It has a new fisheye lens mode, which is really cool.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  You can set a timer.  They used to have a timer function, I believe.  They took it out.  Now they put it back in.  So you can say, you know, in 30 seconds, take a picture or whatever.  It's actually a three second or a 10 second, not 30 delay so that you can get into the  group shot or whatever.  And again, that that was used to exist.  You can also capture landscape scenes with your left hand.  So and you can choose between 16 by nine or four point three aspect ratios.  And there's a new creative panorama mode of wide angle and fisheye.  So the fisheye mode actually simulates a fisheye lens.  So this is a variant of like a photosphere where you essentially end up with a circle  rather than a 360 degree thing that has to be viewed in a special mode.  So it's really a kind of a nice update.  If you're already using Google Camera, of course, it'll you know, you'll be using it anyway.  But if you're not using it, you might want to give this a try because it looks really cool.  It's already a great little app and it looks even better with a few unique features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing I liked about the Google Camera app is that it was a lot simpler than the built in Android camera.  So I hope that all these new features they're adding doesn't turn into that like halo  menu effect where you're like sliding up and down, you know, huge hierarchies of menus.  But those cool, those sound like really cool new features.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess we'll get that soon.  I mean, I don't think I have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they announced it around two o'clock.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forty four minutes ago.  I should have gotten the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad you got that.  You couldn't have gotten it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just announced it.  I got a couple of Kickstarter or actually crowd sourced projects to talk about.  Everybody's been saying you got to talk about Levar Burton's Kickstarter project to bring back reading rainbow.  I did not grow up with reading rainbow.  You did not grow up.  Maybe Gina did.  Chad, she didn't grow up.  Yeah, yeah, it's Chad's generation.  Go anywhere.  Oh, dear.  It was a it was a PBS program that was very beloved.  Levar Burton taught a lot of kids to read.  He said, you know what?  Millions of kids in the United States are still illiterate.  One out of every four children in America will grow up illiterate.  That is just wrong.  Reading Rainbow was 1983 to 2006.  Twenty six Emmys, a Peabody Award.  But PBS canceled it in 2006.  He wants to bring it back.  He did bring back the reading rainbow app.  We've we've we talked about that.  But he says it's not going to be TV anymore.  So what he wants to do is reading rainbow in the classroom.  He wants to raise a million dollars to do that.  And lo and behold, I mean, they just started this today.  I think it's already the three quarters of a million dollars and going up fast.  They'll reach their goal in minutes.  That's great.  Yes, good for him.  Good for him.  And if we can help put that over, I would love to.  I would love that.  You know, let's try to get Levar.  I'll call Brett because I bet we can Levar and turn up triangulation.  Yeah, get him on and talk about that.  We've talked to him before.  He's just he's a great guy.  The other one is something that Jeff Jarvis asked us to talk about.  His friend Bill Gross, he's been on the show, has a new affordable 3D printer on Indiegogo,  the Matter Mod T, a 3D printer that would go for just around 250 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is an elegant piece of kit.  This thing looks amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This thing looks really, really cool.  Isn't that neat?  And it's not only that it's a 3D printer that's really affordable,  but they want to make transmitting designs as easy as installing an app on your phone.  Wow, it's like an Apple product.  It is beautiful.  I can send you a really cool coat hanger, you know, just as easy as sending you an SMS  and you can just print it out right there on your desk.  And like you've got it.  I mean, it's teleportation, you know, really kind of in a way.  And yeah, I mean, you know, look, I love MakerBot and, you know, like, I mean, I love printing,  but this one seems like it's really kind of even within range of kind of a normal person.  And if a lot of people have these, then sending designs and making designs,  I think will just be a lot more prevalent.  This is a really cool project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a PLA printer.  It would be able to print objects at six by four by five inches.  Frog Design designed, and I believe this if you look at it, designed the printer itself.  Beautiful plexi case and so forth.  So I just wanted people to go or to know about it and to visit Indiegogo.  They're trying to raise $375,000.  They're more than halfway there.  35 days left.  The campaign started today.  So this is another one where people are just going crazy for it.  Gosh, crowdsourcing is just it's great.  Incredible.  If you search Indiegogo for M.O.D. dash T, that's the name of it.  The Mod T printer that will now be able to teleport coat hangers.  Thanks to Gina Trippani.  I'd like to send you a coat hanger, not wire, not wire, PLA.  So there's a couple of interesting Kickstarter projects.  Hey, folks, we're out of time, but I want to thank Mike Elgin for being here.  Taking some time.  I think it was a good time to be here.  We had some big breaking news, too big breaking stories.  You catch Mike Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific to 1 p.m.  Eastern Time 1700 UTC for tech news today.  Our daily news program.  Mike's really done a great job kind of revitalizing it, redesigning it so that it is just  really a great place to go not only to know what the big stories are, but to understand the big stories.  We've really focused on that.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've been focusing heavily on getting some of the best journalists in the business to come in and tell us about their scoops and exclusives.  And it's it's really great.  Jason Howell and I are having a great time.  And it's really exciting.  We're having fun.  Nice to have you, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We really appreciate it.  Thanks, of course, to Gina Trippani.  We love you.  Think up dot com.  If you want to sign up for the best Twitter analysis tool ever, I wish there were some way to get Google Plus into this.  Yeah, we're working on that.  We're working on that.  Instagram, Google Plus, Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  It's not easy, though, with Google Plus, is it?  They don't make it easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there is a read API.  So I guess you could read it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we can't we can't read it.  We can get comments and stuff that their API is not as fleshed out as as Twitter's and Facebook's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but yeah, we're still working on it.  You can only also only get public shares.  Right.  So that's less than half of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  A lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Less than half is public.  That's what they've said in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, we talked a couple of weeks ago with when Kevin Marks was here, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he's big on the Indie Web Project.  We talked about this new with known used to be IDNO, the publishing platform, the design  of which is you publish to your web, your blog, and then it publishes it to your blog.  You publish to your web, your blog, and then it publishes it out to Foursquare, Facebook  and Twitter.  But of course, it can't do it to Google Plus because there's no right API.  Right.  And Ben Wordmiller said he sent me up.  So I'm going to have my I'm going to move my blog to that soon.  But I you know, we get I wish we could do this with Google Plus, too.  Anyway, think up dot com.  These are the insights.  Leo Laporte really inspired conversation, replies, outnumbered, retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, you wanted it.  I'm going to do it.  I was wrong about beats.  OK, you happy now?  You happy now?  We played the video.  Why did we record that?  Because I knew there was a pretty good chance I would be wrong about beats.  But I wanted I wanted to be wrong about it.
