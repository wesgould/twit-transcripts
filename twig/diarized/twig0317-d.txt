Transcript:  Coming up next on This Week in Google, I've got my buddies Erin Newcomb and Gina Trapani  joining me in Leo's absence. We're going to talk about the Amazon Fire Phone, the nail in its  coffin, the kind of the class war of high-end versus mid-range devices going on right now,  Google and China, and so much more. Stay tuned. This Week in Google is next.

I am filling  in for Leo, who is in New York. I believe he's at a meetup right now. He's in New York for a few  other things, but he's partying down with Paul Thurad of Windows Weekly and a whole lot of other  people, probably some fans there as well, I would imagine. That's kind of what it was all about.  I'm happy to be back. I love filling in for him when he's gone. And I've got my A-Team here to  back me up. Well, one member of my A-Team is gone. Jeff Jarvis. He's in Vienna right now. I checked  him in with him like an hour ago, and I was like, so do you think you're going to make it? He's like,  I have to wake up in four hours. So no, I don't think so. So I guess I forgive him. But in his  place, we have not one but two amazing people to fill in. First of all, sitting to my right here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron Newcomb. How's it going, man? Good, good. Good to be here. You said A-Show. I thought you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were going to say the double A-Show. What you'll realize very quickly when I introduce our next  guest is that this is pretty much everybody from All About Android minus Ron Richards. Also joining  us, Gina Trapani. Just heard her laughing. How's it going, Gina? Good, good. I heard that Leo was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  doing a meetup in Manhattan, and I'm here in Brooklyn. And I was like, oh, great. I'm going  to drop that on the calendar. And I was like, oh, I'm doing Twig during that time. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll catch up another time. Everybody else bailed on today's shows. So, you know,  I would have understood anyways. But I'm thrilled to have you here. It's awesome that I could get  you both on the hook. And then, well, normally I switch the show. I'm usually the technical director,  but instead we have Brian Burnett, who is normally the technical director of All About Android. So it  really is like All About Android during the day. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. It's all the same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's Ron? I'll try and get him on Skype. Yeah, if you could please. I'm sure he's not doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anything. You know, he just started a new job, by the way. So I'm sure he's not busy. You know,  you can pull him away from his new duties and throw him on a podcast. So I'm not going to lie  with you guys. I was looking through the content, throwing it all together in the dock. We were all  kind of working as a team to try and fill out this doc. There is not a lot of news. And I'm sure you  can guess why Apple had their big unveiling today, probably their biggest event of the year.  So why don't we get that out of the way? We don't have to talk a whole lot about Apple. I know a  bunch of people just rolled their eyes when they heard me say that, but I feel like including you.  Okay. I'll be completely honest. I wasn't paying, even though I was producing Mac Break Weekly,  I was not paying attention to the actual devices. So I'm a little bit clueless. Gina, I know you  were kind of watching in Safari. I saw that on Twitter. Was there anything that really stood out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to you? Anything that made your ears perk up? It was funny. I was curious to know what you think,  Jason, because you were like one of the few people in my life who has been sort of untouched by the  reality distortion field. I'm so untouched that I'm clueless. I'm sorry to say. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there are a couple of things, but I'm curious to hear what you have to say first. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say that the event today did kind of inspire some gadget lust for me, particularly  the thing that I was particularly taken with was the 3D touch in the new iPhones, particularly  in the pricing that leasing an iPhone where you can kind of pay 32 bucks a month, get an unlocked  iPhone, you get AppleCare and you just get it and you swap it out for a new model every year. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like, Oh, that's something I might want. You're paying that directly to Apple. That's not through

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the carriers necessarily. Right. Not like a carrier. It's not a plan. So it's an unlocked  phone. You have to get your own plan, which I do. I have a T-Mobile plan that's pay as you go.  And I pop my SIM in and out of different phones, which works with unlocked phones,  which works really well on the Android side. And I think I should be able to do that with one of  the new iPhones. So I found the kind of stylus and the soft keyboard amusing because it seemed like  something that Apple would never do, but Apple kind of added their own touches to it. And I  got to tell you, watching that pen, the Apple pen on that screen made me think like, wow, I  really want to try that. The pressure and sliding the pen to the side. It looked kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this video is like Apple to a T as far as like their product videos are concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Super close up rack focus. The pen is gliding over the display so slowly, but accurately to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  portray an artistic image. I mean, it looks pretty impressive. This is very different from  what we've seen. Like Samsung has the Note tablets and it has the S Pen. Are there layers? Are there  layers with the S Pen? I feel like if you pressed harder with the S Pen, you get a thicker, but I  don't know if that's necessarily 3D touch or whatever it's called. My shield works like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The shield came with a stylus. And so the first thing I did, I'm not an artist, so I gave it to  my daughter and she was playing with it and she drew some pretty cool stuff with it. So there's  obviously a market there for this. And as the technology marches on, I think more and more  people are comfortable working in that sort of a medium with the tablet and a stylus. And so I  think that there's definitely interest there. That was the thing that caught my attention,  even though I really didn't know about it until I asked Tony right before we started the show. I'm  like, what happened with the announcement? He's like, oh, there's cool stylus. I was like, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which by the way, I think is something, it's one of those hell freezes over moments. Yeah,  stylus coming out, you know, that Apple is like super behind. Because I think the thing with Steve  Jobs was always the best stylus that you have is your finger. Like that's the only stylus we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to do. So, but you know, but I think this is, I mean, a lot of people used back in the day,  since I'm an older person, I mean, a lot of people used Apple products for artistic endeavors,  you know, more than they would use a PC. And so I think this, in some ways, this is like  going back to their roots a little bit, kind of going towards the artists, you know, in the past,  it's been video production people or other things. But now, you know, reaching out to those people  who want to draw. I don't know, I think it's kind of cool. And it's unique. And that's the thing that  I point to. No pun intended is, yeah. You know, that so much of what happens is just iterative  anymore. And I don't know about the phones. I mean, you know, they added an S, I guess that's a good  thing. Something. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe there's a new OS or something. But I mean, it's all  iterative, right? And at least with the stylus, it's oh, that's that's kind of, you know, new,  clever, and they're doing some different things with it. And so I don't know, I always look to  those kinds of things as being the things that kind of set these things apart, as opposed to just  new phones, faster processors, bigger tablets, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, for me, it was very much a testament to Apple's marketing. I don't know  if it's the way they present it or that the commercials or what it was. But you know,  I've seen plenty of tablets and devices with styluses before. And I always thought, I looked  at this one today and thought like, oh, I really want to start drawing. I mean, everyone who watched  the keynote today was like, oh, I'm going to get one of those and then I'm going to start drawing  and I'm going to be really good at it. Right. Which is just just a testament to Apple's marketing  and the way that they're able to make something that exists, cool and new kind of in a whole in  a whole new way. Apple TV was also kind of interesting. You know, there were some features  of Apple TV that was just like, I mean, I don't want to know what the weather in Alaska is when  I'm in the middle of watching, you know, Mad Men, but there are a couple of interesting features.  The one the one Apple TV feature I really liked is if you're watching, you can say to your remote,  what did she say? You know, if you miss something that someone says in the show and it automatically  skips back 15 seconds, turns on closed captioning temporarily and plays back what you missed. And  that's like, oh yeah, that's something I do when I watch TV that I, you know, that I haven't seen  before. That's a very human, natural interaction. So yeah, I thought there were some interesting  stuff there today. It made me think about M and you know, what, or I guess Marshmallow,  now we call it, you know, and kind of what I'm what I'm looking forward to there and what I would  like to see. I definitely like, like I said, the 3D touch in iOS, how you kind of you kind of you  touch a little harder, you press a little more pressure and a part of the in iOS, you know,  a fragment or a message or a photo pops up. And I really like that they have like pop and peek and  Android has something very similar. There's several apps where you know, you long press and  it initiates an action like that. But I really like the way how smooth it looked in iOS and how  how nice it looked. It made me really want to try it. I don't feel that way that often after  Apple events. I'm usually like, you know, whatever. But today I did. Yeah, it's interesting. The what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is it 3D touch is what was once forced touch. So I'm wondering if that extends beyond Huawei  actually. And I just I just put the link in bright. I didn't have this in the doc, but it's in the  chat chat area. Huawei at at was it last week? Why am I suddenly blanking in Berlin? Anyways,  whatever Huawei showed off their ascend mate s they have actually integrated force touch into  their display as well. So when they showed it off, you know, it can do things like, you know, you  could use it as a scale. In other words, you could actually put the put the phone on a table,  set an orange on top of it, and it'll tell you how much the orange weighs. So and this is Huawei,  Huawei suddenly is this manufacturer that I feel like we're going to continue to hear more and more  about there. It's rumored that they're going to have the next there we go. Fruit on a phone.  It's for that they're going to have, you know, be involved with the next nexus that we'll hear  about at the end of the month likely. So this is probably ramping up to be a big year for Huawei.  But interesting, you know, kind of an entry for force touch or that type of technology on Android  coming from Huawei there, who knows if it's just, you know, gimmick along the lines of some of the  gimmicky things we've seen some OEMs do to try and move devices, or if it's actually something  that everybody's going to want. And if that's the case, I think it's probably going to take a couple  years before they figure it out very well. But and who knows how it compares to Apple. I personally,  like I said, I'm very clueless when it comes to Apple devices. I just haven't used them very much.  I don't know or understand from a use perspective, how earth shattering force touch or 3d touch  actually is. But sounds cool. I wouldn't mind that in all my devices. It looks neat, but and I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tempted by the new iPhone, but I'm also I'm waiting for the nexus five. So I'm the market for new  phone, my OnePlus one that there's a strip down the bottom that like the it's breaking. It's not  working anymore. So I'm ready. It's that time of year where you put up with your crack screen and  broken touchscreen just another week because it's going to be a new phone announced. And I think  it's going to be the nexus, the new nexus, the nexus five, 2015, whatever it's going to be.  I'm really looking forward to that. I don't want to want to see what that's going to be like. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, not only is it a new nexus, you actually have a choice, you know, which is which is  potentially a big, big differentiator this year versus other years, which is that there will be  not one but two nexus devices introduced the nexus five by LG and then the Huawei nexus six successor,  which I think is actually five point seven inch display fingerprint reader, all that kind of stuff  integrated in. So it's it's an interesting month. This is totally hardware season. We're in the  midst. It's like the leaves are about to start turning colors and phones are going to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dropping. That's right. The phones are right. They're ready to be picked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. And I'm ready to pick them and maybe review a few of them while we're at it. So OK,  so then this seems like a perfect segue into kind of one of the topics that Gina, you had  expressed interest before the show about chatting about. And there's there's there's kind of like a  I don't know if it's a hardware class war or something along those lines brewing, at least  in terms of Android phones. Apple, obviously, clearly, you know, they are committed to the  high end when it comes to hardware. And we've seen a lot of high end hardware in Android. Samsung has  reveled in that with their S their S line of devices. HTC has their one M nine was the latest  one. That would be definitely their premium higher end devices. LG G four. All of those  second quarter of last year was actually not a very good year for high end Android OEMs.  None shipped more handsets than one year ago. And none of those OEMs made more operating profit  than one year ago. Samsung's S six performed pretty poorly. Supposedly the G four didn't  sell very much. Sony Sony has a rocky kind of experience in the U.S. to begin with. But I guess  theirs have been pretty dismal. And now HTC the big news with HTC is that its stock was removed  from the Taiwanese TWS 50 index after seeing a share price drop of 66% in the past year,  which is just kind of crazy. Now, suddenly, like and we heard a little while ago that HTC's,  you know, monetary situation is that they're they're worth less than their their stock is  worth. So their company is basically valueless. So suddenly we're seeing the floor kind of drop out  from all of these premium premium smartphones. So I don't know, I kind of feels like there's a  sea change going on, at least in the world of Android. How can how can on one hand,  something like Apple be a brand that exists and rebels in kind of the high end, but then you have  Android kind of struggling in that regard? How's that happen? Well, I think it's following the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  PC trend. And the same thing happened with PCs, essentially, where you can go out and buy a $250,  $300 desktop or or netbook or Chromebook at this point. And so and people are willing to just go  do that unless there's a small niche, of course, well, moderate size niche for gaming enthusiasts  and things like that that are willing to go pay to take build a high end machine. There's, of course,  the server enterprise market that's different. But for consumers, you know, everything just got  so commoditized. And the applications that were being written weren't necessarily driving the need  for faster and faster hardware at the core. So it's like, hey, I've got a phone, you know,  I don't have to pay the big bucks to get the features I want anymore. You know, a lot of the  middle tier phones are coming with decent cameras now and plenty of features. My wife is a good  example of this. You know, she does not need a high end phone. And she doesn't want a high end  phone. She just wants one that works reliably through all her kerfuffles that she does with  her phone, it seems like every day. And she just wants it to work. Like I just want I just want to  go to Maps, have the maps work. As long as it's working. I'm okay. I want to check my mail. I want  to play words with friends. And I don't need a high end phone anymore. I think a lot of people  were at that point now where, you know, the curve is kind of starting to level off in terms of  what people need and what people expect. And so there's nothing really driving companies,  I think, to produce that high end phone. And there's no longer demand or as much demand,  I would say for people that are willing to go out and shell out six, $700 for a phone when they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  buy one for $300. It's just as good. Yeah. Then that's exactly what we're seeing right now. Now,  you're in the market, obviously. Do you find yourself gravitating towards towards the higher  end? Or do you feel satisfied with what you're seeing kind of in this mid tier of devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I personally would would spend extra money to get a premium phone. And but I don't  know what that phone would be like. So I mean, I want to go with Nexus because I want the latest  Android stuff. And I know that Google has worked with the manufacturer to sort of, you know, make,  you know, make this reference what the Nexus still feels kind of like a reference device,  take advantage of all of Android's new software features. And so, like, so I'm going next Nexus,  for that reason. But I and the other higher end devices, Samsung devices, they just don't,  they're just not interesting to me. And this is just because I mean, this is also just because I  have sort of a nerdier bent and I'm more interested kind of in the software than the hardware.  But I don't think that anyone's quite owned the high end market for Android. And it feels like  part of the reason why Apple has been able to do it as well as it has its amazing marketing aside  is because it owns both the hardware and the software and can do these sort of coordinated  launches like they did today, these announcements. And this was, you know, the S is an incremental  kind of upgrade for them. It's that, you know, that off year upgrade and still people, you know,  make it's like, this is the thing that you want. This is the thing that you have. This is the,  you know, this is the one choice. But having all the different choices. And I think that, yeah,  I mean, I think that having other choices that are medium, I mean, the OnePlus one certainly isn't  high end, right? It's kind of a mid level phone. But I think there are times when I'm like, I really  want like the camera that's going to give me a great photo every single time and not make me  think about it. So I am willing to spend that extra money. I just don't, I don't think there's a clear  choice for the, for the folks that do want to. Yeah. I mean, what, what I feel like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IFA, that's the word I was trying to find earlier in Berlin from last week, what we're,  what we're finding in this trend is right in the sweet spot seems to be like 250 to $400 unlocked.  You know, you got the Asus Zenfone 2, Alcatel One Touch, idle, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 2, if you can  get it, that's actually around 168 US, the OnePlus 2 for $389, Moto X Pure, which everybody's raving  about, that's only $400. There's the new blue Pure XL, that's at $349. And check this out. So  this is my Nexus 6. This has been, you know, considered a premium phone for not even a full  year at this point. It just saw a price drop to $349 for the 16 gig models, $399 for the 64 gig  model. So which is a great deal. Oh, that's a fantastic deal. I think there were 699 when

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they came out. Is that right? What's that? If I'm remembering correctly, there were 699. Yes, it was  upwards of 600 some odd dollars. It was expensive. Yeah. So I've got, I've got mine too. Suddenly  threw Gina curveball, didn't we? Yeah, this is a, this is a great phone. I've been noticing lately,  I still don't, I haven't upgraded to 5.1.1, partly because I'm unlocked and rooted. So the upgrade  process is a little bit harder for me. Harder in general. And I just haven't bothered with it. But  I have noticed like the battery life on this is somehow getting better. So I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're not, you're not using, you don't have any of the developer previews for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not running them. I'm just running 5.1.0. And I keep noticing like I go to bed at night,  I haven't had it plugged in all day. I turn it on. I'm like, oh, I've still got like 30,  you know, percent of battery. Yeah. Yeah. Why that is. And you know, I've been, and the thing is,  it's usually, it's when I don't use it. Of course, it's when I don't use a screen as much. It's when  I'm listening to music with the screen off or something like that. But yeah, it's, this is  great. I think it's, I'm so glad to see that they lowered their price, not only because that probably  means the new models are coming out for sure. But also just because for people that are looking  for a good phone, it's a great phone to pick up for that price, I think. So of course, if you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that, then you're buying into what is soon to be like in less than a month, probably last year's  model of Nexus phone. And yeah, having said that the Nexus five that rocked, like pretty much,  it's still going people that still have it still love it. They still love it. Yeah, yeah. It's a  great device. So there's a little bit of extra longevity there that I feel like was hard to come  by even a year or two ago. So there's that is this is it? I guess in some ways, it kind of feels  like it could be erased to the bottom. And that could be kind of damaging. Do you think there's  any risk of that here? Like it's just going to keep on going down, keep on going down, and then  suddenly the floor is dropping out of the whole category because it can't sustain where what  people expect out of out of their devices from a cost perspective? Personally, I do not. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's fine for the I don't think there's a danger in that except and especially because if you if  we were to say to make the same argument about Apple, I think there would be a problem there  because Apple owns the hardware. But in this case, it's other manufacturers hardware that we're  talking about and not apples. And they're all competing against each other. And that's probably  another reason why we see this is because Apple owns their own markets, so to speak. And what we're  seeing with Android is competition between different players. And you mentioned HTC going down  in market value. And I think what we're seeing is the competition is actually driving that price  down, too. That's another another aspect to it. So I don't think there's a danger in it at all.  If anything, driving the price down will increase adoption. And that's a good thing, too. So yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's definitely a good thing. Then I get getting the next billion getting people online that  wouldn't have necessarily gotten online. Otherwise, it concerns me a little bit when it feels like,  you know, the iPhone is what you know, is a, you know, as a status symbol, right? You know,  is the symbol of a premium device, even though there are plenty of premium Android devices,  but the iPhone is the symbol. I mean, that's their tagline right now in their commercial,  right? If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone, which is the stupidest thing ever.  But they're just reinforcing that kind of that perception for the higher end buyers. That  concerns me a little. So, you know, I don't know, I would like to see, you know, the premium Android  device be super popular and maybe the clear winner. But maybe that's it. That's not that's  not how it's supposed to be with Android. There's supposed to be lots of different choices  and they're supposed to be really affordable devices that anyone can get to.  But it is interesting to see the separation. It does feel like there is this the separation.  This gap is getting bigger. It's like a little bit of a class war, especially kind of what you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talking about the the kind of the social interpretation of what it means, you know,  as a symbol of having an iPhone or an iOS device versus having one of those Android devices. Like,  I think I read a couple of reviews that were like, why, you know, of course, Samsung's,  you know, having issues selling the S6. Why would anyone want to buy a copycat of the iPhone at the  same price of an iPhone when you can just get an iPhone for that price, which kind of means that  anything of quality on the Android side must be lower than than, you know, an iOS device,  because iOS is at the top when it comes to that kind of class war. You know, that's kind of,  I don't know. I mean, I was an Android fan. It kind of hurts. It does. But I've said this before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on other shows. And I think that most of the people that I see running, no offense, folks,  but most of the people I see holding an iPhone in their hand are my age or older. I don't see a lot  of younger folks running iPhones unless it's because their parents got that for them. Right.  Or their parents upgraded. Right. Because I've got a teenager, I've got a 16 year old at home. So I  always ask, like, the kids that come over and they're like, Oh, do you have an Apple charger?  And I'm like, No, sorry. And, and I asked him, like, Well, how do you know what is that? What  you get that for it? And they said, Oh, that's my mom got it for me, you know, because she has one  or something like that. So I don't know, I think that I think eventually Apple is going to run into  an issue here, where if they're not reaching the younger audience that upgrades their phones more  often and wants to do that, I think that that may be a little bit of an issue, because I think Android,  and that's another reason why the cheapness of it plays well, if you're a starving college student,  even though you may may want a nicer phone, you may not be able to afford it, but you can definitely  go down and afford the $99 Android phone. Sure. And over time, I think that's going to hurt or  dig into Apple's ability to broaden their market and increase their numbers. Yeah. No matter what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're getting the internet, the world's information in your pocket. That's pretty impressive for $99  for $50 for $700, whatever, whatever. That's pretty impressive that we have this like conundrum right  now. Absolutely. Let's take a quick break and thank our first sponsor. And then when we come  back, we're actually going to talk about something that's totally related to this. And that is the  Chinese market, which is a huge market right now that everybody's trying to figure out how they can  get into without sacrificing company ethos and all that kind of stuff. It's a very challenging  problem. There's a lot going on there. But before we continue, let's take a minute to thank Zip  Recruiter.

And  we thank ZipRecruiter for their support of this week in Google. Okay, so a lot of stuff happening  when it comes to tech companies in China here. A few things kind of converging all at once.  I'm probably going to slaughter this, but back in 2010, Google had to pull out of China. Basically,  there was suspicion of cyber attacks from the area that Google was cautious about. And then also this  ongoing battle with search censorship. China has since blocked access to Google. It's also actually  blocked access to Facebook. And times seem to be changing. Google and China have struck a strategic  partnership that'll allow Android Wear to come to China for the very first time. In place of Google  services, voice service will actually be provided by Mobvoi. I'm probably not saying that properly.  Mapping provided by Sugu. This is the first time that Wear has been stripped of its Google  underpinnings. So that's kind of significant. Wear is directly tied into Google's services.  And suddenly we're starting to see a little bit of loosening in that front. This along with a  report from the information that shows how Google is willing to make changes to its policy in order  to once again gain access to the Chinese market, which happens to be the world's largest internet  market. So you can see why it's a big deal. And hopefully gain control over that marketplace,  which is just filled with forked Android devices throughout the country. Google would need to,  of course, follow local laws in order to do that. Block apps and content that the Chinese government  sees as objectionable. Stop right there. There's more to this story, but we can kind of stop right  there and talk about it a little bit. Does this seem like Google's going back on its own  commitment to not being evil? It seems like Google was taking a stance from kind of from a  humanitarian aspect back in 2010 when all this stuff started happening. And now it seems like  that's reversing because business is important. Do we understand? Is this Google being evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think, Gina? I don't think that the evil switch has been flipped.  I think that like this is a delicate dance. Like a really important place that's undergoing,  I think, some changes over time based solely on my like very short visit to China. I think China  is changing. Things are changing. And I think that Google has to be there. And I think that this is a  delicate dance. It's going to be lots of conversations. It's going to be lots of negotiations. And  I think that it's the right thing for them business wise. I mean, look, you can take the absolute  radical, we won't even speak to you position. And I think that's the wrong one to take forever  and ever. Right. I mean, I think this is kind of this is an ongoing negotiation. So I didn't read  this and think, oh, they went back on their word. They're evil. Right. Like that's not a very nuanced  view on this. It's interesting to see. I mean, I'm interested from the software perspective. Like  it's really interesting to me to see the way that Google separates Google services from the open  source version of Android and how they separate those things. And so what they're offering to  Chinese users and what advantage that brings them, what advantage it brings to Chinese users. I mean,  this is going to be an extremely delicate incremental dance in the next few years.  But I think that this is generally a good thing. And I don't think it's just about business. I mean,  it is about business. I mean, it certainly is about market share. But I don't think it's about  them turning evil. Am I being too easy on them? Am I being too much of a Google fan girl? I might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think if you go back to when they got kicked out or whatever you want to call it,  I mean, how are you going to spin that as a company? Right. When you have to put a positive  spin on it. So one way to do that, and I don't think this is not true. Right. I just think that  you emphasize that positive part of your message, right. As a marketer. And so the  positive part of their message back then was, well, you know, in China, there's these things  and we, you know, we want to stay above board and blah, blah, blah. But, you know, really,  it's about doing business in China. And if you're not able to do business in China, you just have  to put the best spin on it. Now it's like, oh, well, we can get back into China. I mean, you have to,  you have to, you know, for better or worse, I mean, certainly there's some extreme circumstances  that, you know, you're probably going to have to make that call as a company. But I mean, India and  China, I mean, you're just going to have to play there if you want to take it to the next level or  find a way to do that. And, you know, it's not like Google's like entering the North Korean market,  even if they could, you know, it's not like they're saying that it's just that they're saying,  Hey, look, you know, there's a big market there. We want to be a player. We want to have, let people  have access to our products. And so that's what we're doing. That's the way I read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. And this can kind of put it into perspective. Apple actually during their, their, their bevel,  their huge number of announcements today announced the iPhone market grew 75% year over year in China,  which is its second largest market after the Americas. Economic slowdown in the region  could mean that those iPhone sales are going to drop, which could be a great opportunity for the  lower cost Android devices. Of course, Google would love for those lower cost Android devices  to be running its services and not, you know, be forked versions because then they can actually  kind of capitalize off of that, obviously. And then finally, this just broke shortly before the show.  New York Times reported today that a meeting of Chinese president Xi Jinping, I believe, during  his first US visit next month is being planned, invites out to top executives from Apple, Facebook,  IBM, Uber, as well as of course, Google. The topic will be industry cooperation between the US and  China along with big companies from both countries. So there's a lot of movements suddenly going on.  And it seems like probably what we're going to see if, you know, all this kind of comes together is  Google making some, making some, I'm sure, difficult decisions for the company based on  its history with wanting to kind of keep things open and keep search, you know, keep it all free  and all that and unfiltered. But, you know, if they want to play in the second largest  internet market in the world, there's obviously something's got to give. And so we're probably  going to see that sometime in the near future, I would guess. And I mean, it's important to remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  how much China, how important China is to the Android market anyway, because China, most of the  hardware that we run our software on comes from China to begin with, right? So like, you know,  it's like, it makes sense that the software should be should be there as well. So I think this is a  good thing. I think conversations, negotiations and meetings are about cooperation are a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing for everyone. Yeah, I hope they go well. I wonder if any of this is made easier with the  transition into alphabet and kind of splitting things up. I don't know for sure what the answer  would be on that. But, you know, that was kind of part of the reason I think Google gave for  splitting, you know, splitting everything off and creating alphabet was that certain things that  might have seemed outside of the realm of understanding from a company like Google,  then suddenly makes sense when Google is just a company under something bigger like alphabet.  Maybe this falls into that category. Maybe that makes it a little bit easier. I don't know.  Speaking of the alphabet, let's talk a little bit more about the logo. We did actually, Leo and the  gang spent a good amount of time on the logo last week, so we don't need to discuss it to great  depth. But I'm sure, you know, our opinions haven't been heard about it yet. And it's been a good nice,  solid week. The new car smells kind of faded and we've kind of our eyeballs have adjusted. You may  notice down there that we haven't updated this week in Google logo with font. Whoa, and it's growing.  I'm impressed. Anthony Nielsen here at Twitter redesigned the logo to more or less match the  actual logo from Google. I think it's a great job. It's not a straight borrowing of the actual logo,  so we had to kind of recreate it. But I think it looks awesome. And thank you, Anthony. Yeah,  thank you. So the new logo has complicated serifs. It actually results check this out in a six  kilobyte file that's compressed all the way down to two kilobytes. Sorry, that's the old one. The  old logo compresses down to two kilobytes. The new logo is only 305 bytes. What the font? Can you  believe it? Because things like serifs and stuff are kind of complications within the font. And  this new logo, as you can tell, and as a lot of people actually seem to hate, is that it's really  simple. It's really straightforward. It's just a bunch of circles for the most part with a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of slanted lines. Yep. It's all about compression, compressibility. If Google wants to get anything to  your device in a place where your connection is really bad, it's at least the logo. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're seeing everything get re-stylized. Like just today, Google Plus rolled out its new logo style  and everything. I don't know if you've seen on, do I have it on my Nexus 6? Yeah, I've got it. Oh,  I don't have it. You don't have it? The Google Plus? I have it on my 5. I don't have it. Oh,  no. I was going to show the search bar. The search bar. I do have that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except I don't know if I have a camera that's tight enough to get this.  Yeah. Can you see that? Yeah, I can see it. You can see the Google logo, obviously. But then also,  I've noticed, even in Maps, I don't know if you saw that today or yesterday, even in Maps, they've  updated all of the associated logos, like the microphone here. Of course, the Maps itself has  changed. Let me see if it has it. They've got the logo there. I thought I saw something else. I  don't know. I thought there was something else. Oh, well. I thought there was something else in  Maps as well that I saw that had the updated logo. It's just popping up everywhere. In Chrome,  in the browser, I've noticed a couple things that had the logo updated. The fave icon.  Yeah, they're just going all out. I just kind of joked that the logo was fine with him,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but that the fave icon made him want to throw a chair through the Googleplex window.  This is so funny because we all look at our tabs all day long. And that's such a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  jarring change. Yeah, it's true. It is a jarring change. We've been so used to it one way for so  long. I mean, people are getting really like, wow, people spend a lot of time watching fonts.  The New York Times actually compared Google's logo change to that of New Coke versus Coke.  Yeah. Remember, Quickster versus Netflix. I forgot about Quickster. I forgot that that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  even a thing. I know. That's just mean. It's crazy. That is totally crazy. I like it. I'm coming from  the perspective of someone who's been looking at material for a long time. So the new logo didn't  feel that jarring or surprising. I was like, oh, that feels very material. And yeah, it's really  different. And I'm not a typography expert, but I've been making software for a long time. And I  have gone through firsthand the sort of user revolts to change. And that particular piece,  that New York Times, it was a New Yorker piece, that particular New Yorker piece about how bad  the logo really is. I read the whole thing. It was thousands of words. And all I could hear was like,  I hate change. Wow. I hate change. I mean, people just hate change. It's natural. It's human to hate  change. But I think in this particular case, it's like, I had not a big deal. I like it. I think  it's clean. I think it's modern. It is slightly childish, but Google's always had a very whimsical  little kind of childlike aspect to the company. I think it's very reflective of the brand. And I  have to say that I think that Google's advances in design in the past few years have been amazing,  have been great materials, an incredible design system. And I really love this logo design system.  I think it's very mobile friendly. And I think it works. But it's funny. It's just funny that a  week later, people are still like ruminating about how much they hate. I will say that I wish  that the microphone on my home screen was not colored. Like that felt a little-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear that from people a lot. Yeah. And I wonder if that's one of those things that'll just kind of  get used to it. It goes to show how much we stare at Google logos. If people are this concerned  about it. Because obviously we use Google a lot and we see it everywhere because we either don't  mind seeing the change or we can't stand it every time we happen to glance at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we called it before the show started, we were calling it the crayon. The crayon font.  Or as Gina would say, crayon. Crayon. The crayon. Crayon. There's two syllables. Crayon. Crayon.  I say crayon. I say crayon. It does feel a little childish to me. I mean, it does feel a little bit  more like I'm using like a kid's phone when I- especially with the mic icon. And so I think  there's a danger here of them going- taking this a little too far. Like sometimes when you come out  with a new branding program for a company, everyone jumps on board and they're like,  oh, we're going to change everything. Oh, look at this. I styled this just to look like our-  the new logo, blah, blah, blah. They could take it a little too far. It could get carried away.  So I think there's a little bit danger in that. But I agree with Mike P in the chat room who said,  I don't like the new- I like the old one better. I don't like the new one, but who cares? It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  logo. Yeah, absolutely. I kind of thought it has, you know, a alphabet, the tied alphabet. It kind  of obviously makes sense, I think, when you're talking about it looking a little bit kid-like  and childish. Oh, there we go. But that's- see, that's alphabet with Seraph font. That is so like  a week and a half ago. And drop shadow. Yeah. But also, like, weren't Sergay and Larry, weren't they  Montessori kids? And I don't know if- they were Montessori kids. So I know for some reason in my  brain, I'm like, yeah, it makes sense that they do that. Yes, the company is whimsical and operates  kind of in the Montessori way. That's obviously their background. So it all kind of works together.  I like the logo. There we go. That's all anybody needs to know is that we three, we think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all right. We twig has officially embraced the logo and our logo has been updated. So deal with it.  Yeah, deal with it. I need the glasses. Deal with it. Let's see here. Did you guys see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Motorola watches? We talked about it, I think, a little bit on last week's show, but the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Moto 360 watches that Motorola unveiled? Yeah. I want that sport. I want that sport watch. When's  that going to get released? I went looking for it and it's apparently they haven't they haven't  given details on when that's going to be released. They look neat. They just kind of showed it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sport does look very interesting. They actually had another watch that they were  potentially going to release, I guess, a blog post by a Motorola engineer revealed that an even  lower cost kid friendly version of the Moto 360 was in the works, didn't make the cut with last  week's announcements. It would have been what they're calling a value tier smartwatch and,  you know, super bright colors and perfect for kids. And I think some of the pictures kind of  show the back and, you know, kind of looks like maybe some of the materials are of a lower quality.  But I don't know. So I like their strategy, though, with the Moto 360. And actually,  it's not just Motorola. It's some of the other some of the other watches that are being unveiled  of kind of the new the new era of Android Wear watches that we're entering into for the next year.  They're realizing that not everybody's wrist is the same size. And they're kind of giving  you some choice options as far as size is concerned. I think that's I think that's kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of important. I'm just looking a little bit more closely now. They look a little bit like I mean,  I know that the it doesn't have the same mechanism, but it looks a little bit like a swatch watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Remember swatch watches in the 80s? Yeah, I wonder if it's so if it's meant for kids. And  does that mean that your kid would also be carrying around a phone that's syncing to their watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was my question. So I'm like kids like kids like what not how old or what are we talking about?  Are we talking about high school kids? Kids that are already carrying phones and like what are they  doing with the watch? Like I don't know. And then whatever I got into this existential question of  like well what do I do with the watch? And you know would I get one of these from my kid? I don't  know. I don't know. I'm just imagining my kid sitting in class getting like Instagram likes  notifications on her wrist, you know, and getting distracted. So I don't know Jason, would you would  you get a smart watch for one of your kids if she were I don't know 12 13 14? Sure if she wanted one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the challenge. That's the question kids especially 13 14 15. They're very opinionated.  Are they going to want to wear a Motorola you know? It's true. Flashy color watch at that point. I  don't know. They're probably going to want to step it up a little bit but maybe maybe I don't  understand 13 14 and 15 year olds very well. My five-year-old has a watch but it's a very cheap  watch. And I'm okay with that because she's probably going to destroy it. Oh yeah. Does she  want a watch? Yeah she did. She asked for one because she sees me wear my Moto 360.  And you know and every once in a while she'll come up and she'll just start touching the screen  which is kind of annoying. But you know she sees me wearing that watch. My wife wears a watch. She's  in fitness so she wears it to time certain things and yeah she wanted to watch and it's helped her  tell the time. But it's the old-fashioned. It's not a digital. It's like the hands. Yeah with hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Today's crazy. What is going on here? Motorola probably made the right decision cutting this  value to your kids watch at this point in time. Maybe you know five years from now.  Yeah. You know that would be a kids watch or just a you know a low end value value tier. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Calling it will make more sense. Sure. I can see like with these you know the band. I think they're  missing an opportunity here. Like the band should be like Avengers or you know Batman or you know.  Hey something. There's options. Something like that. I mean if they're really if it's really  going to be marketed to kids. I mean I don't know. I can see that. I can see buying you know  when I was a kid I had underoos. Maybe now it's smartwatches. I don't know. Time's changed.  Yeah it's a smartwatch band. Yeah. It's the new underoos. Yep. I'm not sure that's the marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  angle that they want to take. But don't you like that? I think it'll work. Along the watch tip  of things Samsung unveiled what was expected from them at the EFA conference in Berlin last week.  Though they didn't unveil it in the main presentation which is kind of interesting.  The Samsung Gear S2. It's a round face watch. Round watch face. Stainless steel body. Small size.  And it's not actually running Android Wear. We kind of heard hints of this is running Samsung's  Tizen OS. But Samsung's doing something a little bit different here. It has compatibility with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  all Android devices. Not just Samsung's. Oh I thought it was only Samsung. I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is great. Newer Android devices is what they said. Okay. And Samsung's also looking into iOS  compatibility. So Samsung kind of embracing the thought that they might actually sell more of this  type of accessory style hardware if they open it up to more than just Samsung users. I like that  from you Samsung. Because I've always thought a lot of their components and their accessories  and whatever are kind of neat. But you're limiting yourself. Galaxy. 100% Galaxy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That seems like a late revelation but glad that it happened. Yeah. So what's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about this is it has a bezel. So the round bezel essentially rotates. And that's what you use for  navigation through the S2. It also has NFC on board for Samsung Pay. So that'll come in really  handy. Samsung Pay. You saw. There you go. You see a little bit of the rotating bezel in parts of the  video anyways. It has 3G and non-3G versions. Yeah. There you go. Supposedly it's very responsive  with the rotating bezel. So that's cool. And yeah. But it's going to be a little expensive.  Apparently the placeholder on the site has it around 379 euros to start which is around $420.  Up to around $500 US. Those prices might fluctuate. It might go downward once we get an official  pricing in the US. But yeah. So I'm like torn because it's a nice looking watch. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say from the videos and the pictures I've seen it's one of the nicer looking watches compared  to what's available right now. I mean it looks about the same as the Huawei watch. The Huawei  watch. In terms of looks. I haven't held it in my hands or anything. But I mean just based on what  I see it looks like about the same. Yeah. And the Huawei watch. No flat tire with a relatively small

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bezel. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I think that's because it's the different. I think it's an OLED screen  versus the Moto 360 LCD screen. And that ambient light sensor has to be facing forward  on the LCD screens along those lines. So you know Motorola is sticking to its flat tire philosophy.  It doesn't bug me though. Does it bug you guys? It does. Yeah. Absolutely. It doesn't bug me as

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  much as I thought it would. Yeah. I know. I stopped noticing it. But I do and I do prefer the round.  Like I looked at the new Moto 360s and was like yeah I want one of these. The sports in particular  I was like I want one of these. You know even with the flat tire. But we'll buy again. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just. Oh nice. Excellent. Thank you. See this is why we need Brian on all the shows  because he can do things like that out of nowhere. Absolutely. And then finally before we take a break  related to Samsung. I thought this was kind of cool. So we've heard a lot about Samsung Pay  and we've heard about how it works with pretty much any you know contact or you know any payment  center essentially anything that can that can accept a card swipe. Samsung Pay is supposed to  work with because it basically blasts out kind of electromagnetic field and essentially sends  your credit card data through that way imitating a card essentially without actually having to  swipe through. There's video someone got Sam took Samsung Pay for a spin at a retailer to kind of  show how it works using it looks like an S6 Edge and it's quite literally like the easiest thing in  the world. Like it works exactly like any other contactless like NFC payment. But I saw one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these for Android Pay this week too. A similar video. Yes. This is Samsung Pay. This is Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay. OK. So yes. So using the loop pay technology. Yeah. And this is a terminal that is not set up to  accept NFC payments. It's just a normal terminal. Now that's cool. That's awesome. I kind of feel  like that's what we need on all the phones. Like I don't know. But maybe NFC will become so ubiquitous

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that it won't matter. Let's hope so. I love using my phone to pay for stuff. And it still it still  wows people. They're like oh I didn't know you could do that. You know. And it's like it's been  out for years. But it's so much easier. In fact I was someplace the other day and I had forgotten my  wallet. I think I was going through a McDonald's or something and had all the kids in the back.  Everybody's hungry. It was like OK we'll just go to McDonald's. We get all this food and everything  and I get up there and I'm like oh crap I forgot my wallet. So I just pulled up my phone. I'm like  oh yeah it's McDonald's. Can you just scan my phone. She's like sure. Done. So nice. Excellent.  That's the wallet saved the day for me for sure. Yeah. That's that's my problem is I forget to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. And then because it's not every single place. Right. It's not a no brainer. So then you actually  kind of figure like do I get my wallet. I forgot my wallet today. So maybe it would come in handy.  Maybe I'd be forced to use it. And that's right. I'm just not going to buy anything instead.  But you might want to buy this. Let's take a break and thank our second sponsor of today's episode.  And that is the Ring Video Doorbell. Now I have a Ring Video Doorbell that I connected to my house  a few months ago. Super easy installation. And I'm loving it. It is super cool. Basically it allows  you to use your smartphone to see who's at your door. It's literally a video doorbell. Somebody  rings your door and rings at your door and the app for Ring pulls up a little notification and  says somebody's at your door. And you go ahead and click through and it'll give you the video  readout. You can either accept or deny. And if I hit accept I can actually talk to them and I see  them talking to me and I hear them talking to me. My kids love to run up to it and just hit the  button because they know dad might answer. Which is hilarious. Sometimes annoying but mostly  hilarious. It's very easy to install. They give you the whole kit as you can see right here. The  drill bit. They give you a nice little level so that you can just drop it right into place. Make  sure that it's nice and level. And then this is the video doorbell. Somebody hits that. It chimes.  If you have an additional accessory inside the Ring chime, which I did purchase myself so I have  one of those inside, it'll ring that same doorbell inside. If I don't have my smartphone on me I'll  hear that. Or it can kind of connect into your existing doorbell setup. So if you already have  a bell installed inside you can just wire it into this and it'll ring your doorbell like any other  doorbell would. And it has proprietary screws. So you're kind of wondering like oh can't someone  just walk up and unscrew it and take it with them. And oh here I'll show that to you. It's that little  proprietary screw bit that locks it in place. Make sure that they can't take off with it. So  it's just really cool. 95% of home break-ins happen during the day. That's why you need something  like this. It's a great security tool. You can set it up for motion detection if you want and kind of  set the range. Or you can just have it be a doorbell. And when someone rings the door you'll see  it. You know it's got night vision LEDs. Really really performs well at night when there's no  light outside. You can still see everything nice and sharp enough to understand what's going on.  And yeah the install was just super quick. Very easy. I'm loving it. It's a lot of fun. And I  enjoy the random calls from my kids while I'm at work. It's usually when I'm doing all that  Android and they're getting home from school. But every once in a while I scare them and they think  it's hilarious. So if you want to check out the Ring Video Doorbell I think that you should. Time  Magazine thinks that you should. They named it one of the top 10 gadgets of 2014. And yeah it's  just a lot of fun. Right now you can get $10 off the normal price of the Ring Video Doorbell.  Protect your home. Have peace of mind with Ring. All you got to do is go to ring.com  slash twig and you'll get $10 off the normal price. That's ring.com slash twig. Check it out for  yourself. You're going to have a lot of fun with this and it's going to protect your home. So it's  a great investment and we thank Ring for their support of this week in Google. All right. Hey  you brought in some hardware Aaron. I did. As you all want to do and I love that because it's like  when we bring Aaron Newcomb on to a show we're partially getting your brain and then we're  suddenly seeing what you've been working on the past couple weeks. That's right. That's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what it is. It's like what have you been doing since we saw you last? Oh well let me show you.  I know. I'm amazed that you find time to build these things. It's all like after hours. You know  wee hours of morning stuff. It is. It's a lot of fun. That's cool. So what you got here? Okay. So  this is my project. This is my thing that I usually bring in here. Let's see if I can get this. Here  we go. So this is actually the backup entry access system for our makerspace which I've been working  on for a while. So it uses an Arduino. The great thing about this. So I love projects that reuse  technology to keep them out of the landfill and I also like projects that are cheap because I'm a  cheapskate. So this satisfies both of those because I'm reusing some stuff and this stuff is cheap.  These Arduinos you can get on eBay or sometimes Amazon for less than five dollars especially if  you get them in bulk. So this has become a really really cheap platform. Some of these are knockoffs  I know. I'm sorry about that but again I'm a cheapskate so I'll just go for that. So anyway  this really really cheap development platform. There's a real time clock here if you're wondering  what that is. It's a real time clock to keep time because Arduino once you unplug it it's done. It  doesn't have a real time clock built in or battery built in. So I needed that as part of the system  here. And then of course I recycled this number pad. This is a PS2 number pad that you used to  have to buy when you got a keyboard without a number pad or I don't know you want extra number  pads one for each hand. I don't know why but you can find these things in sometimes you can find  them in flea markets or I found this one in a warehouse you know computer PC supply warehouse  for less than five dollars. So this whole thing costs about fifteen dollars and what it does is  it allows you to implement a secret code system that would unlock your door. So we have an  electronic door on our front door at the makerspace and what I can do is I can hook the Arduino up to  a relay so that when you enter the correct code on the keypad here and press enter it'll actually  unlock the door. And it's just a backup system. You can run this off of solar or wind power. You  can hook it up to a battery and just run it that way so that you don't if you're off the grid for  example. The way we typically do the door system is there's an RFID key that's hooked up to a Raspberry  Pi. You scan the RFID key it looks up in a database but there's all these moving parts  and if the power goes out that's that could be a problem because the door wouldn't open from the  outside if someone wanted to come in. So this is the backup system. It runs a very simple well not  very simple a relatively simple program and you what I'm going to do is I'm going to post this on  github so people can put in their own key system their own algorithm. So for example you might use  part of the date or part of the time along with you know so many digits of pi to come up with  some sort of unique number that only you know and then someone you can give that code to someone  they'll enter it and then it'll change. Kind of like how Google does when you sign on from a new  computer if you have two factor authentication on it'll send you a passcode and you'll have to  put in that passcode to make sure you are who you say you are. This algorithm works similarly but  you're able to tinker with that on your own and either make it as simple or as complex as you want.  So we can try this. The way this will work is if it's working I'm going to give you a code.  Jason you're going to put this in and what should happen is yeah here we go ready what should happen  is on the Raspberry Pi you should see the green light blink solid for three seconds. If it doesn't  work you'll see it blink twice in quick succession. So why don't you put in a random four digit code

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and press enter. So you did it blink twice. I missed it I was looking at my fingers. Try again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try again. Yes it did. I saw a little little green blinky things. Okay so now I'm going to put in the  my super secret code and if I do this right you should be able to type in the code 4896  enter and press enter and we get a solid light. I don't know if you can see that it says solid for  three seconds and that's emulating what would happen with our door lock actually the door lock  would unlock for three seconds you'd be able to go in and then it would lock back up. That's the way  that works. So if you're interested it's just an interesting cheap hack that you can do at home.  You can actually take the keypad out of this and put it into your own case if you want to  and I'm going to be putting the code up on github once I obfuscate some of the parts in there.  Put in some more variables and obfuscate some of the code that I want people seeing. But I'll put  this up on github and anybody should be able to implement this like I say for under $20. It should  be kind of a fun project. You could build this into like a lock box for your kid. You could put like a  make a make some sort of a treasure chest and this would be the secret code you know that you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man that's a great idea. Yeah do like a yeah a treasure a treasure hunt right right at the very  end of it. You have to know the code. Yeah exactly. Piece the puzzle together they know the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly so there's lots of cool little ways you could use this and it's a fun cheap project to do.  Anyway that's the project I thought I'd show off for today. So when you do a project like this do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you set out to solve a particular thing or be like like like a particular need in your life.  Like yes you know what I need is this thing. I'm going to see if I can build it for $20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely not just for $20 but let's see if it's feasible to do this in a cheap way. You know  I mean we would probably do this if it was $20 $30 $100 we probably still would have done it  anyway just because we need to have that backup system because that's what we're offering our  members is 24-7 access. If you don't have that then you know you're kind of not fulfilling your  part of the bargain. So we probably would have done it anyway but it's cool to reuse electronics  in a way for me anyway in new projects and kind of bring them back to life or use them in a way that  just to keep them out of the landfill like I said you know just to be able to reuse it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in new and interesting ways. So love it and I am I'm about to reap the benefits of your handy  work as well because Aaron's arcade is hopefully coming soon to me and I'll be back on the new  screensavers sometime in the next month or two. Diyami Palakki and on the east coast is a wood  worker that is basically building the cab the what is it tabletop main cabinet for me and he's  also mounting all the components so it's been a project that's at this point been months in the  coming which is just going to make it that much sweeter when I finally have it and can do all the  wiring but maybe we can get you on the screensavers that episode as well and you can show me how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wire things. Yeah yeah I can bring mine in I can bring mine in and we can kind of go over it and  here's the finished version and and we'll kind of wire yours up and see if we can get it to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it'd be fun. I'm jealous that you're able to find this time to do this stuff. Well you know the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing is my kids are a little older now yeah so 10 to 16 so they're pretty self-sufficient. We don't  have to change the diapers wipe the butts all that fun stuff like you guys are in the middle  of right now so it does help having the older kids. Yeah it's true. It's true. Hopefully not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hopefully soon not that anymore. Yes yes but yes that's reality for me right now and definitely  for Gina I would imagine as well. Let's see here got a lot here I thought there was not enough news  to talk about it turns out we're probably not going to have enough time to talk about everything  but I think this is this is interesting or maybe expected. Amazon has sold out of its supply of the  Fire Phone. The product page on Amazon now states we don't know when or if this item will be back in  stock and an Amazon spokeswoman told Geekwire that inventory is officially depleted as of the end of  August. So the Fire Phone no more stock if you if you were thinking about picking up the Fire Phone  you might be out of luck unless you find a reseller on eBay or something like that. This coupled with  Wall Street Journal's report that Amazon laid off dozens of Fire Phone engineers I don't know could  spell the death of the Fire Phone experiment or maybe they're going to come back with a new and  improved one that doesn't quite hinge so much on the gimmicks. I guess Amazon reportedly sold a  total of around 12,960 Fire Phones. Wow that's wow when it's 13,000 that's teensy it's minuscule

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but we understand I mean really marketing that went behind I mean think about how many people  saw the ad for the Fire Phone. I mean I don't mean to be like schadenfreude but it is kind of nice  to be like oh okay like even Amazon which is an amazing company that does amazing things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can have just a huge flop. Oh I know right and the the numbers that Amazon is used to moving on  pretty much everything it sells and for this to literally be 12,000 and change devices that's wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's a big I wonder what the ratio of cardboard box tape to phone sold is you know because they  were putting that the Fire Phone tape on everything. How many yards of tape does it take to sell one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  phone? I feel like I still get the I guess it's not the phone anymore tape but yeah that tape  yeah and we had to say goodbye to Firefly right was Firefly the feature? Firefly was a feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the Fire Phone but I believe you also do you also get that in the Fire Tablet? I can't remember  I think it's also in the in the Fire Tablet but yeah that's a really good question I'm trying  to remember if it was part of the tablet I thought that they included it there too  that is just part of the EOS could be wrong maybe we'll find out soon enough because the Wall Street  Journal also reported that Amazon is preparing to release a six inch tablet at around half the  price of the Kindle Fire HD 6 targeting a $50 price point $50 for a tablet. $50 bucks. Yeah the  Fire Phone came out at what two three how much was the Fire Phone at launch was it 400 was it like?  No I don't think so I thought it was like $299. I remember when it came out everybody was like wow  that is priced way high. Fire Phone original price I can't even remember at this point  Google to the rescue $200 on contract $650 off Fire Phone $650 off contract wow okay and now  they're coming out potentially with a $50 tablet so maybe they are learning some lessons

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well you know the $50 tablet is the Kindle thing where it's like this is actually you purchasing  a buying machine like you this is a machine that helps you buy things from Amazon right yep and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guess they potentially don't have to clear anything with any mobile networks mobile carriers  and all that kind of stuff which I imagine is annoying and costly uh at least that's what we  hear anyways um let's see here I know we've probably got more Google stuff to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  did you guys by the way did you guys get the do you run Amazon on your phones Amazon app do you  run the Amazon store app or any of that because I got the Amazon video app which is a separate  did you guys get that did you talk about that I talked about it yeah all about Android oh you did  okay I don't want to but all about Android this is a different show well I'm just curious because  I mean I haven't used it I've been a little bit afraid to use it is it just basically being is  this ultimately the connection to uh you know Prime instant video streaming video right that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they held off on for so long okay and and one thing one of the things that is added in here  and one of the things that um Gina you love so much about it you brought it into the arena on  all about Android last week uh is that it supports offline viewing so you can download to your device  uh and a streaming video download that to your device and then when you go flying somewhere or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  whatever you got it interesting yeah I'm just just pulling this up now it's kind of it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Netflixy yeah it's Netflixy it's got that the x-ray feature where like if you're playing  if you're watching something you can tap and it'll tell you like who the actors are and  and what song is playing like the Google Play uh similar to the Google Play feature  but it's IMDB powered yeah it's pretty good I mean it doesn't have a cast button like that's my  that's a big one that's strange annoying thing I mean really if it had a cast button

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  man I would I would totally use it yeah there's more more than I would you know  yeah more than I do now which is hardly ever I just there's tons of comment like as a Prime member

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's just tons of content that I get for free that I just you know forget about don't look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah it's kind of crazy it's not like we don't consume content yeah but Amazon has all this free  content that's tied into the price of our Prime membership yet we forget about it and part of part  of the reason for that is because up until recently it's been very difficult as a general Android  user and not an Amazon device user to actually gain access to that which is just incredibly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  frustrating I found that interesting and I'm glad you guys talked about it because I found that  interesting that they're finally coming out with an app I mean I you could get the app before but  it was um you could get it to work on non-Amazon phones before but it was extremely difficult  you had to install different things in different orders and trick it and get it to work but  I think maybe they're finally like starting to get it like maybe they're  following Netflix or they've been following Netflix cues and start in developing their own  you know original content for a while now so I mean maybe they're finally realizing like oh  yeah we need eyeballs you know actually to actually make some money here yeah absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  let's see here Google is testing out its food delivery service so kind of expanding  their horizons here trials set for San Francisco and another unmentioned city at this point  Google's partnering with Whole Foods as well as Costco and yeah food delivery this would be an  expansion of Google express which is kind of its current service that delivers merchandise dry  foods dry foods if I can talk to customers competitors of course include Amazon with its  Amazon fresh service and Instacart and we'll also see an expansion of next day deliveries to a  number of places in the Midwest for Google express so I would love to try this out but it's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  petal I still have a coupon I actually can get the service I think where I live I've got a tent like  a ten dollar coupon or something for uh what is it what is the other service called Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  express express express yeah so I tried that manhattan yeah it was great it was great it worked  yeah it worked the stuff showed up you know it's funny my like my issue with this like in my mind  in sort of an app-driven world you have to like be like I want to do this thing what is the app or  the brand or the company that can do this thing for me and so I have these very strong mappings  in my mind you know so like for me like the Google mapping isn't delivery right like for me if I want  something delivered I'm going to go with seamless or Amazon you know and if I want the cloud then  I'm going to get Google you know if I'm going to watch streaming video I'm going to go Netflix  which is part of the reason why I always forget about my Prime Instant video stuff because to me  like I'm on Amazon to go shopping so while like I'm sure that Google's entirely capable with their  lots of money you know billions of dollars to to to create like a super fast and efficient  delivery system which would could possibly rival Amazon's although it's hard to believe that  Google you know is you can be anywhere near moving this type of merchandise at that scale that Amazon  does anytime soon I just don't think of Google like I'm you know I just wouldn't think of Google  to be like oh let me let me order from Google versus Amazon but that said when they released  shopping express it was a while ago I feel like a while ago and it was a day we were doing twig  and I was I happened to be working in Manhattan because it hadn't been released in Brooklyn yet  and I ordered like you know some granola bars and snacks for the office and it showed right up and  it was great it was really and and they gave a coupon you know they want they want new customers  it's just that I just don't I just don't think like oh Google like and now I want produce from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whole Foods so Google will deliver it to me and I need to go grocery shopping log into Google yeah  that doesn't that doesn't really cross my mind but although Costco we haven't done that Costco's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a good partner for this I think I like a lot of the Costco stuff we shop at Costco quite a bit  not as much for the bulk part of it as for the taste of some of the food items they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they have some pretty tasty stuff so I enjoy going to Costco you do well no okay wait because  they actually have carts big enough for you to ride in I enjoy parts of going to Costco some parts  I actually really hate like the other parts like the free food that they hand out and you get to  eat while you're walking around that's good oh yeah the carts crack me up you can come and deliver  me samples and then right right be like I'll take three of those yeah to me it's just the carts I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  can't I can't stop laughing every time you go in there if you just step back and look yeah it makes  everybody look like a really little kid because the handles are like up to here like people are  trying to get their chin over the cart because it's so big oh it is um it's it's awful because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they know you're loading up oh yeah you if you're going you're loading up buying more toilet paper  and one that you've ever bought in your entire life definitely that's that's where Costco sings  new google play is uh is hitting and of course being torn apart and so we're seeing  a fingerprint sensor code built into it in in large numbers so kind of confirming what we think  we know anyways about the next nexus devices having fingerprint sensor in there I for one  am really looking forward to the day when I can use my fingerprint authorization for things  that I normally have to enter passwords into last pass is one of them that worked awesome for me  when I was using the s6 and it was just so nice to just go bloop and have a password enter in  for some reason with the one plus two that doesn't work yet and I'm sure it's a compatibility issue  that either last pass or well it's probably on last passes side but it's not recognizing the  fingerprint reader as being an official mechanism for security with the app but  but that's cool starting to see a little bit more of that fingerprint  code entering into google's grand master plan  relative to grand master flash I was just thinking that actually I'm happy I didn't miss this one  okay google io this year we saw a focus at least partially on virtual reality cardboard  and something that google called google jump vr that's basically their platform for vr video  and stitching it all together this is a whole complex thing shown off on stage was a go rig  comprised of 16 cameras that could film content for jump and stitch it all together seamlessly  the rig is called odyssey and now content creators can actually sign up for early access  to the hardware it'll be available in limited quantities and they are aiming this at professional  partners if that isn't totally evident by the rig's cost of 15 000 yeah 15 000 that's 16 go pros  which if you break that down to a retail per go pro that's around 8 000 so I don't know where  the rest of that money is made up there's mounts for each camera memory cards pelican case and the  rig itself uh man 15 000 but can you imagine how fun it would be how long will it be before  leo gets one in here I mean part of me would say like 15 000 is a lot but he did buy like a 9 000

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  camera lens and yeah yeah I'm sure it'll be right quick yeah I think it's happening pretty soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that would be pretty cool that's really cool wow love it's capable of 2.7k video at four by three  I imagine that four by three I'm trying to trying to kind of figure out visually what that means  that's your viewable viewable area I suppose um that's that's one kind of downside to this  rig is that you don't really get up and down it's not a full spherical thing yeah we got the the  the because when you take a look at the rig there is nothing pointing up right right it's all just  it's so it's basically like surround on a vertical sense and horizontally there's nothing up there  which is kind of a bummer when you're spending 15 000 on a rig to do this type of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well it's gonna have some blind spot somewhere because you got to hang it mount it  put it on a pole yeah there's to be someplace where you have things attached to it well um but  they've been I mean I think I saw this I don't know if it was this if it was the GoPro one but  there was one on Conan when he was at Comic-Con I think they had one in the audience or above his  desk or something and you could like tune in and put on your VR glasses and look around while the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  show was being filmed um it was kind of cool that's fun yeah the blurriness up top that was a little  bit of a bummer you're like oh yeah it is but I'm being super picky yeah it makes it seem like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything's foggy like everything has a fog looming over you at all times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  isn't the one that they showed at IO wasn't that like a six glasses again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sorry you're making us deal with it Brian what's going on yeah sorry I didn't have a perfectly  positioned that time deal with it guys why do we have to be the ones to deal with it Brian why  can't you deal with it because GoPro's awesome so whatever it's super awesome you do revel in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the GoPro didn't have a six camera one though that they demoed I thought they had yes so they the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  spherical yeah yeah yes and then GoPro's like oh we're gonna do you know whatever yeah GoPro  has a spherical uh video solution it does have six cameras so they have that I imagine it's a lot  less than $15,000 um but I love this what I wonder is how long it's going to be before they figure  out how to make that and also 3D so you know and not just a flat image that surrounds you but  and technologically that seems really difficult yeah to be shooting everything in 3D in all  directions and have it seamlessly stitched and everything I don't know how you do that  but thankfully that's not my job to figure out so there we go uh did I miss anything anything  you guys want to take uh talk about real quick before I go to a break and then we do our tips  and all that stuff anything that's that's burning in your minds I think you we got it you hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  everything Jason that there wasn't anything a lollipop at 21% that's kind of fun yeah 21%

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a nice nice little milestone one year later yeah almost a year later wow it's just the way it  is it's just the way android is we just gotta we just gotta deal with it yep it takes time there  we go thank you I was waiting for that deal with it uh I think we have our title okay if if that's  about it then let's uh take a minute and thank our final sponsor and then we'll come back and  we'll do a couple of tips and we'll wrap things up an amazing episode I'm super thrilled to have  uh have my friends here Aaron Newcomb uh floss doing floss every Wednesday not every not every  Wednesday but uh a lot of Wednesdays most Wednesdays anyways a lot of Wednesdays and then of course  Gina Trapani uh maker maker base is kind of your your latest thing but also think up think up a  ton of fun yeah thank you yeah it's good to have you guys here um we want to take a minute and  thank another awesome sponsor that's Linda Linda.com and if you're looking to just kind of get smarter  uh you want to you know solve problems if you're just kind of curious about how things work you  want to watch people who really know what they're doing really know how to make things happen  watch how they do it then you definitely want to check out Linda.com maybe you want to develop an  app or take better pictures master your skills in photoshop sharpen your html skills all this stuff  Linda's got you covered go to Linda.com has everything you need to feed that curious mind  if you're starting a new business or you want to grow your existing one Linda.com's new courses  include creating a business plan you can find one on creating customer value global strategy  teamwork fundamentals and they really cover the the bases here there's also new courses  on the fundamentals of lead generation problem solving for web professionals there's media  training speech writing guy Kawasaki is on there talking about entrepreneurship talk about a video  coming from the right person uh to talk about that sort of thing just very very cool stuff i've learned  a ton about and you know mass well maybe i'm not a master of adobe premiere but using it when we  switch from final cut to adobe premiere it really helped me with the transition i've studied up on  pro tools 11 uh you know soundproofing my audio space at home it cover if you can't tell by now  there are literally covers uh categories that cover the gamut all sorts uh animation cad  design development it business educations all over the board you definitely want to check it out  it's top experts that are teaching this to you and they know exactly what they're talking about  high quality videos uh and it's just a lot of fun you can get lost there's thousands of video  courses and it's all on demand or you know you can learn on your own schedule do it at your  own pace courses are actually structured so you can start uh you know and start at the beginning  and watch to the finish but you can also kind of consume them in little bite-sized pieces because  they're broken up into kind of chapters and sub chapters and all that kind of stuff so it makes  it easy to pick up where you left off it's also transcripts included for all of the videos so you  can actually watch the transcript or search the transcript and jump right to a particular point  in a video and learn that one thing that you're looking for you can take notes as you go and of  course refer to those later you can download tutorials watch them on the go that includes  access on your android and your ios devices and you can create and save playlists of courses  that you want to watch so you can customize your learning path you can share that with your friends  and your team members and your colleagues just a great way for everyone to learn and become  smarter and we've got kind of a great way to do that right here your lynda.com membership  gives you unlimited access to training on hundreds of topics all for one flat rate if you're looking  to become an expert you're passionate about a hobby you just want to learn something new  become skilled at something new definitely check out lynda.com slash twig and sign up for your free  10-day trial it's 10 days all you can eat lynda.com slash twig l-y-n-d-a dot com slash t-w-i-g and we  thank lynda for their support of this week in google and the twit network such good content  there i love it all right so we're kind of wrapping things up this is about the point  in this week in google where we talk to uh talk to you guys and see what you got you know tips  numbers tools whatever you happen to have jena let's start with you what did you got

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the sources like you can see that it's not just wikipedia or like trivia sites it's like you know  it's usa today the last one was from bleacher report they're from different there are definitely  are a lot of answers from wikipedia but it's like you know facts from all over the web i feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if google opened this up in some way for developers to have access to this engine they could make a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really cool trivia app well wasn't there a game like this from google at one point wasn't there  so i don't know wasn't there a trivia game i thought maybe google should do that then was there like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it was like a scavenger hunt so you have to kind of use google to find out i'm also recalling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something along these lines yeah i thought it was like you're supposed to use google to find the  answer like in your it was like between you and another person and you're trying to figure out  who could do it faster something in the back of my head is just telling me that this there was a  trivia game but maybe the chat room will come up with it i could swear there already was one like  this but it's interesting we'll see i feel like this is i mean this is kind of google kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  turning inside out some of their knowledge graph stuff the like the way that the google computers  are now understanding objects and attributes and questions right i mean like like the reason why  google can answer questions is learning how to parse text like this so i think it's it's interesting  to to run this and see the question that it presents and then the answer because you know  that when someone googles that question that's the answer that they give right so uh so it's  kind of neat to get kind of be like just yeah show me something maybe this is of course it's a play

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on i'm feeling lucky yeah right maybe this is what they're using their quantum computer for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to open up the magic radio shack bag now this should be a segment the magic radio erin's  magic radio shack bag here it is here the lovely radio shack bag that i brought in what could it be  what could it be it really is a radio shack bag so this is actually again going back to reusing  things and doing things on the cheap there was a time when i needed to trace out we got a new  house here in california and i needed to trace out the cables in the house because they were all  mixed up i didn't know how to do it and i didn't have a cable tracer back when i was a business  telephone installer random piece of trivia there i used to have a nice little toner tracer and i  could put a i could put a tone on a line on a cable and i could go to the other end where  you know there's like 15 cables coming out and i could touch each one of them and eventually i'd  find out the other end of that cable but i you know long since have lost that tool didn't have  that tool and so partially based on inspiration from an instructable i found this cool little hack  you can do you can go to the dollar store pretty much any dollar store and you find these little  white boxes that you you attach to your window and there's a little magnet that you put on it  like a present sensor yes and so if someone was breaking into your house or they they opened the  window when you didn't want them to you can set it to go off they have these for a dollar yeah  they're in the dollar store absolutely little little little bits of electronics you can see  them on the inside i cut this part out and i'll tell you why in a minute but this is where the  speaker was and um but you can hack that and what you can do what i've done basically is i've  separated the speaker that was in there um from the from the board and now what i can do and i've  attached these leads um and a little phone jack because that's handy shock me are you i'm not  going to shock you i'm not going to shock you so now what you can do is um you can actually uh if  i have this plugged in oh the other hack i did to this was i kept running out of batteries so i put  a usb cable on here to replace the battery so now i can take it just about anywhere plug it into any  usb jack let's see if this disrupts all of the of the mics in the studio no i don't hear anything  ah was that me no that was me oh man you got me good i was like holy crap i totally didn't mean to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do that wow i was okay that was i was impressed i was waiting for you to point that in dang that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was some coordination right there i'm not kidding um i've also got a dream bag sound effect if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when you put it away wow that was fantastic um anyway so i'm just so impressed by that  um of course now it's not working oh yeah i must have done something it's been sitting in my bag  for a while but anyway you can go hack this thing all it is all you're doing really is extending  the speaker um from the device so you go hook this up to your cable either by using the little  alligator clips or if it's a telephone jack you go hook it up with the little telephone cord that  i've soldered on to the to the end where the speaker used to attach to then you take the  speaker back to wherever your cables are and you just go through and touch the different pairs of  cables on the other end and eventually the little speaker will go a little sine wave thing and then  you know you've found the cable that you're looking for the other end of the cable that you're looking  for and you can do whatever you were doing with it so it's a really simple little one dollar hack  of course you know if you have a soldering iron that's always helpful you can attach the cables  but you really don't need much and you can make this thing work for you and you don't have to go  out if you buy those toner tester things i think they're like 60 70 bucks for the for a set of them  you can find them cheaper at flea markets and things but you know why do that when you can for  a dollar you can go out and hack together this nice little toner tracer a word of caution you  may end up if you have sensitive electronics on those lines you know if you if you're if you're  not sure if both ends are disconnected just be careful because this sends out a sine wave  you know it could do some damage to sensitive electronics but mostly electronics in your house  it should be it shouldn't disrupt them at all it should be fine you're not going to blow up a phone  or anything like that that's connected to this so there you go that's my second project for the week  one dollar slightly scared of it one dollar toner for tracing cables in your house yeah interesting  yeah great i wish i heard it i know i'll work on it tell you what i'll work on this while you guys  are doing your numbers your are you doing a number of now i'm doing a little tip and it's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of kind of an old tip but i think it's really cool i've been having a good time with it i think  it's awesome so if you didn't know google maps app for android is like one of the best apps in  the world i've always i've said that for years it's one of my favorites i use it all the time  it's probably one of my most used apps from navigation to doing all sorts of things and  they've been you know slowly bringing it up to material design and you know they recently  changed the logo they're always changing it and tweaking and everything one of my favorite features  in the maps app as of late is my timeline and i don't know if you guys have seen this  i'm going to go ahead and show this it's kind of far away and i'm not going to go into certain  screens because it'll show my address but basically what it does if you have your location sharing set  on your phone and you just live your normal life what it will do is it will it will show you just  how much how you know where you travel it basically tracks your every move and it syncs up stuff that  you do on the phone to those locations so we went camping this weekend so you can see i started my  day out in mendocino california i took a couple of pictures while we were by the campfire took a  bunch of them actually and then a little bit later we went into mendocino went to frankies went to  out of this world shopping went to the beach you know i was on the beach with my kids and  all this kind of stuff then we saw the sunset and everything so that's day one then you can try  switch over and you'll see like little indicators too like that's a little tree because it recognizes  that i was in hendiwood state park you know that we were driving we passed through navara we went  to navarro winery actually and then we went back to hendiwoods and it's just a cool way to kind of  visualize what you have done over the course of however many days weeks years because all this  information if you've had location sharing on all this information i mean it's it's a little  frightening you realize that google is storing all this information for you but you also you have  access to it and you can kind of reap the benefits it might actually be and it has been very  beneficial to me um oh i just got a got rid of it and i'm going to be careful here because i don't  want to show my address um it might be beneficial to you at some point there we go to need to  navigate back to a particular place right and the only way that you can remember to do that is oh  well i know i went there two days ago you may not have even like actively navigated there so you you  know normally you can maybe look at that and be like well i went there two days ago so it's in my  history it actually is in your history whether you did that or not it's in your location history  and you can just go right into it and yeah navigate me to hendiwood state park and it's  the easiest thing in the world so it's just kind of a way of looking into your history of of travel  and um you know within the google maps app and be able to put it to use get yourself back to where  you've been find out kind of what your the last couple of days were like from a you know travel  standpoint as well as from all the pictures that you took and having it all sink in on a timeline  it's literally a timeline it's just awesome loving it it's a good time i didn't know about this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's crazy it's so good it's like i was on the subway i was home and then i got on the subway  and then i was at the dmv and then i went out for lunch like it's crazy how accurate it is  yeah it'll tell you whether you're walking or driving exactly because it knows i was on the  subway i guess it knows where the subway station is and like where i lost a signal that's i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is crazy i had no idea it's kind of a window into just what google knows about you based on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  just you using your phone yeah yeah this is really neat thank you for pointing it out yeah and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fact that we carry our phones everywhere so yeah all of this information you know is obviously  very valuable to google to know uh know all this and at least you have access to it too i guess  that takes maybe a little bit of the creep factor away from it but i don't know i kind of knew that  google had all this information anyways uh yeah you were good with it you were down anyway so  whatever yeah it's awesome it's awesome scanning through it though it is it really is i'm like  totally blown away yeah and it goes back far you'll you'll keep scanning back and be like wow okay  this will be going on for a really long time deal with it yeah uh all right oh were you no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i can't get it so yeah you know one out of two ain't bad i got one live demo today that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's a good that's actually really good when you're pulling apart a piece of electronics from  me from the dollar store yes yeah yeah um i think it's about time to wrap this up we uh you know  the whole schedule has kind of gone a little bit behind today because of the apple event but i think  we've been able to pick up some steam and more importantly we were able to cover i think most of  the really important stuff that's happened this past week with google and beyond and i'm just  thrilled that both of you guys were able to to hop on and join me today in leo's absence thank  you so much um anytime yeah jeena uh why don't we start with you first what you're working on  what are you most excited about where can people find you yeah so my company think up is working
