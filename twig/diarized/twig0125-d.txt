I'm the author of Think Up, the app that takes your tweets and parses them, breaks them down,  analyzes them, comes up with statistical probabilities, and then spits them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yes.  I eat your tweet for breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I eat your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, we don't have to go to the crappy new Twitter homepage.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, thank you.  I was going to ask you what your opinion was about the redesign.  I'll tell you in a second.  Hi Gina.  New haircut.  Yes.  Cute.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you.  Also with me, of course, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  He has a very nice haircut too.  I don't know how you get...  I have bad hair days.  I'm hiding mine.  Look at him in a beautiful fez.  Your hair always looks good.  Jeff is a professor of journalism at...  He's like God's sovereign.  ...the City University of New York, also at BuzzMachine dot com.  And with us from Google+, Mike Elgin is also here.  He's not at Google+.  He just uses it to great effect.  Occupy Google+.  That's what he does.  And he's thinking right now.  He's thinking.  I feel like he's frozen.  He's coming up with a retort.  He's contemplating.  Ah, yes.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got you back, Mike.  And now he's muted.  Did you mute yourself, Mike?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Merry Christmas.  I can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Freeze attacked you.  I have taken your movement away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll work on it while you start the show.  Poor Mike.  He was all serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was so set up.  He had his seven cannons.  So excited.  His T-7000 all set up.  It would have been beautiful.  Next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Charge the battery next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk SOPA.  I thought SOPA was done.  I went to France thinking all was well.  No, it's back, baby.  In fact, the committee vote is tomorrow.  This is the Senate.  Or is it the House?  No, it's the House.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Engine advocates.  It is the House.  It is the House.  IP Protect was the Senate bill, which is gone, I think.  Now, update me.  I thought it was all gone.  I thought we won.  I thought 87,000 petitions and calls to members of Congress from Tumblr alone were gone.  I thought that would have just put this thing to bed.  But no, they fixed it.  Oh, you utopian you.  Fool that I am.  The folks at the movie industry and the television industry and the music industry just went  back and rewrote it.  And they kind of rewrote it.  Well, one article says to isolate Google.  Google, of course, been very vocal against the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google can't still oppose it.  On matter of principle.  Yeah, they have.  Well, in fact, they have.  Good.  Founders of Google, Twitter, head of eBay and Yahoo all came out in vocal opposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NGN, YouTube, Craigslist, a bunch of people.  Not Zuckerberg, though.  Well, at least not in this article.  Come on, Zuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or Zuck.  So SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.  Well, no one's in favor of online piracy.  What's wrong with that?  Mike, explain to me why we why we have to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for starters, it's based on the bizarre premise that you can simply establish a law  and the rest of the world doesn't respond.  So you got to think what's the response to this.  And the response is going to be that the pirates will simply and very quickly and easily figure  out how to put up an alternative site in minutes if they're ever taken down.  So first of all, it's not going to stop pirate.  It's not going to solve the problem that it claims to solve.  The bigger problem is what it does to the U.S.  government's relationship with essentially censoring the Internet.  This is a kind of a Chinese type of thing or an Iranian government type of thing where  well, in the case of China, I think is a better case.  China censors the Internet heavily and famously, but they never do so and they never state  the real reasons.  They never say, well, we're censoring the Internet because we want to prevent the formation  of an alternative political party to the Communist Party or we want to censor the Internet to  make sure that people who call for democracy and freedom and so on can be heard and so  on.  What they say is that we're going to cut down on pornography.  We're going to we're going to crack down on child pornography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's always we're doing it for the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always for the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think of the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in this case, there are all kinds of things that the government could do.  And when people bring that up and say, well, you could do X, Y and Z, they say, well, but  we won't.  That's not going to happen.  And that's the thing that I'm most concerned about.  Trust us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're not going to we're not going to create the great firewall of the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As if politics is going to stop.  I mean, you know, somebody wants to have the levers of power.  They're going to use them for political purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the nose under the camel's tent.  So the House Judiciary Committee will vote on this tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Its chairman, Lamar Smith of Texas, says SOPA's opponents is spreading lies.  Lawful companies and websites like Google, Twitter, Yahoo and Facebook have nothing to  worry about with this bill.  He said, I like that cartoon rooster.  I say, I say, I say it only applies to foreign rogue websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Furners, ferners, so they dropped.  This shows their moronic stupidity.  They said, well, OK, we'll exempt dot com dot net dot org sites.  That means it's only foreigners, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, except Pirate Bay is dot org unit wits and twit is dot TV.  So what the hell do you not use the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's an Internet Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't I say I say Internet.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Companies like Google have made.  I don't know if Lamar Smith talks like this, but he sure as hell ought to.  Oh, he should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll say companies like Google have made billions by working with and promoting  foreign rogue websites.  That's why Google's against this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have a vested interest in preventing Congress from stopping rogue websites.  Wait a minute.  Lamar Smith, you're saying that Google has a vested interest in protecting piracy and  preventing Congress from from doing its job as their article, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our Google's Achilles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll go ahead.  I was just going to say that they as evidence, they point out Google's fiasco where they  were knowingly allowing pharmaceutical shady pharmaceutical ads in the ad network, which  is probably a bad example.  That's not an example of what they would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a shame that that did happen.  And they of course, they paid half a billion fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their opposition, this legislation is self-servant since they profit from doing business with  rogue sites that steal and sell America's intellectual property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's institutions, defending institutions.  It's the same as we talked about this, I think, when you were gone, Leo, your good buddy,  Sarco, saying that content has a distribution problem.  And in fact, I would argue that content has solved this distribution problem, but he defends  the old business model.  I'd like to point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was Congress defending the old business model.  I did not shake Sarco's hand.  And he was crushed.  You know, his assistant for Internet Affairs or something, Nicholas something, came up  to me and said, oh, we are so glad to have you.  Actually, he's had no accident.  He's perfect English.  We're so glad to have you.  Thank you for being here.  But, and then Loic was going around with Sarco because, you know, the reason this all happened,  Loic Lemer, who puts on the web.  And by the way, if you ever get a chance to go, this is a great show.  This is, I think, now.  It sounded like your coverage.  It's like South by Southwest.  It's now the news that used to be broken at South by is now being broken in France at  the web.  And part of that is because of this great upsurge of European startups like Spotify  and, you know, SoundCloud.  We interviewed some really interesting people who are doing really, I think, innovative,  exciting things in Europe.  It's the it's the renaissance of Internet stuff in Europe.  Anyway, so Loic was back when he was a very influential blogger in France.  I tell Loic got started now.  He's an entrepreneur.  He's a founder of Seismic and lives in the U.S. with his family.  But Loic, when he when he was back, if this is 10 years or eight years ago or something,  was a very influential blogger and was approached when Sarkozy before Sarkozy became president  by the Sarkozy campaign, they were looking for some support from bloggers.  And Loic advised him on social media strategy.  And so he became an insider in this in the circle.  And actually, I haven't asked Loic how he feels about Hadoop and the three strikes laws.  But Loic was introducing him around.  Scoble met him. Alexia Sotsis met him.  And, you know, they said, well, go on.  You know, we could.  And I said, you know, I'm just going to I'm going to watch.  Really? It wasn't first of all, I wasn't going to say to him, you know, hey,  my friend, Jeff Jarvis says, will you do any harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, I just thought you feel kind of obligated to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I didn't want to meet him because I didn't want to have to say I didn't want to have  to glad hand him say, you know, pleasure to meet you.  And I didn't want and I would have felt compelled to say, you know,  this this stuff has to I understand that, you know, he gave a fairly long speech off  the cuff. He had notes, but he read right off the notes.  He said, you know, I know you guys aren't crazy about me.  Google just opened in Paris the day before.  Something like a what was it?  One hundred seventy four thousand square a huge square office in a beautiful building.  I mean, they really have a huge Paris presence now.  And he said, you know, I was it was, you know, I was damned if I did and damned if I didn't.  If I went to the opening, there people would have hated me for doing that if I hadn't done it.  If I didn't do it, people would hate me.  So he just but Eric Schmidt, by the way, was in this audience.  He shook his hand. He talked to Eric.  He said, I need to reach out to you.  I need to I need to represent publishers and the rights of publishers.  But we need the Internet economy.  We need you guys that we're struggling here in Europe.  And we need the innovation.  So he said, I'm just trying to find a balance.  You know, on face value, that sounds good.  But actions speak louder than words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the feeling that one of the interesting things about this story was that,  you know, of all the European powers, the major European powers,  France is probably one of the biggest challenges in the long run for Google.  Germany is another one. But France is a difficult government to deal with,  because as we were talking about before, it's earlier, it's hard to control.  They like to control everything, like your language.  They'd like to make sure French, the French language is preserved and all that kind of stuff.  And so I got the feeling that Google established its kind of European  headquarters in France as a way to influence the French government.  And I think Sarkozy's appearance is a kind of an example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're exactly right.  I mean, and they also established a research institute in Berlin.  At the same time, some people, you know, complained about that.  But what do you complain about?  You know, they're there. You can't win.  You don't want Europeans to be the can't win continent.  If they're trying to Google's trying to reach out.  And I think that's not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here is Eric Schmidt.  He says with President Sarkozy, that is not I believe actually that's Nicholas,  the guy I talked to, Sarkozy's advisor on Internet Affairs  in their new office, where they have apparently Rubik's Cubes, snow globes.  They all and notice they have those those balls that I sit on.  So bourgeois, so bourgeois.  So I guess Sarkozy did go to the opening, but it was.  Yes, he did. Yeah.  He said, I know how controversial that is.  He's walking a fine line.  He's not very popular in France either, by the way.  He's on his way out. Yeah.  Although the fear is that someone who is more rightist will be elected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The week before I was in Paris and spoke at La Canteen,  which is a great  incubator space on the book, because it's just out in France as of last week.  And, you know, I took swipes at Sarkozy and nobody swiped back for me for that.  That was fairly popular to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's here's a picture of Sarkozy and Eric cozying up, so to speak.  How short is he? Tiny.  He's Regis Philbin short.  Oh, that reminds me a lot of Regis.  If Kelly's still looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, OK, OK. After the election, you have to do Regis with a French accent.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's a gigabyte?  I don't know what you're talking about, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the I don't know if I can mix those two together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does it work? The Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he's so yeah, he's a Yiddish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Phil's all mixed. Well, Philbin is kind of has that anyway.  He's a high  and like a lot of like Regis, very natty, well put together.  And like Regis had heavy pancake makeup on.  So that's my only observation.  He seemed like quite a nice fellow.  I'm sure that he's a perfectly fine fellow.  And, you know, politics is complicated and  I'm sure he believes that he's you know, he's representing the interests of  France. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he knows. Yeah, I believe that.  Google is but he defines France as the power structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's a little  I think after the currency deal that they just made in Europe,  it's pretty clear that all the power is in Germany  and and most of the euros are in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I when I got to Germany, I read in Velt, which the newspaper  saying that all of Europe learns to basically becomes German.  Yes, they can.  Do they see the irony in saying that? Yeah.  Well, if you can't win one way.  Well, yeah, that's that that's the great irony.  Currency reform.  And it's a united Europe and Germany's in charge. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a certain logic to that,  which is that Germany is the biggest country in Europe, and it's also  the most the most industrialized.  France may disagree with that, but it's you know,  the thing that has prevented Germany from being the clear leader in Europe  for all these years has been the legacy of World War Two.  And every decade that goes by, that that restriction fades a little bit.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Mike, Mike, that's what's interesting about this to me is  and this is why I tried to think about in terms of a beta culture,  is that, yes, Germany is the industrial miracle.  It's so far, even though there's a lot of good development going on in Berlin,  is it yet the digital miracle?  And will its culture support a digital beta fail in public culture?  If they can't handle street view, can they?  Well, exactly, exactly.  And, you know, can can France be farther ahead?  The UK, which is probably, you know, a little more fertile for digital.  But now they're they're more separated from Europe because of Cameron  and what he did with this agreement.  Eastern Europe.  You know, it's really interesting to see that in an Internet world,  if there's going to be a center of digital in Europe, where is it going to be?  And I don't think that's at all settled.  I think Loic's trying to help France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think that I think the Web is pan-European and I don't.  It's very international.  You know, half the people there are  you're Americans, more than half.  And, you know, Loic told me once that the original plan  and I think, you know, originally it was called Le Blanc, by the way.  I came to the Web a few years ago.  The original plan, I think, was to bring American entrepreneurs to Europe  to have some of that gold rub off.  And I think mission accomplished.  There are some issues in Europe.  You know, it's good in many different languages.  They don't have a venture capital  infrastructure like we do here.  They maybe have some risk aversion.  But I think that's changing very rapidly.  And the testament to that is the number of very successful startups.  You know, from Finland, you've got Rovio with Angry Birds.  From Sweden, you've got Spotify.  From Germany, you've got SoundCloud and on and on and on.  And these companies are doing very well.  They're really exciting American style startups.  That's one of the things that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, really good point, Leo, is that the way Germany used to do it  and I used to invest for my old employer in German companies  is they would tend to copy the American company, which wasn't a bad strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are a couple of companies in Germany that unabashedly do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've done that. And it's not a bad strategy.  Then you get bought by the one you copy.  But all the list you just gave and this is vital.  All the list you just gave is original companies that are doing new things.  And I think that's critically important.  And that's the way they're going to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Daniel Ek of Spotify is very interesting.  He said, well, one of the reasons I did this is Sweden was becoming known  as the pirate company, a country, he said, probably because of the penetration  of high speed Internet, widespread penetration of high speed Internet.  We had Pirate Bay.  We had that's where Kazaa came from.  And so he said, I kind of I love music and I kind of wanted to create  a company that promoted legitimate use of music.  And Spotify, there's no question is in my mind, is taken over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The startup scene in Europe is is more robust than people think it is.  And the reason for that is that when you look at Silicon,  first of all, you look at the United States versus Europe,  people tend to look at individual countries in Europe, whereas the United States,  of course, is a single country.  And so comparing US to Europe,  it's not a comparison that happens all that often.  Also, the bigger issue is that the giant companies, the Amazon, Google,  Apple, Facebook and so on, if you remove those from the US  technology scene and just compare the smaller companies in the US  versus the smaller companies in Europe, Europe is, you know, it's a it's a vital  segment of the technology industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, and especially with apps, you know, one of the things that's really happening  is it's the barrier to entry for creating apps and raising, you know,  crazy money. TaskRabbit just raised.  We interviewed TaskRabbit, Leo Buskin.  They just raised 28 million dollars for an app that basically  has somebody do your shopping for you.  And the barrier, that's a US company.  But the point is that the barrier to entry to creating these is very low  and the potential win is huge.  So we met a ton of new apps and it was very exciting, very vital.  You don't have to be you don't have to be working on the next Microsoft Word  or even the next Spotify or Skype.  You could be working on an app.  And we saw a lot of people there.  I was I was actually really exciting to me.  It felt and what's interesting, a number of American companies  made announcements there. Evernote announced two new apps.  Flipboard announced Flipboard for the iPhone, which is huge.  Spotify announced and this was funny because they had the week before  done an event in which they announced apps for the Spotify platform.  And they didn't mention this.  And they came on stage at the Web to say, oh, and by the way,  we're going to do radio, which, you know, if I were Pandora,  I'd be shaking my boots.  But most I think most telling in the past, Marissa Meyer has always come  and been the flagship representative of Google at this conference.  In fact, she got engaged at the Web four years ago  and goes back with her husband each year because it's, you know,  it's a romantic thing for them.  But they're a merger.  How geeky is that?  That would be a merger.  Merger. OK, let's call it a merger.  Marissa might have had the wherewithal to acquire a husband, but I think she.  Well, that's true.  I do believe it was an equal partnership.  But the fact that Eric Schmidt was there and not even the keynote,  the keynote was Karl Lagerfeld.  Well, isn't that wacky?  He had they Chanel.  Well, he was of Chanel, but he's doing a deal with another company  to do a Lagerfeld line online only.  I know that was really wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have Chanel.  No, not Chanel. It's anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me let me look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But didn't they aren't they suing?  And didn't they were they involved in that case that that they took over those?  And yeah, that's another thing.  OK, that's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lagerfeld is no I don't think he designs anymore for.  For Chanel, I don't know what he does.  Where does he buy those shirts?  Such a strange looking fellow.  And he says, I do not use the Internet, however,  I will be selling many things on the Internet.  You know, he's a very.  So that way, I mean, it's a that's one of the things that's fun about the web.  You know, South by really is about Austin and really has that Austin feel.  This is very much a European continental feel.  The barbecue.  You're coverage may definitely be the barbecue is terrible,  but the wine is excellent and caviar and paté.  They serve.  They serve.  They serve paté and wine at the conference for lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They serve paté and wine to the soldiers, French soldiers stationed abroad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it wouldn't be it wouldn't be lunch without the day line.  So he  he he Lagerfeld is making an audacious bid to make history in fashion and technology.  He's going to launch a lower priced lime named Carl.  200 pound jacket instead of 25000 pound jacket on and it'll be all online.  You can only buy it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, who is this group, Gina, when you go by clothes, how do you buy them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not I'm not a fashion person at all.  I mean, what do you mean by brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or do you ever go into stores anymore?  That's what I'm asking you simply.  Oh, as little as I have to.  When was the last time you were in a department store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, a department store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you asking her, is she the token woman?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to ask you all. Don't worry.  Gina's been in silence. I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I apologize.  I'm in an antihistamine haze today.  I haven't been in a department store in forever, but I'm really not like a fashion person at all.  I'm sort of I'm not a good example of a woman my age, I think.  But yeah, as little as possible on the type that I find the stuff that I like,  and I just order a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think all underwear thing we have, we guys have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Man packs love the man packs.  I need a real like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do you ever shop in person anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my wife does all of my shopping.  I say I need another shirt and then a day or two later, one appears.  And it's it's a great system and works for me.  But what's more interesting is that recently my wife has discovered the joy of buying footwear online.  And, you know, because you know, Zappos is great.  Yeah. Growth of free shipping and stuff.  And she's just been buying boots like like it's going crazy.  And so she so she's getting sucked into the whole online thing.  And it's really working for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I buy all my shoes at Zappos. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zappos is where I'm where I'm headed here is that is that is that retail's gone online first.  The designers who resisted because they thought it was cheapening them now have no choice but to write.  They have to figure out the appropriate way to do it.  You're not going to buy twenty five thousand dollar jacket online, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The new the new Carl Lagerfeld line I've had on the screen here is called is coming is at NetAporté.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, which is an amazing company is owned by.  Yeah, it's owned by it was bought by Richemont,  which is a very high end company that has all kinds of wildly expensive watches and fashion and things like that.  And they realized they were kind of trapped with I spoke for them once in South Africa,  but they realized they're kind of trapped with their retailers and NetAporté gets them out of that.  And NetAporté does, you know, it's like they've got Jimmy Chu, Yves Saint Laurent, Donna Karan, Chloe Burberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, but Bottega Veneta, they've got everybody here on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  The thing is that I would think, you know, high end fashion would really love the Internet because that whole industry is based on what's really, really new.  And it's really expensive because it's brand new.  Nobody else has got it. And it's going to be gone in six weeks.  Right. And that's perfect for the Internet.  You just have to make sure you get the kinds of people who buy that kind of stuff online.  And this guy with his Carl Lien is not helping by saying that he doesn't use the Internet.  He should be really embracing the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They even have look at this NetAporté live.  You can watch what people are buying.  As they buy 16,262 people are on this website right now buying crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Friction free snooping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, wow.  You know, up to now, what the haute couture companies have used the Internet for, and it's actually been very successful for them,  is kind of their remainders.  They don't want to sell the old stuff at a discount because it cheapens the name.  So they go to sites like fab.com.  They're a whole bunch of sites. Guilt. Guilt. Guilt.  Shame. Shame. Apathy.  Didn't Marissa Meyer have, didn't Google have a site like this as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did. They had a fashion site at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what they can do.  Somebody explain this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a visual matching thing.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  But like.com.  What was it?  Like.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  So, and I figured Marissa must have had a lot to do this because she's very focused on it.  I know fashion is a big deal for her.  Like.com, I guess, is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they folded it into Google Image Search and took away the commerce thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boutiques. That's it.  I think you're right.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I signed up for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the fashion voice coming in.  Also gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you Eileen representing.  Rue La La.  How it looks.  I'm all over that.  It's also there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rue La La.  I'm a member there.  I like that.  So somebody explained this to me that the whole deal is they don't want, they want it.  They got to get rid of this old stuff.  So they, but they don't want a deep discount in the stores because it really hurts sales.  So they have initially been using the internet as a dumping ground.  They put, that's where they put the reduced cost stuff on Rue La La, places like that.  But I think they're discovering, wait a minute, maybe we should also be selling the new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think your point about being, I think it was your point, Mike, about being current.  They should be more than current.  You know, waiting for the first designer to discover the wonders of Kickstarter.  If enough people want this, we'll make it.  If you don't, we won't.  And if you buy early, you get it before everybody else.  I mean, there's a great system of benefit there that people could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a shame that boutiques.com is gone and they've replaced it with, they said, go to Google  product search, which is not where women go.  That's where guys who wash their hair with soap go.  That's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to, I mean, I think the last time I went to Macy's was I needed a suit.  I had a meeting at the White House and it was like, I needed a suit before I go to DC.  So I went to Macy's.  I need a suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Help me Macy's.  Help me Nordstrom.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Moves.  So the parents are working at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody just bought a pair of flip flops in Sydney.  I just want you to know from Net-a-Porter.  I love the name Net-a-Porter.  It's at a completely obscure pun that maybe I guess fashion people would get.  I love how it's zipping around as well.  Somebody just bought a pair of slacks in West Africa.  I'd like to see returns.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be fun?  A shirt named Acne.  Good.  Just purchased in Egypt.  You really want to see who's buying this stuff.  I would love to.  Oh, look, somebody in France just bought a Michael Michael Coors.  Hot.  Hot boots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those boots are made for walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Handbag just sold to the United Kingdom in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man.  This goes beyond glee guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Tori Praver.  Lucy's Smocked Bandeau swimsuit just sold to Stockholm, Sweden.  This could be a whole TV show right here.  Strapless crepe jumpsuit.  Yeah.  I'm telling you this because fashion is your New York show.  Look at those Python and suede sandals just sold to Chicago.  My goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, so how about your Galaxy Nexus?  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for redirecting me.  Back to Earth.  I mean, I'm really anxious to see it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I ordered this speaking of online commerce from a British site, Expanses.  Now, have they announced Verizon available when it'll be available?  And we know it's Verizon.  They still have.  I thought for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I shot for sure the ninth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm glad I actually hailed.  I almost canceled this.  I thought, well, when I get back, I'll be able to get it.  So it did arrive.  Here it is.  This is the galaxy, Google galaxy Nexus running ice cream sandwich.  So if you've seen, if you've unlocked and GSM only, it's not  LT. So if you've seen cost you $749, that's about that's actually about right.  Anyway, I don't know if it's right or not.  It looks very similar to the Galaxy to.  S2 from Samsung.  This is, you know, similar back.  It's a little bit.  I don't know if you could tell, but it's slightly curved.  It's got the bulge at the bottom for the for the, I guess, for the antenna.  Um, OK, so ice cream sandwich really is the big change here because everything  else is it's a big screen.  Oh, and one other thing, and it's 1280 by 720 is the highest res screen out there.  But I'm going to tell you a little bit about that.  There's a caveat.  First though, I turned on the face recognition and let's see how well this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, a demo that might actually work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nope.  Couldn't find my face.  So it fails back to this.  Let me, let me try it again.  Cause it, you know, go ahead, put me on camera one because the truth is it works  better if I'm in a more it's this over the shoulder shot is not ideal.  But if I just do, if I just do this and it has to be, by the way, I tried this  in the dark, doesn't work and there it unlocked it.  So, um, it takes a couple of seconds.  It's cool.  You, it fails pretty quickly over to just the swipe.  Um, I'll leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have to hold it up in front of you.  So you lift your arm and hold it out like the shot straight on your face is the one  that's most likely to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Another stupid thing people will be doing in the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, and you do spend a lot of energy getting it just right.  And it didn't work again.  I was just swapping around.  So, uh, glasses, I think kind of didn't like, I haven't, I have to try it again  with my glasses on, but, uh, and sometimes it spends an inordinate amount of time.  And then it says, I don't, I don't know who you are.  So it's not, you're going to, it's a gimmick.  It's not, but it's inter it's a cool gimmick.  Um, now, but okay.  And in every other respect, you know, it's a, uh, it's a snappy phone.  This is, uh, there's a few things that are immediately throw you throw me anyway,  on about ice cream sandwich.  One is there's no physical buttons anymore.  The three buttons that are generally at this edge of the screen, although I, there  are soft, they're not real buttons.  They're on the screen, so they could move around anywhere.  You could barely see it.  There's the back button.  There's the home button and there's a recent apps button.  If you've used honeycomb, you'll recognize that from the tablet interface.  That's the recently run apps button search.  Not here anymore.  It's up here.  But it is on every page and it's, and you don't have to press and hold.  It's just one tap and you'll get the voice dictation, uh, and the search  capabilities that you're used to.  Although this has been much upgraded.  We're going to talk in a little bit about a new Google voice dictation system that  I think they're going to implement soon on this.  Um, so I have to say Siri quality dictation.  I'll show you in a second.  Well, uh, I could show you that now.  Um, let me, let me, let me start a message here.  New message.  Yeah.  I don't want to show phone numbers.  Thank you.  Uh, let's send one to Gina here.  So the voice dictation, if you're, if you're using, I don't want to  show any phone numbers, do I?  No, don't show it.  Don't stop.  Oh my God.  That's no, no.  Okay.  So here we go.  Here we go.  So I'll do the dictation thing here.  So there's a dictate.  This is the ICS keyboard.  But one thing they've done differently now with the dictation is it starts  typing almost immediately.  So it's quicker to make corrections because you can see what it is typing  and change it as you go.  And as you can see, it hasn't made a single mistake yet.  Exclamation mark.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is comparable to Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Siri has actually gotten less, uh, accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and Siri's down all the freaking time.  I know.  Means if it's accurate or not, if it doesn't work, I, I, I, I've been,  w I really like Siri and I was using it a lot to dictate on the iPhone 4S.  This works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one.  And that's, and that's making the requests over the network, Leo, as you speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't tell.  I think it is, but boy, it's watch.  I'll do it again.  It's fast.  It's really fast.  Cause that's the thing about it.  This is almost dictating in real time, which means, I mean, I do love the  fact that I can see the results as I go, which makes it much easier to  catch a mistake before you've gone on and on and on, and then you have  to go back and so forth, but this is, I don't know how this could possibly be  online, it's doing it practically in real time.  This is like dragging dictate on a desktop.  Can't you go into airplane mode and see.  Oh, I could, but that would be too easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't seem a little too fast for I'll go into airplane mode in a second,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but okay, you want to know the negatives and the only negative, and it's a hardware  negative. It's not an ice.  Well, I, okay, let me talk about ice cream sandwich briefly.  Let me finish that and I'm going to tell you what I don't like about this phone.  A couple of things that are different.  We've got the bar down here.  These are easily customizable.  When I go to the apps page, it's slide sideways, not up and down and widgets  are here, they're no longer on press and hold on the desktop.  And this is just like honeycomb, where you get a preview of the widget.  And if you want to put a widget on any page, you press and hold it and you  can drag it around from page to page like that.  The Google widgets are resizable.  So if this, if I've decided, this is the Google plus widget.  If I decided, you know, I don't want to occupy the whole page.  I do have handles that I can drag it and make it resizable.  There have been third party launchers like launcher pro that give you that  capability, but it's nice to have it built into the OS.  Unfortunately, it doesn't apply to all widgets, just to, just to a few and no  Google, no non-Google widgets that I can tell.  Um, although I, you know, I guess as time goes by, more people will release versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does just have to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yep.  The folder look is new.  It's a circle and it works like the iPhone does where you drag, if you drag  an icon, let's see, you drag an icon on top of another one, it will  immediately create a folder.  Uh, doesn't name the folder until you open it up and then you can  name it there like that.  I like that.  I think that in fact, as you can see, I'm using folders a lot, uh, to, uh,  give him, give me access to more things on the, on the desktop.  It comes with, interestingly enough, this is the vanilla Google experience.  It comes with a Google folder, uh, when you out of the box with all the  Google apps in a single folder.  Um, that's kind of smart, I think on Google's part, any redone apps in  there because of ice cream, uh, Gmail looks the same, um, yes, the context.  I'm not going to launch contacts cause I don't want to show you, but the context  is very nice, lots more space.  It's white.  It's got a light background.  Uh, it looks more like kind of a Rolodex.  It's nice.  I think they've done a really good job with the context app.  I think the maps app is the same.  Google plus different.  Uh, Google plus is different only in the respect that it's got a new widget that  is a full screen, a widget, but the Google plus app is, is really just an app.  Uh, but I do, but I do like the fact that I can do a full screen scrolling widget.  Of Google plus right on my desktop widgets are one of the things that  really distinguishes Android.  Well, this is, I'm sorry, go ahead, Leo.  This is not a widget.  This you cannot get rid of this Google search bar.  So Google's really taking a front page.  Uh, you know, they're really saying, no, we want some real estate right on  the front of the top of the screen.  So now 12 80 by seven 20, but you're going to lose this and you're going to lose  this because of the buttons.  So the available screen real estate is exactly the same as any other phone.  The only negative to the super high resolution, uh, is that sometimes this is  path, which by the way, I love, thank you, Dave Morin for making it available on  Android.  The typeface on this is, yeah, I'm glad they have that new, that new font because  it is tiny and there's, and you know, right now there's, there's, there's  Eileen, there's no way to make it bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the coolest thing about ice cream sandwich that hardly anybody talks  about and I buttoned hold the head of the ice cream sandwich project at Google  IO and ask him point blank.  Is there anything that would prevent somebody from using this on a desktop  computer?  And he said, no, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, well, we know the ACEs transformer for instance, is really kind of a  laptop with Android on it.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh yeah.  And I've seen people using a honeycomb, frankly, that they don't have ice cream  sandwich yet.  Somebody tell me that I can turn off.  I don't know where I'll look at display.  I can turn off that Google search in the settings.  They have reorganized settings in a very much nicer way.  So we have wireless and networks here.  Uh, I could see data usage in a very granular way that I couldn't see before,  including set a bar for my warning.  So I set it two gigabytes right now, but I can make it more or less.  Uh, and I could see which apps are using the most amount of data.  I think that's the kind of granularity people are going to need more and more.  These are the device specific, uh, control panels.  Somebody's calling me cause they know my phone number.  So you see, this is that honeycomb.  Go ahead.  Oh, sorry.  I don't care if we show their number.  This is that honeycomb slider.  You see, I can slide left or right to pick up or not.  Um, developer options, uh, because it's a Google experience phone, we have USB  debugging, stay awake, allow mock locations, desktop backup passwords.  Strict mode.  There's a whole bunch of developer options in here.  So I clearly, this is going to be the developer phone for Google going forward.  Makes sense.  Yeah.  It makes sense.  There's NFC is built into here by the way.  Uh, and apparently a barometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No app yet is taking advantage of this, but I want to know what the  barometric pressure is and apparently that's in here.  Battery life, exactly the same.  Here's the negative, the stupid pentile display.  So even though this is a AM song, Samsung says it's a super amylo display.  It is not as deep and rich as the galaxy two S two.  It's a, the path is a good example because it puts up this white screen.  You can see banding in here.  Uh, you can see pixelation in here.  When you turn it up to bright, it looks better.  The brighter you get it, but of course you don't want to do that.  You want to use automatic brightness, uh, to protect your battery life.  Um, it's not a consistent color.  Pentile is absolutely not as good as the super amylo, but I love the resolution.  And when you're watching videos on this thing and you turn it sideways, um,  it's a nice 4.6 something screen.  So there's definitely it's a, I think this is a good size.  I think it's been your default phone lately.  They are, uh, you know, I've been using the iPhone four S a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how would you compare this to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The screen is not as good as a high phone for us.  It's roughly the same, um, pixel per inch, a little bit, a little bit less,  but the iPhone four S color is much more accurate.  And I think that's a little bit of a negative on this.  Camera's comparable, not exactly as good.  There's a nice new feature in the camera that actually I've been using a lot.  It works really well.  Uh, this is the, again, this is, you know, Motorola and others have been  putting features into the camera software.  They ship with Android, but this is the Google camera and it now has a pano.  So there's still there's film and there's pano.  And if I want to take a pano picture, I literally just rotate the camera.  I don't even have to press the take button and it just records the images  and stitches them and does it and does a fairly nice job.  I found artifacts, but, uh, the trick is to go slow enough so that, uh, you  know, it does seem to, I've posted a couple of my, uh, uh, my, uh, where  did I put them?  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, a Euro nerd says the barometer is used for altitude measurement,  which improves GPS accuracy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  That makes sense.  Yeah, they're certainly on path.  So there's, there's one, uh, one in my gallery.  There's one I took and here's another one.  Um, and it's kind of neat to be able to do a pano without, you know, quickly and  built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  I like that feature a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll certainly do a lot more panos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chase the pano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what I'd like to see is, is the, this feature replacing the degree of wide  angle, I'd like to see flatter lenses as the default in phones, and then you can,  you can capture a whole room by panning around.  That's a great idea.  That would be better than the weird wide angle lenses that currently exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are all, you know, I would guess around 24 millimeter lenses.  They're fairly wide.  Um, which means it's fine if you're in close and for most uses of a  camera phone, that's what you want.  But if you're going to take a picture of a sunset, the sun is deep, the  moon is deep and so it's not great for, for distances.  Uh, you know, on balance, uh, this, this is a great phone.  I wish the display were better.  That's probably my only negative.  Uh, I've been very happy with it.  It does get really hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, on the back of it, uh, which is a feature in the winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure.  It could be a hand warmer and a phone.  And some people have complained, M G's M G Siegler complained about, of course  he's, you know, he loves the iPhone.  Complained about how chintzy this back cover is.  Samsung galaxy.  Yes, too.  It's the same problem.  And I just pointed out, well, MG, yeah, because you know, who would  want to ever change their battery?  Should be glass.  Just make it glass and glue it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that an iPhone 4s user, I'd like to change my battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, you know what I do with the iPhone 4s?  I have a big Mophie juice pack and you know what?  Everybody at the web practically had a Mophie juice pack.  If you're going to have an iPhone 4s, you have to have an external  monster external battery.  It's like carrying around a car battery with you.  Yeah.  Uh, this is this, but you know, this is not great battery life either, but at  least I can order another battery and have it charged up and, and pop it in  there, which is a lot more convenient than the Mophie.  So, um, on balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like it.  Can you go, can you go to an airplane, airport, mordant?  Oh yeah.  Let's do that.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's do the experiment.  Let's do the, let's do the dictation experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri is scientific moment for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Siri, as you know, won't even set an alarm without network access.  Siri says, no, no, everything I do must be sent back to the mother ship.  So, uh, we'll show you now.  Here's an interesting thing.  They've hidden it.  It used to be airport would be airplane mode would be right on top there.  It isn't anymore.  You have to click the more button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's usually as forth known as the Alec Baldwin button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am not playing the power button.  Uh, oh, that's yeah.  No, if you hold the power button, you get those, you get those choices.  Silent.  Okay.  You're playing a power.  That's how you do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That makes a lot of sense.  All right.  Hide my screen.  I don't want to show any phone numbers.  I can't remember.  Here I'll go.  I'll just pull it over here.  Sorry.  I can't remember.  Oh good.  No, I'm still in this bogus message.  So let's continue on with my dictation.  Nope.  It's not even, you can't even press it.  The button is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that is, I mean, that's, that's a pain, but it is so miraculous how the  speed is to be online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if it's not using both at the same time.  Spinning off the job locally and remotely.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems so fast.  I don't know how.  Well, maybe you could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does it behave on a slow connection or a connection that's just flaky and  going in and out?  It's interesting.  It was super fast.  Were you connected to the wifi at Leo?  Or?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me, let me turn off wifi.  That's it.  That's, let's do one more experiment.  If you will all bear with us, we'll turn off wifi.  So now I'm going to be on T-Mobile's HSPA plus 3G and let's dictate now.  So the good news is the dictation button is back on, but as you can see with 3G  dictation, it isn't nearly as fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, it's a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's not awful though.  And it, what I do like is it types as you go.  Yeah.  So, and a big improvement over the gingerbread implementation of dictation  is it lets you continue until you press done, which is what Siri does as well.  The problem I have with gingerbread is if you pause, it says, Oh no, you're done.  And then starts recognizing.  So I think this is actually a really good, this is not too bad.  Um, I would say it's about five seconds behind, maybe 10.  Um, so yeah, it definitely is tied to the speed.  So, so it is going out to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's need to optimize it as best they can.  Yeah.  That's, can you use it for, for, for any, well, we, and the run up,  but we have some kind of story.  Could you use it?  Number one in any, um, app or most apps?  Yes.  Remade board.  That's part of the keyboard.  Okay.  And then second, um, is it good for commands, you know, open, open email.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in this respect, it is superior to Siri.  Siri, for instance, will not open an app.  This will open apps.  Um, I've always liked the fact that I could say something like, listen to Bob  Dylan and because I have Spotify on here, you could, you tell it what you want to  have that listen command go to, but because I have Spotify on here, I can play any  music that is on Spotify, which is fantastic.  Uh, all kind of automatically search.  How do you, how do you cue it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That you're going to talk like you just did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, you have to remember there was, used to be search buttons at the bottom.  The search button is now always at the top.  Right.  So I'd say that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it weird to get used to having two layers of buttons  at the bottom of the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wish they had physical buttons still.  I don't really understand why we're using screen real estate for these buttons.  You know, I'll give you an example.  When you go to camera mode, uh, the camera kind of rotate, you  can't really see these buttons.  It turns the buttons into little dots, but they're still there.  They don't, it's not like they, it's not like they're rotating them.  To different sides of the screen.  They're always in the same position.  So these could easily have been physical buttons.  Maybe that's a way of saving money.  I don't know.  And I don't really, maybe, maybe others like this, but the recent apps button.  I don't find that particularly useful, but maybe some do.  I know that, you know, it's on honeycomb too, and they kept it in ice cream  sandwich, so there must be some reason that they do that.  It's cool.  I mean, there are thumbnails of every app that's running.  So that, you know, that's kind of cool, but I, it's to me, I don't need that on  a phone, that's more of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's surprising that they bumped the search button for that.  Like right now, when you build an app, you can attach search, like your internal app  search to the global search button, but that global search button doesn't exist  anymore.  That's that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't because it's only on the desktop.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only on the home screen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's on every screen, but it's not, it's not in an app.  Well, let me see.  Let me see.  I don't know.  I think you're right.  Let me, let me launch force.  Yeah, no, it goes away.  Cause so four square uses, by the way, that's another point is.  Four square does get to use the whole screen except for this little row on the  bottom.  The other thing is the menu command now is this dot dot dot.  It looks like a sideways ellipsis.  Um, and it, it, there is inconsistency about where it lives.  Sometimes it's down here.  Sometimes it's up there.  I just really prefer physical buttons that don't move, but, uh, that's now, you  know, Google made a big point about Hugo Barman, a big point about that.  No, we don't have physical buttons anymore.  They're gone.  Apple and beef.  Yep.  Yeah, exactly.  It's very jobsy and you still have volume control.  He's having an on off button.  I don't, I don't see the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If an app is designed for ICS or honeycomb and ICS, it will use the action bar,  which is having that menu drop down on the, on the bar across the top of the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if that's what you liked is the action bar.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So that's why they show that ellipsis.  That's like the old school apps that that's just backwards compatibility with  the old menu button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Got it.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if they want, if they're trying to get people to use voice recognition  instead of lunging for the search bar again, out of Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but the problem is it's the, the voice recognition button is on the search bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So how do you invoke search?  Like I'm thinking about my app.  That's it.  You know, my to do it, my to do app.  It's like, how do you launch search within an app?  I guess you have to do it from the action bar or you have to put, yeah, you'd have  to probably put a search button on your action bar.  That's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting.  That's probably what they want.  Anyway, I, you know, it's a nice phone.  It's not a, it's not the Jesus phone.  But what is, what is, and I do, I can understand Google's going, I have to say  for two days I was uncomfortable with ice cream sandwich.  Uh, it just was, it was different enough and not, it didn't feel like a better,  just different, uh, I'm starting, I'm coming to get used to it.  Uh, maybe it's better.  I don't know.  Um, there's some things that are certainly better.  Camera app, by the way, very fast on this, uh, faster than an iPhone 4s.  So that's nice.  Uh, and the gallery loads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's see here.  I'll show you the gallery.  Look at me.  That's me.  See?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audibly disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's look, where did I put the gallery?  I guess I don't have it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sounds of an Android user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the new calendar, by the way.  Very nice.  That's one thing that has been changed.  The calendar could, and this is the context style, contact list style with  it's white now, um, I think the con the calendar is much better, uh, very modern  feeling that's one thing that's aesthetically, I think got, gotten really, really nice.  Uh, it looks nice.  Yeah.  It's much better.  Um, they already had a very nice gallery app and so that's, that's, that's, uh,  not, not changed a lot.  Uh, let's launch it.  Yeah, it has changed.  I take it back because this is the tile, a tile interface now, uh, which is nice.  I like this.  They've done a nice job.  Um, thumbnails at the bottom.  Yeah, it's snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you see how fast that is?  Yeah.  Yep.  You certainly don't ever feel like, oh, this is laggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think that you can see, I've customized it already quite a bit.  I have the beautiful widgets, by the way, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google,  10 cents right now, a lot of apps are 10 cents on the market, including beautiful  widgets, which everyone should have.  Um, there, there's a, is there any way to know that on the market?  To know what what's 10 cents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a, uh, a 10 cents button.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's another thing that's changed is now we have apps, widgets, and there's  always a market button on the, uh, just kind of like the bookstore, you know, it's  just how it should be.  You should always have a market.  So right there, search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So right there, premium apps, 90% off two days left.  And every day it changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so check this.  This is their response to Amazon's app of the day, free app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's limited time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Nexus arrives Verizon tomorrow.  Two 99 tomorrow.  Two 99.  Go to the next web.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  That is expensive.  So seven 49 doesn't for unlocked, uh, GSM doesn't seem so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon will deck out with mobile hotspot service for additional 20 bucks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Additional.  Yeah.  Well, they've been doing that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have, um, so that's, that's supposed to be the four GLT network.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't, I don't mind not having 4g on here.  I'm just rationalizing the browser.  Oh, I like the browser.  Let me show one more thing.  I know this is dragging.  Uh, one more thing, the browser share location.  Yes.  Thank you.  Oops.  So this is why I don't like soft buttons.  It's too easy to push them.  Um, share location.  See, it's right by the button there.  So it's very easy to do that.  Uh, the browser now has, so you saw I drag it down to see the address bar.  This is windows.  So if you have multiple windows open, you'll see them here.  Uh, bookmarking, um, sharing was there as well.  And this is that dot dot dot menu.  I don't like it that you don't know exactly where it's going to be.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so where it goes bottom to top.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, I do like the browser.  Those are very, very snappy.  Um, I had easy tab.  I used to have a, um, actually those tabs are part of the Google.  Uh, I used to have a variety of third party, like dolphin and X scope  apps, uh, used for browsing.  I, I, I, I'm sticking with this one.  That's good.  Nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, so when you pull down, you can see the address bar, but if you open a new tab,  it shows the, the, the thumbnail, right?  It's not, it's not like a tab the way it is often.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Uh, so that's plus here, right?  So that's a new tab and, uh, let's see.  Where's it?  What, what should we render?  How about, uh, what's a galaxy nexus?  I just, I want to, um, go to a site with flash.  Vimeo.  You saw this.  I mean, you feel how snappy this is.  It really, I feel it's actually snappier than my desktop.  It feels pretty good.  It's on wifi.  I should point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope the tablets are the snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  What is the processor in this is at one point?  Two.  Two.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I get this to play, maybe it's not gonna, so maybe it's flash.  Anyway, there you go.  That's my, uh, extremely lengthy and detailed review.  No, it was a good tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rehearsal for our product show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to do, we're going to do this on the product show is one of the  things I'm going to, we're going to review on the production, uh, including, uh,  one of these new UM, uh, ultra mobile PCs.  Um, yeah, I, you know, I think it's probably the best Android phone out there,  but if you already have a galaxy S two do not feel the need to jump, especially  since I think you'll get ice cream sandwich pretty quickly, uh, especially  since there's CM nine might be the way to put it on a lot of phones is UCM nine,  uh, Cyanogen mod instead of, uh, official ICS.  Well, we're going to take a break and then we're going to talk about the, how  many, how many, this is a quiz question.  How many private jets do Larry, Sergey and Eric have between them?  Just a little quiz question, but before we do that, let's talk about my private  jet, my Ford Mustang.  I'm a big Ford fan.  As you know, in fact, earlier today I was a test driving a Fiesta, the focus.  And then later today, I think I have a 2012 Mustang to try.  And in every case we're trying out the new Ford sync and my Ford touch and  these sync services, which are really awesome if you haven't tried these.  So what you do is you press the button again, steering wheel, right?  Eyes on the road, steering wheel.  You press the button on the focus.  It's a little paddle behind the wheel.  I like that very easy to hit.  And, uh, you say, uh, services and you can get news, stocks, sports,  weather, horoscopes, uh, you can say, what's the traffic like on my route home?  What's the traffic light on my route to work?  What's, what's traffic like on the way to sit at San Francisco?  And it will tell you, uh, it's, it, you can have an in-dash display that does  this, or you can have it read it to you as you drive, you can even have it.  Text it to your mobile phone.  How about that?  Uh, and of course all the personalizations available online.  So you don't have to do it in the car when you're at home.  You can even say, I'm going here, here, here, here on Google  maps and send it to the car.  I love what they're doing with sync and sync services.  I encourage you to go to your Ford dealer and drive a 2012 focus.  Awesome car today.  Uh, or visit the website ford.com slash technology.  Some great stuff.  And we'll get the video.  We're going to, I shot a bunch of video in these new cars so you can see, uh,  me at work, although tell Tom for some reason, I asked for tech news today  and I got freak a leak.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Freak a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tom's looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the universal music group has infiltrated even my Ford sync.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Dave.  That's that video has been pulled down.  We, we haven't, we have ford.com slash technology.  We actually haven't talked about that issue.  We should talk about it briefly.  YouTube screwing me and Tom and every, and every freedom loving American who  wants the internet to be free and, and open.  So you've heard the saga of mega upload.  Did you guys talk about this last week?  We didn't actually.  So mega upload is a site that some say is used for piracy.  Certainly it's a way to upload large files.  Although, uh, who was it?  50 cents Snoop.  Dr.  Dre.  Somebody said, Oh, I use this all the time to share music with my buddies.  Uh, I needed an update to Adobe flash player.  So mega upload made a mega upload, uh, kind of promotional video with will.  I am and a lot of big names.  Who's is Beyonce in that?  No, I can't remember who's in the video.  A lot of big names.  And, uh, weirdly, even though mega upload says we own this video, we've got  permission to use everything in this video, universal music group just kind  of took advantage of the fact that there's automated takedowns and took

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  down somebody else's video, mega uploads videos and said, well, I  know we don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still down if you go there, uh, which sucks.  Tom Merritt on tech news today, uh, was talking about it this week and  he played the video, right?  They took tech news today down.  So we, he, we appear, which, so, so here's the problem with this.  First of all, mega upload.com says we have the rights to this video and it's,  it's illegally taken down from YouTube.  Second, even if that weren't the case, this is a news show.  It's a news story.  We're using a clip of it in a new show, which is absolutely legal and fair  use and always has been go home and watch the news tonight and you'll  see this happen all the time.  This is, this is completely permissible.  Um, they pulled down TNT.  We appealed it, the automatic takedown.  They put it back up and then universal music group filed a injunct, right?  They filed an automatic injunction, took it down again.  We've appealed that now they have 10 days to get a court order.  And if they do pull it down again, and I, you MGI encourage you to pull it down  again, please, we will go to court because that is not okay.  Now, unfortunately, and maybe Jeff, you know this better than I, I'm told that  the fair use is a defense.  It's not a mess.  So I can't use it proactively.  I have to go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And the fair use as Lawrence Lussing said is a right to hire lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that sucks because I don't want to spend a lot of money to have the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have the incredible Twitter army, you know, just today, writing the  path train in New Jersey, I sit down and see a guy next to me is coding on his Mac.  Uh, he looks over and he says, you Jeff Jarvis?  Uh, this is the show.  Uh, you have the Twitter army, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, so the question is, uh, well, you know, if it's expensive, we'll have to do a  defense fund or not an offense fund.  Yeah.  But we will, but even if not, I'm going to pursue it.  Cause I just think that this is, we, if we, we cannot sit silent as stuff like  this continues and they pull down a lot of our shows all the time.  And I guess really what we have to do is go to Congress and say, dudes, you're  killing online content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  But here's the other thing I think we have to do is we have to give Google cover on  this and I'm not saying this is a Google fan boy and we're not defending what  Google does automatically.  Corey Doctorow has a piece in the Guardian right now talking about how  YouTube system is screwed up.  It's broken.  But what we have to do is put Google in position where they say, Whoa, you have  to, we're going to get in, uh, an S load of trouble for following your orders all  the time, you know, come on, you're getting us in trouble here.  Well, we've got to get Google in trouble.  We've got to go port.  These things happen in organized ways.  Otherwise Google's going to the path of least resistance, which is to listen to  the big media when they're trying to do deals with.  So we've got to create pressure on the other end.  Time to bring the Twitter army to March behind time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This would, if I can't think of a better reason to mobilize, I've always very  grateful that we have such a great community and active community.  I don't like to, uh, mobilize them unnecessarily, but this really is an  important, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think in this case, what we're doing is we go to YouTube, we go into Congress,  you know, Occupy Washington.  Um, if we, I think that if we go to YouTube and Google and say, you know,  there's two sides to this darn it.  Right.  And stop just going automatically to the big media side.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, and we're the future of media.  Damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, what you're doing is you're empowering big media worse.  You're empowering people like UMG.  You're empowering content rights holders to squash the future.  So let's knock that off.  Uh, or we can't do our jobs.  Now I don't, I cannot look at YouTube as a revenue source because this happens  at least, you know, weekly on this show.  It happens a lot because we play a lot of clips.  Uh, it happens all the time on Twitter.  I don't know.  Does it happen a lot to TNT for Tech News?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it actually doesn't.  It's happened to us on frame rate.  Hi, Leo.  Uh, it's happened to us on frame rate a couple of times.  Cause we play movie trailers.  That's murkier ground with tech news today.  We played a portion, not the entire video in order to illustrate, uh, the news story,  which we were commenting and critiquing on.  That is absolutely fair use.  I'm 99.9% certain we are in the right here.  It's not a like, well, we were playing the trailer, but you know, maybe it's not.  No, this is, this is what fair use exemption is carved out exactly for.  And the way the law is written, uh, universal can legally get YouTube to take down our  show until it is no longer relevant 10 days later with no chance of remediation.  Right.  The only chance of remediation we would have would be to go to court.  If YouTube puts it back up after the 10 days.  The only chance of remediation would be, we would have to proactively sue  universal music group and try to prove in court that they in bad faith took us down.  That is incredibly difficult to prove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The typical fair use exemptions for this kind of thing are for criticism or comment.  That was what that was.  Or news reporting.  That's what that was.  Um, research and scholarship, nonprofit, educational uses and parody.  Uh, any of those would be traditionally accepted by a court as a defense.  That's the problem.  The, the, the DMCA has written such a way that this takedown request is automated.  It happens.  YouTube just says, yes, they don't even, there's no human involved.  Uh, which is why a company like UMG could pull something down that they don't even  own and then pull down a new show that covers the story, which is absolutely  censorship, the whole reason UMG is doing this is not because piracy is involved here.  They don't want you to hear the story.  Right.  And that's, I mean, appalling.  They don't, they, this is censorship.  This is them saying that's a story that doesn't reflect well on us.  Make sure it doesn't get out.  So here's a question.  We've got to get these stories in.  Well, I don't know.  Should we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you try it?  If they can, if they can do it to you, why can't you do it to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, cause I, uh, I don't know if I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because they have better lawyers than us, so they can afford to take us to  court and say, this was a bad faith takedown.  They said on this week in Google that they were going to do this as a, you  know, as a matter of retribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not about the outcome of the court case.  It's about the public opinion.  Right.  And there was a case when it was in New Hampshire where, um, where some people did,  uh, a eminent domain on the home of a judge who had ruled in favor of a company  that was using at a domain domain to take away people's homes.  And so this would be a fantastic publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to do it as a publicity.  So I just think we need to, I just think we need to really stand up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the problem is, I don't think I would do that for that person, but I think  you do need a publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem is, don't do the stunt that it costs us money every time they do this.  Because that's, uh, those 10 days go by, this stuff is like, you know, fish rap.  It doesn't, it doesn't, nobody's going to watch a new show that's 10 days old.  So it's done.  That means it's a restraint of trade action.  Yes.  It costs me, uh, every time they do something like this, thousands of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Twitter army, Twitter army.  We need good pro bono legal help on this for Leo at all.  Leo and Tom at all.  Well, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not yet.  Let's see what happens.  We need some advice.  We need some advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, advice would be good.  Best paths.  What, what re what, what are the options for Twitter?  Um, and then, you know, choose the best options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, um, and we can't so much to talk about, and we're already 15 minutes  late, so Tom, we're going to get back, get to you in just a moment.  The answer to the question and should be your number of the week, but it's not,  I hope eight, eight Larry, Sergey, and Eric Schmidt have eight private jets  between three of them.  That's why they're renovating for $33 million.  The airship hanger at Moffett field.  Anybody who lives in the Bay area is driven by this ginormous hanger.  They used to put blimps in on Moffett field.  They're going to spend $33 million to renovate the 1930s hanger one.  And, uh, that's where they're going to store their eight planes.  Why?  Because it's really cool.  Yes.  It's also really close.  Uh, they have, okay.  The there's a modified Boeing seven.  These are, we're not talking about G five's baby modified Boeing seven 67,  two G five's a seven 57.  And, uh, apparently they've added a fighter jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we said last week that Google's not a nuclear power, maybe it is.  Bombers next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's five.  And apparently there's three more that are, you know, we're looking for people.  Are they personal property or company property?  Uh, not clear.  They do at least these back to NASA apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  NASA uses them as well as part of the deal to allow them to.  Yeah.  So it's, it's, they're kind of, um, and, and this is uncomfortable for NASA  because here's this government agency that is favoring a specific company.  I'm sure Larry Allison would love to get his plane in there.  I mean, there's all kinds of weird politics about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the tech crunch is reporting this, but the San Jose Mercury news said eight  tech crunch found five.  We're still looking for the three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe one of them is that giant plane that Paul Allen is building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an amazing story.  That's a story for another day.  Cause we've got so much more to talk about.  I really want to get to, uh, Modgel.  We got to talk about Modgel.  That's a, it should be like a rap song.  I want, is it major?  It's major.  Tom is the expert on geek culture.  Major Barrett.  Major Roddenberry.  You know, he major Barrett Roddenberry.  And it's a new thing that Google is going to do apparently.  But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at new egg.  If you've ever, if you've ever bought computer hardware, uh, or gadgets or  cameras or anything really that, uh, with technology involved, you know about new  egg, everybody who's into technology knows about new egg, it's a place to go  to get great deals on, I think 85,000 products, 1.9 million customer reviews on  their site.  So you always know if what you're getting is going to do what it wants to do.  The only problem I have with new egg is my budget because I could spend millions  and I don't dare.  I got to save some money for the UMG battle.  Fortunately, you can trade in your used electronics for a new egg gift card.  And this is a great way to do it.  New egg.com slash trade.  They're using our old friends at gazelle.  So you can, you can bring your old iPhones there, your old Kindles, your  digital cameras, your D 90 with lens, 171 bucks, cyber shot, 82 bucks, uh, Kindle.  43 bucks.  H Droid bionic.  I would trade that in for a Nexus.  You bet.  The camera on that thing is you could wait a day for the camera to take a picture.  It's horrible.  So, uh, but don't tell anybody cause they're, they're 290 bucks for a droid bionic.  So 290 bucks for a droid bionic.  New egg.com slash trade.  Get rid of the old, bring in the new.  Once you know you new egg, new egg.com slash trade.  Just think of it next time you want to get some fun.  No, I end up holiday shopping for myself because nobody's going to buy me the eight  gigs Corsair SD ram stick that I want.  So I do that for geeks.  We have to buy for ourselves.  Uh, Google Chrome 16 is out with a user, multiple user profiles.  That's a nice feature.  Thank you, Google.  Something Firefox said for ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, before you move on from that, I have a theory about that, which is that if they  can get everybody, I think this is what they're going to do with many, many of their, uh,  online products and services and so on.  Get you to add your password in order to use it because if you enter in your Google  password, you are now using Google plus.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's all about the plus baby.  Isn't it?  It's soon as you do that everywhere you go and the Google sites, it's going to show  you how many notifications you have.  The going to put your name up there.  What's going on over there.  You click it.  They're going to suck everybody.  You know, Google has way more than a Google, a billion users per month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do I sign in?  I don't, I'm not finding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on go into the wrench menu and they'll say like signed in as whoever you are.  And then you can add new users there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it.  I got Britain 16 and I'm not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let me see here.  Let's try this here.  Okay.  There's the wrench.  Uh, and I'm sorry.  See, I'm signed in as a little bit.  I got a synced as, but I didn't get signed in.  No, you don't have the newest version.  So here's what you do to make sure you get the, you go to Chrome about Google  Chrome and checking for updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love the version numbers, by the way, the version numbers are like IP addresses.  It is.  It's a dotted quad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, uh, update now, of course, nine 12 would be illegal, but anyway, update  now, if you don't have it, like God, yeah.  All right.  Well, why don't you have what we have, which is signed in as, well, if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  choose synced as, uh, Jeff, what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I nothing.  I'm not getting these things.  I'll find it.  I'll figure it out.  People.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does show up, uh, in your personal stuff and the preferences, how you're  signed in, you can manage your synced data on Google dashboard, but if you  see here, it says users, you're currently the only Google Chrome user.  I can add a new user right here under personal stuff.  Actually my Chrome for some reason on my max is really slow right now.  So I just started using Safari again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there and, uh, you'll have to take the omnibar for my cold.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate that with Safari.  I don't, I keep typing the type in a search term in the, in the address bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it doesn't like, I know it feels so old.  Go to the alt K or control K or whatever it is to get to the search bar.  I think that's a good theory though.  Mike.  I think that the classification of everything continues.  I think it makes a lot of sense that they want to know who you are.  Uh, add those plus one buttons everywhere, but it's  the one tracking you everywhere.  They everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my theory is that Google is heading toward having one product.  They weren't initially a company with one product, which is search.  And then they spun out one product after another, and now they're scattered  all over the place and being threatened by Facebook, which is a single walled  garden type of place where you use all these different things, but always  inside the context of Facebook.  And they found that that's very powerful.  So what they're doing, the big strategy appears to be make everybody who uses  Google, anything, a user of Google plus.  And it's a powerful strategy.  One of the, one of the aspects about it that I think is underappreciated is  that they're going to feature eyes, everything they're going to take things  that are currently products elsewhere and make them Google plus features.  Now you see them doing that with Hangouts, which is now, you know,  Skype has been a product all these years.  And now pretty much all the basic things that are available in Skype are now  simple features that are already there free right there.  You already signed in, ready to go click a button.  You're using the feature of Hangouts and so on.  And so what is, how do you exist as a product when your product is just a  feature that everybody already has and they're going to just lay waste to all  these smaller companies, I think that by, by simply product, by  featurizing their products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can now add Hangout to a post or it actually is added automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You, you can be having a conversation, click a Hangout button and that  conversation turns into a live video Hangout.  Yeah.  Holy camo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you, has that happened to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the link about half an hour before the show started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm getting it on my post too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Haven't tried it yet though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't either.  I'm seeing it actually on everyone's posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I see it now.  Yep.  So if I, so Herbert posted this Galaxy Nexus available tomorrow of  Verizon, if I wanted to talk to Herbert about it, I just click the Hangout  button and it would say, Herbert, Leo wants to talk to you.  I guess this is going to use Google talk.  Or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's Hangouts.  Use Hangouts.  And the other thing is that Herbert will see that a persistent button now on the  right saying Leo's trying to have a Hangout with you or call, cause you can also,  you can also call phones now.  Like, thank God no one's there.  But that, that Hangouts is just a lot more kind of there all the time starting today.  This is kind of a Regis phone moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm such a nerd cause you know, this, and this is my problem with  Hangouts, FaceTime, all this.  I don't want to talk to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, you don't want to talk to anybody, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I talk, I talk at people.  I don't want to talk with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's another thing they announced actually, the, the ability to broadcast  your Hangouts and then automatically record them to YouTube is something they  announced today, they're rolling out to a lot more people.  So in fact, Leo, you will be one of those people, I guarantee it because you have a  lot of circle friends on Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some circle jerks too, but most of them are friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Circle jerks as well.  But you could, you could, if you want to talk at people, Hangouts is a great way to  do it, just restrict who can get on the call.  And then you just broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I said this before, if I had this five years ago, when we were starting  Twitter, this whole network would have been very, very different.  We had to, we had a labor to get multiple people in video conferences and all that.  This is like push a button.  By the way, I have an announcement.  I think I can announce this.  Trey Ratcliffe, the great photographer who was here yesterday for Twitter photo  and has been doing at least weekly, sometimes twice weekly Google Hangouts  with other photographers, he's really been doing a show and I love it.  And he's agreed to add it to the Twitter network.  So we are going to do in fact, exactly that where he's going to do Hangouts, but  we're going to broadcast him.  We're going to restore him.  We're going to offer him his podcasts kind of automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  I think that's one, it's a great experiment and I'm very grateful to Trey.  He actually came to us and said, we, we'd like to do that.  I said, Trey, are you kidding?  You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now are you going to be able to add ads into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we, you know, I train, I talked a little bit about how would we, how  would we do ads?  So I don't know.  I don't know.  What I was thinking is what if, okay, it's a photography show.  So what if we got somebody like B&H photo, which is a big photography salespeople  to say, you know, sponsored by brought to you by B&H photo.  And then maybe had just a little logo on the page or something.  I don't want to interrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  But it's the same as you do now.  And then they're sponsored, they're, they're, they're host read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't even thinking of that.  Although you could have me as one of the nine, I could just be sitting there and  then, and then Trey could say, well, now we're going to take a break and click on  me and I get a big, now I'm going to do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's just, if you're going to shoot on location, you're going to need to get there  and afford the new Ford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For pics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know they're trying to rush us along here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we have Chipotle news first.  Okay.  Real quick.  So I, a manager of a store told me that they're going to bring back the, um,  chorizo because it's going to be part of the breakfast menu.  Yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That mollified.  Eileen was in such a hurry until you said that.  And now she says, Oh, we can keep doing this.  Yeah.  Tell us more.  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should she pull the tweets came in and said, well, not so fast.  It might be everywhere.  But I said, you know, listen to your people.  The people were going nuts for this.  Yes.  End of drinking game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now on to any of that means, uh, I was going to talk about, uh,  major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me major major major Barrett Roddenberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's just a rumor, but apparently Google will have maybe even by the end of  the year, this is according to Android and me, a Siri like dictation system that  improves on the existing system, which is already pretty damn good.  And they've been working on it for some time and evolution of voice actions.  The only difference with the Syrian voice actions, as far as I'm concerned is  voice actions has limited vocabulary.  Siri has more natural language.  This would add natural language.  So Google has to do this because, uh, Siri can disintermediate them.  It can say, yeah, we'll search for it on Wolfram Alpha.  Or Bing.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the feeling that Google is going to take this tool and Google ify it by essentially automating the process of finding out what real people  say in real life and building those common phrases and responses in, in a  hugely scaled version of that.  So, and the power of that is that it's not just American English, you know,  Siri is this, you know, English speaking person who speaks a few of the major  dialects and, uh, essentially talks like an American, but imagine every little  dialect, every little regional thing.  It could detect how you talk and talk back at you in the same language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said this, uh, Mike, when, when Siri came out, you said Siri's a game changer,  but it ain't going to be Apple in the long run.  It's going to be somebody who has a lot of information.  It's going to be Google.  Going to be Google.  It's going to be good.  I agree with you.  And they're already pretty darn close.  This ice cream sandwich is pretty darn close.  Um, so Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, the iOS, the Gmail iOS app just got another update.  You know, when it first launched, they had that bug that they had to pull it  within a day and the reception was kind of lukewarm.  It's not, it doesn't have that many features, but it just got this new  update with a couple of new features.  It supports nested labels.  There's a new notification sound, but my new favorite, um, feature is  this thing called scribbles.  If you're composing a message in Gmail, this works especially well on your iPad,  because, you know, you get the bigger screen, but it works on the iPhone as  well, you can sketch something out.  Like if you're sketching on like a napkin or if you want to draw something real  quick and attach it to your email really quickly.  So it's got, it's kind of like a very basic paint tools.  It's got colors and brushes and that kind of thing.  And you can send it as an attachment to your email, which is just an image  attachment, which is kind of fun little thing for kids or if you're the kind of  person who likes to do things visually.  I just bought, and this is, this is a confession or admission.  I just got a stylist for my iPad, which I know you're not supposed to get a  stylist, but I've been using some art apps and I wanted a little more precision.  So this, so I've been drawing and writing and drawing a lot on my iPad.  So I'm really excited about scribbles.  So that's in the new update to Gmail on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which one did you get?  Just so I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got the, uh, bamboo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the hot one right now.  So walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it's the Logitech.  It's a, it's a silver one.  I forget now.  The Logitech.  Kind of hold me at the end.  Like, yeah, well, that's got kind of just like a rubber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I know which one you got.  I can't remember the name because that's the one that originally came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure it is a Logitech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, this just in it's snowing in Mountain View.  Good.  They did this.  Google does this every year.  They bring in snow machines for their employees and they've snowed on all of  the honeycomb and the donut and the eclair and all the little Android gingerbread men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the ice cream was leaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looks like it's the ice cream.  Uh, the fro yo.  Let's get Jeff's number actually numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was going to do five.  The New York times did this ridiculous, uh, fake trend story.  They found five people who aren't on Facebook and called it a trend.  And I hate that.  I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's 800 million people using it.  Five knot.  That's a trend.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to do 10 because this is the season of the time person thing of the  year and 10 best listen predictions.  And I hate all that BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, time picked the right person.  Yeah, they did.  The price thought the protesters, which is the time person of the year this year  is exactly right, whether it's Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, or Zuccotti park.  I think it's the year of the protesters.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the number I'm going to do, which is 500,000, which is how much  Louis CK nethead.  Yes.  A gross gross for his video just announced on a site.  It means he netted three days, $200,000, or as he said after taxes, $75.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He actually, his math is completely wrong because he says at the beginning of the  blog post, the cost of production were essentially covered by ticket prices to  this show.  So it's all profit or close to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All profit, $500,000 to 110,000 copies, five bucks each, $550,000.  People thought he was crazy doing this.  Some PayPal charges, the site cost $32,000, which is expensive, but he said  it really had to be robust and good.  And so he said he probably wouldn't paid a little bit more if a company had just  paid him for the rights, but they would have charged everybody 20 bucks.  Meanwhile, people are going to keep buying this.  He's going to make an effort.  This is the first three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Three days.  He's going to make a million bucks on this thing and it's going to change  comedy on the net.  Yeah.  So he's really happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did it.  It's an education.  And what delights me so much about this is that I, you know, whether it was, I  try to get, I wish that Howard Stern had been somebody to prove that the  net is ready for stars.  We only have Glenn Beck.  So now this is an antidote to Glenn Beck to say that you, you know, Hey, stars,  you really can do it on your own to heck with SOPA to heck with all this stuff.  This is where we're going.  Your fans will buy your stuff, make it easy for them.  And Louis CK is a half million dollars richer because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He is.  I mean, I watched last night.  I watched like eight, eight Louis episodes.  He is so smart, so funny, so creative and, and he's smart enough.  And I know that he's not a super techie, but he's smart enough to trust his gut  and say, you know, I bet if I charge five bucks, I have no DRM, I have no copy  protection, I think I can do okay.  He did more than okay.  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if people, people, no, no doubt did copy it and did pass it around for free, he  still made a half a million dollars and his fans love him and he found new fans.  And this is a smart way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he did it right too.  He did it kind of in the same way you do it, Leo, which is that, you know, you're  broadcasting before and after the show.  There's a lot of transparency that the live audience can come in just, you know,  it's a very transparent and open process.  And he did the same thing.  They filmed him in the beginning, walking down the street and you're like, oh,  he's walking down the street.  And then he walks up to the theater where, where the show is taking place and  started and, and walks in the front door of the theater.  Doesn't, you know, not a limo in the back, but walks in the front door of the  theater, shaking hands, everybody's patting them on the back.  And then he starts the show.  There's no announcer.  There's no opening act, nothing.  He just walks out on the stage, ask people not to use their cell phones and then  does his thing and walks off and that was it was totally bare bones, you know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, really, really great.  By the way, he, maybe he's more techie than I thought, because two days ago he  did a Reddit AMA, which is ask me anything.  Hi, I'm Louis CK.  And this is a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said he had no idea what AMA was, but he was going to try and do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody's telling him he's got, I don't know what somebody's telling them.  He's obvious.  I think he's got, you think he is.  He's geeky in the sense he gets it.  He gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is changing and he understands his respect for his fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a pioneer and to take somebody of his stature, to take that chance  and, and make it work is huge.  Huge.  Mike, did you have a tip or any, any thing you'd like to pass along?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  How to do a poll on Google plus.  Cool.  There isn't a plugin, but what you can do is you ask your question, you know,  what flavor ice cream do you like?  Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry.  And then you put in the comments, what the answers are, the options, one for each  options of chocolate, it's one vanilla and so on, and then people can vote  by clicking plus one, what, what you then do is you turn off comments.  You inform people in the post that comments are off.  So don't try to comment and vote by clicking plus one.  And then which up with is 340 people like this one, 200 people like that one.  And you can do a poll of any length.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to see if, are there any polls that you've done recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have pretty recently, maybe three or four days ago.  Of course I post a thousand things a day.  That's the problem.  You write so much on here.  But, uh, you could, you could do your own poll.  Actually it's instantaneous, but it's, uh, it really works and people really enjoy  it and it's a great way to, you know, if you have a really contentious issue like  religion or Android versus iOS, uh, it, you end up with so many comments, nobody  could possibly read them all, but a poll, everybody can get the snapshot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  our people pretty ruly.  I mean, do they, do they follow the rules and do it or do they start commenting?  Cause if they start commenting, you could screw the thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You turn comments off to one of the features and you just, and sometimes  people post a comment before you can turn them off because you're, you're  typing as fast as you can and then you just delete them and, and, and people  seem to understand and, uh, you, you get, you get a lot of shares for these polls,  which, uh, amplifies the response.  So it works and it's, uh, it's a lot of fun and, um, it's still a pretty new  practice, uh, so people, people really like it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Mike Elgin, the world's only lovable technology writer, computer  world, and of course Google plus.  Like he makes his news newsletter out of it.  Elgin.com.  Just go there.  You'll find him.  Thank you, Mike, for being here.  Always a great pleasure to have you.  Pleasure was all mine.  Yeah.  This is such a good show.  We didn't even get to the new Twitter.  We had so much to talk about.  We'll get, we'll get, we'll just come back and do it again next week.  Actually, I won't be here next week.  Tom will be back, which means TNT will start on time for a change.  But, uh, I think we should do twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Really fast.  Awesome.  Really, really fast.  I swear we won't hold up TNT anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we have to show this loser video.  What was I going to say?  I was going to say, uh, 28th.  Are we going to do a show?  28th.  We are going to do a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you guys are up for it, Gina can't be flying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We love you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yes, we do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll be on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very nervous about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be on the plane.  Very nervous about what's happening on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We love you, Gina.  We do.  Kotkey.org.  Lizard plays ant crushing game.  Do I need audio for this?  Cause I'm all have it.  No, you don't need audio.  On an Android tablet.  See lizards, even lizards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm the Geico gecko.  Oh, I hate ants.  I'm going to squish these ants right now.  Oh, oh.  Dead ants.  Dead ants.  Yeah, good.  Oh, I love them.  More ants.  They keep coming out the screen, but they don't taste like anything.  This is so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  We do this show every Wednesday, by the way, at 1 p.m.  Pacific, 4 p.m.  Eastern 2100 UTC at twit.tv.  If you missed the show, you can catch the video after the fact.  Oh, now he's going to have lizard juice all over his screen.  You know, it's great.  He's not fooled by the non ant stuff.  Well, there he was.  Game over, man.  Game over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See you next time on This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see the guy spraying him.  Oh, pepper spray.  So, yeah, I mean, I think Tom is really being  well, not just Tom, all of us.  Yeah.  And we've appealed twice now.  How many times have we appealed, Tom?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's the robotic takedown we appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We appeal the robotic takedown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The actual DMCA takedown kicks in when Universal resubmits.  Right.  And so we have actually appealed that.  Universal has 10 days to respond to that with a court order.  Or our show goes back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's good news.  So I'm sure you didn't hear that, but I will re-explain.  And we do this.  It happens frequently in our news shows because we put clips in there.  In this case, the clip Tom uses, the famous mega upload video on YouTube  that had everything in there was approved by the owners of the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, mega upload says they filed a waiver from Will.i.am today in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So every personality in there has said, yes, you may use my stuff.  The Universal music group still pulled it down and Google exceeded to that.  Now, maybe the dispute is these are artists that do not have the right to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there could be all kinds of reasons Universal gets to say that mega upload  can't use that footage and that can be determined in court.  But they shouldn't be able to pull down a daily news show  because they are commenting and critiquing.  Yes. So there's two sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's two parts in our favor.  One is that mega upload says we own the content.  So who is UMG to talk about somebody else's content, pull it down  and why YouTube lets them is beyond me.  But then there's an exemption for us.  We're news shows and we're showing these clips in that context.  We're not using them to dress up the show.  We're talking about the news and that's fair use.  Now, the problem with fair use is it's not a proactive defense.  It's a defense. Yeah, it's a defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a YouTube's following the DMCA.  They're doing what they're supposed to do.  Yeah, they're saying this is what we have to do to maintain our ability to stay online.  Well, I certainly don't want you to disappear.  But what it means is censor anybody anytime they want by claiming  there's a copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then it's automatically taken down.  We appeal that YouTube then goes back to UMG. Right.  And then there's an official DMC take down, which they probably have  like a stack of them by the door and they just go here.  And then and then so then we appealed again.  And now there's a 10 day period in which the UMG would now have to go to a judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they'd have to get an injunction saying against us.  Twitter is, you know, is is breaking the law and they they have to pull this down.  Otherwise, YouTube puts it back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So then if that happens, then we will go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, it just stays down at that point.  We wouldn't necessarily have to do anything.  Well, no, I fight it. I would like to fight it.  Yeah. Then we would have to go to court and say, no, this is this is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, so we so we will pursue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have my commitment.  My guess. Well, thank you.  My guess is Universal won't right.  File the injunction because they don't care.  Ten days later, it's all over.  It's not worth their time. Exactly.  And that's the problem with the law is it gets to take a daily news show  down for 10 days with no actual evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that happens to us on Twitter, almost every other show.  And if a show of Twitter, for instance, is down 10 days, we've lost most of the revenue.  Same thing for TNT.  You're a daily show, but a weekly show.  That's really that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is effective.  Adipai in the chat just put up a link for a piece that Corey  Doctorow wrote in The Guardian. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Saying the content system sucks.  Yeah. Which it does.  But, you know, I guess it's.  I don't know, is it is it incumbent on Google to come up with something better?  What's it come in on Congress?  Congress needs to go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube's basically just they're doing it.  It's called SOPA. It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much better. That's right.  It's being voted on today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, you know who will be exempt.  Dot com dot net dot org, but not dot TV.  So we're still screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, don't we follow  under the rules of to follow in that case? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To follow decides what's legal here, baby.  We should just move the damn show to follow. I'm with you.  Who's who's up for going to the the Pacific Islands?  It's warm there, right?  It's sinking. Those are my people.  It's sinking.  Just why we don't win island.  So we'd have to kind of put I don't know what, but it's sinking.  You know, it's going to be gone in a few years.  We can sell more bricks.  Sell more bricks.
