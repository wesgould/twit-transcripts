Transcript:  This is twig this week in Google episode 513 recorded Wednesday, June 19th  2019 a secret route in Jersey this week in Google is brought to you by  worldwide technology  Worldwide technologies advanced technology center is like no other testing and research lab with more than half  a billion dollars of equipment  Including OEMs like netapp and it's virtual so you can access it  24-7 to learn more and get insights into all that it offers go to  WWT comm slash twit  It's time for twig this week in Google the show we cover are all the  goings on in the Google verse not just Google but Facebook Twitter  Journalism at large and that part of the reason is of course this guy right here who is our  Esteemed professor that the journalism or the large is the large journalist at the City University of New York the  Craig Newmark School of Graduate School of Journalism  He's the tau Knight Leonard somebody professor of I don't know I don't have my  My page in front of me anyway. It's Jeff Jarvis. We all know that be longer the title the less power you have yes  Well, that's good TV blogger former TV guide critic. Oh, I was a critic. I was a critic  I'm sorry have bloggers when he was young yeah, that's what I thought okay. That's my big in bottom our iot guru in  Her new abode on the West Coast here with us. Hello, Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, you guys you happy in Seattle. I'm so happy. I've been singing all day. It's been nuts. Oh, that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the weather is gonna be good for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do too. I am more climate change was gonna be bad for the earth, but good for Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean climate change hitting Austin was gonna be way more impactful  Yeah, well maybe not more impactful, but in a more personal negative way anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is early to talk about this because it was only announced yesterday  But it is to me maybe the most interesting and could be most important story of the year

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait wait, can we guess yeah one two three Libra Libra

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, Facebook's cryptocurrency and  Already  France has said hold on there big boy  You're not so fast mark Zuckerberg  Has has the chair of the house financial services committee  This is going to be a very Maxine Waters this is going to be a very  Interesting story. It's not gonna happen till next year and  It takes some understanding  You know and a little bit of research to really get what's going on  I'm gonna refer because I think they are the smartest guys out there to the Wired article  By a Stephen Levy and Gregory Barber the ambitious plans behind Facebook's cryptocurrency  Libra  The  Deal is complicated. First of all, maybe it's not even quite appropriate to call it Facebook's  Because as Facebook will point out  Libra is a nonprofit out of Switzerland  Global coin the Libra Association there the Switzerland of digital coinage  the  Technologies open so sourced the control of the blockchain will be out of Switzerland  The Libra Association will consist of up to 100 founding members of which Facebook is just one  each of them will put in ten million dollars to fund the association and  receive interest earned off the reserve  It's an NGO in other words  Actually, no, I'm sorry some skepticism about this part but keep going will be NGO members Libra is not an NGO  But it is a nonprofit each member will be empowered. I guess it is ultimately a non-governmental organization though  yeah, in the most truest sense of the word because and this is what scares banks and  Scares governments it will be a global currency  Not peg to the US dollar but tied to the dollar the yen the euro

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I throw out a challenge just just now for just a second just just for as the discussion continues is  To think about this as a Facebook word not mentioned at all  Right to take that angle out of it and say  Does this make sense? Is this a good thing for people is this a bad thing for people then we can add Facebook back in  And there's perfectly legitimate things to talk about there is whether or not there a proper  A proper you're right because Facebook kind of tilts it if you say google you do that. I want to think about the the  theory of this too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. Okay. So we totally can't but before you do that  I want to bring up the fact that I have in covering technology. I'm sure you guys have seen this too. There are tons of  independent standard settings boards or organizations that have been created but are yet dominated by one member  And I think it's important when we're talking about this to understand how much Facebook has  Here it does say that it eventually will step back  But we have no guarantees there. There's a lot of decision making that happens in these organizations  And it's entirely possible  for  An organization with a hundred different groups involved to still be dominated by one or two major players. That's all I want to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fred Wilson, they're right. It'd be great investor Fred Wilson  Says think of Facebook as the satoshi  Of bitcoin the creator of bitcoin and libra coin like bitcoin  in other words satoshi  Released it into the world facebook came up with the technology and is open sourcing it  I think it's also important to say that  Facebook understands the value of of this not being  Facebook some of the articles out there have described this as zuck bucks. That's the frame phrase I like and face coin  If that if it's that it's dead in the water says  Marcus i'm, not sure who marcus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that is david is it david marcus? Oh, he's the facebook executive who came up with this. Yes. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was he was president of paypal. Yes  So here's how the levy article begins near the end of 2017 on a dominican republic beach with his family facebook executive david marcus  wrestled with the question he'd been pondering since his previous job as president of paypal  How would you build the internet of money?  a friction-free global digital currency  Would be a boon for many people with mobile phones, but no access to banking  which also coincides with facebook's commercial interests because that's the  The other billion or the next billion facebook people right and who better to develop something?  Like this marcus wondered than facebook with its global reach and massive user base  He was at the time head of facebook messenger  And he texted zuckerberg saying it's time to talk about creating a cryptocurrency  He wrote a memo that laid out his ideas and zuck quickly endorsed the plan saying the approach synced with his ideas  They were thinking about this for a long time and with messenger apple has kind of an in in iMessages payment using  well, it's wallet shows the um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The path right the chinese model that you can do everything  Are you thinking we chat not while we chat? Sorry we chat. Thank you. Thank you. We chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is more than that this I think it would be a currency that messenger would run on facebook messenger would run on  But listen to the main so to your point jeff. What if we leave out facebook, but we mentioned the other partners visa  mastercard paypal  Coinbase stripe  Uh vcs like andres and horowitz and thrive  kiva, which is that micro lending  Nonprofit the NGO even though this will not be a lending platform. Let's be quick to add  Yes, but they're but they but maybe the lending would occur in global coin is the idea women's world banking  votaphone  ebay  lift uber  Spotify these are all partners  In this no banks, of course because if you're going to pick one victim of this it would be banks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other one is not in there is and it's not a victim  It's it's somebody who victimizes customers around the world the world is western union  Oh, yeah, this would totally replace that this this is this is that's that's one key to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I noticed I noticed m. Pesa isn't in there either, which is the african  payment platform  That is  Basically widely used in lieu of banks, but stripe is in there  Um  Payu is in there paypal is in there. So they're it's an interesting group mercy core  Ribbit capital union square ventures. It's a really interesting group

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the things you were trying to get yeah, so there's a couple things about this that we should look at  one is  There's a lot of value in understanding what people are buying what people are spending money on  And how  Money flows around the world and seeing that in almost real time  It looks like and again, I don't know the math behind this but unlike something like hyperledger  It looks like the blockchain process behind this the math behind this will make that sort of information public  So a company like stripe spotify even visa and mastercard who actually already have access to this data  It behooves them to have something like this where they can see what people are buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To facebook says that none of the information would go back to facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, i'm not i'm not just worried about facebook. I'm i'm curious what it means to make transactions public  so i've talked to people in like the fbi and about  digital currencies and they love this because  You can find out who owns what and see what's happening. So there's a lot of information and data being  Available like if we're all excited about search data because that shows intent. This is like the next best thing  No, it's the  More best thing gosh. I don't know what i'm saying there. So stacy stacy. Can you can you stay there for one second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just so I understand what you're saying  So because it's because it's on a blockchain  all the transactions are  visible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see all the transactions now there are ways to make a blockchain  Private I don't know if that's been done in this case  So what i'm pointing out are things that I would be asking and looking for so it's  It's a ledger. So it's necessary

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That there'll be some identifying well not public but there'll be identifying information with each transaction  But it doesn't have to be connected to your public identity. It just lies with bitcoin

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can be an identity that you use. Yeah, it can be a number you can find out who people are behind bitcoins

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's one of the yeah  It's one of the things that surprised some people who thought that silk road and other places would be anonymous is that  You can't I mean, I guess you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so going back another thing to look at is the fees generated like how are the participants going to earn money here?  And the reason I think about that is we're taking banks out of the equation in this particular example  But someone like visa or mastercard is still going to want to have a processing fee, right?  So how do you build this in and I think  What we're looking at here and it's  We talk a lot about digital currencies and I think one of the important things here is that it's going to be  Decentralized which is awesome and scary  And two you can do microtransactions, which we've been like, oh my gosh, we can't do  We've been waiting for this. Finally the messiah has arrived  So yes now right now we can't because they talked about this and I believe it was a wall street journal article had some good  Q and a's. I think it was only this particular  This could only do 1 000 transactions per second versus visas 24 000 transactions per second  So obviously this is not up to scale yet, right?  But if you got to that scale then you could look at something like  Or even greater than that you could look at something like microtransactions being more feasible  So I think there's a there's a lot of things we don't know here  And I think yes, it's probably safe to say that this is going to happen something and it's disruptive and blah blah blah all the words  But it's way too early and we don't know enough  Yet to say how it's going to be disruptive. So i'm just thinking of the questions  I asked to figure out who's going to get so let me can I ask you a question stacy? So um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh fees as I said, I I you know, i've i've talked to people in and especially in african countries plus also latin america  Where the diaspora sends money back home, right and the fees and the conversion and the currency conversion both there's there's all kinds of  Union problem western union and others. Yeah, um is is fairly awful  um, so  What would hope and presume that this?  Does to that what what craigslist and others did to to the um,  Horrible pricing of classified ads, but so there are fees in in a simple bitcoin  Um transaction now, what do the fees look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, what's the base you could set it to what you want?  Right, and the higher you set it the faster the transaction will occur  Because the transaction is done by the miners so if there's more money in it for them more coin in it for them  They'll do it faster. You'll prior get prioritized. You can set it as little as I can't remember what it was but 0.00001  Bitcoin is a small fraction of a bitcoin  Uh, that's presumably how this would work as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, well are there miners here? Well, this is backed that's who those 10 million dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Participants are they become I think they become the nodes  On the blockchain I haven't read the white paper yet. I think that's the that's the idea  So it's you know, I have you know, this was announced yesterday there is a long there is a white paper  Which I will read and i'm sure a lot of people who understand, uh, cryptocurrency better than I will  I think it I think what's it so that and by the way  France  Us and india has already introduced a bill that would ban it in india  Remember, this is somewhat similar to facebook's internet.org plans to bring the next billion people onto the internet through a specialized india went after and india said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, they felt it was kind of launched this in india anyway, according to let's see. It was a tech crunch article  So, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it's up to facebook where it gets launched

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, well let's put it this way supporting it on their platform for those users users in specific countries got it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean because that's what facebook if facebook is truly independent from this  That's what it offers is the fact that a lot of people are already there and facebook will make it easy to convert is my assumption  Facebook already has like my credit card information. So  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook's contribution to this at this point it seems to be kind of inspiring and providing the code  Um, but as uh, kevin weill who was an engineer at instagram. He was a product chief there  Who left to work on the project said in the wired article facebook will have but one seat  On the council that oversees the foundations and will have no more rights. No more governance  That isn't exactly the same as everybody else has

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So  Like I like stephen levy. He's a smart man  But he also writes with access and he never jeopardizes his access. So I always he is the friendliest  Of he is smart and he understands what's happening, but he is very friendly. Okay, so  I I would there's other articles. I'm gonna read the white paper. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the white paper, of course is the most interesting thing and and also also this isn't happening till next year  I mean the reason i'm interested in it is partly because it looks like a grab by facebook  For extra governmental power  You know, it's almost as if facebook as if mark zuckerberg said well, obviously I can't run for president  What else could I do? Oh, I could be emperor of the world  Uh and and said well, what about what about a global? I mean really isn't that interesting for facebook a global currency?  But it doesn't look it's smart that facebook  Is saying but we are going to be one among equals we are not going to be the running this show  It is interesting for everyone. I mean I you know  Except the banks, but let's get rid of the banks. I don't have a problem with that if we come  Exactly, I mean to be able to do transactions easily would be a wonderful thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold up. Okay. So there's a couple things one  This is backed by actual assets, right? That's  Not exactly unusual but the the  The direct link to the assets is probably worth noting. I think I think they're really trying to solve the problems that they saw with bitcoin  right and  With actual assets backing them up  This is predominant. I mean, this is a threat not just to banks but also to the banking regulatory infrastructure and the protection set in place  and and state banks  Yeah, well anything so like if you're the sec and if I put my money in a bank for example  And you know it is backed by up to a certain amount  It is backed by the u.s government right or fdic insurance in a bank  If I buy bonds, that's backed by the u.s government. So if i'm  Putting my money into libra  That's backed by the libra association with bank with some bank deposits in it says short-term government securities  with that  We introduce a new buyer like on the the short-term currency or short-term bond markets  for you know, these assets we  Kill that. This is not a regulated entity at the moment. So there's a lot of potential for  All kinds of things not just money laundering but but yeah malfeasance or just  Just a lack of understanding which we see a lot in the tech community which is like oh we could totally do this better  And then they're like la la here. We are with our you know trading  basically our trading  Uh pool of money and let's see what we can do with it and you know, we've seen banks  Go astray with this but that's why the sec has you know  Changed rules about how much money you have to have in reserve if you're going to do certain kinds of securities. So  We'll see  this  I think those are  More so and and I am curious about trust and stuff like that  but those are the kind of things where I think the  The real story is going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So lately let's talk about your point about the extra governmental piece here because I I think that in the long whether or not  This is the path that works or not. I mean before this we have blocked  bitcoin  Which is certainly extra governmental  We have wars fought over data fought fought with cyber hacks now that is extra governmental  We have wars in essence fought with  disinformation which is  Can is sometimes extra governmental sometimes not  The challenge to government and all this also fascinates me. That's a huge just conceptually why you know  So what services what services do governments provide? Well, they provided more security for currency, which which bitcoin didn't have was volatile  So along comes this consortium saying okay  We'll fix that and we don't need you government  Uh now government's going to try to intervene but at some point government's going to lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not necessarily. I mean they these guys may  They may blow through all their cash and not be able to pay back people on their yep  Or they may not be able to back their security basically  I mean in some ways you're like you have a lot of faith  Would I buy venezuelan are they pesos? I don't know I would not right now because that is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I couldn't agree more. I'm not saying that this is going to win  I'm just saying that the challenges to government are going to keep coming and coming and coming and coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's two there's two parts of it. One is the crypto part  But the other part is just a non-governmental currency alipay in china is a non-governmental currency  That's digital payments across social platforms  is in fact  Because it's chinese  Believed to be a part of government surveillance there  In fact, it seems some say it's actually a critical part of their whole social credit system is alipay  So there's always that potential crypto or not  So, I mean there's so many interesting facts the reason I think it's the story of the year is so many interesting facets to it  And to watch governments which have pretty much ignored cryptocurrencies up to now  Immediately step forward say oh hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the sec has been regulating token sales for a while now, but they're allowing it. They're not I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What governments are saying now is no you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  I think they're saying let's look into this. Yes. Yes, there are bills being proposed  But I think that's a typical knee-jerk thing  I think what's going to happen is they'll use these as an excuse to understand and dig into this more and maybe they will and  You know that is they're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and also let's not forget banks spend a lot of money on  congress and they  They may act to defend the interests of the banks the banking industry is so powerful in this country  Look what happened in 2008. Remember all those bank presidents who went to jail. Oh, no, nobody did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay the banking industry, but it's so intrinsic to our economy that they kind of had to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's an interesting question. I mean, that's what these blockchain guys are talking about as well. Is it  Intrinsic or is it just a 19th century way of keeping track of who has what money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a really important thing to keep track of in a capital  Yeah, but what if we had a better way better decentralized way  Well in in we might this might provide it I would say  We're gonna have to wait, I'm sorry, so we're gonna go out on a limb here, but you know, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Understanding I should have prefaced this with this was announced yesterday and we're all just scrambling to understand  Oh, yeah figure out what it means. I just think it's fascinating. It is  Fascinating it is  And yeah, and you're and I think you asked a really important question jeff when you said well  What if you d took the word facebook out of it? Then what would you say?  The problem is without facebook backing it. It's not nearly as interesting. It doesn't have nearly the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, well, hold on a second there. I mean, let's say two things one  The internet has cooties right now with government and media and facebook has nuclear powered super cooties  So, um, you know, that's the the timing is not great to do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Innovative and this is another conversation which i'll start after this  About what is facebook up to but go ahead, right? Right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so so so but so it's really almost impossible to take those two factors out  Yes, but i'm just fascinated by the infrastructural question here about currency and what works and what's a better service for people?  We've already talked about the international piece of this if you could  Take out all the middlemen to enable  Uh, what do they call it when they when you send money back home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a word for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Money orders, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you remittances, uh to make that smooth and and take out currency transfers and um  Uh other middlemen fees that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To make people who don't have a bank account part of the economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so this is all good except  except  We still like  Yes, the banks do not serve everyone. Yes, there are crazy fees, especially internationally from rich companies going to poor companies  But I will also say that in many cases like the us and other like sweden places like that  the  Banks are trusted entities and they're backed by the government. That's one reason why in the 2008  We didn't let them go under as as the u.s  When you give that power to something else, which is fine  You may be dooming people who haven't had access to a bank account to using something like this without any regulatory oversight

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yes, all true now. Now let's go to another level where  um  What kind of you know, just within the u.s. Let's say  What kind of uh of commerce does this enable? What kind of commerce does?  Does wechat enable in um  In china that we don't have here. What kind of new businesses can be started?  What does that look like if you have this kind of fluid currency?  And easy transfer. I don't know the answer that question  But to me, those are the things that are interesting to me before we get to the political issues of internet today and facebook  And now leo  What's facebook up to? Well, it's I think I think that's it's timing is messenger is interesting  I think it's it's it's their messaging services trying to be chinese messaging services. That's my first thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we know they want that and that actually is not in incompatible with zuckerberg's  Stated plan to put an end to end encryption and privacy and all of that stuff  in fact  In this day and age making it that way would make it more palatable to people right i'd be more likely  As soon as you turn on venmo  I was talking to somebody about venmo the other day, which is by the way widely used henry uses my son uses it  But as soon as you turn it on it starts broadcasting your payments publicly to everybody  and  You don't turn henry. You haven't turned that off. You know about it, right?  You know that every transaction you do on venmo is public, right? But you never turn it off  Yeah, I do because I don't want people to know what i'm buying. Why do you leave it on paranoid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a social aspect to it interesting to see what people are doing. Yeah, and people have fun with it  What is that social aspect? What is the benefit? It's fun because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Comment on transactions. Yeah, you put in fake comments. Yeah, you you make  Jokes you put in a comedy opportunity. It's a comedy opportunity is a lot of emojis in there  Some of it's genuine though, you know, thanks for last night. Well, nobody labels their transactions actually what they are  Nobody says for pot boos and women  Right except my son but that makes me think that you're not doing that. Uh-huh. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to embarrass your son

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Said that no, he never said that  But but I but I you know  I of course and I tell everybody when I tell them about venmo and don't forget to turn on the privacy switch because it's off by default  But I know henry knows that he leaves it on uh, he leaves public leaves his transactions public  So I think that's kind of fun. There's something there's a social aspect to it. Well, there's also uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a couple probably about a year or two ago  The venbo transactions were being scanned by and I can't think of the name of the committee  But the terror the anti-terrorist group or anti-terrorist banking committee because people were like for anthrax or whatever  They were like nip and people were getting their accounts for anthrax

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Please i'm gonna use venmo to buy anthrax  come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But these were these were jokey comments this was by this one was this yeah, this was accidental right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no, this was somebody somebody went through and and uh  scraped venmo to because you can just because you can to show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That just to show that hey, this was a computer science student who wanted to demonstrate to his peers  dan salmon  Uh that you know, you should really think about what you're doing here. This has been going on forever  This is not  You know, everybody. I mean truthfully everybody knows that it's public

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, no, I mean people are still flummoxed by this stuff  I always think everybody knows that this is public everybody knows how this works. No one knows how these things work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it goes back to the the facebook discussion of you don't have a you don't have a presumption of privacy on facebook  Yeah, because you just shared things and everybody's having to fit about it  But they're finally saying the true fact which is once you've shared things you can't presume that it's private

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, I gotta tell you the best story because if you haven't read this jeff  Okay, this is gonna get into  No, no  Okay  Pinboard I I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um and meche. I love meche chaglowski

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So did you read his story on oh my gosh ambient privacy because we should talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that is in the list. I I was really impressed by that and we came segue into this  He is becoming by the way  A great thinker. I am  Really enjoying his blog  Uh, in fact, i've been meaning to talk to him because I think he would be a great podcast host on our network  But in any event, this was a really interesting story  About why privacy is important. I thought  Go ahead and he put it up he put into words what I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I and many people like me have been saying for like a decade  Which is when you have computers and their awesome computing power and ability to retain information in ways that humans cannot  They can hold and store information even tiny little bits  They can analyze it and put it together in ways that normal people cannot  And they will keep that information and build upon it for the next forever and it is searchable forever  And he calls this ambient privacy, which is the idea that one by one  Pieces of information don't matter but most people are not aware of how that information gets aggregated  Stored and then referred back to over time and that is where we're getting into  That's where we're losing our privacy  So jeff you and I argue a lot I think because you're talking about privacy in the moment  And i'm talking about this concept of ambient privacy. So I was so excited to read this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where is it in run down? I keep a new wilderness. There it is. It's under idle words. I got it before I just couldn't find it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so he says this is my i'll read a couple paragraphs just because it's he's a great writer  Seen in this light the giant tech companies can make a credible claim to be the defenders of privacy  Just like a dragon can truthfully boast. It's good at protecting its hoard of gold  Nobody spends more money than securing user data or does it more effectively than facebook and google?  And this has always been the kind of disconnect we say facebook isn't giving away your privacy. They're keeping it to themselves. It's too valuable  He says the question we need to ask is not whether our data is safe  But why all of a sudden is there so much of it that needs protection?  The problem with the dragon after all is not its stockpile stewardship  But it's appetite  And that's when he brings up the phrase ambient privacy understanding there's value in having our  just it's  Our most trivial everyday transactions the smallest details of our lives up until very recently  Would pass unremembered but all of a sudden everything's being recorded  And he says not every conversation needs to be a deposition  I love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really good post. So two things one i'm looking for a book i'm reading  Before we got on the air  Call this air. Um  I mentioned to leo that a a friend of ours in the technology world. Uh, i'm not gonna say who it is  Um, because I don't want to violate the person's privacy  Uh, it was a private communication but uh said that this person had  Afib and was wondering whether to go through an operation and i'm not a doctor don't play one on tv  But I I share the reason this person could come to me and we could share information and I recommended the cardia  And I told him my experiences because I have been public years ago  Right 2001 is when I got afib and I wrote about it  um  And and I haven't written about it hardly any sense. So is that ambient? Yeah, it's it's back there. It's out there  It's searchable and good comes of it. It's not the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's not sharing i would argue that's sharing which is very different  Well, but sharing can take many many more what what's seven eleven you walk into and when is not  that kind of sharing ambient privacy would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You walking into your clinic it being logged on your four square account and maybe a surveillance camera nearby  In a computer somewhere putting that together and saying oh jeff has afib and then decisions being made for that for the rest of your life  based on that inference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is what I hope my argument to this is always is always  Uh, I dana boy taught me this  You control the use of the knowledge  You don't try to control the knowledge in in a free and modern society one based on  Of freedom of information and thought and expression trying to control knowledge is a dangerous concept  And one you can't really win at because the knowledge is out there, you know, I I bought cardia somewhere  There's a transaction that knows that my bank knows that my isp knows that tons of people know I bought cardia  So they can tell if they want to who has afib because who else would buy cardia?  Which by the way is a very good product  I recommend it to anybody out there if you want to have a quick and easy 99 ekg that's approved by doctors  Um, so right so so  The issue there is not that that transaction exists somewhere in data. The issue is what is done with it the the the the  regulation as I wrote in a post  Last week about about regulation is this not about regulating the internet or regulating the technology  It's about regulating human behavior whether that human behavior is a big company or an individual person  That's what we've always regulated the law and we still need to regulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the challenge I think that we've had in having these regulatory or in talking about this regulation regulations is  we haven't  Been addressing this type of privacy. We have been addressing individual one-off uses of hey  Don't share naked pictures or hey, we've decided that children are protected class and their data should not be  floating around the internet, so I  think  By putting words to this and by by introducing the concept in a very  A very good way. I I think he's helping drive a conversation that we haven't really had the words to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he and he also points to a significant consequence  To the loss of it now. Let me read another paragraph. My own suspicion is that ambient ambient privacy this kind of trivial privacy  Plays an important role in civic life when all discussion takes place under the eye of software  In a for-profit medium working to shape the participants behavior. It may not be possible  To create the consensus and shared sense of reality that is a prerequisite for self-government if that's true  Then the move away from ambient privacy will be an irreversible change because it will remove our ability to function as a democracy  This is this is a symptom  That i've been noticing that everybody's been noticing and I'm concerned about it. I don't know if I accept his causal link to it  And to the loss of ambient privacy  But I feel like Joan Donovan has talked about this as well. Yeah, I think she probably thinks about it a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just want to be careful that there is and we've had this discussion a million times. I don't know how  Uh productive it is to have it again, but but I will I will you've heard me say this before so there's  I only have so much to say but there is  ambient data about things like health  That could be useful and to cut it off we don't know what we're cutting off  Um, and so on the presumption that something could happen I get worried about trying to erase all possible outcomes  Because you also erase good possible outcomes as opposed to saying  What could bad uses of this be what do we then regulate and forbid which i'm fine with I I don't think it's the gathering of knowledge  Is not necessarily a bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to look at does the good outweigh the bad not that are there two sides to this you  Well, you can't know we can make educated guesses and we can say hey going forward this way  Like I can tell you that I don't know exactly what would happen if I built my house on the edge of a cliff at you know  Certain engineered parameters  But especially with climate change, but I can say hey, it's it's probably not good  So it would be awesome to have those cliffside seaside views  But the risks are a little high there and I think it's fair to say in some cases  That yeah, it would be awesome if we saved 10 people from dying  But if it's a consequence of a hundred million people losing their health insurance, I would say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so let's let's go. Let's go. Okay now now i'll cue you  In the rundown I put up a provocative headline under other  Cue the moral panic or treat the ailments  Language on facebook posts is more predictive of some diseases than demographics  A a university study from university of pensifinia school of medicine  found that language  around  Um some obvious things mentioning bottles a lot and glasses and things like that probably issues of alcoholism  but mentioning, um  Uh, i'm, you know, I kind of find it i'm looking at myself on the screen. It's farther down. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You brought this we don't have to go into depth lines because you brought this up before  I didn't bring this one up before. Yeah, but it's a brand new study. I will I think we all stipulate  That there are benefits to this mass collection of data  But there but I mean nobody's saying that there isn't value to the mass collection of data. Yeah, sure  You can diagnose diabetics and I didn't hear you both say it now. Well, I think we both stipulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, there there are goods coming from this, but I don't know if they always outweigh the harms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and I can't necessarily know the harms or the good for quite a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we're in the smack dab in the middle of the harms right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're also in the middle of the goods and and the problem is the media panic going on right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't give any attention to that. Well, I think it needs to be done now because it's going to be too late pretty soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, but then we then machete like it's an environmental

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Regulation I think that's a really interesting and uh telling I mean there's a point beyond which  It's too it's too late  He says I believe mr  Pichai and mr zuckerberg are sincere in their personal commitment to privacy just as i'm sure the ceos of exxon mobile and shell  Don't want their children to live in a world of runaway global warming  But their core business activities are not compatible with their professed values

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is this is that's to my my mind that goes too far the core business values here also enable  I'm gonna say it again. I've said it a million times living while black me too  Yeah, black lives matter. We all know that we all stipulate in big white owned media that now have voices out there that now can speak  That's part of their core value too. That's connecting the world. Yes, you have miyamara, which is a horrendous thing  But you also have living well black questions. Thank you. And how can you now think that you have the hubris to balance all of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the questions machete says we should be asking our discourse around privacy needs to expand  To address foundational questions about the role of automation to what extent is living in a surveillance saturated world compatible with pluralism and democracy  What are the consequences of raising a generation of children whose every action feeds into a corporate database?  What does it mean to be and this is the key one to be manipulated from an early age by machine learning algorithms that  Adaptively learn to shape our behavior. I don't think that's  Worth the benefits that you that we will all stipulate. I just don't think it's worth it. So in june 27 1900

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mark twain  uh wrote a letter  I won't read the whole thing because it's really good  But he says all the world acknowledges the invention of gutenberg is the greatest event that secular history has recorded  Gutenberg's achievement created a new and wonderful earth at the same time also a new hell  During the past 500 years gutenberg's invention has supplied both earth and hell with new occurrences new wonders and new phases  skipping to the end  What the world is today good and bad it owes to gutenberg everything can be traced to the source  But we are bound to bring him hondage for homage for what he said in dreams  To the angered angel has been literally fulfilled for the bad that is his colossal invention has brought about  Is overshadowed a thousand times by the good with which mankind has been favored. It took 450 years to come to that judgment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so we're talking about global surveillance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not books. You're also talking about global sharing. You're also talking about global connection  You're also talking about global empowerment of people who have never been empowered  You're talking about a lot of good things if you put it all in one frame

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I think we can actually separate the actions of surveillance from a lot of the things that you're seeing as positive  I think proactively sharing  Yeah, it's very different than passive collection of information carston go ahead mr harvard here do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh the the past two  hundred years of democracy  are worth the  Tremendous loss of life that occurred in the 200 years before that because of uh the protestant revolution  reformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I was in germany when I was in italy at the at the journal of the festival, that's the that's that's the trade-off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the trade or you could say or you could say the press that's the trade-off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or could you say the rising standard of living in this country and around the world?  Is worth destroying the planet that we live on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would be another it's similar trade-off. There is no simple one-to-one trade-off my friends  Well, i'm just saying life is not that simple  I think you can say oh if we just shut off that then everything will be okay again  And that's what I hear too often if we just shut off facebook everything will be okay again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not talking about shutting this off jeff we're talking about recognizing what this is  What the natural repercussions of bringing all this technology into our lives?  Will will mean for us and then let's hear more about the good stacy. Let's regulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to hear the regulators? I don't the regulators. Let's let's look what they've done already done to damage the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's okay. I think you're being an apologist jeff at this point. That's that's completely  No, i'm a defender of the internet. I'm a defender of the internet and the freedoms it brings no you're at this point  You're not jeff. You're being a defender of surveillance capitalism saying well, yeah, but we got a lot of good things out of it  So pay no attention to the consequences you pays me  Yep, but you're saying I know it's do you want to pay no attention to the consequences you say?  Wait, the consequences this is what happens pollution just happens formulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertising is generally being called surveillance cap capitalism. So leo you're in the business of surveillance capitalism  You're selling a certain audience to certain people  you're the two

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My timing I would disagree with you on that actually because we don't what we do is we create content that attracts a certain kind of person  We don't know for a fact that you're turning leo's business model into a straw man here. Don't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well fun, but i'm the media so it's timing  I've said this many times before I can go to axiom far before the internet and give more data than I than could an internet  company  I also understand the internet  I am i'm worried about section 230 that the right section 230 is in danger right now. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are bad laws, but you can't that's not the reason to not think about any regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying i've written long posts which i've read on this show where I there are regulatory regimes that I endorse  The internet court I endorse the french structure. I endorse I endorse regulatory regimes, but I don't endorse  Uh this this idea that that labeling the entire internet surveillance  Is going to be is going to be beneficial because it leads us to bad law  Like we have and like law that was proposed today about section 230 you want to hear about that law from our dear government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I want to move on from this topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's let's that's one way to move on let's get me on this i'm going to get on this one no matter what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is really dangerous to the internet. This is a proposed law not an actual law, right? But yes  What is who is doing this and what is the proposal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's that that that they would give section 230 protection only to companies that show that they are not  engaged in  Political leaning in their moderation  This is an effort on the right to say facebook and google and twitter you must

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, this is josh holly's this is josh holly's new bill. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Act on 230 and it's one of many attacks that are going to come i'm not saying this law is going to pass as is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there are many attacks has proposed a bill called ending support for internet censorship act  Which would say that companies would be stripped of their safe harbor immunity their section 230 immunity if they exhibit political bias  Or moderate in a way that disadvantages certain political candidates or viewpoints  I guess you could say this is bringing back the equal time amendment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I would put it another way I think that it is a government it is it is so absurd to the first amendment  It's kind of ironic because i bet you anything josh holly was against equal time  It's kind of trying to break out that it's going to try to regulate the internet like broadcast, which I would find to be abhorrent  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So by the way ted cruz  Uh and nancy pelosi  um  have I think might be in bed with this because  uh  They've threatened companies like facebook and twitter with modifications to the law of 230 platforms don't behave in a more responsible and neutral way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very nervous about the talk about oh, let's just regulate the internet  We're going to lose freedoms  We're going to lose the potential this brings  So i'm sorry, but i'm not an apologist for any company what you do to those companies you do the internet and what i'm what i'm  Defending is the internet and the freedoms that it brings that I charge this though jeff. What about this thought that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These companies are not the internet these companies are google facebook  Whatever you want to pick and really their goal is not  To have a free and open internet their goal is to collect this information like the dragon and hoard it to themselves  They are not saying oh this is all great we're going to share this is not the internet this is some specific companies who are  Aggressively pursuing the aggregation of this information and protecting it keeping it to themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The worst companies I think we can all agree are the telecoms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would say the worst companies are the data brokers. However, I don't I don't care who's the worst company  I care as an individual that I am powerless to control the flow of my data and the protection of my data  And what people let's go to this concept of my data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most data is a transaction and there's an other side of that transaction and who's to say who has the premier rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if the information from that transaction you walking down a street of a city. Uh have two sides to it  Uh, yeah, yes as a journalist absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is public and if you restrict the idea of what is public you restrict my ability as a journalist to report on those  Things that are public. How about how about the information about where you slept last night?  Who's who's both sides in that transaction if I slept in a comfort in the comfort in has a right to know what that information is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And use that information. What if you slept at your girlfriend's house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but where is that information necessarily it's probably my phone company it's probably not at google or facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By a no, it could be public using face recognition on a camera that's running on a street  Outside girlfriend's house google knows it google knows it because it's on your phone. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, we go back to the street. Uh, again, what's public is public and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's public though jeff is now that's very easy and cheap to aggregate all of your information  So as a journalist, yes  I can see as a journalist people doing something and doing my job on a public street  So I can go out and talk to people and get news  But the government can also follow me while i'm getting that news see exactly who i'm meeting with which means clandestine source meetings become way more difficult  um, and they could also use that to track me or build a case against me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or you know, but you can also use this to uh, look at the case we had just this week of the horrendous police in phoenix  and um the the  surveillance cameras  Gave the case to show how they abused a pregnant woman zero point in us going back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me put word words in jeff's mouth really quick  Jeff wants to not regulate the collection of this he wants to regulate how it's used

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes companies. Yes. Yeah, that's what that's what i'm fine with that and i'm more than fine with that  But what I get nervous about this idea that data is a scare word and knowledge is a bad thing  That's a very dangerous thing to do in a supposedly enlightened country

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if we're in a supposedly enlightened country anymore. I think that might be part of the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then why you go over that line?  I understand what you're saying, but that's a dangerous don't you agree? That's a hard line, isn't it stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am I am very concerned about where we have I mean ever since the patriot act i've been thinking about  what we do as a country so  It is a hard line but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is something to think about especially as a journalist whom do you trust?  To manage that the patriot act didn't come from google or facebook it came from the government you want to regulate google and facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know but giving the government access to more and more data which they can get through  subpoenas and they can get through  You know the use of tools from some of these companies does become  You know a challenge and i'm not saying i'm not just against google and facebook. I'm against all  collection of this data in all  applications of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Surveillance technology basically again define define the words this data and surveillance technology, right?  A lot of this is useful and good and that is a very broad sweep that says gathering data and information is bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would say unlimited use of facial recognition data by municipalities and government entities is probably is a problem  I would say unregulated use of facial recognition in private places used to  create  red lines or  Limit access to certain populations would you require?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The faces be blurred that tapes be erased. Let's say is that a way to regulate that how does everybody feel about the recent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  laws passed in san francisco  Yeah, they banned face recognition in san francisco law enforcement's use of right of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's good. We've actually seen how long use of law enforcement is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  abusing what if they're using it to find someone who's  Left the old folks home who has alzheimer's or a missing child, you know what jeff this is or or in fact a terrorist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wait, wait, wait jeff. You're saying  You say you want  to focus on how it's being used. This is a very  Narrowly targeted law of about how this data is being used

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so so so carsten answer me this because I don't i haven't followed the law this carefully  Um, if it if if it's law enforcement can't use it. No, i'm against that if law enforcement can't use it in these cases  i'm all for it  Which how was the how was the statute written law enforcement cannot use it?  That's what i'm against because there are good use law enforcement is not wholly evil law  How do you feel about unreasonable search and seizure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean that is a law that is  That is a law that is designed for protection of our individual right, how do you feel about even though it might catch people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you feel about finding a kidnapped child?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I should not we should not break my my my  Sharp dividing line is if to find that missing child you have to break the the fourth amendment  Then no, I don't want to find that child exactly even if it's my child

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that's a it's a crappy thing and law enforcement deals with this all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also throw in one little extra thing, which is sometime in this coming week  Uh ice is going to fan out all over this nation  looking for  undocumented  Foreigners and is going to arrest them detain them and throw them into camps  And I bet you in many cases face recognition will be a big part of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Process what's evil and that is not the technology what's evil and that's what they're doing with it  Right, but what we're saying is should the police use this technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is evil in it though?  if it's if the face recognition produces a large number of false positives because  It isn't accurate in people of color then you regulate that you don't regulate the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The operatives regulate the use that's what san francisco has done. They've said they've said this technology is not  That's specifically what san francisco has done is that they have said this technology is not ready  This technology is right now  You should not use this technology for this reason and this reason this reason mostly because of the false positives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, can you imagine a different statute to be better written that says you cannot use it unless with approval of a court  That's why we have things like warrants. That's why you can do a wiretap, but you have to get a warrant  Maybe there are ways to regulate this without without going through the whole thing and saying all official

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but right now we can't use it because it's not accurate. So we're saying you can't use it  Like you could ask the court but a court would say I guess the court could say hey  If you're looking for a white guy, it's pretty good here  But anything else no, but they don't know who they're looking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To to fan out and search for all sorts of illegal immigrants. This is a completely legal  move by law enforcement  Um  and giving them more tools to do the wrong thing is  legal  But I would say immoral

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, but I also think that there are things that are right things to do and if we have that  I mean, I I don't have much faith in my government right now, but the san francisco police  Um, I think that there are there are far better ways to write this it was written in a moral panic way  Which said technology this technology is bad in all cases  There are ways to regulate it. That's  Yeah, that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What jeff's gonna talk about our stories yeah, we can we can we can change the subject but let's let's take a break jeff's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have new weens to peel garlic that twitter went crazy about jeff's jeff's gonna jeff's gonna win this argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in the long run because I fear that  uh  No regulation even if they attempt to  Enforce it is going to win in the long run and so we'll find out what the consequence is  I fear we're already fine. We already know what the consequences don't forget. Let me say again. I favor some regimes of regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've written about that stacy you can you knock your head in the mic, but I do  I just i'm gonna defend against broad swabs the gathering data

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Surveillance technology if you were in china right now and you knew the chinese were using face recognition  To isolate and arrest a muslim minority the weger wegers. I'm telling you very clearly what's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the chinese government right? That's what needs to change witness hong kong face recognition gay hong kong, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you can't change the chinese government if they've got a surveillance operation that can stop you before you even start  We're not going to talk about this anymore because this is we're going to agree to disagree on this because I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's clear we and by the way, the garlic peeling video was debunked today by many people even some famous chefs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man, I really wanted to try it  I'm just gonna put this up. Don't put it up. Take it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Carson is going on vacation and he's trying to speed this show along  But we're gonna we're gonna take a break and come back and we'll have a nice happy pleasant topic that we can all agree on  But that's not not that that's not why you look at the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys just I've been i've been hanging out with my worry bird the last like 30 minutes. I'm just like  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That video was bs because I have I have peeled a lot of garlic in my time and there's no way that works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Queue it up so we can watch it. It's really really crazy. Do you happen to have any garlic in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and I because the engine my husband doesn't eat garlic anymore. So I was like what's wrong with him

Transcript:  It's it's a sad thing. Geez, I hope to god I never get to that point in life where I can't eat garlic garlic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Garlic does to him what this conversation did to stay sad and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's a vampire. I'll just give andrew a worry bird and move on it's time to talk about  Our fine sponsor worldwide technology  And their atc their advanced technology center. They've been building this for over a decade now. It is so cool. It's grown  Well exponentially it's there's no other research testing lab like this in the world and you can use it  You can use it from wherever you are 24 7  Let me talk about this lab. It contains more than half a billion dollars in equipment  from hundreds of oems  people like cisco net app vmware  And then even small and new companies like tanium and equinix and x expanse that are  disrupting  wwt  helps companies like yours  Acquire technology install it configure it run it choose it and this lab is so awesome the atc  The advanced technology center is an incubator  For it innovation you get hundreds of on-demand  integrated solutions labs  Representing the newest advances in anything your enterprise might be interested in flash storage software defined networking network automation  endpoint security architecture  I mean as a perfect example here, you know, we're sitting here and we're trying to figure out what should we use  For our how should our security architecture be built?  We can go to the lab. We can configure it  We can try it we can and we can even do this remotely from here to see how things work. What works with what?  You can learn about products before you launch them  In fact, that's how wwt's own engineers do it  They use these environments to spin up proofs of concept and pilots in a sandbox  So the customers can see how they work.

Is this on twitter?  I missed this somehow  This is a video on twitter of a way to peel garlic  You take the knife you take the garlic. What is she using to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A knife

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's getting a knife in the bottom of the garlic and pulling it out from the papery leaves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you don't have to peel it. Let me just tell you this is this has got to be  maybe like  a month  Two months old garlic for this to work. There's no there's just no not with fresh garlic. You don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The skin is very so a number of big time chefs debunked it and one guy actually cut himself doing it. Oh, Jesus  So no  Here's another story. I love this story  Rap genius, which is a site for lyrics. It's a crowd source site for lyrics, but it is the place  If I want to know lyrics i'd like to go but lately, you know  the  We have all realized the best way to figure out what the lyrics in a song are just ask google google  Song name and lyrics  Let's let's try it with not today  Okay  Lyrics by alessia cara  And see this is the thing. It's not a snippet  It's not like song zushraff  It's the whole freaking lyric

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well the fun of rap genius is it's annotated to explain. I agree what the heck things are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree and if you do this on google  You you know, okay if you don't understand the fun of rap genius, you're going to probably find this now google does  Immediately right beneath it. Yeah, the copyright notice is just funny comes from the music publisher, but it turns out that's not where

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's new as of as of this is yeah, that's what they're doing now source lyric find is new because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what happened rap genius. It turns out has been doing what a lot of mac makers have been doing for hundreds of years putting  different  information in the lyrics  in this case  choosing between  smart apostrophes and  Dumb apostrophes  In the punctuation they've been watermarking lyrics on their website  and in fact, let me just show you because it's even cleverer than that  because this the mix of straight apostrophes and kary apostrophes can be used to create a morse code  That when you spell it out  Watch this here it comes gives you the words  Red handed  That's pretty cool  So apparently even though those were unique to genius google was displaying them now google's explanation is  oh  We don't scrape the net directly. We use lyric fine to do that  This is by the way the excuse that companies have used for years  We just hire a third party and they they break the law on our behalf  Lyrics fine says no  We have a whole team a content team  That does you know, sometimes we get them from the artists. Sometimes we get them from websites  What I really would like is for google just  There's two things google could do one is they could buy these lyrics from the publisher if they really want the information  But what we would like is for google to just  Buy these lyrics from the publisher if they really want the information  But what if you just gave the first verse and then a link back to the source?  Just like they do with newspapers do snippets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think that's that's right i'm amazed that there hasn't been  So if this had happened 10 years ago, there would have been copyright screams from the publishers clearly there's benefit  To having the lyrics online  it must drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Attention well remember we're old enough to remember when you buy an album and have the lyrics on it  But some artists didn't want the lyric they wanted you to guess like the rolling stones never put lyrics on their stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and I also remember when when i'm old enough to remember in the early days of the of the internet that I so dearly  love and protect that  If you put up more than end lines of lyrics you'd get you you were in trouble  And that's kind of gone away that's interesting because it is copy it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Publishers copyrighted. It's already copyrighted. They own it  so  Yeah, I agree with you. Uh, let's give credit to rap genius now  Just genius.com that the information that is on their site is much more than just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lyrics they're annotated, but but the interesting is they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get it off listening to the music. So they're violating copyright right there in many cases. They get it from fans. It's crowd-sourced  That's what i'm saying. It's crowd-sourced  But also

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The artists themselves annotate. I don't know if you've ever exactly that's why it's all seen as a good now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the funny thing what i'm trying to say is this the funny thing is that and I like the guys at genius  They're very smart and i'm not criticizing them, but  They are in essence violating the copyright of the music  Producer and now they're accusing google of violating the copyright that they violate  Now the truth is that as you say the artists go in and join the conversation so it's all a fine thing  Here's an article from 2012

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  lyrics website owes music publishers 6.6 million dollars because  Apparently posting lyrics is illegal  But I think that's changed. I guess the the labels kind of accept it now  And by the way, if you listen to a song on your amazon echo show, it'll play lyrics in front of it, right?  Google's home hub will now uh apples even will on apple tv  I  Yeah, I think probably just as record companies have realized that having music on youtube isn't the end of the world that having lyrics  On the web is not so bad. It's probably good for sales and I have to say I love  the annotations on genius

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because uh, I don't know. Here's the problem with your solution  Is that it is the ubiquity of search?  Um, so what I went on are you mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a license here's the solution they license the this is back and when what's the year of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, okay. Okay, then I stand corrected. I did license they did license. They made a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's no wonder they're peeved

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're paying so I went on harry melbourne  Uh two weeks ago, yeah, and I I need I said on twitter arm me with some lyrics  people  And so some people on twitter did but I had to find the original and confirm those late that video. Yeah  So I had to search  the lyrics themselves which were in the middle of the song  and  The only way I could do that is because google had the entire lyric

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way pandora is being sued  by the publishing company for tom petty rage against the machine in weezer  Because they put lyrics without any valid license or authorization  on the pandora screens  Uh pandora shows lyrics between beneath some songs on mobile and desktop and it's done so since 2009 partnering with  lyric find  It's apparently in flux  Yes  It's a situation in flux. I just honestly I really liked what genius did they suspected that they were getting scraped and so they  Put smart quotes in. Yeah, it was very smart and they caught them  Red-handed  Uh  Let's see, I guess we could talk about rcs. This is just an endless  cluster mess up  I love our ranam audio's article google's ninth attempt at a messaging service. This is so funny. Yeah a ninth listening to all  attempt  Will be based on rcs, which is this rich communication services which google wants telcos to use to replace sms  It gives messaging  basically a few of the simpler features of you know, whatsapp and  messenger  Rcs has not been really  widely  supported by the carriers  Rcs according to ranam audio will follow after google talk google voice google buzz google plus messenger hangout spaces alo and hangouts  chat  Um, so now google's because they couldn't get the telcos to do it are going to run their own rcs server

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Important note this is not happening in america. Yes for a very important reason. Why is it not happening in america?  Why none of the telecoms want to want to play around and they have a lock on sms

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's going to happen in the uk and france  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't interoperate with sms without right permission from the telco. So google, you know says we'll we'll provide a gateway

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not a problem. We're going to make it universal but the  You know if the companies don't go along with it, then you have a messaging app that doesn't work with anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I ask a dumb question?  Why is it work on apple and it doesn't work? Um here I know you explained before but I just forget

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because apple has a captive bunch of people  And also have a lot of clout with the telcos, but apple does support sms as well as its own data-based messaging platform  so if you have to send  A message to somebody who's not on an iphone for instance because you know, no android phone supports messages  You'll use sms. So the carriers say okay. Well, she's interoperable. It's interoperable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're like so when i'm on like i'm an android user a bit everybody's iphones  so in because  I am not using because my carrier doesn't support it  Rcs and because I don't have an apple phone on my end running the right software  I see stupid things like friend liked this or friend laughed at that one all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I showed my head. I was like, please stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And well the the other question you might ask is well, why doesn't everybody just use service x whatsapp or facebook messenger or  Telegram or there's a million of these but the problem is nobody can we need we don't need it  Can we just set a standard and just all use it? Wait, there's an xtc for this xtc xkcd for this  There's always an xkcd for everything in the world  They've they've dealt with this before. Let me see the chat room probably gave us a link. They're very good on that  Um, so one of the problems I have and ron has as well with google's solution  is  Is uh that it's tied to your phone number, uh, which unlike um  Uh hangouts. Yeah, unlike hangouts. Um  Means that you can't use it on your desktop easily. You have to tie it to your phone specifically. Oh, this is the standards one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Situation there are 14 competing standards 14 ridiculous  We need to develop one universal standard that covers everyone's use case. Yeah soon situation. There are 15 competing standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Standards are great. There's so many of them  So that I i'm I think google is probably the last company in the world that should try to get everybody to use the standardized

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Platform, so is it just hopeless as an android user will never have really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know in some part like if you're in brazil, everybody just uses whatsapp and that's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so that becomes the standard so facebook wins

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In that case my friends we all use group instead of group test we group text. We use whatsapp  We used to use hangouts, but now we don't know who's going to have support for hangouts. I really I still use hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I wanted to work because it works on all my phones. It works on iphone works on android. It works on my desktop  There's a chrome plugin  Google already has the perfect solution  It's just depressing. I don't I don't know what the answer is. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So stacy how'd the dog adjust to the move

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's still barking. Um, she's not doing well. She is she's sad  Oh, no, this is austin  I think she's just we were here for like first we flew her up here, which was beyond scary for her  Yeah, that's really yeah  And then when she got here we had like two weeks of nothing in the house and she got used to that and then suddenly  We put her away for change change change and then suddenly all the furniture came and so  We kind of broke the dog, but you know, we're trying to get her back on track. I'm sure she  I'm sure she'll get she should hopefully she'll I mean, I don't know what else to do for her. Oh, she'll get you  No, she'll sell that  Treats many treats. Yeah, we're doing treats. She doesn't like walks anymore. She doesn't want to leave the house for very long

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's afraid it'll be gone when she gets back. Yeah, so we're we're really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let her she needs to pee inside the house everywhere to just no. Nope. Nope. That is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She doesn't want to do that and we don't want her to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Casey newton does it again blockbuster article on the verge once again talking about the poorer content moderators  at facebook  Casey wrote a story about phoenix and then heard from a lot of people  Now it's con it's it's facebook's lowest performing content moderation site in tampa florida  Facebook does this thing that a lot of companies do which is they outsource it they outsource it to a company called cognizant  It's a big contract a hundred million dollars for two years  cognizant hires people working for  $15 an hour which sounds low until you understand the minimum wage in florida is like eight bucks  So people are happy to have this job  But it is a nightmare  furthermore  Uh casey had a bunch of contact. They have a 14 page nda, but casey was able to get some people to talk to him  Contractors told me that cognizant had lured them away from less demanding jobs by promising regular schedules bonuses  And career development only to renege on all three  They described a filthy workplace in which they regularly find pubic hair another bodily waste at their workstations  Employees said managers laugh off or ignore sexual harassment and threats of violence

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, why is there pubic hair at their workstation? Don't ask stacy. Do we have to ask it's on a need-to-know basis

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's let's let's just don't ask questions like that. I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I stacy I admit when I read it I focused on that as well, but let's just move on shall we yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's please leave your I mean, it's it's a terrible place. I'm just like wait. How does that even happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But okay. Yeah, I shouldn't ask these questions. Well remember too. I mean the other part of this and this is a horrific article  it's in fact, there's a definitely a trigger warning in this article because  It just talks about some of the the content that these moderators have to see  And not just once but again and again, there's one moderator talks about an animal abuse situation  He flagged it. Of course facebook decided not to pull it down saying and get this  We want the authorities to have a chance to track down and arrest the perpetrator  The moderator says and as a result this keeps getting reshared and I keep having to see it over and over and over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have the video. Why don't they just send it to the authorities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they track uh, this is this is this is a no win  uh for for moderators because the authorities complain sometimes about things being taken down because they want to see the traffic around it to  Get to get to understand the network

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As the weeks went on the video continued to reappear in his queue and he realized police were unlikely to look into the case  They kept reposting it again and again. He said pounding the table as he spoke  It made me so angry. I had to listen to it all day  uh now  You know, there's part of me says you should get a better job  The algo doesn't do crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is this was this was true in the christchurch video  Is they try to hash the videos?  But of course the videos get changed, right?  So there are n number of versions of the video because they know how to get around right and the hash technology isn't smart enough yet  To recognize the pieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when it does they'll use it for surveillance tech to  Check out humans who've modified their own faces to avoid surveillance. Sorry. Go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go again. Also apparently cognizant is not spending a lot of time screening hires, which  Well, they give one example. They probably go pretty quickly. Yeah, they give example they hired a a moderator who  Actually had sent been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for an investment fraud scheme involving facebook  Uh, and also I think the constant barrage of these videos  Has it takes its toll on these people and they start to act out  um  The result is a raucous workplace where managers send regular emails to the staff complaining about their behavior  Nearly every person interviewed independently compared the tampa office to a high school loud altercations  Of often over workplace romances verbal and physical fights break out monthly a dress code is instituted  To discourage employees from wearing provocative clothing to work  Um, it sounds you know, the smell of marijuana is so strong one manager complains getting like a high a contact high  Anyway, it's uh, it's a terrifying and sad story and  It's something probably when you read these statistics about the high rate of employment in this country  You should remember that many people are employed at jobs  That are just awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and then and the problem too. So so I talked earlier. I went to the this this  A workshop for the oversight board that facebook wants to do that's not going to scale  Well the darn the volume of the stuff is amazing  But the difficulty as I said, you know, they gave us a couple case studies and people disagreed  And it's difficult I read today the the washington post has some really good reporting on a rich new york couple that's that's  Contributing more than three million dollars to anti-vax stuff. Yeah, right. And so they're out there everywhere. They're doing this stuff  How do you how do you play whack-a-mole not with a bad video not with a bad image with a bad idea content? I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um facebook now higher has employs 30 000 people in this in these jobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as I like to point out at this moment  There are a few and again, it's apples and oranges, but there are fewer than 30 000 journalists working for newspapers in the u.s  Now, yeah, so it's where are we devoting our societal resources?  To tamping down the idiocy of a few let's say it's a few who do this versus informing the many

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we're fighting the we're we're  dealing with facing with fighting the consequences of  of these  Uh platforms instead of possibly regulating the their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their use I I just i'm so glad i'm carsten. Hold on there carsten  Uh, you you act as if as if by just passing the carsten. I was gonna do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I did not poke jeff with a stick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you want to leave on vacation? He's going on vacation. You really can't tell  I'm gonna get back at him for this  If you act as if it's as easy as saying we pass a law and that doesn't what this story demonstrates is how hard the actual work is

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it also demonstrates that like you and I jeff reasonable people can disagree. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you for calling me reasonable. I appreciate that. I'll call you reasonable, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, how could anyone not call me another great story matthew miller. Well, great not great  Uh, who is a zd net columnist. He covers smartphones and cell phones  Published his story. I've known about this for a while, but he finally published his story simswap horror story  I've lost decades of data and google won't lift a finger. I don't know if that headline really  We heard about last week. Yeah, I don't know if it's really fair matt was talking about matthew ingraham was talking about it  Uh, he's the guy, uh on june 10th or I think it was matthew ingraham was talking about no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was probably kevin because this is his

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the mobile podcast absolutely right. It was so I didn't know that he works. He works with kevin. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The mobile tech roundup is the name of their podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you'd think he'd know better  He had a t-mobile phone  He got up in the morning his oldest daughter shook his shoulder and said actually no, i'm sorry  It was 11 30 at night and said your twitter account's been hacked  I picked up my iphone saw the text message that said t-mobile alert the sim card for your number has been changed  If just change is not authorized call 611  He uh  Apparently had another phone with a google phi sim in it so he called and t-mobile  He called t-mobile and said I did not authorize a change to my account  I was getting I was able to get them to assign my number back  By giving them the sim card id I asked why they would allow someone to call up  And take my sim without my approval  The representative said well, we can't really discriminate or tell who is who over the phone  And as long as some key information is given to them a swap can be authorized  Didn't say what that information is mother's maiden name birthday. I don't know  So the problem is it doesn't end with t-mobile whoever did this obviously was targeting  Matthew because  Then they went after his twitter account and stole it and of course  Because twitter and i've tried this today. I try to turn off  You if you have two factor on twitter they offer a variety of ways of doing it, but you can't turn off  SMS two factor you can't turn it off  So  You can have other means  But of course as long as sms is turned on it is always the weakest link  So he also found that he can't get his twitter account back twitter has a form to fill out if your account's been stolen  But it needs your email address  But his email was also stolen  He's stuck in a circle of hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With twitter and google has nothing been fixed yet. Nope. No, it's been fixed now and they stopped a thing  I will point you to just because this is  Kevin did a blog post on his about chromebooks.com  Talking about how what needs to happen to make something like this not happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And as we talked about last week put a pin number. It's public service. Let's go through this again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, okay. Well in this case, so yes, don't use mobile sms, but also he says  He points to chromebooks having tpms trusted, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Program modules platform modules. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, or a program. I can't no you're right platform trusted platform module

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um that won't let you log in  um  And he also recommends I was actually going to do this because I did this at kevin's bhest this morning  Going into your google security thing often  And yes do the security check and see in revoking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whenever possible don't use sms as authentication. You can turn that off on google  So I use a yuba key and then I have as a backup. I have an authenticator, but whatever possible turn off sms  Unfortunately, almost all the banks in this country  Require sms for two-factor and it is better  To have two-factor than not even if it's  sms  Because in this case the bad guys had his password and his sms  Uh, and at least in some of these cases  Plus they got his bank account and bought  $25,000 in bitcoin  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That didn't happen. They they took that out. Uh, they revoked that transaction and they didn't have his password and they had they only had his sms

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all they needed because they were able to get twitter to give them a new password

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, so in this case using sms as a second was sufficient  It wasn't really a second factor worse than than having not having a well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's the point is if it's not going to be used as a second factor. It's a single factor. It is worse than a password

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have as I remember we talked about last week that because i'm I live lovey to google and I have chromebook and android  When I sign in someplace new into chrome  It sends a message to my phone not sms  and I have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unlock the phone and say that's me. That's okay, right? That's right. That's actually a very good way to do it  Better even than an authenticator. Yeah  So even than authentic. I'm yeah, i'm reading the the june 17th article  So since in the last two days since even though this article is not updated. He has gotten everything back  Is that your understanding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His money he he now I think has everything but his  $25,000 that they tried to get from his bank did not go through so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay, let me just say that we will be asking him in person tomorrow on tech news weekly. Yeah, he's gonna be a guest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With megan actually megan's on vacation with jason hell. So yeah, watch uh tomorrow tech news weekly matthew miller  He will personally answer all your questions. We can find out  how it stands, but boy is that a that is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real lesson. Yeah, and it does suck. So leo, what's the uh, inconvenience to the yubiqi or the the physical thing?  You have to have it with you. Yeah, I mean I carry it with me at all  You have to be able to you have to plug it in you have to grow the time to plug it in every time  You lose it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so this is really the issue is  uh, if you you know if you have what I would suggest with the yubiqi  Is get two and lock one in a safe or keep it somewhere where you can't lose it  And then you can say I don't know other authentication except for this physical authentication. That's a that's a very secure system  But if you lose it was out of the country  Yeah, see that's why I would I don't I think this thing where google  This is the new thing google does where they send you a notification  On your phone and you have to approve it and you have to do that by logging in first  I think that's equally secure your phone. That's wonderful. Your phone is your authenticator your hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Protected him from losing his gmail which would have been key to the whole exactly problem  Exactly, but the problem is nobody else uses that but google, right? Well, yeah banks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, it was your phone company twitter  I always look for a way to turn off sms as an authentication. No, no  What i'm saying is they oh there are lots of people that use this approved and I think  Uh duo duo security uses it microsoft uses it  Oh, okay, that is the new that is kind of the new standard as opposed to the six digit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Authenticator a lot of a lot of people are also starting to use authenticator  apps like uh google authenticator  um, we've been using that here at twitter requires that and for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I talked to somebody who is  They're using a new authenticator like app, but you know with google authenticator how you you  Look into it and you get a code a one-time code for each of your right? Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, logins but the code expires every minute basically, yes, it's 30 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's called t o t p a time-based one-time passwords. I'll talk about the technology if you're interested. Go ahead stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but the challenge is when you get a new phone  You lose all of it. So you have to download authenticator again, and then you have to only if you're using google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's stupid authenticator. So what people sometimes do is they print the qr codes  I use and recommend an authenticator that uh called authy which is free from twilio  That's what I wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I was like there's another one and I can't remember the name of it and i've been looking for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's several of them that do this authy is my favorite authy  has  You create an authy account and an encrypted you encrypt your pass your uh, so the reason this is  I I still I like this approved and I think a little bit better  The way time-based one-time passwords work is every site has in effect a second password a long  secret number  And that is hashed with the time of day  updated every 30 seconds to generate a six-digit code  But that is kind of like a password and if somebody were to get those long numbers they could come up with the authentication code  So that's that's the problem with that system  And that's one reason probably google authenticator says well, i'm going to give you that number once  It's going to be stored deep within authenticator. Nobody else will get access to it  But if you get a new phone or you lose your phone, you're out of luck  Authy tries to make it more convenient by storing that long number  In your authy account it encrypts it on device sends it to authy. They don't twilio doesn't have access to it  So it's always encrypted you want to encrypt it with strong, you know  Passphrase if you can but that's the advantage and see I needed this because I have a new phone every five minutes  So I need to be able to move my authenticator account. So I just did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wanted so I have the the new phone and I went to the other phone and  Uh opened authy and it just said go to the other device that we know is okay  Yes, and say it's okay there and then my my new device is okay. So that's that's really there are some very good systems out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a fan of authy. I think twilio is a good company, right stacy?  Oh, yeah, twilio is a lovely company. Yeah, and so I trust them and that's why they give it away for free, which is pretty good  Authy has this new that new thing that you just did jeff, which i'm very excited about businesses can enable that  Which is a much an even more secure way of of doing it  So yeah, I think that  There are solutions out there  The problem with sms is that one you just talked about jeff, which is they didn't need the password. They only needed the sim

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really trouble troubling. Well the weak link in all of that is the damn phone company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, customer service reps who you know, the authentication there is very weak

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the weak the weak link is is almost always going to be social engineering humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Humans are bad always the weak link and we talked last week about google phi and kevin sent me a link

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, so phi will generate a new passcode every time you log in  So you can then so the what will happen with phi if somebody calls them up and says well  I want a new sim card. They'll say okay  Tell me your code and that you'll have to go to your phi page and it will generate and then press a button  That will generate a new code and that's each time you do that. So I think that's a good solution as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So phi.google.com slash accounts hashtag settings slash privacy. Yeah, you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't matter. You don't need to see it because it's generated a new every time the representative asks you  You see you don't you don't need to generate it now  Right  It's only it's it's so that when you have an interaction with a customer service rep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can say okay for additional security use a secret code to verify your identity when you contact us  Button get secret code which sounds like so much fun. I just want to do that all the time. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would be like maxwell smart. So this is something I you know, we we always have to give google credit for it  They're good at security

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're real good at see here's if you go to your phi if you have a phi account and you go to your phi account  Under settings, there's a privacy button. You could show this car. So I don't care  There's a privacy button and this is where you get the secret code to verify your identity  So just press that. Yeah, we don't want to know no you can have it now. It's not it's not worth anything  It's it's a it's the same thing. It's a t o t p and it expires in 30 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  30 minutes or 30 seconds this one 30 minutes, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, well actually that was that out but anyway, uh, please don't use that hackers, please  30 minutes go I honestly feel really lucky that this has never happened to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, don't don't don't jinx the gods. Would you knock some wood, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Knock some wood. Thank you. Well, that's but that's why my strong preference is you use yuba keys  apple nat last pass supports it now apple supports it, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Finally on the iphone I never have my challenge is I never have the right thing  I used to have like a little rsa security dongle at time inc  They made me have one of those on my corporate computer, which I never used right. I did have one  But yeah, I just  I never have the right tool with me when i'm because I actually wander around with my computer  And I never have my phone with me. So i'm constantly like oh crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is this is on the key ring that my house key and my car keys are on so I really can't leave home without it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I just mean like, you know, i'll be downstairs and it'll be upstairs  I mean, it's am I complaining about having to walk? Yes, there is a trade-off between security and convenience

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will note that theo complained about this for about  Three or four weeks straight when he first started doing it. What do you mean? Oh that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that was when I did the super security. Where's my ubq? That was when I did google's super security  So what is more explained the difference between those two things again to me that's when it will only accept a hardware token  And they require you to buy two  Titans or you can use the titan security key which does both bluetooth and hardware  And that's the only way you can log in and that actually turns off a number of useful features in your every single time  You log every single time. So that's for people like, uh,  Podesta if you're if you're the democratic national committee  You should absolutely be securing your email. What is what does google call it? Uh, super super duper authentication  Technology, but it's they even say this is going to be  really, uh inconvenient  But it's good  Um, yeah, I tried it because I thought well i'd like to do it's called google advanced protection  And I tried it for a while but you're right karsten I was bemoaning it every time they were last year they were at rights con

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And were offering the keys free to because these are people who are out there doing dangerous things  Human rights advocates. Yeah, and they were oh, yeah, instructing them all and how to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you think the russians are after you  Uh, you you you want to do this you have to buy two keys  Um and register them with your google account  They do say they've added some new features what happens if I lose both my keys  You're bored if you have lost both keys and do not have access to a login session  You have to submit a request to recover your accounts  It will take a few days for google to verify it's you and grant you access if you lose both keys you you simply must  Use social engineering to get yeah, there should never be it's always remember security is that's always the weakest link  That's why if sms is allowed the bad guys have sms  It's why I don't believe in secret questions, which are a terrible  authentication method and whenever I see that it drives me nuts because  Nobody should ever use secret questions. You should treat secret questions like a password  And provide it with a random password which you record in your last pass  But I actually was on a site the other day that had dropped down secret questions and dropped down secret answers  So you couldn't do that you had to use  Yes, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a company that every single time i go in and ask me the same two questions from the same drop down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's  not right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and this is a company that  has  control and access about much of my access to the internet. Yeah, see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's problematic  I should do the advanced protection again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially after you challenged everyone on your show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Believe me it doesn't take a challenge to get people trying to hack my accounts  It's fine. I can live with it  Well, actually my the low-hanging fruit is probably my twitter account because again twitter requires sms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you started tweeting though, we'd all be like what is happening? This is not Leo. That's how his that's how Matthew's daughter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She realized this hack started because she looked at his twitter accounts. That's not her  I was about to die  Google's uh, let's do the changelog because there's some interesting things coming from google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten you're not on vacation yet. Karsten. Come on. Your job. Come on boy. I really see a curve on that. I'm so sorry  the google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I can't see what's going on on the on the board over there  It's a little distant and dark, but I just imagine cars are going like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hitting every button

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just saw this my google assistant showed me where I parked today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh  Are you sure you want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, okay  Where why did you park there if you don't want that you may remember it used to do that and that  With google now but google now is gone  But now assistant will now is google then yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see I have an app that's done this for me for for years and it turns on when I push a button  Yeah, that's a better way to automatically track my car at all times. But yeah, but then remind me  Yeah, but hey your car is yeah, but where my car is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is you don't usually lose your car unless you're kind of not thinking about that, right? Right?  That's the thing if you think oh, I don't want to lose my car. You're not going to lose your car  It's when you're drunk off your ass  And you don't remember where you put your car. That's when you need this feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can't tell you what floor you're on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember to push the button for that. So I go and I look let's see if it's doing it  I think it's doing it. I'm going to go to updates. Yeah, you parked here  Updated four hours ago based on your location history  And it's right can't do floors, right?  Sagan  Karsten, I'm not karsten. What's your name? Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon they forget you can't do floors in like when new york. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you ever park in the car elevator garages?  No, they're so weird you park and then it puts your brings your like stacks the cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a secret place. I park in new york and i'm not saying it on the air  I'm not telling anybody because i'm not generous. I'm not sharing this because you park in time square

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could figure it out. See this is this could teach jeff a lesson

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually you have 30 minutes to find jeff's car go  Yeah, go find the other thing I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing I do is i've got a secret route in jersey and I turn off ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I take it i've got a secret route in jersey. Oh you turn off ways so it won't  Let anybody else know about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a very generous guy. I share lots of things. Those are the two things I won't share but see you you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's point out because of privacy. No, but because no no you have the choice. That's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually it probably does track me anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does I mean so you work in time square you work in what has to be in center of the universe the whole world  the worst place to find a parking spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets worse all the time because they're building hotels like crazy and taking down the garages, which is a fine thing  How much do you pay a day?  It can go anywhere from  45 dollars to  65 to 70 dollars  I don't drive in I don't do that. I don't you take the path jersey. Yeah, it's a path. Oh, so your secret spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is not in new york. It's in jersey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not gonna say where it is. It could be in nebraska. I'm not saying  I have I have a good spot and i'm not saying another one. You can't get it out of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google it's a I actually know you know what I know exactly what I mean because I have a secret space to park in for the giants games  Oh, yeah  Google's safe browsing service gets its own chrome extension  so  You get this benefit when you use chrome anyway  But they released the suspicious site reporter extension which lets you report suspicious sites to the safe browsing service  Safe browsing service is one of the best things ever when you and sometimes it's wrong  but when you go to a site like I can actually I can actually make it happen because  If I go to dick debartolos site  He's done something wrong with his certificates  but if I click uh  I think it's if I click the what the heck is it? No, maybe it's  Oh, it's working now too bad. I used to get irc. Uh, your irc channel is insecure  Is it no no, i'm not talking about that the one where you get there's malware  You know, you really you can't go here. You have to say yes, this is that's the safe browsing  Service and now you can report  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See i'm i'm a little suspicious about this story only in so far as whenever i've heard people raise that kind of idea  That's all crowdsource bad stuff  Google people have told me on facebook told me that's gonna be utterly worthless data because it'll get gamed  It'll be crap that their algorithms are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Clearly they've figured out a way  To vet this information or that I know you know what I think it is leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's the crosswalk button. It just makes you feel like you're doing something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the closed door button elevator closed door button. Yeah, I don't know that closed door button, right? Yeah, sometimes those work

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they work for me because whenever I see jeff coming down the hall  I hit that button and it closes the door and I go  And I say, oh, oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry as we're going away

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other jeff  Yeah, not you jeff  I told karstin every time you you you bark at instruction to that jeff. I jump. Yeah, that's our new jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's our new jeff  Should I jeff do you have an old jeff new jeff? Do you have a nickname?  I can use instead of saying the j word. He's jeff. It's fine. It can be jeff. I'll just call him. I'll call him new jeff  New jeff and you'll that way I get to call you old jeff. Yeah, that's not no, that's not good for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's call him ancient jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually redundant to call one new and one old you should just decide  Either call him new or no, we should just call what is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what happens when you get a degree from harvard  You know actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, what are you doing? Call me cranky. I'm not cranky. I'm on vacation already. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's wearing shorts and a hawaiian shirt. This is a guy who comes to work with a tie a suit and tie every single day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, i've i've met him bowtied. Yeah, very very i've never seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woof de karsten woof de karsten

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never seen mufti karsten over there. We want to see making it up. Are you in mufti?  I am not in mufti. No, I was making it up. He's actually looking very happy underneath my my underneath my clothes  Google okay. Maybe this is another walk button. I don't know google says we're gonna pay we're gonna give one billion dollars  To build 20 000 houses in the bay area  What is that per house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a lot first. Hey harvard. Hey harvard. Hey haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not major in math for the next hold on. So this is a big investment  So over the next but it's in part so over the next 10 years. We'll repurpose  The land our own land that we have 750 million dollars worth  Which is currently zoned for office or commercial space. We're going to repurpose it as residential housing  That'll let us build at least 15 000 new homes at all income levels. Although honestly  It's got to be because they want to have a place for the engineers to live 50 000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, is the 50 000 per house google says that is per house, which is  Um, nothing then they're gonna build in the bay area. That's nothing. That's very one of my favorite games

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the valley is to or in the peninsula is to go buy a house and looking up on zillow  You see some rundown piece of junk. It's amazing million dollars. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But to google's credit they're going to have low and middle income housing as well  In fact, they're going to establish a quarter billion dollar investment fund  To provide incentives to enable developers to build at least 5 000 affordable housing units across the market  Uh in addition to the increased supply of affordable housing  We're going to give 50 million in grant through google.org to non-profits focused on the issues of homelessness and displacement  This is good. I think as much as i'd like to be cynical. I think this is good corporate, uh, citizenship

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, yes, it's also the zoning issues. They're gonna hit yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say that the challenge here isn't just money  It's like hey, we're gonna put up dense cheaper housing in your area and then people are gonna be like not my backyard  I don't think so  I paid four million for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The property they're gonna give away is in places where there's no houses, which means they're not great neighborhoods  They're not they're not unsafe or anything, but they're just really boring views boring, but it's not unsafe mountain views

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know  Hey, i'm really excited about this and i and carsten. I hope you're gonna  Do something like this with your kids. I'm thinking of doing this with uh,  our our teenager  Google has released game builder that lets anyone create 3d games in a minecraft like ui remember microsoft bought minecraft  And is doing a lot I think to make it an educational tool  But this is google's response game builder and this comes from google's area 120, which is their experimental  Workshop if you have an idea for a video game  Uh, you can use this it features a card-based visual programming system for building 3d levels. Yeah, let's look at  That's not the video of it. Unfortunately  Drag and drop cards to answer questions like how should I move?  You can make moving platforms scoreboards healing potions drivable cars  Have you played with this or has zach played with this or anybody? We have not played with this yet, but um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it's got a lot of uh  Scratch  Uh scratch like yeah, yeah scratch is a mit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Version of small talk actually. Yep, and it's got a plug and play  Kind of simple drag and drop interface that's become a but I don't know look at this. This looks this is pretty cool  This is the video on steam because it's on available for free on steam  It it is drag and drop but you know, it looks pretty cool. You can also put uh, javascript in and it's live  so  Light and particle effects. This is pretty cool  Um, i'm gonna i'm gonna play game builder. Let's see. Oh, I need to install steam  I won't do that right now  But this early access game is not complete and may or may not change further if you're excited to play this game in its current state  If you're not excited to play this game in its current state, you should wait  But if you want early access apple or windows download steam  And install game builder, this is from google's area 120. I think this is so cool  I'm gonna get the i'm gonna get the kids playing with it  That's for sure  Kids go code. Well, they want to code and i've been really looking for different ways to teach them. They're all uh,  Like sophomores and juniors in high school  And so there's you know, they're ready to think learn real coding  But I want to also make it fun and the nice thing about something like this  They love games is it would give them instant feedback and I think it'd teach them some the skills some of the basic skills  Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah  Uh google has ditched nets nest.com. You gotta go to store.google.com if you want to buy  nest stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be fair, you can always buy nest stuff on the google store. So now you just no longer have a nest store

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just can't go to the nest store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked um, or I didn't ask somebody else asked when I was at i.o whether they were gonna, you know  Withdraw all the boxes and rebrand them. They said nah, we'll just sell them and till they're gone

Transcript:  Sure, they stuck a sticker on them. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They stuck a sticker

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the goo. Oh gosh. Here we go. I'm gonna mess it up. It used to be the nest home hub  Now they stuck a sticker over the word nest and it's the google home hump

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know I thought that was the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that's the opposite of they stuck a google sticker on the nest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They stuck a nest sticker on the google because it's now the nest  So google home. Yeah, they killed the right. That's right. They killed the nest servers, but they adopted the nest name

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jesus  And their messaging service on google is going to be called nest. Yeah  But I can't wait for the nest messaging platform. That's next

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Followed by the wave messaging platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
