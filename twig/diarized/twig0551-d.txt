See, you're lucky, you're in an island,  isolated from the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's four cases on the island, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's bad.  Now you wanna get off the island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How I'm stuck on this island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey on iot.com, at Giga Stacey,  of course a great IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is also here.  He's in Sconstant, New Jersey.  We're actually, they're pretty serious in New Jersey,  aren't they?  Very serious in New Jersey.  We don't screw around here.  This is the first town to have a curfew,  I think, was Hoboken, aren't they?  They're telling you you have to go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's also because Hoboken  is filled with obnoxious drunks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A curfew on St. Patrick's Day makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it does, get the amateurs off the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Newark Strong he's wearing.  Oh, is that what that says?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  Newmark Strong, there's a big difference.  Newmark School.  Oh, okay.  Newmark J School.  Yes.  From CUNY.  CUNY, that's a nice looking.  It is a good hoodie, isn't it?  Yeah, it's a good hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kinda want it.  I went to the Cronkite School, I didn't get a sweatshirt.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uncle Walter wears my sweatshirt.  We do this show Wednesdays.  You may notice there's a slight difference to the way,  if you're watching the video, the way we're shooting it.  If you listen, you won't notice a difference,  but normally we do it at the round table  in our big studio.  And I am not in the round table, I'm in my office,  because of course, we're sheltering in place here.  We're one of the now eight Bay Area counties  with the shelter in place order.  And I was gonna do it from the house,  but then I realized, I actually could come in here.  I locked the door of my office and nobody can come and go.  Even engineers can't come in,  they don't come in to empty the trash or anything.  I do all that.  And that way, I feel like this is as safe as my office,  except for that brief moment  when I'm passing through the hall  on the way to the men's room,  but I have appropriate guard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you wear cowbells over breaking the horns.  Shame, shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think, and we have a skeleton crew here,  there's one engineer running the board.  In fact, the transition took a little longer  to get into the show,  because they wiped the entire board down  with sanitizing wipes,  so that Kevin, who's running the board now,  can take over from John.  John's gonna go home.  So we're trying to make it,  there's only one engineer here at any one time.  There are a couple of skeleton crew staff here.  But I think all our hosts are gonna operate from home.  I think we're gonna be able to do this just fine.  And we take this pretty seriously,  because I think podcasts are gonna be one of those places  you can go that's short of the news  that's making everybody crazy.  It's your friends,  and we're talking about stuff you're interested in.  We'll talk a little bit about the virus is impacting.  The cheer song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Podcasts are the place where you wanna go,  where everybody knows your name.  I won't sing anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dorn!  Dorn!  That bore no resemblance to the tune, none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I thought it was quite good.  I thought that was quite good.  None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The point is, we're like cheers without alcohol.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just all Cliff Clavin.  And no Woody Harrelson.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, maybe I am Woody Harrelson.  I wanna be Sam.  Can I be Sam?  No, you're not Sam.  No, not Sam.  I am not gonna be Diane.  I was hoping, but okay, that's fine.  Nevermind.  You might be Kelsey Grammer.  Yeah, I think I am, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are my options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frazier.  Frazier.  So, I'm actually, I'm coach.  Actually, the chat room says I'm coach.  I will take that.  I will take that.  Yes.  Yeah, that's good, that's good.  The Captain Kangaroo of Tech, some have called me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, we have no Karsten Cam.  This has me just sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Karsten put in a requisition for a Karsten Cam.  I vetoed it.  That's where it would have been.  No, it wouldn't have been.  He wanted a Karsten Cam as a house  that we then put an avatar, a little tiny TV screen there  for the, but you know, let's not go crazy.  Pretty funny.  Let's not go crazy.  He made masks, plague doctor beaked COVID masks for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like those scary, bubonic plague ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he made them out of leather  and piping that glued, you know,  blinked in the dark and stuff.  And he actually FedExed them to the two hosts.  We had Marques Brownlee and Amy Webb on Twitter this week,  but they wisely declined to wear them.  I wore mine because I took a hit for our guy,  but it would have been a funny shot,  the three of us in our COVID masks.  Nevermind, glad it didn't happen.  Let's see.  So, can I start off with something here?  Yeah, I'm gonna let you pick.  I don't wanna, I think we need to talk  a little bit about this,  but I don't wanna do a COVID show by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's tons to do.  I just wanna, I rarely plug anything,  but I did a Twitter list of experts,  and it took me not much time last weekend to go through,  and I've been adding to it and calling.  Oh, I need that.  As I go, so it's on the rundown.  I've got three, so if you go to Twitter,  look at my list, it's the COVID list.  I have now 325 or thereabouts epidemiologists,  researchers, doctors, a little bit of NGO,  few journalists, few policy people,  but it really is the experts.  It's really the people, and I am glued to it now.  Last I checked, it had 1.4,  or I forget how many followers it had.  Last night it had less than 1,000.  Now it has 2.6,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you go to Twitter, actually I'll show you,  I'll do it on my system so I can show people what to do,  because what's nice is Twitter has kind of brought back lists,  Yes.  which I think was one of the best features of Twitter,  for a while they were kind of deprecating it.  So if you go to Jeff's Twitter feed and I watch,  I'm sorry Jeff.  Oh no, night mode, no!  I don't even use the dim mode, I go all the way to night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that looks like fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it looks good, doesn't it?  I love dark Twitter.  Dark Twitter, man.  If you click the three dots next to Jeff's head  and go to view lists, you'll see his list.  That's a little confusing, because there is a list item.  Role list.  There's a list item, but that's your lists on the left there.  So don't do the one on the left,  go to the three dots next to Jeff's head,  and then it shows his list.  And then if you click on his list, you can subscribe to it.  And I think it's worth subscribing to,  because then once you've subscribed to it,  if you go to your lists,  and you see I have a lot of lists that I follow  and I've made and so forth, can I,  oops, what happened there?  I don't know what happened.  Twitter, I don't understand.  How do I follow your list or how do I go to?  It says subscribe.  You show up from your list. I did subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now from your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be in my list.  Oh, I, sorry, I didn't click the subscribe tab.  There it is.  So the easiest way to do this is that,  and then you can, your Twitter just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That woman right on top, stop there for one second.  Devi Sridhar, she is incredible.  She's in Scotland, and she's there,  I think she's as important as Anthony Fauci,  and really smart, and I've learned a lot from her.  There are scientists in here who reveal  the latest of their tests,  and it's very early stuff, and a lot of it I don't understand.  I didn't understand something today  about these assay seratology tests.  There was some progress, so I went in and I asked somebody,  can you explain this to me,  and they explained it to me really clearly.  They're busy, I don't want to bug them,  but it's quite phenomenal to see science in action,  which is what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very nice, thank you for making that list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just wanted to mention that,  and I think if you're tired of talking about misinformation,  the beauty of this is you go to where the experts are.  I'm not bothered in the least by any disinformation,  I just spend my day on that getting scared to death.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have advised people,  it probably isn't good to live on Twitter  if you don't want your anxiety level to ramp up  any more than it's good to watch the news stations.  Well, you can watch Fox, it's very relaxing,  but if you watch the other news stations,  it might also ramp up just a little bit.  Actually, Fox has gotten scary too.  Isaiah Tufiki wrote an article in The Times  I thought was very interesting.  She is a professor of information science,  a great sociologist, and has been doing some great stuff  on her Scientific American blog,  but she said something about masks.  Did you read that opinion piece that she wrote  that I thought was interesting?  She said, the government would have been better off  if they hadn't lied to us about masks.  The drum beat has been very strong,  masks don't do anything,  only if you're sick should you wear a mask.  She said, masks help.  People who wear masks are less likely to get infected.  What the government should have said is,  there's a mask shortage, please don't buy masks,  let the medical professionals who really need them  have them, but if there were an infinite supply of masks,  the right advice would be everybody should wear a mask  when they're anywhere near people,  because they do help, they may not be perfect,  but they do help.  And she made an excellent point,  she said you could even make your own surgical mask.  It's not an N95 mask, but even that will help  for two reasons, one, because it does keep particles  from spraying into your mouth and nose,  but two, it also reduces the amount of time  you touch your face.  And of course, that's one of the big problems,  is particles that land on surfaces that then you touch,  and then you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth,  and infect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Stacy removes her hand from her chin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, touch your face.  I sanitize, if I'm gonna, like in here,  I feel like I could touch my face,  because I'm clean.  I've washed my hands, I've sanitized, I'm clean.  But when you go out in public, you gotta stop.  We took a nice walk the other day,  and we did a no-no, and I didn't realize till we got back.  We went over to the middle school where Michael,  who's now 17, went to a junior high,  and he couldn't resist playing on the playground equipment.  And I read, that's a no-no.  Take a walk, but don't touch any metal  or plastic surfaces.  Unless it's copper.  Yeah.  So these masks I did not buy.  We bought these months ago after the fires,  these N95 masks.  So I probably should bring them over to the hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's now requests if you're a construction company,  or if you're a nail salon,  or if you're a veterinary office, or a dentist office,  and you have those kinds of masks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh Lord, nail salons do not wear,  they don't care enough about their people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever you have, get them to the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, yeah, yeah.  Cause that's really the issue.  And I think Tufiki was right is,  but you know, this happens all the time.  Public health officials don't trust the public  with the truth.  So they often shade it a little bit.  Gary Taubes wrote a great article in The Times  some years ago saying, you know,  salt really isn't a problem.  But because in some cases salt raises  people's blood pressure,  public health officials decided,  well, we're just gonna make that a blanket recommendation.  Not all people, I eat a lot of salt,  my blood pressure's not affected by it.  So not all people are.  So this is not unusual in public health  where they make these blanket claims.  The problem, as Tufiki points out,  is when you do that and you're caught out,  then it erodes trust.  And trust is so important at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you should not lie to your people.  I mean, if you know something catastrophic,  maybe you don't tell the whole truth,  but you shouldn't actively lie.  That is, nowhere is that good public policy ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, it bothers me a little bit.  There is a silver lining, I guess, to all of this.  HP's hostile, or Xerox's hostile takeover of HP is now off  because nobody's at the office to work on it.  There is also a negative Google's announced  that don't expect updates to Chrome or Chrome OS  in a timely fashion.  Everybody's home.  Can't they still work on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I work from home.  I've put out entire publications remotely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says due to adjusted work schedules,  at this time we are pausing  upcoming Chrome and Chrome OS releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This makes sense, actually, because if you do have,  the thing is, a lot of people are home with their kids  and you are gonna be less with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another issue, and this has come up with Apple.  As you know, Apple's very security-focused.  A lot of the employees who you would think could work  at home can't because a lot of Apple's security  requires you to be on-prem.  Google has adopted, and maybe is less prone to this,  I don't know, a more modern approach.  So there's, actually, Ben Thompson had a great article  on this, on a Stratecary.  The way Google does it is called zero trust.  Traditionally, businesses assume,  well, if you're on premises, you're trusted.  If you have a VPN and you're logging into the intranet,  you're trusted.  Google's zero trust assumes all resources,  all devices, at any time, could be accessed by anybody.  It's like everything is public.  Even before this.  Yeah, and by doing this, then you set up procedures  and policies that are secure no matter what.  And that is a better way of doing it  than kind of making some assumptions  about, oh, this guy's on premises, it must be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a super secure way to think about things.  A lot of it, it's a best practice in security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and apparently, Google has implemented that,  but nevertheless having trouble.  I guess Apple hadn't, because a lot of Apple employees  are either have to stay at the campus or can't do their job.  And I'm wondering, maybe Google's having  a little bit of that problem as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have something like Firefox,  isn't that done remotely?  Yeah, that's the other side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and I and everybody on podcasting  and a lot of geeks work at home anyway.  This is our normal environment, we're happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'll even tell you,  I'm not used to having my kid who is 13  and actually has a school that is completely prepared.  I mean, imagine, you can't expect someone  with a four-year-old and a six-year-old  to work from home and be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, no, that's true.  You're suddenly doing childcare  and it's hard to get a job done.  I've worked at home with young kids.  It's a lot harder to get a job done.  My kids used to pound on the door  if they knew I was in my office.  They would just go, bam, bam, bam, let me in.  I know you're in there.  I'm working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a, I don't remember who it was,  but a freelancer on Twitter who was a journalist,  she was talking about how, like telling other people  who are freelancers, the kids will be okay.  You just shut yourself in, get your job done.  She's like, I have been on a phone call  with someone walking in a park taking notes  while tossing fruit snacks at my kids  so they would stop crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's the best parenting message ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  She's like, her kids were fine.  And you know what?  I've done something remarkably similar  with my child when necessary and she's also fine.  Yeah, just all the time.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was an absent father somewhat  because I remember my kids saying,  put the BlackBerry down.  Because even with, even pre-smartphone,  I wouldn't be, I'm looking at them,  typing on my little keyboard on my BlackBerry.  They didn't like it.  And I think it's maybe, there's a balance, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is amazing watching these families deal with it.  My wife and I are so grateful that our are grown  because it's tough.  Yeah.  It's hard and you're trying to do your job  and you're both trying to do your job and who does what.  And I talked to, I saw one thing come across  in my feed today in the list.  Somebody said, one of the parents got sick  and said, what if the other parent gets,  and said, don't, stay away from your kids.  And said, well, what if my other kid,  my other, my partner gets sick?  Well, we haven't thought, we haven't had that happen yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're a cluster, Lisa and I and Michael.  And if any one of us gets sick, well, there you go.  We're all gonna get sick, but we then close the door  and it's kind of hard.  Michael's dad, I'm a stepdad.  Michael's dad used to come over several times a week  and have dinner with us.  He can't anymore.  It's hard for Michael.  And we don't want Michael to go over there  because he could go over there, get something  and come home and bring it home.  His friends, every Friday, we had six teenage boys  in the house.  Thank God we don't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lot of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not just food.  There's a lot of sweat and socks and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've gone through a bunch of sliding screen doors.  I'll just, you can imagine.  The other day they were over and they found  a metal detector and they found all the metal in the yard  and they've put it on our porch.  A lot of rusty metal on the porch.  Don't know if any of it's valuable.  But it was fun.  They had a good time.  There's holes in the yard.  Anyway, I don't mind that they're not coming over,  but Michael's going a little stir crazy.  Little cabin fever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the other hand, I'm also counting,  I'm at 10 days from my last ride  in a New York City subway.  Not so bad.  Right, and so if you get to 14,  you're gonna be okay, right?  Well, for that part, I mean, we had to go to the store,  but my contact is just imploded  from what it was being a New Yorker.  Oh gosh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I think one of the upshots of this,  when this ends someday, we'll emerge out into the world  bleary-eyed, see if it's still out there,  and it'll be a very different world.  I'm not gonna be able to go to trade shows anymore  and not be thinking, I can't,  there's germs everywhere, germs.  I wonder how many trade shows will get back on track.  This is gonna hurt the economy terribly.  Vegas is shut down, and I wonder when it comes back,  it'll come back full strength.  I wonder when the NBA and the NHL come back,  Major League Baseball come back,  if they will have the same size audiences,  or if people will just go, hey, you know,  it wasn't so bad not having a basketball game on every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not gonna happen until we.  Nobody misses baseball.  It's gonna kill baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but it's gonna kill baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband is sad.  He's like, I have to be trapped inside,  and I don't have sports.  No sports.  And the other part is he can't go play sports,  and that was a big part of his life, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hard.  What does he play?  Okay, he plays pickleball.  Okay, I don't know what that is,  but I'm imagining there's a ball, and there's a pickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's like imagine kind of a tennis court,  slightly smaller than a tennis court,  and you're playing with like a ping pong paddle  and a wiffle ball.  And that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I miss my pickleball too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it's a good sport.  No, it sounds like fun.  It's low-key, you can play it forever.  It's not super competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will he play pickleball every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He plays it like four or five times a week.  Yeah, it's good fun.  It's his exercise.  Well, I mean, he exercised too.  It's just, you know, like, I mean,  anybody who goes around and likes to shoot hoops  and stuff like that, you just, it's camaraderie.  It's exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's great, I agree.  It looks kind of slow.  Are you watching a pickleball video?  Yeah, I'm watching video now.  Yeah, it's kind of a nice pace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a good pace.  I mean, again, I called it less competitive.  It's good for the joints.  I still miss the ball, but yeah.  This is getting to my speed.  Oh yeah, it was invented on Bainbridge,  but my husband learned about it in a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, you're in pickleball headquarters.  You're in pickleball HQ.  Oh, this is America's fastest growing sport, apparently.  It's America's slowest fastest growing sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more complicated than it looks.  It's tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure it is.  I'm awful at every sport.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeff's a tennis fan.  Is it a smaller court or is it that's a tennis court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit smaller than a tennis court.  Yeah, I think it's a little bit smaller.  Or maybe it's much smaller.  I don't play tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very Portlandia, I gotta say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good game for everybody.  How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  There you go.  Fun for all the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're six feet apart, so.  We used to play something like that.  Well, but you can't play it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because everyone touches that ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, you can't.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless you sanitized in between serves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't eat the ball and bat an alcohol.  Yeah, don't.  I washed a spoon in Purell today.  Ugh, Jesus.  No, it evaporates.  It's actually fine.  I'm here to tell you, I survived.  I had some soup.  You think?  I'm bringing my water from home.  I'm bringing my food from home.  Normally I bring a utensil.  I didn't.  So I went out to the communal kitchen.  With a paper tissue, got this spoon,  put Purell in it and cleaned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't there a dishwashing detergent out there at the sink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been involved washing the spoon  and I'd be touching a lot more things.  Sponges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somehow your logic seems a little flawed here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sponges are filthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could wash your hands as you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Use your fingers, yes.  And wash your hands at the same time.  Purell really worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm gonna say.  It wasn't a dirty spoon.  It was in the, you know, it was in the silverware drawer.  I'm never eating a twit again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I'm like, what if you get the Purell spoon?  Or pizza maybe.  It evaporates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no, okay, maybe there's a thin film  of aloe vera gel on it.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your tongue feels so soothed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have, I mean, this is crazy.  This is neurotic,  but I have been microwaving the sponge every day  after I do the dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should have a dish brush, man.  I gave you one.  That was one of my things of the week.  Why is that cleaner?  Because you can replace them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I replace the sponges.  I have dozens of sponges in the sink,  but I'm not gonna use a new sponge every day.  So every few days I will replace the sponge.  Brushes are better.  All right, so here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They grow fewer bacteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really, is that true?  Well, yeah.  Sponge has to be the worst.  Sponges, the Petri did a dish in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's the most erotic thing you're doing  or thinking during all this?  Erotic?  Neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neurotic.  Neurotic.  I'm hanging out if we start talking about neurotic stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know there's a lot of neuroses come up, don't they?  Yeah.  I'll think while you tell me,  because obviously you had something in your mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  That's what I was gonna say, how crazy I am.  I've got nothing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I'm not very neurotic.  I donated blood on Monday,  which is not neurotic.  Wow.  While I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a beautiful thing to do.  You took your life in your hands to help somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not really.  Oh.  I'm like, they were very hyper sterilized.  The woman, I mean, I'll tell you,  when I got there and they gave me,  they were like, and here's the tablet,  you've got to do all the answering questions on it.  I was like, oh hell no.  I like, but she wiped the whole thing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a need for blood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently Washington state had a shortage.  I think it's because people who normally donate  weren't going.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gave, when I got my gallon pin,  I said, okay, I've done enough now,  but I probably should go back to,  well, maybe now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A gallon's only eight donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I got a bigger pin than that.  I did about 30 or 40 donations.  Oh, okay.  Maybe my 10 gallon pin or something, I don't know.  Because it's a pie each time.  Do they need to test you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they don't test you for coronavirus.  If I have a fever, let's see, I donated Monday.  So if I have a fever or start feeling ill before Friday,  I'm to call them.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Okay, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't know if coronavirus  is transmitted via blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't know.  The scientific stuff is just absolutely fascinating  about how they're figuring this out.  I just got yelled at by somebody on Twitter,  a journalist, you're like, this is raw information.  You can't do this.  Well, no, people can figure this out.  Nobody knows what's going on yet.  There's little dribs and drabs.  There is one test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There has been a lot of misinformation though.  Oh yeah, of course.  Facebook, WhatsApp, especially WhatsApp's been used.  There is an article going around  and I have yet to been able to find confirmation  that says the World Health Organization says  don't use ibuprofen if you're treating a COVID infection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were in France, they take ibuprofen more  than in other countries.  And there's a theory, but that's all it is.  Not enough data yet.  But hold on, did I just-  Didn't the WHO update it yesterday?  Science Alert, is that a legitimate site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's the problem.  That's the one site.  No one has found corroborating information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just a minister in France, right?  Wasn't it the health minister?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't trust no French ministers.  But it's all coming from the Science Alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the minister of art and culture, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tesla is in Fremont.  Fremont is in Santa Clara County, shelter in place order.  They have deemed auto manufacture is non-essential.  They have told Tesla, you need to shut down.  Tesla apparently in defiance of the order  continues to operate the factory.  Of course he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm actually super worried about.  There are places, even restaurants who,  in certain parts of the country, who are like,  yeah, we're not gonna listen to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you understand it's a economically  existential threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, I'm not unaware of that.  I mean, my brother is a waiter.  That's what he does as a living.  Yeah.  I mean, you can't just say, I mean,  the government has said you need to do this  for a reasonable reason.  It's not like, you know, quartering soldiers in your house  or something, horrifying.  That was sarcastic.  So yeah, I think, are you going to bring out police?  Are we gonna have citizens who, you know,  wanna fight for their right to own their restaurant?  I hope not.  That's very scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of charter employees are very upset  because charter is not letting workers work from home.  They are, I guess, an essential industry.  And they sent out an email on Friday saying,  you can't work from home, you gotta come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, I mean, well, so there, I mean,  if you are a lineman or if you're a network operations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, our engineers have to come in.  They can't push the buttons at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That really takes everything that Kevin does  and makes it pretty late.  You can't push the buttons at home.  Kevin does it at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin does it at home, but you have fewer buttons.  We have more buttons.  This is, look at how, see, you can't,  could you do, could Kevin do that at home?  I don't think so.  Of course, there's bad behavior of all kinds.  There is a SoftBank patent troll.  Did you see this in Tech Dirt, Mike Masnick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, is this the testing patent troll  or is this the ventilator patent troll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's both.  Oh, both, oh, geez.  So the SoftBank-owned patent troll  apparently bought up a bunch of Theranos patents  when they went bankrupt.  And they're asking one of the testing companies  to halt all tests because it's a patent violation.  Now, they have come back ever since the publicity  and said, oh, no, no, no,  you can keep doing the COVID-19 test.  It's just the other tests.  I love the register headline,  Theranos Vampire Lives On.  And then this is the 3D printed valve.  So this is fun.  There's a company that makes ventilators  that charges $11,000 for a replacement valve  in the ventilator.  Italian Hospital had run out.  They went around, they found a tech company CEO  who said, ah, we could 3D print these.  He didn't release the 3D models,  but he reverse engineered 3D models.  And for one buck each, printed 100 of these valves  now the company that sells the valves for $11,000  is upset, maybe even suing on patent infringement  instead of doing the right thing,  which would be to put out the 3D files  so others could do it if they need the valve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm betting their argument is something  about FDA approval, compliance and safety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's what changes.  Now this is in Italy, so they don't care about it,  but that's exactly the point.  This 3M N95 mask is intended for carpenters  and others who have sawdust in the air  and they don't wanna breathe it.  And the FDA has loosened its rules  and said, yeah, medical personnel,  because there's such a shortage can use some of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think doing the valves  is a fine and wonderful thing,  but I've also seen, I put this on the rundown,  there's a open source medical devices group.  And I get the maker culture, but making ventilators,  people are honestly trying to,  cluj together ventilators.  I don't think so.  I think we need the automakers under federal supervision  making the ventilators, not three guys in the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if you don't have a ventilator  and the choices between not having one  and having a homemade one.  A remade Chrysler.  Give me the homemade one, I'll take that.  If you need a ventilator.  Yeah.  Universal Pictures is gonna release.  I know you were worried Stacey,  cause you and your daughter were so excited  about seeing Trolls World Tour in the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, that was up there with,  but you know what I am excited to see?  What?  Mulan and Disney Plus, we just got it.  So I'm like. Oh good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the live action Mulan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Disney has not said they're gonna release it,  but I really want them to,  because I really wanted to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Universal, NBC Universal,  which is owned by the fine company we know as Comcast,  is going to release three movies  that were scheduled for release.  The Hunt, which was scheduled on the 13th.  The Invisible Man, which was released  end of the month in February,  but no one went to see it cause the theater's closed.  Emma, which is also released in February again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanna see that, but no one else in my family does.  I know. So $20 is too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is what irks me.  And then Trolls World Tour, April 10th,  they'll all be released to stream,  but it's $20 and it's not, you don't own it.  You're renting it for 48 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would be okay with paying $12 for that,  just for my ticket, kind of that thinking.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess they figure you're gonna bring your daughter,  that'd be 25 bucks to the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody wants to come with me.  You're alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I guess if someone's sad next to you.  How much of that actually goes to the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it depends on if you go on opening night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the deal with movie tickets?  If you go during opening weekend,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more of the revenue goes towards the theater owner operator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  And then after that, it goes to the studio.  Yes.  But the theater operator gets it on the $20 popcorn.  Wait, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, did you ask me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do you know what the proportion is?  Cause what I'm saying is,  if the theater is now cut out,  the distributor is cut out.  So to look at the retail price of the movie theater  and say they're trying to recoup that is not a one for one.  How much would they like the net for you,  from you at the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like individually.  I think they get the whole ticket price.  Yeah, for a $10 ticket, one of that goes.  So they get the whole price on opening day.  Opening day, they get the whole price.  Yeah, what they're probably doing is,  well, I don't know what they're doing.  Let's put it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't want to be a theater owner right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they also, this is to me, let's go big,  go way out here.  The internet, and let's look at journalism, right?  It got rid of distribution, right?  You're no longer a printing company,  a printing press, right?  Distribution was no longer your value add as a newspaper.  It got rid of the middle man.  And it's in this process of figuring,  we're still figuring that out.  What this is going to do is accelerate the elimination  of the middle man in a lot of ways.  So think about something like toilet paper,  which apparently is near and dear to American's heart.  Kimberly-Clark, which makes,  who's their, which brand is,  are they Charmin or are they the other one?  Kimberly-Clark, which makes diapers, toilet paper,  all kinds of personal care.  They make Kleenex too, don't they?  They make Kleenex.  They have been experimenting with a direct  to the consumer model in diapers.  But imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want my toilet paper direct from the factory  at a reduced price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a possibility of something like that here.  And I'm laughing because chicken head 21's  near and dear to your rear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make Scott's toilet paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scott's toilet paper.  Yeah.  And cottonel.  Imagine being able to sign up for a cottonel  because cottonel is better than Scott's toilet paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scott is for the employer  who doesn't really care about their employees.  Exactly.  But wants to save money with a thousand sheet roll  of one blind toilet paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is, I always feel it means that you don't value women  in your organization.  That's absolutely right.  Because women always have to use toilet paper.  That's absolutely right.  The point here is that we're going to see  a lot of businesses have the opportunity after this  in the experience now of cutting out the middle man,  which I think is gonna fundamentally change the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've already seen that.  I mean, half our advertisers is direct to consumer.  Yeah.  That's like the internet thing.  Casper, Harry's, Warnen, Parker.  So next we're gonna have the toilet paper club.  Yeah.  Come on, you can advertise it.  We'll keep you in.  We've got an audience that's dying for your product.  You can just come on and advertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if Scott's gonna go for it now.  Email lisa at artisanalagency.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Well, honestly, that's kind of what's happened  is a number of our, especially consumer advertisers  last minute just said, we're out of here.  And what's survived-  I'm worried about you.  Yeah, it's a little bit of a problem.  What's survived though, interestingly,  I think is the more the business to business stuff.  And I think we're, I don't know why.  I mean, if you make, why isn't HelloFresher  or Blue Apron going crazy?  What an opportunity.  Or Zoom or, I mean, you can think of dozens of businesses  that actually will thrive in this.  Of course, we can think of a lot of people who aren't.  In fact, I really shouldn't feel bad  for the movie theater owners.  It's the kid behind the counter selling the popcorn  I should worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those people, well, not a lot of people want that job  or have that job.  I mean, you can feel sad for that kid who loses their job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn, that's, what are you gonna do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can work in an Amazon warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100,000 new jobs, there's an example.  Amazon also says we're gonna prioritize essential products  over, I don't know what, the Chia Pets.  And they're hiring 100,000 new workers for their factories.  That's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I told my brother to go do.  It's mostly, well, some of it depends on the factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're also increasing the pay by $2 an hour in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of the shifts available are overnight  and there's other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could kind of feel like you're helping people too  though, right?  You mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's vital, it says, now, vital.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel that, well, I have a lot of questions about Amazon  and their treatment of workers and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that one of the reasons they're doing this,  A, because they need it,  but B, because this looks like you're a good member  of the community.  They even say in their blog post,  a lot of people are out of work.  Full and part-time positions across the US  and our fulfillment centers.  We know many people have been economically impacted  as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants,  and travel are lost or furloughed.  We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams  until things return to normal  and their past employer is able to bring them back.  That sounds pretty darn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  I applaud Amazon's PR, but this is, they need the people.  They're putting the nicest gloss on it  and they're hoping to get credit for it.  And can I just say, given the government's antipathy  towards the tech companies going into this  and where we are now,  the tech companies look just covered in glitter,  except for Facebook.  Yes.  You could give Facebook an opportunity to look good  on a platter and Facebook would still like take the platter,  throw everything off of it, stomp on it, and then run away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes you think maybe they really are evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God, they're the most.  No, they're just.  Horribly evil.  I mean, they're just incompetently evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're competently evil.  They're incompetently good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So back to your Amazon point for a second.  We'll get to Facebook again later, I'm sure.  New Jersey crashed the website for unemployment benefits  with a record number of 15,000 applications.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of people losing jobs.  I think Mnuchin said to expect 20% unemployment rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gramercy Park, was it Gramercy Park restaurants?  Is that what it is?  Union Square restaurant?  The big restaurant company in New York?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  80% gone, 2000 jobs gone.  Oh my God.  Oh, so hard.  I mean, I'm very privileged to have tenure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of graduate students are complaining  because they're being made to come in to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, graduate students have always been the serfs  of the university education.  Right, but the point is like.  In other words, I'm not surprised.  Terrible, but I'm not surprised.  What are they doing, grading papers?  What are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  They're not teaching classes.  I don't know what the sense is.  No, they're not.  No, we're doing everything remotely now.  What I'm seeing too though is I'm seeing,  in my Twitter feed, I'm seeing PhD students  who are scared to death because they had research projects  they have to leave now.  They had a timetable.  And in the sciences, they don't know what to do.  Meanwhile, Italy took, I think, some huge number,  like 20,000 medical students and said,  okay, you're in without taking the test.  We need you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Washington State is having PhD students  and anyone with lab experience,  they're asking for them to come and do testing.  Well, that makes sense, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That makes a lot of sense.  Misinformation's a problem.  This is an opportunity for Facebook and others  to step up WhatsApp because it's so widely used worldwide  and it kind of allows these group messaging  and it has been a source of a lot of misinformation  and it's a little harder to control  than something like Twitter or Facebook  because you sometimes can't even see the messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had to, like, some of my WhatsApp chains,  they're worse than Facebook.  I mean, I've just been, and someone will post something  and then someone else is like,  hey, that was actually debunked on Snopes  and then the other person will be like, what is Snopes?  And then there's this education process.  And you're just like, it's like your grandma meets  your crazy uncle meets your science friend  and then there's always the weird anti-vaxxer type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there's Geraldo Rivera  who's spread the phony Facebook meme that,  oh, you can tell if you have COVID,  if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds,  you don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That happened, that was on my WhatsApp chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it was, my father sent it to me.  I said, dad, but you know what?  And it's nice to be cool.  I didn't send it to the whole list.  I sent it to my father and he sent out a message saying,  I'm sorry, I saw this on Facebook, I hate Facebook,  this is wrong, don't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In an-  So should I tell my Facebook story from last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on, let me read the statement  from the Facebook newsroom,  a joint industry statement from Facebook, Google,  LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube.  We are working closely together on COVID-19 response efforts.  We're helping millions of people stay connected  while also jointly combating fraud  and misinformation about the virus,  elevating authoritative content on our platforms  and sharing critical updates in coordination  with government healthcare agencies around the world.  We invite other companies to join us  as we keep our communities healthy and safe.  That is about, literally about the least you could do  is put out that tweet.  But all of them did it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, now I feel better.  So I guess it's what they could agree to.  They all agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was a bad idea.  During an address at the Munich Security Conference,  February 15th, a month before this was declared a pandemic,  the World Health Organization's director general said,  disinformation is as dangerous as the virus.  We're not just fighting an epidemic,  we're fighting an infodemic.  I like that word.  Oh, Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Well, he's Greek.  Oh no, here comes moral panic,  except this is information panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just offensive to the ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Infodemic.  Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus  and is just as dangerous.  But again, a lot of this is lip service  until these companies,  the problem is it's very hard for companies  to find ways to stem this tide.  They've created such low-friction platforms.  Anybody can post anything, anytime,  and there's billions of users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's up to people to learn who to pay attention to  and not pay attention to.  Survey after survey after survey  says people don't trust what they read on social media,  which is good.  Good.  Wonderful.  Yeah, it's great.  It's discerning.  But stuff goes on.  I just got yelled at by somebody, a journalist,  because I retweeted a scientist  who had this small test using malaria drug in France  and in 16 cases, because this is all he had,  saw some difference and he tweeted that out.  And that was interesting.  Well, you shouldn't be putting that out.  People will think this, they'll think that.  Jesus, at some point you gotta say people will judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon Musk then tweeted,  oh, chloroquine, it's the solution.  Without any context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, everybody's going to hoard it.  So now the UK has already passed a regulation  that you can't hoard it or export it.  So they can hoard it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it really is exactly what happens in any crisis.  You have some malefactors who take advantage of it.  They hoard stuff, they scam people,  they try to sell silver solutions on TV  that'll kill the virus, as Jim Baker did,  the televangelist.  But I think for the most part, in individuals,  and it's not very public,  because it might be, Paul was talking about  how in his cul-de-sac, one woman who bought a lot of stuff,  she was a couponer, opened her garage door  and said in his cul-de-sac, said,  there are a lot of older people,  anybody who needs anything, I've got all the supplies,  come on in, just take it out of my garage.  There's a lot of that too, more of that,  but you just say it's not newsworthy.  Don't you think there's random acts of kindness  happening all the time everywhere?  Oh, 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just donated blood, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You donated blood, damn it.  And there's random acts of meanness that are happening.  I heard a horrible story.  No, you're trying to break things up,  I'm gonna do it badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No horrible stories.  Let me tell a kind story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Jeff, tell a horrible story  and then you will be the antidote.  So Jeff is COVID-19 and you are chloroquine.  Okay, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, just a friend of a colleague of mine  went down to pay their cleaning person  who needs the money desperately  and the cleaning person said, oh thank you, thank God.  Another client screamed and started to spray stuff  on the person.  Oh Jesus.  Right?  By the way, nothing to do with the internet,  people can just be horrendous a-holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, now I have two nice stories.  We are asking our cleaning person not to come  but we are paying her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As are we, by the way.  I wanted to stand up.  Yeah, good, all three of us, that's good.  So, because if you're lucky enough to have a cleaning person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you probably should treat them well.  Okay, so that's one.  And then two is the efforts by people  to buy gift cards to restaurants  and there are several efforts to make it easy  to see restaurants in your areas  and get them online and buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  And then when it's over you'll go out to eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and then also if you're worried  that maybe the restaurant will be out of business  and your gift card is nothing, which is a legit worry  and if you don't have a lot of income, that makes sense.  You can also, some people are buying food  and getting takeout for hospital workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice, there you go.  Those are two very nice things.  We gotta all pitch in.  Meanwhile, let's do a little pickleball interval.  A little interlude.  I have some, let's just watch some pickleball.  It's a great sport and it's something  we're all gonna be missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Between every match they come off to explain it.  They say, let me tell you what you just saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's watch a little more pickleball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Andrew is a award winning pickleball player.  He's a champion?  He's a champion.  Oh my God, you must be so proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must be so proud.  I did meet a professional pickleball player once.  No, there's no professional pickleball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is professional pickleball.  And I had no idea and this was at a conference  and one of the speakers was introduced  as a professional pickleball player  and I was just like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Professional pickleball player.  Andrew Higginbotham.  You know, I would like to, oh okay.  It should be.  Mr. Higginbotham, that's what I call him.  Google has also in-depth, there are conferences after,  I couldn't even go through the whole list of conferences  that have been delayed, canceled,  will start streaming the Cloud Next Conference,  which they were gonna do digital,  now they just said, oh screw it.  Nobody wants this anyway.  And then it's not gonna do it.  Game Developer Conference will be going on right now  in San Francisco, it's not.  People are streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a speaker, I have been both postponed now.  So it's sad from a revenue perspective,  but people are still optimistic.  And then I have turned into a digital speaker  at another conference.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're set to do that.  I don't know about that.  You know, one thing that bothers me though,  I see this a lot, well,  we're gonna postpone until April 1st.  Yeah. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people are postponing until November or the September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's gonna be a really busy October, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but.  So I will tell you guys, I up until last night  was evaluating doing a conference in September in Austin.  Was gonna announce it at some point in time,  but everything was going.  But I just, I pulled the plug on it this morning.  This is what you've been working on?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what you mentioned last week.  Oh, I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm real bummed, but just given the.  I think that's wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't wanna be on the hook for that.  And you don't know what's gonna happen this fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and here's what seems to be happening.  Until we have, so this is what this video did  in the Britain thing.  Hyde immunity doesn't work because the best way  to go hide immunity is injections.  And we don't have it.  Herd immunity.  Right?  Herd immunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Herd immunity.  Herd immunity, sorry.  Okay.  I know.  You know, you voted against the Hyde Amendment.  I just want you to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, the problem is that we will, if we all tamp down,  we'll do a good job.  But then when we start coming back out,  people will get it again.  And then we'll have to tamp down again.  And it's gonna be an oscillation until such time  as we have a vaccination.  And so we might be okay.  And that's a year off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did the first human trials a couple of days ago,  which means they have to wait and watch her for a year  before it's safe to use in humans.  And then they can start mass production.  So what could happen is we could be okay in July.  You're saying we're stuck in this for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we could be in pretty good shape in July,  but then, uh-oh, here it starts again.  You go back into your homes,  and it may be an oscillation is one theory.  So we'll be in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two really good things to read on that.  And here, I'll put them in the rundown.  Copy.  I can do this.  Maybe.  Where should I put them in the rundown?  I never added them in the rundown.  Put them in chat.  Oh, chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  It's a little easier for everybody.  Okay, tell us about these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I put them in?  No, I put them in Elizabeth Warren says Facebook  has reported, what?  How did I do that?  Okay, I will just tell you about them.  One is a Twitter thread.  I'll just go.  One is the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm good at Googling.  If you give me information, I could probably find the page.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One is the opinion article,  the coronavirus is here to stay, so what happens next?  Written by an oncologist, a medical ethicist,  and medical ethicist, an epidemiologist,  a biostatistician, and that is exactly  what Jeff was talking about.  And then the other is a Twitter thread  on the Imperial College report on COVID-19,  which by, and this is by Jeremy C. Young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is an excellent thread, as I remember that one, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here's the thread.  I'll pop the thread as in the IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat room's also good since you're in the chat room.  That's actually a great place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, the this place that I'm waving at.  The this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the New York.  Together, those things, that thread plus the report,  if you wanna read the report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the report that said what England  had thought to do, this herd immunity thing  you were talking about, Jeff, didn't work.  Wasn't gonna work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem was they had to use the wrong data.  They used just kind of a general flu data  of how many would be hospitalized.  And they quickly saw that their hospitals  were gonna be badly overrun if people were out there  just muxing around saying, oh, let's all get sick  because it'll help me get over with faster.  And they realized, and scientists in the UK  were having a fit because they were not revealing  any of their thinking behind this policy.  So the scientists had nothing to react to  and nothing to correct.  And so that Imperial College paper came out.  And that was it.  But I think Young says, same thing happened in the US.  That's why there was a lot more kind of panic in the US  and saying, uh-oh, we're closing down.  I am impressed, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't you by, well, you mentioned Governor Cuomo  in New York, but our governor, Gavin Newsom,  and the local authorities who have all just said,  you know, we're not gonna wait for a federal instruction.  We're just gonna do it.  And actually, honestly, I think that's the way it should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Governor Inslee.  Yeah, Jay Inslee's been amazing.  He's been doing a good job.  Can I just say that I am so glad I am not in Texas  because, wow.  I mean, Austin's fine, but John Cornyn today  and John Abbott, the governor, is he John Abbott?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just wiped that dust off your hands  and you just went, you said, bye-bye, Texas.  I am not, I am gone.  So they're not doing much to,  well, yes, we all saw pictures in Florida  of people on the beaches enjoying the sunshine,  sharing their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeez, and the Florida governor said,  I'm not shutting them down.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I understand people like Devin Nunes,  a California representative who said,  go have, go eat out, we need your business.  I understand that they're looking at  kind of an invisible epidemic  and weighing that with the clear economic consequences  of shutting all these places down and saying,  well, I know how bad it's gonna get economically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you had media say,  you had a certain media outlet, shall we say,  listening to a certain single politician, shall we say,  saying, no, no, no, it's not a big deal,  not a big deal, not a big deal.  And the disinformation was.  Well, they changed their tune, have they not?  Well, you saw the Washington Post comparison.  It's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, in-laws and my parents, who a week and a half ago,  and granted, you know, there are more cases,  but we're very cavalier about this.  And now all of a sudden they've like switched their tune  and they switched their tune pretty much in line  with our great leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So.  I understand that though, because again,  well, we only lost a few hundred people  in a country of 300 million.  What are you talking about?  You have to have an imagination.  You have to have information.  It's hard.  You have to have a heart.  A heart.  I mean, but it's also a scary thing to do  because what you're saying is,  we're gonna have 20% unemployment.  People are gonna be out of work.  People are gonna be starving.  People aren't gonna be able to pay rent.  There's gonna be an economic,  the airlines are gonna go out of business.  So I understand the hesitancy to, you know,  pull the emergency brake, but at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look at Italy.  Yeah.  And we are, the numbers, when you see the numbers,  we are tracking day for day to Italy.  Day for day.  And versus South Korea.  Now, by the way, let's be clear.  And this is an amateur opinion,  but China and Singapore and South Korea,  which have been in Hong Kong,  which all have been in good shape,  you know, may not stay in good shape.  For lots of reasons, right?  It could be that new people were exposed.  There's travel starts up.  This is not, until we get a vaccination,  this ain't forever.  But there is a way to get this,  so that the problem in Italy is people over a certain age,  and we're not far away from it, Leo,  are being told we will not get veterans.  Yeah.  That's grandma and grandpa are gonna be sacrificed.  Right.  That's serious stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Also the Republican base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the Fox News audience.  So there's a certain irony in all of that.  Yeah, but I don't want anybody to, you know,  our, at least his parents, when Lisa,  I think he was only a few days ago,  said we were gonna shut down the studio and all this,  her mom laughed.  She said, come on, you don't take that seriously.  The very next day she started taking it seriously.  So it does track very closely the President and Fox News  and what they're being told.  And I'm not surprised.  If you have somebody you trust, rightly or wrongly,  and they tell you it's gonna be fine,  especially because you want to believe it's gonna be fine,  I don't blame them.  They're getting, they're not getting the information  they need.  And even I, knowing the, you know, all the information,  far too much information,  look out there and everything looks fine.  Nobody I know has died.  You know, Tom Hanks is coming home from the hospital.  What are we worried about?  I understand you kind of want to believe all that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw this morning on Facebook,  is that guy know, is home and has it?  I'm looking at these, at my Twitter list,  and there are really prominent people in the field  who've been treating people and as a result have gotten it  because they don't have the proper equipment.  That's what I really feel for is the health workers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who are really getting it badly,  I guess because they're exposed multiple times.  They don't get a chance to recover.  I'm not sure why, but boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the other problem is, is there, I've saw it again,  little knowledge, dangerous thing.  I don't know, Jack, about medicine,  but I ask questions when I don't get it.  And I saw that somebody was showing  what they came out of doing in intubation  and in intubation, you know, some patient scares me to death.  Awful, awful.  And they're skipping the prior stage,  kind of, not the oxygen mask, whatever,  the respirator or whatever it is,  and going right to intubation for various reasons  that I can't explain.  But every time they do an intubation or extubation,  they're in big, the medical workers are in huge risk.  Their stuff, sorry, flyin', droplets flyin' all over,  and we know it's infected.  And that's the kind, and they don't have,  I saw one doctor put up a picture of himself.  He said, this is the same mask and gown  I've had for five days straight.  Of course, you're supposed to discard it each time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So there are, shockingly, there are evil actors everywhere.  There are people taking advantage of this.  And the range of kind of evil varies.  There's the hacker who created an Android app  that supposedly tells you if it's been exposed to the virus  and instead locks your phone up for ransom.  And then there's the United States Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I thought we were gonna talk about the guy  who bought all the hand lotion, or the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he's a poster boy, right?  The guy who bought all this hand sanitizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to hear from the reporter who got that guy  to be the front page of the newspaper for that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the people who used the overhead image  to crowdsource the location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good example of, of course,  I don't wanna encourage that because how many times  has Reddit discovered somebody they thought did something  and it wasn't the right person?  The Senate is working on something  they call the Earn It Act.  They are using, pulling every stop in misrepresentation  and evil out on this one.  The Earn It Act threatens Section 230 protections  for companies like Twitter, Facebook, and others.  They have to earn those protections.  God, how I hate this.  God, how I hate this.  And the way they earn the protections  is by showing a National Commission  on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention  that they are doing the best practices,  so-called best practices, which are determined  by this committee, for owners of internet platforms  to prevent, reduce, and respond to child exploitation.  Now, when Richard Blumensal, a Democrat of Connecticut,  was asked why he hated encryption, he says,  it's nothing about encryption in the Earn It Act.  Well, they don't have to.  So this is, nobody's promoting child exploitation.  Everybody hates that.  But that doesn't really seem to be what this is about.  Oh, by the way, even if the committee says  somebody's doing the best practices,  the attorney general gets to decide.  And we know how Attorney General Barr  feels about encryption.  He says, best practice is to force  encrypted messaging systems to give law enforcement the keys.  So this bill from Lindsey Graham and Dick Blumenthal  would give Barr the power to demand  that tech companies obey him.  I'm reading from Bruce Schneier's blog,  or face serious repercussions,  including the civil and criminal liability they'd face  if they lost protection under Section 230.  WhatsApp, Signal, Facebook, everybody would have a choice.  Either we're now suddenly liable.  Imagine if you said to the phone company,  you're liable for every conversation  that goes on over telephones,  unless you just record it all and give us the recordings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be fair, the phone companies have been very willing  to give data to the feds.  But they've never been liable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they just do it anyway.  Nobody's forcing them to do it.  They just do it anyway.  They're good patriots, they're good citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could argue that that's why this is now  being pushed to the core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because encrypted conversations,  even video and audio conversations over, say WhatsApp,  are dark to law enforcement.  They don't like that.  So they wish they could wiretap everything.  The thing, the difference is,  when you go to the phone company,  you have to have a lawful order.  You can't just say, hey, can you give us that recording?  You have to have a warrant, right?  This would basically mean, well, we can get the encryption,  but by the way, you got to weaken it enough  so that anybody else, with a little bit of effort,  figure out how to listen in or hack.  It is a terrible bill.  And of course, it's been proposed.  It's in committee now.  And I don't think the time,  so A, they're using the age-old canard  that think of the children, you know,  this is to protect the children.  And B, they're doing it  when the nation is very much distracted.  There is a petition you can sign.  Go, you know, read the EFF or Epic or Bruce Schneier's blog.  This essentially kills free speech online.  And they're trying to kind of shepherd it through  while we're not paying attention.  That's because if they introduced a bill that said,  explicitly, you got to have a backdoor  on your encryption, they know we would all sit up,  take notice and say no.  So they're not doing that.  They're doing something about the family's stake here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I was in the Senate with the working group  on regulation that I'm a part of  and an aide in Senator Wyden's office,  who was the coauthor of section 230,  was very unhappy with the platforms  because they weren't sending high level people  to testify against FOSTA-SESTA  because who wants to stand there  It looks terrible, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks bad.  Oh, I'm all for sex trafficking, yeah.  No, they know what they're doing.  They've done this before and now they've got,  this has been weaponized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slice by slice.  Yeah.  Our freedom is gonna go slice by slice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can go to, you know, Fight for the Future,  which has done a great job fighting for the future  of the internet all along.  They helped in the boycott against SOSTA-FESTA,  which didn't work, but they also,  they did actually some really successful boycotts  in the past, actionnetwork.org.  The petition is online there.  The more people who sign it,  the better we'll demonstrate that even though  we are all sheltering in place or, you know,  suffering from the impact of the virus, we still care.  We still care.  This is bad news.  Let me take a break.  Find some good news.  Find some good news.  There's gotta be some happy stories.  What about that bug?  Is that a good story or a bad story, Jeff?  The bug story.  No, it's a Jeff's gonna have a rant story.  Well, we like rants.  Rants are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was gonna be a good story, then it turns into a rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prepare yourself.  Meanwhile, let me tell you about our sponsor, Health IQ.  This is a good story.  I think a lot of people who watch our shows,  listen to our shows, are very health conscious.  They try to eat right, they try to get eight hours  of sleep a night.  This is you, right?  You exercise five days.  You play pickleball five days a week.  You deserve a better deal in life insurance  because you're healthier.  But a lot of times, you're just a number.  You're just a number to a life insurance company.  That's where Health IQ comes in.  They're a life insurance agency that goes to bat for you.  They use science and data to secure lower life insurance  rates for healthy people like you.

See, people who are healthy have always subsidized  people who are less health conscious.  It's not a conspiracy.  It's actuarial science.  It's just numbers.  But there's, you know, life insurance agencies  are not, you know, incented to try to give you  the best price.  You need to go to Health IQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People think of New Jersey as the place across the river  from Manhattan, where all the food-flavoring plants are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We put grass over the chemical waste.  It's very nice.  People think of New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It glows at night, it's very nice.  It says the opening of The Sopranos,  where Tony Sopranos driving across the bridge.  There's beautiful parts of New Jersey.  It's a beautiful state.  It is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the garden state, I believe.  It is indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some parts are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Baby Yoda doing?  He's holding New Jersey in his little Baby Yoda hands.  Oh, is that the New Jersey Twitter account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, it is.  I think they posted that.  Oh my God, that's really forgot.  Yes.  Yeah, they're so great.  NJGov.  They got some wild person doing their social media.  Two of them.  Two of them?  Oh, you know them?  Well, no, no, I know this person.  No, there was a New Yorker profile on it.  Oh God, of course.  That's brilliant.  That's brilliant.  They're writing a lot about the virus these days.  Your bug story.  Yeah, it's not all funny games.  Your bug story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So last night, I'm sitting here happily.  I'm, well, not happily.  I'm reading my Twitter list and going, you know,  psychotic and crazy.  Can I just make some suggestion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop reading Twitter, stop reading news,  stop watching news, get an old movie,  and watch an old movies.  Like, they're blissfully ignorant of all of this.  They're just having fun.  I've been watching old movies every night.  I feel much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're blind!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got my head in the sand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you what's going on.  I don't care if it's Jaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care if it's a scary movie.  Kevin's a big shark fan.  Well done, Kevin.  He loves sharks.  I don't care if it's Jaws.  It's seriously, it will take your mind off of it.  Monty Python would be better, I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sitting there and I'm seeing people,  my sister, the Reverend Jarvis, kidding me,  and said, I had just had a post taken down by Facebook  because it was against community standards.  My sister's a minister.  She is community standards, right?  And I'd seen like 10 of these go by and they were all odd.  So I said, that must be some kind of bug.  And as I started to grow up, I went on Facebook  and I said, Facebook, you got some kind of problem going on.  Lots of people are getting these crazy things taken down.  And within 15 minutes, Fiji Simo,  who's in charge of the Facebook app,  came on and said, can you give us some examples?  Wow, you have some pull, my friend.  Well, she just happens to be there, right?  She's also sitting somewhere at home with nothing to do.  So I got some examples together.  I saw people on Twitter too.  And I said the same thing on Twitter, let me know.  And I put those things on.  And she came back.  At first, the presumption was that Facebook told  its monitors to go work off site.  And that that was the problem.  And she kind of thought that was,  she speculated that might be it.  She came back very quickly and said, no, no, no, no.  It has nothing to do with that.  The spam algorithm has gone haywire.  And it's taken down all kinds of stuff  it shouldn't take down.  And we'll get it all back up.  And I said, well, is this anything to do with coronavirus?  She said, no, it looks like it's something  to do with coronavirus  because it had a lot of coronavirus spam.  But no, it's just the algorithm went haywire.  It's taken down too much stuff.  That was that.  So fine.  And then people started, most people said, oh, thanks.  Okay, good to know.  And stuff starts going up, right?  So it's fine.  But then there's always those people  where you knock on the bunker door  and they stick their head out and they've got a theory.  And this is what's driving me crazy.  So people, it was a bug.  I didn't use the word bug.  Dave Weiner used the word bug.  It's a bug.  It was a bug and they fixed it.  And the stuff's going back up.  Everybody said, yeah, it's going back up.  Well, oh my God, this is clearly a conspiracy  on Facebook's part  because two of my stories were critical of Trump.  And so I know what they're doing and no, no, no, no, no.  And I said, it's a bug.  There's plenty of other things to get upset about.  But people were still going on and on.  And I said to them at some point,  this is like when your car breaks down,  you're trying to psychoanalyze it  and find a conspiracy theory.  Why does my car hate me?  That it hates you.  It hates me.  It hates you and it had a very bad childhood.  It's a bug.  This is the only bad thing about staying home a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a lot more free time to come up with crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, and even today they keep going on.  No, no, no, you're wrong.  This is a conspiracy.  They're doing this.  And I said, isn't there enough to worry about right now?  But no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook has restored all those posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As far as I know they have,  but it was taking a long time.  It was into this more well into mid morning.  People were saying, oh, it just came back.  So yes, this is another stories around, oh my God,  Facebook's taking down things around coronavirus.  No, they're taking down what the algorithm thinks is spam.  And a lot of that happens to be things  because basically everything everyone's talking about  in the entire world right now is the coronavirus.  So the odds are gonna take down coronavirus stuff.  They're very good if they're taking down the wrong stuff.  It's Flay's law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never put down a conspiracy  where you can put down incompetence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  So that's what it was.  So it was, and so I, you know,  and I don't work for Facebook.  I have no relationship with Facebook.  I'm just trying to help people.  I'm just trying to say their stuff was taken down.  Something went wrong.  Put it back, can you?  And they did.  And that should have been that.  But no, no, never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the cover from this week's New Yorker,  which actually is pretty good.  It's called Critical Mass by Christoph Nieman.  And it looks at first from a distance like a coronavirus  with a guy stuck in the middle,  but actually it's a, he's sheltering in place  surrounded by dominoes.  One touch and they shall fall.  I bet you that's how a lot of people,  especially in Manhattan feel right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just stuck in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, can you imagine, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't imagine, the weather's nice here, thank goodness,  because I can't imagine being stuck in a,  this is enough space for three people,  but if I were in Manhattan in an apartment.  Yes, yes.  Or I saw some journalists post something like,  when you're a journalist and your roommate isn't right now  and they're both working from home  and the person working from home that isn't the journalist  is like chilling and the journalist is like all out crazy.  Which I totally, I'm like, yeah, that would be me  if I were at a regional daily or.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We also, as our faculty, we had some debate about this,  but I'm glad we made the right decision.  We told our students they are not allowed  to go out and report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I think by all means is the right decision.  But it's hard for them, and so they're in their apartments,  they're trying to figure out how to do stories,  they're trying to figure out how to get material  for those stories.  And then the other thing that's happening is,  okay, I'm in New York still, but my roommate just left  and left me with a rent check.  Mm, boy.  There's just all kinds of, yeah, it's just,  it's tough all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I were a journalism student or a writer,  I told my kid this, he's 17, I said,  you're living through history.  You know how you talk to your elders and they say,  you know, the depression or World War I or World War II,  you're living through history, keep a journal.  This is a great time to take those writing skills  and instead of going out and looking for a story,  start just writing about it, writing what you're experiencing,  writing what it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can use Facebook to put together communities of people.  Or do that, I mean, there's lots of things you can do.  There's all kinds of things you can do right now  that act as public service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journal from the Plague Year will, you know,  that could be your best seller, I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And right now, like, thinking about people like my daughter,  this is their 9-11, their challenger,  their generational moment in definition.  That's exactly right.  And man, so much to do now.  How's your daughter doing?  She is fine.  Her friends call this the boomer remover,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the senior deleter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great, thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God, the boomer.  They are definitely hard.  Now I know where you got it, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I did that.  And they think it's good, funny, ha ha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the callousness of youth.  I don't think they, they don't want their grandparents to die,  but you know how kids are.  They're dark humor.  What's the, what are they called, the boomer deleter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The boomer remover.  The boomer remover.  All right, we have a show title.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just her friends, it's like youths.  Youths all over the place.  The youths.  What was the other one, Stacey?  Senior deleter, I believe is one.  Oh man.  And there's another one,  but I can't remember what it was.  Oh, find out.  They're not nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that's normal.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how many hours is she online with the school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So her school is actually surprisingly competent.  So yay, her school.  They, when we had snow days,  had to use Zoom for parent teacher conferences.  And so they activated their Zoom.  They've already been on Google Class.  So starting tomorrow, she will have her first remote day.  They're going to do,  Wednesday is going to be a free, like,  do the assigned work day basically,  but they have to log on within 10 minutes on Zoom,  within 10 minutes of their period,  their class period start time.  They log on.  They've got to have headphones.  They have the explanation for the mute button,  raising your hand,  and they're going to conduct class.  Good.  And so I actually may do Twig in a couple, like the next,  oh no, Wednesday is not a day,  that's the day she's out of class, nevermind.  I was going to say, you may see me in a different place  because she's going to have my office for most of the time.  Oh, that's so great.  Aren't you glad you have this great streaming setup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, she's not going to use,  I'm going to move the mic and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, she could be very impressive with the mic.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm doing this with the school conferences.  Everyone, oh, look at that setup.  Yeah, podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last night, or after the,  I guess the election results on Tuesday,  I guess that was last night,  I'm watching MSNBC and they have,  you know how they have eight people or whatever in a panel  and they have all these people  and they introduce the last guy, a podcaster,  and he's got the microphone.  Oh yeah, he's a podcaster.  This is our universal look now.  I take credit for having invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm really impressed because they're definitely on it.  That's really good.  They're trying to figure out how to proctor tests.  That's one of their challenging things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they're worried that kids can cheat,  which they can, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's an honor code you're supposed to sign.  Parents will cheat more.  Yeah, you're like your parents are supposed to proctor  the tests for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I wouldn't cheat for my kid.  I'd like to get my kid into Stanford, yeah.  No kidding.  So how about Michael, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing about Michael,  he's been in online school for years.  So he's gone to high school.  And honestly, I think that's another side effect of this.  There's already been, because of the charter school movement,  especially in California,  in California, you can create a school  and get the state's money per pupil  if you follow certain rules.  It's called a charter school.  So Pearson, which is a big, as you know,  was my publisher, big education company,  they've set up, they call it the Connection Academy.  It's an online school.  And it is free because it's a public school.  They get paid per student, just like any other school.  It's a charter school.  They have teachers online, sometimes live,  sometimes on demand.  They have, you get sent a box with textbooks  and you gotta have your TI calculator, all that stuff.  So for him, this isn't business as usual.  This is completely normal.  I mean, the difference is that we have to give him  a social life.  So we have Boys Night on Friday night and stuff.  We have those teenage boys I was talking about over.  And that's missing and that's hurting him.  He doesn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what tips would he have for the students  who are now suddenly finding themselves doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that impresses the hell out of me  is his work ethic.  He's a straight A student.  We initially did this because he had trouble in classrooms.  They were too noisy, he couldn't focus.  So one-on-one teaching worked out very well for him  and he's been doing that for real long,  like since fifth grade, but all through high school.  And I don't know if, I think it's him  or maybe it's because he's been doing this,  but his discipline is amazing.  So he'll do he as he gets up.  Class starts at 8 a.m.  He gets up, has breakfast at 8 a.m.  He doesn't have to drive to school,  he just goes to the office.  But he starts class.  When he gets out at noon, he makes himself lunch.  He goes into the gym, goes on the treadmill  for half an hour, gets some exercise.  Now after that, he gets to game a little bit  and then he goes and then he does homework  and he'll go into the office at night  after dinner and do homework.  So that's the real challenge is the discipline.  Because you're not, you're not regimented.  You don't have the structure that you would have  if you had to go to school and be in school  and it's time for lunch and you go to the cafeteria  and all that stuff, it's homework hour or whatever.  But he has that discipline, which is remarkable.  And I would bet that's the hardest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and surprisingly as a remote worker,  I've worked remotely since 2008, five?  I can't remember, a long time, 2005.  Wow.  It's that discipline.  You have that discipline, yeah.  Which I don't have right now at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What helps, as a reporter, what was helpful is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always was on a constant deadline.  So you can't slack off for an hour and chill, right?  Because you're constantly producing news.  So I think it's harder to be disciplined  when you're not on the hook for,  the flip side is I worked way too much  and I burnt myself out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, that's the other side, isn't it?  It can actually go the other direction  where you work too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because if you're a reporter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's always, I mean, there's not always a news report.  But in any job, if you're working at home,  there's no governor in either direction.  You can either work too little or you can work too hard.  It's hard to work a normal amount when you're working at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to work, as a manager,  for a time I was an editor working and overseeing people  and it was hard as a manager to,  you had to really touch base with people  and communicate very clearly with them.  This is enough, this isn't enough.  I think you're working too hard.  And that is really a skill that many managers don't have.  In journalism, it's a skill that journalists  have to have, and I think that's a skill  that most people don't have.  I mean, I was a terrible manager.  I mean, I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not for the same reason as all the other terrible managers,  but it's not a profession.  I'm gonna generalize that and say most people,  and I'm gonna include myself, are terrible managers.  That is a, managing people is a skill set  that is not common.  Yes.  A good manager is hard to find, honestly.  I don't think that's a common skill at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my goodness, y'all, Hawaii just said,  oh no, that was Tuesday.  Okay, good.  Said, please don't come to our island.  Yeah, they're close to Hawaii.  Don't come on vacation here for 30 days, yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Puerto Rico is trying to do the same thing.  They were doing okay and people coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My son is in Bali.  I said, are you on the island?  He said, yeah.  I said, stay there.  Jesus.  He's not gonna be able to come home, I don't think.  He was in Vietnam and he said,  they're getting very hostile to tourists here.  I can't go into shops or restaurants.  So he left, went to Bali where,  apparently the party never stops.  Yeah, there it is.  There's the island right in the middle there.  But he says, I'm gonna get really good at surfing.  But on the other hand,  nobody's doing any distancing or anything.  And there are cases there, of course.  There's nowhere safe.  Let's do, get those trumpets ready, Kevin,  because I think this would be a good time  to do the Google Change Log.  The Google Change Log.  Here's what's new from the Google.  And despite the fact that they're all working at home,  they actually, there's quite a bit going on.  If you are using Google Advanced Protection, as I am,  they are strengthening the protection.  They're making Google's Play Protect scanning,  which is their anti-malware scan on Android,  a mandatory switch.  And you can no longer sideload on Android  if you have Advanced Protection.  You can't uncheck that box that says  only download from the Google Play Store.  That box is permanent.  And I don't think that's a bad thing.  They set up Advanced Protection  after the hack of the DNC four years ago,  saying there's some people like, you know,  the head of the DNC who need to be extra protected.  And so it involves the use of security keys,  physical security keys.  And there's a lot of things you can't do.  And now they've added two more things.  Google Lens is gonna be at work on New York Times Magazine's  annual music issue.  Is that coming up this week?  I guess it is this Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll be able to-  This is so 2002.  I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only, just all you have to do is wear a headset.  And the music will come to life.  Oh, Jesus.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah, so who's gonna do this?  Point their phone at a picture in the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a Dutch company that did this for publications.  I mean, about 15 years ago.  Yeah.  I met them.  They were really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was super cool.  And they put them in advertisements in magazines.  I remember them.  I met with them at South by Southwest,  Two Years in a Row.  Right, right.  But it was so cumbersome.  Yeah.  It was just like, I mean, when I'm reading a magazine,  I'm reading a dang magazine.  I'm not-  Stacey, are you old enough to remember to know the QCAT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, the QCAT.  Yes, yes.  I am.  I have one somewhere in my museum.  But just barely.  This, the idea was you'd go to Radio Shack  and you'd get this free barcode scanner  and you'd plug it into the USB port in your computer.  And as you're reading a magazine-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, not USB.  Oh no, no, no, no, USB didn't exist.  It was serial.  It was a serial port.  It was serial.  It was your audio ports or something weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know the guy who invented it.  And yeah, it was something weird, wasn't it?  And you'd be reading a magazine.  Oh look, there's a link in the magazine,  which nowadays I think most people just type it in.  But no, you scan it.  Your computer browser launches  and there you are on the page.  Because no one's going to want to type in these ooo-erls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a QR code, a QR code basically.  It is a QR code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which also hasn't worked either, but fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not here, but in China, QR codes are like, flip, flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you see them, Jeff?  but I think that we're all over subway ads and stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  QR codes.  I have never seen a single soul on the subway.  Really?  Never.  Scanning a...  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you'd get blasted out of the car.  I love QR codes.  I scan them all the time.  I do too.  I do too.  Maybe you're just old and cranky and a New Yorker.  New Yorkers, you know what?  It's the act of scanning.  Makes you look like you're interested in something  and New Yorkers could never be interested in something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Jeff, who's this month's Miss Nickerbacher?  Even I, I guess you're not old enough for that either.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all I remember from the subway then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They used to have Miss Subway.  Miss Subway, yeah.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they used to have ads.  Actually, get ready.  There's going to be a lot more of this AR style stuff  because Apple released, weirdly, Apple announced,  and this is kind of the change log, but for Apple.  Apple announced that they're closing all their stores  worldwide, except for the China stores,  which are now reopened.  So you can't go into an Apple store for the duration.  They now say, by the way, instead of like May 15th,  they say until further notice,  which is to me not a good sign.  That is not great.  Not a good sign.  They announced new iPads today, a new MacBook Air today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm very upset about this.  Why?  They're saying it has LiDAR.  That's well okay.  It does not have LiDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so that's my point.  So the new iPad Pros will now have better cameras  and a depth of field sensor.  It's not LiDAR?  They're calling it LiDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is Apple's marketing.  Unless they have done some amazing Apple magic,  which maybe they have, this is not LiDAR.  LiDAR is much higher resolution.  It's incredibly expensive.  You could not put it on a machine this big.  All right, sorry.  It would drain the batteries.  And this is a time of flight.  This has to be time of flight.  And I wish that someone would actually ask Apple about this  because the Apple marketing machine  is just going into overdrive and I think they're wrong.  Wouldn't be the first time.  It's not actual LiDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say, I'm gonna quote,  LiDAR, light detection and ranging,  is used to determine distance  by measuring how long it takes light  to reach an object and reflect back.  Yeah, that's time of flight.  It's so advanced, it's being used by NASA  for the next Mars landing mission.  And now it's been engineered to fit in the...  With Tang.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's been engineered.  And Velcro and space pens.  It's now been engineered to fit in the thin and light iPad Pro.  The custom designed LiDAR,  they're using LIDAR,  although they don't see a trademark next to it.  Scanner uses direct time of flight  to measure reflected light from up to five meters away,  both indoors and out.  It works, oh, get ready for this, at the photon level.  Operates at nanosecond speeds  and opens up tremendous possibilities  for augmented reality and beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You quarantine whoever wrote this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So time of flight is not necessarily LiDAR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LiDAR, they use the same basic science,  which is like, I'm sending out light.  LiDAR sends out a laser.  And I believe, and I have to go back to my notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I doubt this is a laser, right?  This is just a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you want to,  those are lightest photons, y'all.  So it sends out light  and it usually it is omnidirectional.  The ones on cars are omnidirectional.  Those are the big hunky things you see on top of a car.  They rotate really fast.  So you have a 3D image, yeah.  They're higher resolution.  They need a source of power.  They're not efficient.  And their frame rates are usually slower because,  again, it takes a lot of computing power  to resolve the image and do all that math.  So in time of flight sensors work a similar way.  You flash the light.  So you do pulses of light.  You flash the light.  The light comes back and you take the reading  and you do the math that says,  this flash of light was this far away.  This flash of light was that far away.  And then you create an image  of what the light is bouncing off of,  kind of like sonar or something.  Yeah, it's like sonar for light.  It's actually not,  but we're not gonna get into all of that because...  It's like sonar for light.  I made that same conclusion.  Look it, this is how it works, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, because it's on the Apple website.  Ooh, zoom in and lidar.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  Can you do that at home?  I wonder if it works backwards.  Oh, it does, look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so what would you call it?  I mean, isn't that what was in...  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time of flight sensor.  It's in the freaking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lighthouse.  Remember that lighthouse thing we had,  the security thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was also in the lighthouse, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a time of flight sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now I will say it is possible  because Apple has a lot of very smart geniuses  locked away in their spaceship.  I call them wizards.  Wizards, whichever.  They may have figured out a way to cram lidar  into a cost-effective, battery-efficient power package  and put it on a computer that only costs...  How much does this cost again?  Yeah, that's not lidar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if they did that...  They do say it's unsurpassed innovation.  Well, let me see what the...  If I go to the tech specs,  I wonder if they're a little more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin and I looked at this this morning.  He and I spent a lot of time.  Xbox used time of flight as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and that's the company, by the way, Apple bought.  The Israeli company that created the Xbox...  PrimeSense, is that it?  Yeah, PrimeSense.  Yeah, they're an Israeli company.  And they're the ones who created the Kinect,  time of whatever flight sensor for Microsoft.  And in fact, that was kind of part of the problem  with the Kinect is the company that made it  end up going to work for Apple.  So you're right.  It's probably the same thing as in the Kinect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I imagine it's a much newer version.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just looking at the specs.  Well, good news.  You're gonna see many more of these New York Times  musical dancing flowers in your iPad,  because I think there'll be a lot more augmented reality  going through the iPad.  So that really isn't part of the change log, but...  I thought it was a fun conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, we got nowhere to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not in a hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm making meatballs tonight.  I don't know about you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, yum.  Actually, Google Maps is also making live view  augmented reality navigation more prominent.  I like this.  I like, oh, have you used it?  Cause I like the idea of when I walk.  I love the idea.  Yeah, cause I never know whether, especially in Manhattan,  I come out the door at the townite center  for entrepreneurial journalism.  And I don't know whether I should turn left  to go to Broadway or right.  I hold this thing up and it says,  oh yeah, I see the building across the street.  Go right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you gotta constantly,  and I used it last time in Milan,  but I was there a long time ago before the disease.  And then you're doing this.  It's the new dumb thing you do on the street,  cause you're having to move back and forth  for it to recognize the buildings again  when it loses sight.  Exactly, Kevin.  Um.  And, but when it works, for the 10 steps it works,  it's spectacular.  But then it gets confused again  and you're standing there in the middle  and going like this.  Oh, that's not good.  So you guys never walk anywhere,  so you don't have to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but in New York, this is exactly where I want it.  I get lost.  Yeah. Yeah.  So in the new beta of Google Maps,  the live view button appears the minute you search  for an application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  I really want it to work  because trying to use Google Maps on the foot is awful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of misleading fake news,  Google updates its discover feed  to let you flag misleading articles.  That's a good thing.  I find myself often deleting sources  from the Google news suggestions.  For some reason they would like to give me crappy stuff.  It's such a weird thing.  Yeah, it's just algorithmic.  It's the problem with algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  Well, because I ever looked, now I get absolutely,  there's a huge series of things written about frequent flier  that I am anymore.  Yeah, the points guy stuff, yeah.  Yeah, the points guy.  So I get every one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, get this.  I must have searched for sourdough  because for some reason almost every day  I get an article about sourdough bread.  There's news in sourdough?  Yes.  Actually, there was an article  in the Washington Post today.  I went to bread camp to take my sourdough loaves  to the next level.  Here's what I learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know about the sourdough library?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but that's a great idea.  I just started a sourdough starter this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Search for Puratos, P-U-R-A-T-O-S dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're very famous, of course,  just down the road a piece in San Francisco.  Boudin has had its starter for its sourdough loaves  for 150 years since the gold miners came here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need to go do this.  Yeah, there it is.  Purato.  So go to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do they do?  They have a library.  That's by the way exactly what my starter looks like.  I even have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's easy.  Search for sourdough library.  It'll go right to the page.  I don't know where it is here.  I'm there, but I don't know.  Slash next generation.  So I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a library.  Search, do what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not doing it.  It's not me, it's Kevin.  Search Kevin.  Search for sourdough library.  It'll take you to the right to that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  I started a sourdough starter in January of this year, Stacy.  And it is so luscious and tangy.  There's the sourdough library.  I feed it every day.  You know what?  I put a little rye in it at one point  to really get it zinged up.  Apparently rye flour makes a good kind of feed  for your starter.  It's so good.  How often do you bake bread?  Well, more often than I should.  I actually put it in the freezer.  I put it in the freezer last week  because I said normally I bake it once a week.  Thursday's my bread baking day.  Oh, click on the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Click on the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this the curator of the sourdough library?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the sourdough library.  Every one of those is a different sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot of refrigerator space to dedicate to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those of you who do not have the chance  to visit us for real,  we have now turned the library into a virtual place.  So please enter, take a look around  and discover everything. There's geeks of everything.  about the fantastic world of sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you buy the starters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be cool.  So the whole thing about sourdough  is it's getting its yeast.  Jesus Christ, where's this guy?  It's getting its yeast from the air  and there's different yeasts in the air.  Right.  So they actually talk about the terroir of sourdough  just as they would with wine.  We're in the wine country up here.  So I think we have a very nice sourdough.  I should ship you some of mine  and you could ship me some of yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I literally just started mine.  We're actually using it as a science project.  Oh, that's good.  I'm happy to ship you some, but we made two recipes.  One, the New York Times sourdough starter recipe  that involves pineapple juice  and the other is just flour and water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, it's flour and water for me  and you just leave it out a little bit  because it's gonna get it from the air  and it develops over time.  You have to feed it.  And I mind that it tastes so good and it's unique.  That's why you have to have a library  because it's different.  Everybody has a different flavor.  I just really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you take a jar like the sourdough library has there,  how much do you actually use of each ton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  250 grams in the recipe I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it replicates on its own or how do you keep going?  Yeah, because every time you feed it, it gets bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually end up throwing out a lot of it  because it grows.  I actually, you know what I just did, Stacey?  I had it in these mason jars with the lid  and I actually labeled it.  I even gave it a name.  I called it Liz because I made one called Bernie  and one called Liz.  I should have made one called Joe.  I blew it.  But anyway, but now I, you know, do you know those,  I love these crocks with French mustard in them,  the grain mustard Moutard de Meaux  and they used to have cork caps.  Now they make red plastic caps.  But I thought that's a, I had one.  That's a good sourdough holder.  A crock of starter.  A crock of starter.  So that's where my starter is now.  It's, I have, anyway.  I've given it to friends.  It's a wonderful gift.  Here's some sour fermenting dough.  Enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guarantee you like half of them throw it away  and the other half like two days,  two years after they throw it away,  they're like, oh, I wish I kept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cause that would have been two years old now.  You can freeze it.  You don't have to keep it alive and feed it.  It'll freeze perfectly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you read Robin Sloan?  It wasn't his best book,  but have you read Sourdough by Robin Sloan?  No.  He's the guy who wrote Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore.  Oh, cool.  And the book on sourdough is,  it's about robots and making sourdough bread  and it's just, it's delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Peratto is a Sicilian wine maker.  And so the bread starter's a sideline,  but in the wine, they say in the wine country,  that's where you get the best starters  cause of the grapes.  Just saying.  Boy, we really are,  we're just wandering all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like we haven't talked about anything  from Google.  Let's have a change.  No, I'm doing the change log.  Are we done?  We're in the middle of the change log.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're in the middle of Google land.  Yeah, Google translate games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Real time, we're on Google island.  Gains real time transcribe mode on Android.  I love this feature.  Love it.  And now it's in translate.  So that means you could transcribe a language  you don't know.  There you have it.  I mean, I don't know if we don't have to go on with it,  but there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, play games as they hinted,  adding a friends list for play together.  I was like, that'll be perfect right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Google launches its work with Chromebook badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that pretty much anything with USB-C?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not necessarily.  I mean, this is good.  So you'll know if you're buying an accessory,  if it'll work with your Chromebook.  Yeah, it might be just a little,  a little moneymaker, a little sideline for them.  Oh, you were talking about this Google play games hints.  And adding a friends list for a new play together feature.  You know, that was one of the things we talked about  yesterday on iOS today, since a lot of us,  you know, pickle balls, one thing,  but a lot of us like to get together with friends  and play board games and things.  And there's a program called House Party,  which runs on iOS and Android.  Have you ever played, you,  I know Stacey, you've played heads up.  Have you played that game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The game where you have the head,  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, we play that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So fun.  So you put on your, you put the game on your phone  and it'll show a name of somebody like Andre Agassi.  And then you can't see it because it's on your forehead.  And everybody, all the people in the group are trying to  tell without, it's like password,  without saying Andre Agassi, he's a tennis player.  He's, and you're trying to guess it.  If you get it right, you go down and it goes to the next one.  If you get it, if you want to skip it, you go up.  It's a very fun game.  You can buy packs and stuff.  So that's in house party.  So you can play if you're, you know,  you and your daughter are stuck  and you want to play with her friends.  Here we are playing house party on iOS today.  That's Micah and his friend, Elizabeth.  Isn't that cute?  I think it's really, it's a better way,  actually better way to play heads up.  I think they have some other games in there too.  So play together, I guess is going to be a,  a new feature we'll see in Google play games,  stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  Isn't that cool?  Yeah, cause I was thinking how I wanted like a chat roulette  for games, right?  During this time of sadness.  So like, imagine if you could just like click through  and maybe you're in the middle of a bingo game  and you can join in or charades or whatever that game is  where you stick everybody famous in a bowl and.  Yeah, exactly.  So I was like, oh, I need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm just saying.  This is, we're all, you know, stuck inside  quarantining ourselves.  This would be fun.  You could play house party with friends  and kind of get some sort of, I'd like to see more,  you know, there's some really fun card games  with special decks.  There's Carcassonne and the other new style board games.  There's so much fun.  I'd love to see more of that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to do some of that though with.  Yeah, online.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were, we were trying to think about having playing  like Carcassonne or we were trying to figure out bridge.  Doesn't work.  That's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause you're too young for bridge.  I'm too young for bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey's an old soul in a young body.  I thought it'd be a good time to learn bridge.  And then I realized it would not.  Why?  Because it's actually a good game.  My in-laws play bridge.  Oh, that's a great game.  They tried to teach me it's, it's actually not a bad game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My poor parents tried a million times.  I can't do that in cricket.  I cannot get my head around.  I just can't.  They're both pretty complicated.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cricket with the wickets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the wickets.  Cricket.  Cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or no, cricket with the.  Okay.  Cricket.  Cricket with a bat in the English.  The fake baseball game.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes on five years each game.  Yeah.  You know who's a huge cricket fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai.  Oh yeah.  Oh, he loves the cricket.  Google Hangouts.  There's.  Now I know we're not supposed to use Hangouts.  I'm a Google Fi subscriber.  It's the, it's the only messaging application I can use.  It runs everywhere.  I love Google Hangouts.  They haven't updated it.  They're now removing stuff.  Bit by bit, they're going to take this thing apart.  They're going to tear off little pieces.  Here's Ron Amadio's article.  They're now taking out that really handy feature.  Send my location.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really distressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually, should I do a name drop here?  Humblebrain?  Sure.  I used that with Steve Martin.  Whoa.  I was visiting New York  and I was supposed to go over to their place for dinner.  And I said, well, where are you?  And he dropped a pin.  And then I dropped a pin because I was walking saying,  well, here's, I'm walking here.  Here's where I am.  I'm walking here.  He's quite a nerd.  And we celebrated our nerdiness when I got there.  He said, see, I did the, I said, yeah, I did the.  No more Steve, sorry.  Google launches Android 11 developer preview two  with foldable call screening  and neural networks API improvements.  Huh?  Huh.  You know what else was abandoned where for the longest time?  Remember Google bought Snapseed, which was the most,  I might have, yeah, we moved on.  That was it.  That was the headline.  That's all I'm gonna say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  I just was like foldable.  What's foldable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, cause they're supporting foldable phones now,  like the Z Flip and this Galaxy Fold and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it.  There was actually interesting things there, but okay.  Go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we can go back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  You go ahead and I'll read it in my own sweet time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She just loves the word neural network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did.  Okay.  Neural network API.  I knew what you wanted.  I know.  I was like, what are they?  Is this BS or is this not?  I know what you were looking for.  Yeah.  5G experiences, people in conversation improvements,  neural network API 1.30.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nevermind.  Meanwhile, Snapseed, which was an excellent program,  Google bought it, gave it away for free.  It's the best photo editor.  I think it's wonderful.  Android and iOS.  Hasn't been updated in like two years.  They just updated it.  Snapseed.  So it's not dead yet.  This is what we're reduced to.  Celebrating a minor update to Snapseed,  but at least it's alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The neural networks API is actually pretty cool.  Okay, tell us about it.  It lets you run neural networks on your cell phone.  So you can, as a developer, you can tap into this  if you have something that you wanna do,  run in a neural network basically.  Oh, that's cool.  And this'll do it in a way that is more battery efficient  and help you out.  So that's actually kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm done.  Actually, there's one more story  that's like the house party story.  There's a new Google Chrome extension, Netflixparty.com,  that lets you watch Netflix with friends online.  It synchronizes video playback and adds group chat.  So when you're watching a show  and you wanna watch it with friends, Netflixparty.com,  there's a Patreon page so you can support it.  I think this is a great idea and perfect timing.  Facebook did this with Watch like two years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's so, everybody has Netflix, right?  So, I mean, how-  My parents don't.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, every time they tell me this  because I'm constantly forgetting, I'm like,  how do you live in the world?  We have Amazon Prime.  I'm like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gave my mom-  Have you seen the new season of Babylon Berlin?  No, I'm so excited.  Is it good?  I have just started watching, just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, word of warning, it's in German.  Jeff speaks German, so he doesn't mind.  No, very badly.  Do not watch the dubbed version.  There is one, it's awful.  Watch the subtitled one.  So, there is subtitles and some people don't like reading  while they're watching TV.  But it is a great show about 1920s Berlin.  It's a crime show, murder mystery show.  And it's kind of interesting historically,  it's based on a series of novels,  very popular in Germany, I'm told,  that there are, I think there's eight or nine of them.  They go through the 20s,  leading up to the, through the ascendancy of Hitler.  So, the first season was just the beginning  of the Nazi party.  So, that's kind of the backdrop of it,  which makes it very, I think, really good.  And it's the most expensive TV show ever made  outside of the US.  Very, they put a lot of money into it.  And it shows, man, it shows.  It's really well done, I thought.  Yeah, I can't wait to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called Babylon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Babylon Berlin. Babylon Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's on Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish it were better known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's, yeah, when you have nothing to do  and you're locked inside, it's kind of the perfect show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you watch Westworld Sunday night?  No. No.  You don't care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we're over Westworld.  Now that they've left the park, we don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a whole new world.  I kind of liked it,  because they're finally out of the park.  I tried, okay, so I know it's coming on Sunday night.  Saturday night, I said, all right, I care.  It's too complicated, I can't remember what happened.  I tried, I watched two different YouTube super cuts  where they attempt to explain in chronological order,  because the show does not happen in chronological order,  what happened in Westworld season one and two.  It took 15 minutes of very fast talking  and I was more baffled at the end than before.  That show is insane, but they threw that all out.  All you have to know is the robots got out  and now what happens?  So if I never watched the rest of it,  I can watch now?  You could take over.  You just don't watch it now?  Oh, absolutely.  Here's what you need to know.  There was an amusement park created,  well, you already know, you saw the Yule Brenner movie.  Amusement park created where robots play roles.  You get to go and role play with them as a human.  You can't get hurt.  Eventually though, what happens in the Westworld saga  is the robots become sentient and realize,  eh, this sucks.  They keep killing us and we can't kill them.  They rise up, they kill everybody, all humans,  and one of them escapes with the personality balls  of five more, because it's all in a little globe  in the back of their head.  And now she's wreaking havoc in the,  and it's the distant future.  It's like a couple hundred years in the future,  but it's cool.  And, you know, I think it's pretty good.  At least I only saw one episode, it was pretty good.  It's nothing like the first two episodes  which were impossible to follow.  And I like Jonathan Nolan, but phew.  All right, and that is your Google Change Log.  Plus a lot of stuff having nothing to do with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's us.  Because we don't care.  We have nowhere to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the new Change Log Plus.  All right, she's got dinner or something.  She has the meatballs to go to.  We got meatballs.  Let me, there's actually a bunch of good news  I'm going to run through, shall I?  Real quickly.  Let's talk about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Particular Google story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one is not, but it's really cool.  The Uncensored Library.  So Reporters Without Borders  did something kind of amazing.  Of course, as you know,  journalism is censored in many countries  all around the world.  They created a Minecraft level.  By the way, it is gorgeous.  It is.  12 and a half million Minecraft bricks.  It's called the Uncensored Library.  You can wander around.  You can put it on your own server if you want.  And the reason they did this  is the countries that block journalism  and Facebook and Twitter and all that,  don't block Minecraft.  Why would anybody block Minecraft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good.  So you can go in there and read censored books,  read censored news, because it's in the library,  including a whole section about Khashoggi,  which of course, I'm sure you can't read anything  about Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia.  Jamal Khashoggi, the murdered  Saudi Arabian journalist.  There is a whole Khashoggi tribute in there.  There's also stuff from an Egyptian news site  that reports on corruption  has been blocked in Egypt for three years.  There's stories from a blocked Russian site  that reports on protests and activism.  What a good idea.  And I actually downloaded it,  because I have a Minecraft server  and I want to put it on there.  But you can log in.  There's links in the various articles.  And all you have to do is have the Minecraft,  the Java bedrock version of Minecraft,  and you can go into the server and read.  And I think that's brilliant.  I think it's brilliant.  That's good news.  Here's some more good news.  The Turing Prize has been awarded.  A $1 million, it's kind of the Nobel Prize of computing.  $1 million prize.  Times wants me to log in.  I'm a member.  You always forget me, New York Times.  You always forget me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are forgetful, the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me log in real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not as bad as the Wall Street Journal or Wired.  Good Lord, Wired, I just stopped subscribing to them.  It's Condi, I know.  I'm like, you're just making it too hard.  I actually gave you money and I still can't pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not your password, it's so annoying.  Anyway, Ed Catmull and Pat Hanrahan,  who worked at Pixar and created amazing stuff,  including RenderMan, all the stuff that Pixar uses  to create computer graphics for movies.  $1 million Turing Prize.  It is the most, it's not about the money.  I'm sure Ed doesn't need the money,  but it's really about the acknowledgement  of their contribution.  The Turing Award, the Nobel Prize of computing  from the Association of Computing Machinery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um.  Wasn't that funded by?  ACM?  No, that was the Russian funded it.  That was different.  How about Durov?  No, no, I don't think so.  No, no, no, not Howevel, but nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some oligarch?  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook has set up a time server  that instead of being off by 10 milliseconds,  I mean, 100 milliseconds is only off by 10 milliseconds,  or less.  We don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, are we talking about timing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, time servers.  NTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just read a story about that.  Yes, it was an IEEE interview about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me about it.  You are now the expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I don't know about the Facebook one yet  because I haven't read it,  but I get so excited about timing  because it's crucial.  Timing is essential to everything we do on the internet.  And so I tweeted it to book market for later, basically.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Yeah, so apparently it's a super precise,  and NTP is the network time protocol.  You probably are syncing to it with your computer.  That's pretty typically what happens.  They've improved the accuracy of their time server  from 10 milliseconds to 100 microseconds.  Wow.  Whoa.  That's pretty dang accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, my friend from my editor at IEEE Spectrum  where I write, she sent me the article on Judah Levine,  Levine, who invented NTP because I said I like this.  Oh, that's neat.  So here's a story.  I'll throw this in the chat room for super nerds.  The big challenge, of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care if my computer's 10 milliseconds off.  The big challenge though is because of latency  getting that accurate.  Get it down to 100 microseconds.  I don't know how they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, timing is so important all across the internet.  Think about all of their databases  that are trying to get synced.  Think about things like geolocation, tracking satellites,  and as we put more devices on the internet  and start collecting data for them,  especially devices that are moving,  we're gonna have to have a much better sense of timing.  And it's super nerdy, but if it gets off track,  everything goes to hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bad things happen.  I have to allow this in my Facebook container on Firefox.  Firefox won't let me go to time.facebook.com, but you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I dropped a link in for the thing on NTP's founder  and then the link in the IEEE for the Facebook new timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said NNTP, which I think is the newsgroup's server.  It's NTP.  Oh, NTP.  NTP, I said it wrong.  You said it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry, I heard you say NTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just said, I stuttered.  Oh, and look, we have a Floss Weekly all about NTP.  If you really wanna get geeky.  NTP, we need it.  It's actually had a problem with the surfer software  that allowed, as I remember, amplification attacks.  It was a problem.  I'm sure they fixed that by now.  T-Mobile is getting emergency access  to Dish's 600 megahertz spectrum.  This was something they gave up  as part of the merger with Sprint,  but in our current crisis, they're gonna get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay.  That's good spectrum right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the good stuff.  That's the good stuff.  T-Mobile calls it 5G.  Technically it is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they're deploying the GSMA,  Yeah, they are.  GSMA 5G standard.  Technically they are.  Over that spectrum, that's fine.  It's just not that fast, but it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2B, do you watch 2B?  Every time I say, I talk about cord cutting  and I always get emails from people who say,  Leo, you say cord cutting isn't a good idea.  I don't, I love cord cutting, but I say mostly  it's just giving you the satisfaction  of sticking it to the man.  You probably aren't gonna save any money  because by the time you buy the bandwidth  and Netflix and Amazon Prime and YouTube TV or whatever,  you're gonna end up spending the same amount  you would spend with a cable company.  But he says, my correspondent,  but Leo, don't you know about 2B?  T-U-B-I, it's a streaming over the top  ad supported service that's free.  20,000 movies and shows you don't wanna watch,  but it's free and there's ads in it you don't wanna watch,  but it's free.  25 million users right now.  Fox, which doesn't, Fox does,  not 21st Century Fox, which Disney bought.  Fox doesn't have a streaming platform.  So they just bought 2B for $440 million.  So there.  Lachlan Murdoch said, importantly,  coupled with the combined power of Fox's existing networks,  you know what they are.  2B.  Tell me they're not gonna have a news network part of it.  Yeah, I'm guessing they are.  Provides a substantial base  from which we will drive long-term growth  in the direct to consumer arena.  It's challenging, you know, Fox, MSNBC and CNN have problem  because they need the cable companies, right?  That's really 90% of their audience  is coming through your cable.  But they'd love to go over the top.  They'd love to eliminate giving Comcast and Cox  and Charter all the money.  They'd love to just go over the top.  Actually, it's the other way.  But actually, it is the other way, right?  Fox Charter.  Charter pays for MSNBC,  but they would like to just get the money directly from you.  That's what I'm saying.  And they can maybe make a little bit more.  But they can't go over the top  because almost always, I know this from Tech TV,  their deals were saying,  you can't stream more than 10 minutes or whatever.  So, but maybe this is the beginning, you know?  Maybe they'll make a special Fox, streaming Fox,  something like that.  I have nothing more to say.  Do you have any stories I missed  that I should have said something about?  Let's see here.  The German military laptop that was sold on eBay  with classified data.  Hmm.  Security researchers bought a Bundeswehr laptop  for just 90 euros.  Good deal.  Inside documents on a mobile missile system  used by the German armed forces.  Looks like a good laptop too, doesn't it?  Good, decent German construction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks like some compact I owned years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's definitely mil-spec.  Definitely, definitely mil-spec.  Any other stories?  Let's see here.  We did it.  Oh, we do have a picture of Miss Subways.  Didn't they also have Miss Knickerbocker?  I thought the beer, Knickerbocker beer,  they put up a poster in the subway  with Miss Knickerbocker every month.  There's Miss Subways.  See the girls on telepoles and vote  for our loveliest subway rider.  Miss Subway.  Oh, I think Stacey hung up on me after that.  I probably deserved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Off to make meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she just leave?  Did she wave goodbye?  Oh, here she comes.  Jeff, a number for us please.  Oh, a number, a number, a number, okay.  A number, number, number, number.  Number, number, number, number, number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see, let's see, what's we're gonna do?  Scroll down.  Okay.  Oh, I know what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna do a fun one.  So do you know Choir Choir Choir?  No.  Choir Choir Choir is wonderful.  A Canadian based group that takes over large spaces  and invites sometimes a couple thousand people to come  and all then they teach them all to sing the same song.  Oh, that's neat.  And they do.  Kind of like a flash mob.  Kinda, yeah, but with a little more training and effort.  And it's a lot of fun.  It's really, really great.  Those two guys right in front of that picture you have there  are the mobsters.  Oh, I would do this in a heartbeat.  I'd love to do this.  It's why I'd love to do it.  They do it in Canada, they do it elsewhere.  But huge, huge crowds singing something great.  Well now they can't do crowds.  What, oh.  So they went on to Facebook last night.  That's why I was on Facebook,  because I was watching them just singing  and then people were putting up their own Facebooks  as they're singing along.  It was really pretty great.  And there was their Distance sing along.  I can't play any of these videos, unfortunately.  I know, it's killing me.  So it's not a good number to do.  But Choir Choir Choir is choir times three.  That's why I figured it was a number.  And they're gonna do it again Saturday.  Oh, good.  So Saturday afternoon.  Let's all sing.  I'm waiting for the image of Leo at home singing along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was really, that was the origination of Musically,  which then got bought by TikTok.  Was people lip syncing and singing along.  Stacey is back.  Sorry about that.  I don't know what happened there.  No, it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I accidentally hung up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were mad at me.  Accidentally, sure.  I was like, oh, it's Ogling Women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Done.  It was history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's history.  So what, stop it, go away.  What is your Stacey's thing of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's actually a place.  This is Skype a Scientist.  Go to skypeascientist.com.  It's not an exciting website,  but what it is is if you sign up there as a parent  or as a scientist, you will get on an email list  and they will email you the topics for each week.  So this week we had, oh yeah, what did we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so this would be additional to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is teaching your kids,  it's probably, it's younger kids, but even adults.  Let me just pull up the schedule.  I watched one about giant rats.  Oh, geez, Stacey.  For animal communication,  it was a scientist who works with giant rats  in studies like how animals communicate with one another.  It was really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are ones about-  In New York, if I may, if I may stay,  there is a rat academy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The health department holds  the regular rat academy training.  So if you really wanna get into rats, this is your path.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so this week was-  Sorry, Stacey.  Is it March 18th?  No, that's okay.  How does animal behavior affect infectious disease  with Nick Kaiser?  He studies behavioral disease ecology.  So, and then there's March 19th,  which is tomorrow at noon Eastern,  there's a paleontologist who's going to talk about fossils.  Some of the other ones are ants, zookeeping,  poop, corvids, bats.  Chuck Wendig is hosting a book club.  There's a book club on-  I love science.  The moon.  So you can sign up if you're a scientist to do a session,  but if your kids are home from school,  they can participate via Skype if you sign up for this,  which why wouldn't you?  I mean, you may not do everyone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's kind of fun.  I love that.  And so it's a big group and then the scientists presents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the scientists presents.  I don't know if you can ask,  I think you could ask questions in the chat.  I didn't pay attention because I was watching the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't have-  Again, this would be so much harder  if we didn't have the internet.  And honestly, this is an opportunity at this point  to take some time and learn something  or just to broaden your horizons.  Karsten had a pick.  I'm going to give him a pick of the week  because he's stuck at home.  It's one I completely agree with.  Harvard's world famous introduction to computing class,  CS50, is online for free.  In fact, I've been desperately,  I actually signed up for it.  I've taken a few of it.  It's really, really, really, really good.  And I've actually been trying to get Michael  and his buddies to do this  because they have some interest in this.  You can get AP credit if you're a high schooler.  You could also, I guess, take it for a certificate at EDX,  which is where it is, edx.org,  which is, by the way, a great place.  Created by Harvard at MIT for online education.  They do a really good job.  And this is videos of the CS50 courses,  but it's also worksheets, problem sets, and stuff.  So it's not passive.  You can really get involved.  I enjoy it a lot.  These guys are really good instructors.  It moves fast.  Remember, Harvard kids are smarter than us Yale kids.  So it moves pretty darn fast.  But if you can keep up, I think it's really worthwhile.  I think if I wanted to do it as kind of the syllabus for,  and I would take some time then to talk with them  and do problems and help them along.  So if you wanted to teach some kids,  this is a really good way to do it.  Or learn for yourself CS50.  And do check out everything at EDX.  They have some great classes,  including the best programming course, How to Code,  which is a really fabulous course.  But a lot of courses in a lot of different subjects.  That's Karsten's pick, CS50,  Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science.  Karsten, we miss you.  Did you take, Karsten, did you take CS50  when you were in school there?  Nobody, nobody's there.  Nobody, nobody there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten's like, see y'all later, I got things to do.  No, no, he's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he can't come in.  Next week, can you just put up a stick with a bow tie on it?  Yeah, that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wanted a Karsten cam, I vetoed that.  Maybe we can put a stick with a bow tie.  No, he's at home.  He's participating, he's producing.  But he is at home.  I miss his snark.  That's not all I miss.  Oh, and then I had a pick which I don't,  I just heard about, I'm not yet doing it,  but I'm curious about it.  Around.co, quick high impact video calls  for a new era of work.  They've just coming out of a private beta  into a public beta, which you could sign up for, I have.  And if you get into it, you can invite your colleagues.  It says, we took video meetings and made them less,  less intrusive, less clunky.  A clearer view of your teammates  while making space for work.  This is the interesting thing.  The camera framing is AI based.  So you don't have to worry about your background.  It follows, it finds your face as you move,  craps out clutter, crops out clutter  and other background distractions.  So you don't have to worry about laundry  or your bed unmade.  Auto mute from no dog barking, no washing machines.  It sounds really interesting.  Multiple laptops, all mics on in the same place, no echo.  That's always been a problem for Lisa and me.  I have to go in another room  if we're on a conference call together.  But this looks really interesting.  Now I only can say I haven't tried it.  I like the idea.  It looks pretty snazzy.  It is around.co and I have signed up.  And look, you get a little round dot  with nothing else around there, which means it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're looking for, we now,  Google has been very generous with the features added  for Hangouts, which we're using for right now.  Right, but it's kind of a stodgy old interface.  Yeah, so we're a lot of push the faculty to go to Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also a stodgy interface,  though maybe a little bit better.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zoom on my phone, I really actually enjoy it  because it's got the driving mode you can move over to  and then it's very easy to mute yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of our conferences now are Zoom, but this looks good.  See, you become a little round circle ahead  so that you can still get work done.  It's really more like,  looks more like the kind of thing we all need right now,  which is ability for a team to work together,  even if they aren't physically together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it.  Obviously right now, is there much,  yeah, how much video is there with Slack?  None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they have video calling, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, I thought they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we never use the video calling,  we just use the messaging.  Yeah, they just showed that you can integrate it into Slack  and jump right into a meeting from Slack.  I thought Slack had that video.  Yeah.  They do.  But I've never used it, so.  I haven't either.  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel like Zoom is gonna have a big bump  from this COVID crisis.  A lot of people are gonna be using it to work at home.  Oh yeah.  Skype is actually on Zoom.  I should tell you that.  They call it Skype a Scientist, but it's on Zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they started it a while back.  Yeah, I know, that's right.  I was like, oh wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  Stacey Higginbotham, go have, what was it?  You're having meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm making meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With lingonberry sauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Not IKEA balls.  Just Italian style meat sauce.  So I can, because you know,  I've gotta make things that I can freeze  so we can pull stuff out when we wanna go out to dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bingo.  I have frozen, I made a giant batch  of spaghetti sauce on Monday  and a giant batch of black bean chili, vegetarian chili,  and I froze tons of it, so yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Lisa still doing the keto thing or is she normal now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a mix.  Is ice cream on keto?  No.  Okay.  She's a mix.  She's not full-time keto.  She always said to me, you shouldn't be full-time,  just do it a few days a week.  I said, yeah, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So black bean chili would be okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be, but I don't think she likes beans.  She won't eat beans.  That's the crisis we face.  Love beans.  I love beans too, and you can have a ton of them.  Keep them for years, dry them out.  I have a 20-bag pound of dried corn as well, if anybody.  From your back 40?  I was gonna make, I had a, I got an idea,  must've been in the middle of the night,  I was probably looking at Instagram,  to make my own tortillas,  so I ordered a 20-pound bag of corn  and a tortilla press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never done either of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You had the, what was it, not the pedomatic,  what was it called?  The Thermomix.  Rhodi-matic.  Oh, the Rhodi-matic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Colleen's got that.  No, those weren't very good.  They tasted kind of mechanical.  You know what my, actually my goal is,  is I gotta learn how to use this Thermomix.  I'm completely intimidated by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sign up for the intro course.  It comes with the $1,500 purchase price.  Also, if you get bored and don't want it.  I guess right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know somebody will take it.  We'll take it off your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody emailed me, said,  it's been all the rage in Switzerland  for five or six years.  I use it every day, sometimes twice a day,  and I thought, I really gotta, I gotta figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, you know what?  Here's your deal.  You got two months.  You got through like the quarantine to use this thing,  and if you don't, Leo.  I will.  This week.  I will.  I'm gonna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  That's a good threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, cause I'm really gonna show up at your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take my Thermomix, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time to take the Thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you guys going to the grocery store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did, well you kind of have to.  I mean, we did a big shop last week.  Lisa did it on a Sunday, or maybe it was Monday,  cause she doesn't want me to go to the store.  And then I guess we'll have to at some point, right?  You know, you can get it delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to keep going.  I mean, in some of the stores,  well Best Buy is actually doing delivery to the car,  but also later they're going to start allowing  only 10 to 15 people in at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well they're gonna get, we're gonna be on full shutdown.  They'll be gone.  Well you gotta buy food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta buy headsets.  Everybody in my house needs a headset now that everybody's.  The pet store is considered essential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because your poor doggy.  Doggo's gotta eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gotta eat.  Dispensaries in California are essential.  Here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you do drive through Starbucks or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No.  Steve Gibson swears he got it from a Starbucks lid.  Okay, well that's just.  He doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna have to make your own coffee, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have switched to chai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm touching my face again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay, you're in a sterile environment.  Touch away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me and my Cheez-Its are sterile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.  Stacey on iot.com.  Don't forget the iot podcast.  She's at gigastacey on Twitter.  I'm glad for one that you are stuck at home  and you can't go on those conferences  and those speaking tours.  And so you're here.  You're with us.  I'm so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that is true.  I'm so glad.  Well today is such a nice day.  I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna take a coronavirus break.  Because Wednesday is the day  that my daughter doesn't have classes.  So one day in the month of April,  I'm gonna be gone just cause.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where will you go though?  The woods?  Yeah.  Yeah, where else can you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Olympic Peninsula is an hour and a half away.  Oh yeah, just walk around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nature is the best thing for us all right now.  Just to remind you that nature is eternal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Leo, if you're on huddled in place,  whatever it's called.  Shelter in place.  Shelter in place.  Like are you gonna get stopped by the cops  from going home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there's been some conversation about that.  They say they're not gonna do that.  They haven't done it yet.  Broadcasting is an essential industry by the way.  So we're protected.  So I could just say, yeah I was doing my show.  I'm in media.  I'm okay man.  No and I think that's reasonable  because we still need information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Thank you Jeff Jarvis, Professor Jarvis.  He's the one who's got the time off  in his book line study.  So you're teaching classes from there?
