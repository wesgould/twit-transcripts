Gina Trapani is here from SmarterWear.org and the Think About Hulu and all about Android.  All about Android. All about Android. Good show last night. Oh, what is it? What it would give us one wonderful thing that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my favorite part of the show is the arena. It's the app arena. We each pick an app and then we present it.  People vote. It's a really there's just some really great some really great apps. I download apps like crazy because of that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All about Android. Go to twit.tv slash triple A and you'll find it also here from the Netherlands.  Jeff Jarvis, who's been all over the place, he was in India like three minutes ago. Hey, Jeff. Another high there. Another ridiculously short trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm here basically for a day and a half. Oh, my gosh. Oh, Jeff. Yeah, it looks pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jeff is a graduate professor of journalism at SUNY CUNY, the City University of New York, CUNY SUNY.  He's also the author of Public Parts, and he comes to us via a Chromebook Pixel.  Very nice Chromebook Pixel. But we had to modify it running Linux via a Google project called Crouton that lets us run Skype on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not Google's fault, Microsoft's fault for not doing a Web app of Skype. Well, or you could say our fault for not running Web RTC.  Or Twigs fault for not running Web RTC or Google Hangout, which we should be doing on this show of all shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think we could use a Hangout because we'd have all these little people under you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff gets to beat his chest, though, when he says that he's installed Linux on the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I didn't even put Crouton on this Pixel. I have a loaner Pixel I'm reviewing. Very similar to yours, Jeff. It's the LTE version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I'll tell you the truth.  There's dissension among the ranks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, first of all, it's hot on hell right here. But it's beautifully made. I mean, it's a nice piece of aluminum.  But I canceled my order after playing with this for one day. Just can't justify $1,600 for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I, however, being the true twigger, am living in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Drink your own champagne, my friend.  Although in this case, it's more like urine than champagne. But OK, drink it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I smell my own farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Leo doesn't like the Pixel and Jeff loves it. I was ready to really love it. I ordered it because I thought this is exciting, beautiful screen.  I still don't think the three to aspect ratio really makes a lot of sense. I guess it does for a browser only experience, maybe.  But it just feels constrained. Maybe it's my problem is I use other computers, right? If you didn't use other computers, it'd be fine.  But it feels like a little bit like a toy computer.  And we were showing you some sluggishness, particularly on it's not all pages, but on the verge dot com.  It's there's a hesitation when you try to scroll. Now they're trying to tell me it's this machine. I don't think so.  But maybe I'll go find another one and try it.  Jeff says he never sees any hesitation at all. It wouldn't surprise me, though.  I mean, I know what's in here and it's not the fastest stuff in the world. And there's not a huge amount of RAM either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here's the here's the one time it got weird on me when I was in Delhi in the hotel room where you couldn't open the windows and the air conditioning was weird.  And so it got muggy and the capacitive the scroll on both ends on the screen and the trackpad got wonky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it's muggy here because it feels sticky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's that's what that's what happened. And it was really weird. It hasn't happened since.  You know, it's a problem if you live in India, you know.  But the but the humidity caused it to go really wonky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It feels a little sticky.  You know, it's not it's not as slippery as it could be. But I mean, it's it is a beautiful screen.  It's not more beautiful than other screens on the market.  In fact, you know, the retina display and the MacBooks are roughly the same.  And I have a you know, this Windows machine I have in front of me is a, you know, 1920 by 1080 screen.  And it's probably similar resolution. Very close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'd rather have nothing than Windows, which is what I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I kind of agree with you on that. I'm figuring should I wait for Windows blue the updates  out in a few months or should I just put Linux say the hell with it and put Linux on this box?  I don't know. I don't know. So yeah, April Fool's is two days ago.  And thank God it's over. Thank a thank God it's over. Nobody likes this.  Yeah, I hate it, especially if you're a tech journalist or a journalist of any kind.  Yes, because people are making up crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's difficult for Google. I mean, Google's always been sort of dedicated to elaborate April Fool's jokes.  And and and many years like they've been pretty good. Right.  But now that they're on the spring cleaning thing where they're shutting down products,  I think that the reaction to some of the more elaborate April Fool's presentations are, well, why didn't you just keep reader open?  You know, if you dedicated the energy that you put toward exactly jokes, you know, why toward keeping reader open,  I wouldn't be scrambling to find another RSS reader.  So I felt like this year there was kind of a little little tension, a little backlash more so than in other years.  I don't know. Did you guys get that? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like you think, well, golly, they must have been working on this all year.  For instance, the YouTube shutting down video. Very nice.  Somebody put a lot of work into that. What was the best? Was it Gmail Blue? Did you like that one?  They're not that funny. Google Google knows I liked being a good joke.  I don't know if they're still doing it at Bing dot com.  If you search for Google. Yeah, it doesn't do it anymore.  You got a googly version of Bing, which is pretty funny.  They they use it as a as an opportunity to slam Google once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just like Google. They switch the design. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then instead of saying, I'm feeling lucky, what did it say?  I can't remember now, but it was pretty it was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's pretty funny. I just put up a new clip in the rundown bottom of the Google section.  The Atlantic says that we should be worried about the Google.  About the Google what? Jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Worried because it's such a I think, you know, I think what is happening, I would guess, is the engineers love them.  Right. And and Google being an engineering driven company is not going to get in the way of the engineers should they wish to, you know, have some fun.  But it's not their 20 percent. Right. I hope not. I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it just feels like, you know, this started back when Google was small and had that.  I mean, you know, pranks are part of the sort of hacker ethic. Right.  So back when Google was just kind of small and filled with a bunch of sort of, you know, mischievous engineers coming from that place, it made a lot of sense.  But, you know, Google's huge now and they've got so many resources.  And again, against the backdrop of shutting down all these other products and focusing, it's just hard to, you know, the more elaborate the video or the or the say, you know, the more you're like, this is weird.  Yeah. And this YouTube thing, what were they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're reading every description of every YouTube video ever uploaded to YouTube is nominated and we will be counting those down and they will be reviewed by our panel of judges over the next 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll be here today and for the next 12 hours and for the better part of the next two years or however long it takes to read all of the nominees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very exciting. On behalf of not very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'd like to thank you all for your hard work. This goes the dedication award goes to this because literally it's a 12 hour video.  Look at 12 hours. They live streamed something. Subscribe. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every single title and description of like 100 videos. These presenters about four hours in are thinking, oh boy, this this wasn't this wasn't a good idea.  Was it they switched out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Block Long Hong Kong Terror. Pitbull, I know you want me. Girls shoot behind the scenes.  Anyone who wants to make 20 or 30 hours a day uploading files. Oh my God, I hope they paid a lot of money for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will give you guidance. I will also give you forms. It's the same people all the way through the whole like look, we're eight and a half hours in same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now at 10, they've got to be thinking I am in hell. I've gone to hell. This is hell. I realize now this was my I'm going to kill my agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, and then just watching this, I mean, this is, you know, definitely a live stream event view is there were, you know, around 30,000 people live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Horrible, horrible, horrible. 30,000 people watch this? No, I got it. They started their browser, they went to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's over a million views on this video. Well, and then there you go. Right there. That tells you something about YouTube view counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because that's a 12 hour video. A million people didn't watch a 12 hour video. A million people watched the first 10 seconds as we have.  But you can see like he's taking a break over here. A lot of them did what we just did, which is say, well, come on, are they still there at the end? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So at the very, very end, they all take a nap. They get in bed and that's the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, and then they went home to their children and said, I'm that was I do for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So YouTube counts a view is if you push the play button, but don't finish a video that's counted as a view.  They count starts. Yeah. So it's not it doesn't have to be a complete view. Oh, gosh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, nobody knows. But I think that's pretty obvious that nobody that one point two million people didn't watch 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think we know at least that much. I was going to say, like if we have proof like that video is proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We we don't know how much they how far you have to go before they count it.  But we, you know, for instance, when we count views, we we actually count.  We're very careful not to count partial downloads or partial views. We count the full thing.  It does not have to be a complete view. And I don't think anybody's ever said that.  This was a good one. Google treasure map. Can you see my screen?  Google treasure map. I guess they probably could write a program that did this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, that's cute. Yeah, it's kind of like a map pack.  They've always they've always had a map. They did an eight bit one last year. Remember?  Yeah, they did. They've done like, well, actually, it's probably not a joke, but they've done the moon.  They've done the sea. That's real. They know joke. That's our joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I apparently live in a in a forest. That's cool.  There was a better video, a funnier video that Google did of like why we're wrapping it up and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I thought the nose video was funny. Google knows. I hate April Fools, but I had to say I chart chartled at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It is it is Google knows beta. John Woody, the Internet, most of a woolly.  I'm sorry. His books, videos, look at his nose. Is there something odd about his nose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The search experience that we'd overlooked. Our task as designers is to get our users the information they're looking for as quickly and as beautifully as possible.  But until now, we couldn't always give users what they're looking for, because sometimes they're not looking at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  My wife and I have a puppy with so much energy that we walk her five times. It's just mostly this isn't funny.  That's the problem. This is how she gets information about her world.  Photo auditory olfactory sensory convergence is a phenomenon that's been that was good science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is actually you like this. All right. I think it's true to all the other.  You know, someone has watched a lot of Google videos. Oh, yeah. It's the style.  It's definitely a style and it's deadpan. They're straight faced. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Smells from around the world. You're just being grumpy about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, and I will know. I'll defend them. I don't think if you aggregate all the all the energy put into these.  What is it? A number, a large number, which Jeff will have later of April Fool's jokes.  Even if you if you are generous, it's not going to be enough to keep Google reader alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or is it? Stop and smell the roses. Now with Google knows beta, the roses are just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know what? Here's what it is. And I've said this before.  It's just tone deaf after you kill something that's very popular like Google Reader and you get all these people complaining about it to release all of these April Fool's things just says, yeah, not only do we kill you reader, but we were just screwing around basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Popular amongst the geeks. Right. And the geeks are the ones who watch these videos. So, yeah, but it was too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, what are they going to do? We've decided to cancel April Fool's in honor of Google Reader. They can't. They're stuck. Right.  But you could see why it's not the best communication to put out. But honestly, I don't think that the amount of time put into this is enough to keep a product alive from very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is the thing. Everyone who's saying, well, why didn't they just open source reader or how much could it have really cost to maintain reader?  I don't know. It just it seems that seems seems strange to me. I mean, I think the reason part of the main reason why reader works so well is because it used Google's crawler and search technology right to detect to get those feeds and detect whether or not they changed.  And, you know, it's basically that engine, the Google Reader engine. And from what I understand was tied very closely to Google's general search engine. That's not something they could open source very, very easily.  And, you know, I guess I guess they could have kept a couple of people hanging around to maintain it. Seems like the worst, the worst job ever. Right.  And again, the question is, what impact does that have on other applications? Right. Exactly. Right. Exactly. There's the cost of maintenance. Right.  You can't just let the product just just stay stable. The fact is that Google is constantly changing things that affect all their products across the board, especially with the privacy policy and the consolidation that they've been doing.  And, you know, you'd have to have there have to be active development going on there. So it just seems like it was a strange thing for people to say. So I agree, Leo.  I don't think that the energy they put into these these April Fool's dose could have really kept Google reader alive longer.  But you can understand why people would say like, hey, you're taking away a tool, especially for the people who use it every day. You take away a tool that I would use every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you had time to make these stupid videos. It's kind of even worse than that. You created a tool that put all the other RSS readers out of business and then killed it.  Yeah. And I don't think Google did it on purpose. But people watch these jokes that ever used.  But are they happier because of it?  Now, I like that in that same Atlantic article ever in that same Atlantic article, Rebecca Greenfield points out that Netflix had some fun on April Fool's Day.  I didn't notice this, but in some of the recommended categories, Netflix had a fun like reality TV about people with no concept of reality or TV shows where defiantly crossed arms mean business.  Now, that's funny. And took about five minutes.  Yeah, that's fantastic. That's a good April Fool's joke. It doesn't intrude. It doesn't change the experience. It's obviously a joke, but it's not a prank. I don't like pranks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Google Blue. That's actually a thing. That's actually a theme that's available for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it is a jab at Microsoft's updates for all of its products, which are all codenamed blue.  And they say Gmail Blue because Brown was a disaster. We decided that we were going to do something that is exactly the same as before, but blue.  And that's kind of what they're saying is Microsoft's doing blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Blue was part of the initial conception for Gmail when it was launched. At the time, the technology was simply not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The culture of Google really is to incorporate moonshot thinking to every project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's taken us six years to develop the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, you might not know this, but if you follow Microsoft closely, this is as echoes of what Microsoft was saying about Windows 8.  This is their response to Scroogled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our major challenge was how do we make this intimate, intuitive, realistic and organic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In trying to bring email into the 21st century, we were faced with a challenge.  How do we completely redesign and recreate something while keeping it exactly the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How do we redesign and recreate something while keeping it exactly the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that you say that, Leo, I hadn't caught that. You are absolutely right. It is right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a shot at Microsoft, especially because Microsoft's next edition of Windows 8.1, I guess we'll call it, is called blue.  But that's all right. Scroogled's like a, you know, I think they had to respond to that.  The answer is Gmail blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  You click on compose. The button composes blue. The word composes itself blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Boldface is blue. Underline is blue.  This is pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this didn't take long.  And this didn't take long.  The font comes up blue. You don't have to make it blue. It is blue. It just is blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The little lines, they're in blue. When you go into help, it's blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's Gmail, only bluer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They did have to spend some money on the Blue Man Group.  Or at least blue paint for some Googlers. I don't know. Is that trademark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Orange, brown. Brown was a disaster. We tried yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, brown was a disaster for the Zune brown as well. I don't know if that's intentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's right.  It's a fabled story that she tested 20 blues or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. When that designer left Google, right?  He wrote that saving post that said, I had to defend...  Designers of intuition had nothing to do with how colors were chosen.  Colors were chosen by A-B tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, the moonshot thinking comes from Andy Rubin.  Larry Page's farewell to Andy Rubin where he says he's off to do more moonshots.  That's making fun of themselves. I guess that's okay.  Yeah, that we like.  April Fool's is tolerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I want to combine the two worst holidays, April Fool's and St. Patrick's Day, and just get them over with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's good. Why don't you like St. Patrick's Day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Drunken amateurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  St. Patrick's Day in New York is the worst.  Amateur hour.  It's awful.  Particularly in Manhattan. Yeah, it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's so bad now that Howard Stern has made it a regular annual feature to send guys out to interview drunken teenagers.  Dressed in green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Google Glass... We talked about the disqualification last week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we didn't. The winners hadn't been announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Some of them had. Leo read about three or four of them last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. And Jeff, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Jeff got it.  I can now spend another $1,500 on a Google product that Leo's going to make fun of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, well, I've made fun of it already, but I'll have one too. At least we'll be making fun of them wearing dorky glasses together.  Nikki Graziano... You know, the whole idea of this contest was a Twitter contest.  Hashtag if I had glass, what you would do.  Nikki Graziano won glass. Her tweet...  At first they gave it to her, then they withdrew it saying,  Sorry, we've disqualified you. Sorry for the confusion.  Gee, that was confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a badly designed algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I won't take a picture of my poop.  Said another winner.  Some of these were just mistakes. I don't know. They had a third party do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And then it's over now. If you haven't gotten the invite, you're not going to get one.  This is long over. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And by the way, the invite, it's not like you won glass.  The invite qualified you to pay $1,500 for glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And to travel to New York, LA or San Francisco to pick them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All expenses paid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. No, no, no. You got to show up in person to pick them up.  And they won't ship them?  They are not shipping them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They have to hypnotize you, Leo. Maybe they should have done the same thing with the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They did hypnotize me briefly.  I'm just glad they sent us one to review in time for me to cancel my order.  No, you like it. I'm not going to knock it. You like it. It's a wonderful thing.  Wow, is that hot?  No fans though, right?  It has a fan. It's got a special unique vent that goes all the way across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It irritates me when the fan comes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I think a lot of, you know, Linus Torvalds was saying, I love the screen.  Some people mistook that for I love the pixel.  A lot of people love the screen. It's a beautiful screen.  And anytime you can get a Retina screen, I was singing the praises of the MacBook Retina.  It's these all displays at some point should be 300 DPI or better.  Just they should. This is the way to go. It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And there was one rumor, and of course, rumors don't matter with Jack, that Google was going to bring out another pixel at I.O.  And it will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now we've been we've been debating how we're going to cover this.  But Jeff, are you going yet? Have you decided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  As of now, yes, I'm planning to come. As of now, he is going to be another fast trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I'm going to come out for we're going to bring the gang together.  Gina, Jeff and I will all be at Google I.O.  But Google has informed us there is no space for us to broadcast from Google I.O.  Nor will they give us bandwidth or any additional passes for crew.  So we can't do any kind of broadcast from Google I.O.  So I'm trying to think. I know I'm trying to think what we should do.  I think we should just come back here afterwards. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a space nearby that I broadcast from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we go to the same of our T.Lounge or somewhere.  But then Chad raised the point. Well, so you're down the block from it.  And what way does that? Right. You know, we could be here, too.  We could be there and we wouldn't need to.  We'd have better quality. We wouldn't spend a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that means I got to drive over a bridge. Oh, Jeff, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We can drive you around a bridge. No, there's no way to get here.  How would you get going over a bridge?  You'd have to drive to like Fresno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's that one land mass that we. Oh, yeah.  It's a land mass. Not by the way, Jeff, how do you like wearing blindfolds while we drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We'd have to drive Jeff to Gilroy.  We'd have to go all the way down to the South Bay, go around and all the way back up.  I guess, you know, it wouldn't be much farther from out of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We just go around. Story at the examiner when I was there.  They questioned the guys told to Sarah to the Marin and he covered Marin and he said, You're right.  You're right. You got me.  I actually drove all the way down to Gilroy, back up around all the way up to Sacramento, back down just so I would avoid the Golden Gate Bridge.  And you now owe me 300 miles of mileage. Oh, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would you have to go to Sacramento? You might have to because you got to get around the bay.  Holy moly. But you could pick up some garlic.  If Gina drives, I'll be OK. Wolfie. Yeah, Gina said good driver. Excellent.  She's an excellent driver. We'll get you an Uber.  We'll get you an Uber. We'll get you some nice car.  We'll have tinted windows. You won't be able to see what you're going.  It'll be great. My palms are sweating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The only thing is what we miss a lot if we have to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know this is there's no good answer.  I haven't decided because they sat me down yesterday.  They pinned me down and said, You've got to decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, after the keynote, they do do some press sessions that we probably get invited to, you know, directly after the keynote.  They said today that they'll do pressers.  But honestly, last year, right after the keynote, I went straight to the rental car place, rented a car, drove a Petaluma, made it.  We started a little late, but I made it.  We were able to do it.  And, you know, it's the developer sessions after the keynotes are really throw me out because I'm not a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So press is only there during the press section and for the keynotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I you're not allowed to go to any sessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, actually, I don't know. I was thinking of WWDC.  Apple does that. They let you go to the keynote and then they throw you.  I don't know what Google does. Yeah.  I think Google would let me go to the sessions last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The reason the reason I'm thinking of going ahead and coming besides seeing you guys and scaring my pants off on a bridge is how do you feel about fairies?  There's nothing wrong with that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no you can see him thinking, should I make the joke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He wasn't thinking of the joke. He was thinking, I've got the joke.  Should I make the joke?  We could you could take a ferry from Sausalito to Larkspur.  And I've done that. No bridges involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Jeff, do you only take the subway to Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  As it happens. Yeah, I've never I've driven.  I've driven in the old days to Brooklyn when I lived there.  I used to live there. He'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He'll go over a bridge. He just doesn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But you know what, Gina?  I had this is this is this is heresy for a New York writer to say I have never nor will I ever walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, it's fun. I love that. I've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's my favorite. I actually like to walk across the Manhattan Bridge.  Then you get this kind of see the Brooklyn Bridge across.  But you've been fixing that one for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How do you know they did it right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is there is there like a lot of bridge collapses or something?  Is there you know, here's the nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You were scarred as a youth.  Hey, there's one big one right around you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that was just that was a section.  It just fell in and it was an earthquake.  It was not, you know, well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You have them. Yeah, we do have them.  I know it's ridiculous.  It's it's an anxiety attack.  It's ridiculous. No, any phobia is not ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I get no, no, it is. It's understandable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It is logically. But it's actually grown in me.  The funny thing is, when I confess this to people, I and Chad was like this.  Chad runs across bridge every day.  You don't have to drive across bridges, right, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I'm fine with bridges.  Oh, Chad, you don't like it, do you, Chad?  Oh, yeah. No. Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It throws me under the bridge under the under the bridge with the bus.  I'm throwing you under a bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never you have never been worried about bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I swear when I was out there, you said you didn't like driving.  I don't like Jeff Bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, actually, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, this is getting serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got a Jeff Bridges band is performing up here at the Wells Fargo Center.  Oh, cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to be afraid of heights, but then I did rock climbing and you have to do repelling and you trust your life with a single rope.  That's kooky.  And and that's that's when I got over that and just went, I guess engineers know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I won't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You coming back to the studio after the keynote sounds totally fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk off air and figure out.  But so we will definitely do our usual keynote coverage because last year that was when Sergey Brin jumped out of a plane or whatever.  So that was that was cool.  Blimp. Will you be in the keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I think I want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want to miss it this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do we broadcast from inside the can't?  That's a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So people will other people will be here doing the keynote play by play.  We'll be at the keynote.  So and then when I was thinking maybe we could interview some people afterwards, I could do that.  You know, you guys can go to events.  I'll get my pixel and interview people and then then we'll then we'll come back.  Head up, head up and do this.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They give out the swag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's like, yeah, there's a swag like booth and and they'll say, OK, at four o'clock on this day, it's a get in line.  Yeah.  Yeah. It's not like a mad rush right after the keynote or anything.  Usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're you're you're going to leave Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I am leaving Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  On Easter Sunday, Google did not feature the passion of the Christ, but instead, Seja Chavez, labor activist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And my first question, which I didn't see answered was, yeah, did they do Easter in years past?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They they've done Christmas.  I had the same question.  I thought maybe they don't do religious holidays, but they've done Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they definitely do religious holidays.  But Easter properly really isn't about bunnies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's a bigger deal.  It's not. It's more religious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is. It is kind of the holiest of Christian days, I think.  I don't know.  Somebody check in 2008.  Easter.  Somebody checked the Google Doodles page.  Well, that's the problem.  In fact, I would think it would be smart for Google not to stay secular just because you don't want to look like you're favoring a religion.  I'm going to bet.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm going to bet that's the instinct.  The problem was then whoever chose it just said, oh, it's another Sunday and looked up the calendar and put Seja Chavez on, which only pissed off the Fox News crowd.  Glenn Beck was unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So 2000.  Here's Easter eggs in the O's.  And then there's Caesar Chavez.  So that's a search for Easter on the Google Doodle page.  It looks like they haven't done it since 2000.  So, you know, maybe they have.  Maybe they have.  Have they done Eid?  How do you spell Eid?  Eid, right?  I don't even know what it is.  Nope.  That's the Muslim.  No.  Ramadan.  That's over.  No, no Passover.  So I think that 2000 they can be given a pass because that was the earliest days of Google and nobody really had no Passover.  So it sounds like they are kind of avoiding religious holidays and more likely doing things like commemorating people.  Persian New Year.  St. Patrick's Day.  They did this year.  Remember that?  They did that.  They did that.  They did that.  They did that.  They did that.  Persian New Year.  St. Patrick's Day.  They did this year.  Remember the Irish dancers?  Douglas Adams birthday.  Women's Day 2013.  Mother's Day 2013.  What?  What?  Is this a pre-doodle?  Oh, March 10th.  It's Mother's Day in Ireland.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't talk a ton of St. Patrick's.  It seems like they just try to mix it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they also have a big Irish division.  That's where all the tax money goes.  Oh, right.  So they've really got to sell Bulgaria National Day, St. David's Day, a lot of national independence days in those individual nations.  But yeah, it seems like they stay away from religious days in general, which makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So then given that, however, if you stay away, maybe you should have nothing on those days because anything else you put on it, didn't they learn this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're going to get...  Then it looks like you're ignoring...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're going for a commie neighbor guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a slight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  March 10th is...  I thought that was Friday.  I guess it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We celebrated New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, the invention of the Zamboni, Copernicus' birthday, Valentine's Day.  Yeah.  I think they kind of avoid that.  Yesterday, it was Maria Sibylla Marion's birthday.  That was quite a beautiful illustration yesterday.  She was an 18th century nature illustrator.  And that's what the gecko and the leaves was all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of go to the homepage more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know. Who uses the homepage?  I know.  Not I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it seems like most of the people who were upset were Fox News people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  It's like, hey, first there was a war on Christmas. Now there's a war on Easter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The war on Easter.  And the only response these people can make is, now I'm going to use Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In which case, it's like, go for it.  Yeah, nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why don't they use Duck Duck Go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The Pope should have tweeted, now I'm using Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now that would be serious.  The Pope doesn't use anything.  I don't know how you say Bing in Latin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Bingium. Bingium.  Bingium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because Dr. Mom says, nothing says he is risen like Bing.  Okay. Bing is smart.  See, they don't do doodles.  They just have a beautiful backdrop every day.  That's nothing to do with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and a couple of folks in the chat room, thanks chat room, are pointing out that you do see the Google in your search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. You do now.  The doodles shows up in the search results now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually am using Duck Duck Go, so I'm not even really seeing that.  I use Duck Duck Go for many of my searches. Not all, but many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was a good article about the founder of Duck Duck Go today somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a profile.  Let me see if I can dig that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I favored it on my Flipboard magazine, which means it's totally inaccessible to anybody anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I dropped it in Instapaper, which means I'll never read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. That's what I got to do.  Normally I tweet it, and then it goes from Twitter to my pinboard.  But it takes its time. I'm just looking through it to see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neowind.net.  Neowind did it.  Me, Gabriel Weinberg, the man taking on Google and Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's self-funded.  Good for him.  Yeah, he made all his money on what? Another startup.  Made, which he sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Names database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right. He sold that to classmates.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sold it to classmates.com for 10 million.  Yeah. Good man. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break. Come back with more Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani.  We're talking Twig, Google, the Cloud, Pixels, and more.  Angry Twitterers.  Our show today brought...  When are Twitterers not angry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Jeff on the show, we always have an angry Twitterer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He is the angry Twitterer.  Go ahead. You can be mad at me, Jeff. You can yell at me for not liking the Pixel.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm just disappointed in you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a line my mom would pull.  You know...  I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed, which is worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You were worth more than that.  You were a better person than that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I expected more of you, Leo.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Hulu, you know about Hulu Plus? $7.99 a month and as many shows as you want anytime, anywhere on almost every device  streamed instantly to you and we can try it free for two weeks.  Double the normal trial if you go to huluplus.com slash twit.

A great way to get your television.  Unlimited amounts. Glee, of course, is on here.  Goodglee and Newglee.  You can go back.  Go back. It's how I watch Saturday Night Live, right?  Because not all of it's great. So I just watched the little clips.  They have movies too.  Recently aired episodes, popular movies, fully loaded.  Look at this downside. So here's the deal.  I just watched Madonna's Truth or Dare again. I love that.  That was on this popular episodes.  I'm a big Family Guy fan. So you just tap it.  Tap it. It starts HuluPlus.com slash twit.  Two weeks free so you can try it and see what you think.  It's great for cord cutters.  Hulu. Don't don't tell him I said that.  HuluPlus.com slash twit.  See, I shouldn't have started the Family Guy.  Now I want to watch it.  Is this to Jeff Jarvis was a TV critic for many years.  You hate the Family Guy. Go ahead. Tell me that.  Because that'll make up for me hating the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, I haven't watched them.  Here's the big confession.  You don't watch TV anymore?  I've never watched a full episode of The Simpsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, this is their 24th season now.  Hard to keep a show fresh for 24 years.  That's crazy.  I tried to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Simpsons is a crazy cultural thing.  I have coworkers who would make all these crazy Simpsons references.  I may have watched one or two episodes here or there, Jeff,  but I'm kind of in the same boat as you.  I have no idea what this means.  They would just sort of look at me sadly disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think everybody to be part of this world has to watch the first, say,  five or six years of The Simpsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be part of this world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Otherwise, you're going to feel very left out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm catching up on Breaking Bad and Walking Dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're walking dead also, great.  Let me see what The Simpsons episodes.  They've got, of course, all the current season episodes.  A Tree Grows in Springfield.  Awesome.  HuluPlus.com.  You should, Jeff.  You know what you should watch?  You should all watch the Monorail episode, which is like season three.  Classic.  That'll get you into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would do the first couple of seasons.  First couple of seasons.  Brilliant.  Hey, a story just ran on TechCrunch thanks to Gardner in the chat room,  which I just added to the rundown in the Google section.  Google Forks WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, crap.  That just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And launches Blink, a new rendering engine that will soon power Chrome and Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.  So we're calling it Blink.  As Google describes it, Blink is an inclusive open source community  and a new rendering engine based on WebKit.  You know, I wondered if they would do this now that everybody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  including Opera, is running a WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  That Google has no secret sauce anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Although, you know, it was Apple that really put WebKit on the map.  When Apple was deciding for Safari, its new browser, what engine to use,  it was then that they decided to use the K browser from Linux.  And that became WebKit.  So maybe it's because it's so strongly associated with Apple.  But a fork on something that's so critical like WebKit is not good news.  What a fork is, Gina, explain a fork.  You're a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A fork is when you take a project and you say,  I'm going to make a copy of this and I'm going to work on a parallel.  I'm going to work on it, but I'm not.  But the changes I'm going to make aren't going to be merged back into the original, right?  Like I'm forking it into its own new separate branch.  So, you know, I mean, forking actually in the model of Git,  forking is really a good thing in order to use it to work on a repository in Git.  You fork it.  But the idea is that you then send a pull request and the changes get merged back to the original.  The idea being that if you have one master central project,  everybody worked on that one project, everyone benefits from it.  And it's better if it's a singular project, right?  So but kind of like in the old days, the idea of a fork, it was kind of a hostile thing.  You know, there would be, you know, if there were disagreement about where a project was going,  the way that you would resolve it would be a fork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Screw you. I'm going to do it my own way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, screw you. I'm going to do it my own way.  And I'm going to split the community of people who work on this thing.  And my values are different than yours.  And now suddenly you're sort of duplicating effort.  Then you have users going well, or in this case, developers, I mean, our users using WebKit.  But you have developers saying, which one should I use?  Which, you know, what's better?  And it gets kind of political and weird.  So, yeah, my first reaction to this is, ugh.  But Google VP of Engineering, Linus Ubson and Alex Komorowski said that the decision to fork WebKit was entirely driven by the engineering teams  and solely based on the fact that the engineers felt constrained by the technical complexity of working within the WebKit ecosystem.  Komorowski noted that when it comes to working with other companies involved in the WebKit project, the collaboration has been fantastic.  So, I mean, Google's trying to kind of pave this over and say, hey, this was not a hostile act.  You know, we're just, you know, we're feeling a little constrained.  We want to make things a little simpler, a little faster, because you know that that's Google's obsession when it comes to anything Chrome related.  And I'm sure that they will. Right.  And that's called Blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Google, according, and this is a good article, by the way, Frederic Lardonois on TechCrunch with a history of WebKit going back to Apple  starting WebKit in 2005, open sourcing it.  He says, and I didn't know this, initially Google forked WebKit to create Chromium, but later reconciled, a la that Git model.  So they brought it back into the fold.  Most of the commits, the vast majority of commits to WebKit come from Google.  95 WebKit reviewers, Google, 59 WebKit reviewers are Apple, followed by smaller numbers from BlackBerry, Intel, Nokia, Samsung, Adobe and Netflix.  I didn't know Netflix used it. Google is currently responsible for the vast majority of commits.  So it's a that's I think a big deal to the WebKit team.  Yeah, this is a big deal.  The WebKit team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is not so good for WebKit and all the products that that that you do.  Question, Gina. So are both going to be compatible if both are compatible with HTML5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you're a plain old web designer, does this cause you new compatibility problems in terms of how you design pages?  Well, I mean, this is the engine that is going to power certain browsers.  Right. So it looks sounds like Blink is going to be behind Chrome and Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so it'll be interesting to see.  I mean, Google's pretty good about sticking to standards.  I can't imagine that they would deal with HTML5 differently than someone else.  Right. HTML5 is just a standard.  But but yeah, if you have different engines kind of powering the browser, there's a potential for compatibility issues.  Well, you have to say, oh, how does this look in Safari?  How does this look in Chrome?  There are two different engines.  So it was kind of getting to be good news because you had WebKit, you had Firefox and the Gekko engine and you had Internet Explorer and you could test in all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now you're going to have to test in Blink WebKit.  I mean, it's just it just adds another layer.  And yeah, you're going to stay standard compliant, but it always ends up adding some different things.  So I mean, I think that's a good point.  It can potentially.  Yeah, it can.  I mean, it sounds like the difference is going to be a performance thing.  Right.  I mean, Google's going to optimize for the things that they want to do in Chrome.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is a self-interested thing that they want to make Chrome.  They want Chrome to be the vision that they want it to be.  And WebKit isn't cut isn't cutting it.  Right.  And they said they didn't make this decision.  Likely, lightly, they must really have a vision of what they want to do.  Right.  So I mean, I think that's a good point.  Right.  And they said they didn't make this decision.  Likely, lightly, they must really have like fundamental issues with WebKit in order to in order to make this decision and fork it.  So, you know, there might be a case where you could build an app in Chrome that would be super speedy and great and work really well with Blink, which is optimized for certain things you can do in Chrome, which would be kind of crappy and Safari or Firefox.  I'm just kind of projecting it.  And we'll see.  But it sounds like.  You know, it sounds like speed is going to be Blink's focus.  So and I wonder if maybe Blink will become the standard or maybe WebKit will merge Blink's commits back into it if it really does become superior.  I mean, we all know that when Google puts its eyes on on a browser technology, we look at what they did with Chrome.  Right.  I mean, I don't know.  Firefox is like we don't need another open source browser.  We have Firefox.  Look at how amazing Chrome is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is from the Chromium blog where they write about it.  They say Chromium uses a different multiprocess architecture than other WebKit based browsers and supporting multiple architectures over the years has led to increasing complexity for both WebKit and Chromium, slowing down the pace of innovation.  So what they're saying is in order to fork in order to support our architecture better, we're going to create a new open source rendering engine based on WebKit called Blink.  So multiple rounds.  We believe that having multiple rendering engines similar to having multiple browsers were spur innovation and over time improve the health of the entire open web ecosystem.  There's something to be said for that.  Microsoft has complained about the monoculture of having everything on WebKit.  Of course, they're not using WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  From a security point of view, it does make sense.  If you have one target, the same way it's harder to develop a website because you have multiple targets, it's harder to develop a malware because you have multiple targets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's true.  So not not bad from a security point of view.  In the short term, Blink will this is the Chromium blog again.  Blink will bring little change for Web developers.  The bulk of the initial work will focus on internal architectural improvements and a simplification of the code base.  We'll be able to remove seven build systems and delete more than 7000 files comprising more than four and a half million lines right off the bat.  Well, then that's that's significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds that sounds amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's probably for what stuff that Chrome doesn't run on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a different different multiprocess architecture than other WebKit based browsers.  So yeah, so it just sounds like there's just code in WebKit that Chrome doesn't need.  It simply doesn't need it doesn't use it right.  And but but you know when you have code in a system right that your system is that you don't need you still any new code that you add to it.  You have to be compatible with that other code that you don't need.  And that's why they're saying slows down.  Right. That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To innovate seven build systems they don't use.  That's a lot.  They do say and this is this will be the this will be the test.  They say throughout this transition will collaborate closely with other browser vendors to move the web forward and preserve the compatibility that made it a successful ecosystem.  In that spirit, we've set strong guidelines for new features that emphasize standards, interoperability, conformance testing and transparency.  You know, if they do that effectively, then there's no problem.  That's what they have to do.  That's they have to do that.  And then you can see the benefit and without any negative or fewer negatives anyway.  Compatibility risk is one of the most important decision criteria for enabling new web platform features by default.  So so yeah, they're they're they're obviously aware of the potential pitfalls of forking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just hope that other companies besides Google are major committers to blank because it's always better to have people from different companies all sort of in the pot, you know, contributing and blinky is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. It's it's anybody.  It's an open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's open source project.  Just like WebKit is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Open source rendering engine based on WebKit.  Blink's mission to improve the open web through technical innovation and good citizenship.  Well, they got their hearts are in the right place.  Will opera use blink?  No opera is going to use WebKit or maybe they would.  That's interesting.  I mean, they could write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  What other browsers will switch to blink?  I mean, Firefox, WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be funny?  I doubt that something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But opera is probably the most likely candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're just beginning.  Apparently on Hacker News, the opera dev said, yes, we'll be using blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's Amazon's browser, a fork, or is it its own beast?  I think it's WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Silk, the Silk browser.  That's a good question.  That is a good question.  Google's privacy director, Alma Witten stepping down.  She was their first director of privacy, took the job in 2010.  CNET said the hardest job at Google.  I think so.  She announced that she's stepping down from her post with plans to retire.  This is a big problem for companies like Google and Apple when their employees vest and they're suddenly millionaires.  I don't need the money.  This is the worst job at Google.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, I'm out of here.  She's she's been there for with actually she's going to be replaced by Lawrence Yu, an engineer who's been with the company for eight years and is not based in London as Alma Witten was, but based in Mountain View, which is probably good.  It's a plus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Alma did.  She did.  I would say an amazing job.  She had to suffer all kinds of crises and difficulties and missteps and so on.  But she also and they brought me out to speak to the group once.  They really did do a good job of getting privacy into the discussion and the culture of Google more and more and more having events.  They're bringing people to speak.  Setting guidelines for privacy, you know, all the catching about them aside.  She did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it was she who's oversaw the unification of the privacy policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's that's a highly controversial thing in some quarters still.  But I think she did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think if you have as they did 70 more than 70 privacy policies, it's too much for a consumer to adjust to absorb.  So having one unified privacy policy is a good thing, whether you agree with it or not.  At least you know what it is and you don't have to read 70 different privacy policies to know what you're giving Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, the argument against it is that it then enabled Google to use data from one application and another one, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they were probably going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. And my contention has always been if Google had invented the whole thing that it is today from scratch, it would have been one.  Right. Right.  Yeah. The only reason it was 70 is because they acquired things and everything has happened.  It never made any sense.  But I was at a dinner tonight here in Amsterdam, a wonderful dinner thrown by one of the heads of one of the TV networks here and called Cairo.  A guy with a great name, Taco.  They have great names in the Netherlands.  And so people went after me about Google, you know, not trusting Google and this and that.  And the anti-Google ism in Europe just always amazes me when I'm over here.  But that was part of it is that they're using the stuff across the applications.  Yeah, they are. You don't have to do it with them, but they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's always duck, duck, go and blink.  I mean, Bing, Bing, Bing, now we're going to get confused.  Google has started very strangely Google Shopping Express in San Francisco.  We're too far north, I think, to take advantage of this with free delivery when you buy from Target, Walgreens, staples and more.  So the idea is kind of like Amazon Prime, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so same delivery.  So you order on Google and then it shows up at your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Remember, Wal-Mart said that they were going to have Wal-Mart shoppers do the deliveries.  Hey, are you going that way? Because I got a case of toilet paper you could drop off on your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you select a delivery window. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. What time you want it? Anytime today or 10 or two or six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which says to me that I've said this, I think, on last week's show, I said it before.  The real war isn't Google versus Apple. The real war is Google versus Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google versus Amazon. Will they bring blue bottle iced coffee to my door here in San Diego?  This is what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I can see, I mean, this same day.  So this is instead of you getting in the car and going shopping by the end of the day, you'll have what you need.  Yeah, I would love to see this come north. I don't know who's doing delivery.  I see in the article a Google shopping express little van with a nicely groomed young man in a polo shirt.  Oh, yeah, it'll stay that way for a long time.  Mr. Google is coming to my door. It's the same van that Eric Schmidt was driving before with ice cream cones in it.  Google has this is very interesting from Google's point of view.  Better than Amazon, although Amazon's also looking the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The other thing about this is it's a few things.  One, it's the true future of advertising, which is actually transactions and ROI.  And Google goes toward ROI, return on investment and marketing.  And two, I suspect that Google is going to use existing retailers who are advertisers.  Amazon is competing with all those retailers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Target, Walgreens, Staples, American Eagle, Toys R Us, Babies R Us, Office Depot, Blue Bottle Coffee, Nob Hill Foods and Palo Alto Toy & Sport.  You're right. These are brick and mortars that want to want to stay alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's in their interest.  So, both eBay slash PayPal and Google will be saying, we're not going to kill you.  We're going to serve you and help you and help you find new customers and do all kinds of new things.  Wow. Amazon is saying, screw you. We're going to kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Early testers get six months of free same day delivery, but at some point they're going to start charging you.  Google says we're still working on the pricing and we'll see depending on how the data comes in, what we do.  And people need to target new parents.  New parents is great.  Oh my gosh.  Diapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Diapers, the whole thing.  Blue Bottle.  I didn't appreciate Blue Bottle.  I didn't appreciate delivery until we had a newborn and you're just exhausted and feeding every two hours.  And yeah, so it's smart that they've got Baby is RS, Toys R Us in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they're not only signing up beta testers, they're signing up retailers.  Are you a retailer with locations in the San Francisco Bay Area?  Who wouldn't want to do this?  Now you have to charge the same amount as if somebody came to the store and then there's an additional delivery fee, presumably at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the delivery fee goes to Google.  Google.  Yeah, not to, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But why wouldn't you want to do this as a retailer?  This is great.  This exactly saves your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm going to bet there's a chance for Google to arbitrage too.  Because Google could well negotiate a bulk buying deal from Staples and still deliver at retail.  Right.  Right.  And Staples would probably insist on delivering at retail price and yet happily give Google a volume discount if Google promotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why I'm not surprised to see it's the big retailers that are the early participants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, people made fun of the Walmart speculation.  Yeah.  But I think there's something brilliant about it because it uses the businesses that are built on spare cycles.  It's just doing it that's hard, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's an infrastructural problem.  Who wants to deliver to this area?  Right.  Are you trustworthy?  And what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you get a couple of bucks.  You're going that way anyway.  You'd have to pre-register.  You'd have to be vetted.  They'd have to keep track of you.  Maybe they'd be set for entrances and exits at the store.  What neighborhood you're going to.  There'd be a desk at that entrance.  Pick it up with some stuff.  Take it out.  I mean, it's a logistics thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I almost imagine that people could make a part-time job out of it.  Yeah.  Right.  If it's just an infrastructure, if it's a platform, then you hang out at Walmart all day.  Oh, we like those kinds of people.  And, you know, they pick up things to carry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like what we talked about with cars, you know, that the cars spend most of their time  parked somewhere not being used, right?  The idea of sharing cars, keep them on the road, that pooling resources, which the internet enables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're talking about Google, the cloud, Jeff and Gina.  Our show today brought to you by our good friends at LegalZoom.com.  Not a law firm. Oh, no, no.  Much better than a law firm.  A self-help service that lets you create your own legal documents, affordable businesses, business forms like LLCs and corporations.  You can get an LLC or incorporate your business at LegalZoom starting at $99.  That's a deal. That's what I did.  We're still the same LLC.  The same cheap LLC I did in 2005.

In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom.com for LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks, and more.  I should really go through this step by step.  We should actually...  You did it. You did it for your OMG Chad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Trademarked OMG Chad.  It's amazing the details that I would have never known about.  The process is valuable in that respect as well.  I need to send in now a specimen that says, I've been using OMG Chad constantly.  I would have never known to do that.  LegalZoom makes it easy to send you an email.  They're even like, hey, it looks like you didn't get the email because I'm slow.  They send me a phone call.  It's like, hey, are you sure everything's going fine?  It's like, yeah, I just haven't gotten to it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you run up against anything where you thought, I wouldn't mind asking a lawyer about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not yet.  Trademark's pretty straightforward.  There were some times that I was confused, but on the website it explained it.  It was just like, hey, this is what you're looking for.  These are what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They now have this. They didn't have this when I did it.  They have the LegalZoom legal plan where they have vetted lawyers in almost every state.  They've got reviews online so you know everything about their profiles.  And pre-negotiated low prices.  So you can say, I'm doing this trademark thing.  What do you recommend?  Is this a service mark or is this a trademark?  That kind of thing.  And have legal advice from an attorney as well.  Also very affordable.  So this is really a nice, you know, kind of gotten to be more full service.  I really think it's great.  Step-by-step questionnaire.  It's easy to do.  It's very affordable, high quality, and 100% guaranteed, of course.  I want you to visit LegalZoom.com.  Again, LegalZoom's not a law firm.  Self-help services at your specific direction.  Or you can speak to a legal plan attorney and get your questions answered and get ongoing advice.  To get a special thank you, just a little token of our appreciation for mentioning that you heard LegalZoom on Twig.  Use the offer code TWIG on checkout and you'll get $10 back.  Just like that.  Offer code TWIG.  $10 back.  Just a way of saying thank you for telling LegalZoom you heard about it on this week in Google.  LegalZoom.com.  Don't put it off.  Seriously.  It's not worth the risk.  Google engineers, I guess we've got to thank Matt Cutts for this.  Or maybe not.  Google engineers find a way to filter robocalls the same way Gmail filters spam.  I guess it's not Matt Cutts.  This is this spam filtering.  It was the FTC doing a crowd sourced challenge.  And they announced the three winners of its robocall challenge.  A contest meant to...  This is FTC's whizing up.  Crowd source a solution to the robocall scourge that prompts more than...  Get this.  This is why they did it.  200,000 customer complaints a month.  FTC gets 200,000...  Stupid robocalls.  Stupid robocall.  First place award was split between Aaron Foss and Sertor Danis.  The technology achievement award, which was reserved for a submission from a large company,  went to the Googlers Daniel Klein and Dean Jackson.  Here's their little sketch.  Is this the back of a napkin?  No, it's a whiteboard.  I love it.  People ask the FTC all the time, why can't you screen robocalls just like Gmail screens spam?  And so what the Google solution does is it's crowd sourcing a little bit.  Just like Gmail uses reports from users about spam messages, bogus messages are reported back to the system,  instantly report originating phone numbers to an online database.  On the other side, phones or external hardware automatically check the database  when a call comes in and rejects the calls from spammers.  Now, let's see if they do it.  They call it Nomorobo.  Nomorobo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What could go wrong with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nomorobo.  An entry to the FTC robocall challenge to prevent illegal robocalls.  This is a great idea.  I wish more government stuff would do this.  Yep.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There have been more hackfests and hack days in government agencies recently.  This is cool.  What sad face, my sad face about this is that Google has no plans to integrate Nomorobo into the Google Voice.  Robocalls are unpleasant, Google said, and our engineers have some ideas for combating the problem.  At this point, this is simply a proposal for the FTC to consider.  I get robocalls in Google Voice.  I mean, luckily you can make a block list, but you still kind of have to maintain that block list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You get robocalls?  I don't think I've ever gotten a robocall.  Oh, actually, I might get them in Google Voice.  You know, in a way, Google Voice does kind of discourage it because if you turn screening on, which I do,  they have to press one or no, they have to say their name and then I press one and say, go ahead.  And that stops them every time because a robot can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. That's smart.  I should turn that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Turn on screening.  It just says if they're not all I have on my Google Voice is if you're not in my address book, announce, pre-announce yourself.  And that just stops them.  That's why I don't get any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy.  Yeah, that's great.  I should do that.  People don't mind doing that.  I think you turn on call screen just for people who are not in your address book.  That's because I feel like my friends and family would be annoyed if they had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No.  In fact, it's one of the reasons I use Google Voice is you could have different categories and different kinds of responses.  If somebody's in my family, I say, I love you.  If they're not in my family, I hate you.  It's Jeff Jarvis.  The pixels.  Socks.  I could actually do that.  Hi, Jeff.  It's Leo.  The pixel sucks.  I could actually do that.  Shmuck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You spent $1,500.  Neener, neener, neener.  No, that's one of the great things about Google Voice.  It's awesome.  I just hope they don't kill Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be so sad.  Wouldn't that be bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really, really, really sad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They can't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're not making any money on it.  It's pure cost to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny though, in the left-hand sidebar though, there's like a balance.  Like your balance is $1 or something like that.  Mine's $11.  Yeah, I have no idea how to add money, why I would add money.  You don't make international calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you make international calls, they charge you a nominal amount and you have to charge  it up.  I think $10 at a time.  And it's through wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they don't think that's a profit center.  That was one of the things.  They said for one year only free calling within the US and Canada.  And they extended that last year.  I don't know.  Did they extend it into 2013?  I guess so, because I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm confused as to how it does it, because I know you can do that via Gmail, but you  can't really do it via Google.  That's the Gmail calling.  I think that's Google Voice.  I don't know.  If you hit call on Google Voice, it actually calls your device or it will call your Google  Talk number.  Yes, it's not VoIP.  Yeah, it's not VoIP.  It's an interesting workaround.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But see, the Google Talk is how you're doing it in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And that's free.  But whenever you click call on the Google Voice page, it doesn't give you an option  to do it from the browser.  It says, do you want me to call you on Google Talk?  Do you want me to call you on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here it is from Captain Kipper in our chat room.  Google extended free Gmail Voice calls in the US and Canada through 2013.  So they've done that twice now.  So that's through Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's through Gmail.  I always think of it as Google Voice, but you're right.  It's not.  Right.  So never mind.  Forget I said that.  But if you make a Google Voice call, you're using your carrier minutes to call that other  number, which they...  So that's what it is.  So it's just carrier minutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know what?  We have a Dudley owl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Play the trumpets, ladies and gentlemen.  It's the changelog.  A nice big Google changelog from Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  We got quite a few items today.  So Google launched a new product called Google Maps Engine Lite.  So if you're an enterprise user, you already know that there's a Google Maps Engine, which  gives businesses tools, pro tools to organize big data sets and give customers information  about their location.  So for regular people, regular consumers, they've launched basically a beta Lite version  of this.  You can find it at mapsengine.google.com slash map.  And using this tool, this beta tool, you can import a spreadsheet of locations onto a map  and visualize those places using different styling and icons.  They have a few examples on the Google Maps blog.  One is the Mapa project, which shows shark spotting locations off of the African coast.  Another one is in the San Francisco Bay Area, a hiker site that shows best places to do a hike.  So yeah, if you want to make your own map, you can go to mapsengine.google.com slash map and  upload a series of points and map them how you want.  Google's Gmail's new Compose window, which I think I talked about here on the changelog, or at least  we talked about it here on Twig, it launched in October 2012.  And it's that popover experience.  So it's in the Gmail web app.  When you click on Compose or Reply, it's got this kind of pop-up window that overlays on top of your  inbox and has a couple other cool features.  It was kind of this try it out little beta feature.  It's no longer optional.  It's becoming the default for everyone.  And you're not going to have the option to opt out.  I actually have been opting out because I was so used to the old behavior.  But now that the new Compose experience is going to be the default Compose experience, I sort of finally  gave into it this week.  And it's actually really quite nice.  Over the time that it's been testing since October 2012, they've upgraded quite a bit.  You can see user icons.  When you type in addresses, you can minimize.  If you're in the middle of composing an email, you can minimize it and do more work in your inbox  without sort of losing it or saving it as a draft.  And it supports files from Google Drive.  So if you use the web-based Gmail, you'll see that you have to switch over that new Compose experience soon.  Google Analytics got some upgrades this week as well.  The real-time reports got a bunch of little sort of new dials and levers.  You can filter reports on types of events that happen as they happen.  You can break down access, real-time access to your site by desktop.  You can compare real-time data to overall data.  So if you're an analytics junkie and your site starts to get hammered with a lot of traffic, you can go into Google Analytics  and see that stuff real-time quickly now with these new updates.  Auto-complete predictions in Gmail will now include past Gmail searches.  So if I had gone into Gmail last week and typed Google IOs, I would have gotten a lot of results.  So that's kind of like auto-complete but smarter.  Gmail now kind of knows what your past searches are and will suggest them as you type.  And that is rolling out, I think, over the next few weeks.  And finally, the Chrome for Android stable channel got a big update this week.  We talked about the Google IOs and the Google Drive.  So it's a really cool thing.  It's a really cool thing.  And finally, the Chrome for Android stable channel got a big update this week.  We talked about this in the last couple of change logs.  This is the update. This is Chrome 26 for Android.  And this is the update that you get password sync, autofill sync, and a couple other performance and instability improvements.  But if you wanted to sync your passwords and your autofill, your form autofills, you'll now get that in the stable version of Android on Chrome.  And that is in the Play Store, I believe, this afternoon.  So you can get that update on your Android devices.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, Gina has her change log theme.  I now have my rants theme.  Yeah.  Leo needs one.  I don't think it's it's an Eeyore whining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, you Dan.  No, you did.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't see how you could justify 1600 bucks almost for this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's going up at 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I because I got the LTE version with tax.  It was I don't remember what it was.  1600 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just say that I'm going to wait until I try out the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think maybe they'll give you one.  You think they're going to give away?  It's too expensive.  Too expensive.  Too expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are they going to give away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nexus fives maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There is a there is a we're going to sources say there'll be a second generation Nexus seven tablet that with a better screen.  This might actually be it's from Asus again.  The Nexus seven generation two or something like that.  But they say it won't be out till July.  This is Reuters reporting two sources told us it will be powered by a Snapdragon from Qualcomm.  I presume quad core.  Google's according to this story says they want to ship as many as eight million in the second half of this year.  Seven was quite a success.  I don't.  Did you ever get numbers?  It was running on a Tegra three which was fast at the time not so fast anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty clear the Nexus seven is one of Google's most most if not the most successful harbor probably 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that really makes it easy to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I mean I feel like every every Google I.O. you either you know will probably get the newest phones the new new Nexus seven or the new Nexus phones the Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If there's a Nexus five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's often some Chrome OS product.  So I don't know if that'll be I don't I think Google Glass is too expensive.  I don't think that they will give out Google Glass to everybody at I.O.  I don't know.  They may surprise us.  That seems too expensive.  The pixel seems too expensive to me too.  Maybe five and a seven the new seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you think I guess they do.  They've done in the past.  They'll have new products to show like the queue like the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's always kind of that left field product right like the queue.  Right.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a really interesting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not swag.  It's these are developers.  They want developers right for their things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So you give out things that you want people to write software for which I think still includes Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh God yes.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No matter what you say about it Leo.  Oh no no no no no.  I mean there's no question Google is for reasons I don't understand totally in on this.  Now you just now you know I'm just going to go for it.  Yeah.  I'm just going to get worse and worse.  You're egging me on.  I remember I stood it toe to toe with Sundar Pichai at some Google events a couple of years ago saying I don't get Chrome OS.  What the hell are you doing here.  We can you can you say the Chrome OS is a success.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean when I when I said when I wrote my my pay on to love it at Google on my blog.  What's his name.  Who's the nice guy who's on the Chrome book team who's who was in our chat the phone.  Yeah.  Gee gee something.  I apologize.  Gee I know you're listening right now and I apologize but it's very late.  We like you.  Damn.  I'm having a Lucy.  His name was Lucy.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I had said that I thought that the reason the Chromebook existed was to try to show that Chrome OS was ready for prime time as an OS.  And yeah that was the you know response I got from Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean you can argue that Chrome OS is so it's part of it's Chrome right.  It's Chrome right.  And Chrome is an incredible success.  Right.  You know.  So it's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was just thinking you know with Leo's goading do I you know if I want a Windows machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No you want to look you want a Mac book you want to read the Mac book is what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But even so the advantage now is when I download stuff on in Chrome it goes straight into Drive.  It's yet another layer of integration into Google Ville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah which you're you're more than willing to do but I don't know I think you.  I don't know.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Go ahead.  Maybe it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well I think I think going in this is what the show is about living more and more and more.  A Vita Google.  Yeah.  Is is definitely mainstream.  Yeah.  Right.  It's just a question of what when.

Transcript:  So a 13 inch a 13 inch MacBook Pro with Retina is the same price as a pixel.  For that you get roughly the same you know core i5 processor.  You get more storage 128 gigs of flash storage but of course you need more storage because it's not a cloud device.  Same graphics HD 4000 graphics seven hours of battery life.  It's probably a little heavier but not much and you get that beautiful display.  And you get a full operating system.  Just seems to me more desirable to buy a Mac though I'd buy an air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah I like the air and I think it's probably a good idea to wait and see what Apple's doing with the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised to see a retina air.  And then that's something.  Now you're cooking with gas.  Now you're cooking with gas.  I don't know I mean I can't say you should you should buy this just for the screen.  You know and it's a disconnect for me is that the pixel is high end hardware aimed at a low end audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's what I was trying to say that they're trying to show is that Chrome living in the cloud is high end too.  That's what that's what Google is trying to prove.  That's what Google is trying to prove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No I think you're right.  By do the Chinese search engines working on by do got glass.  It's called by do I.  Everybody's working on everything I think that's a good thing.  Instead of you seen the pictures that get taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Feedly says in the two weeks since Google Reader shut down now three million new users.  Three million is a number three million is bigger than half a million.  That was the first number three million is a big number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Here's my question about Feedly.  I'm using it.  It's OK.  I get used to it.  It's OK.  But every time I forgets me it has me re authenticate through Google Reader.  So it doesn't seem as if it's actually.  Well no they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's just temporary.  They obviously that won't work after July when Reader shuts down.  They have to provide their own back end and that's what they're working on obviously.  OK.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So tomorrow Facebook and we will cover it during the tech news today show at 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern.  Facebook will be making an announcement.  The invitation said come see our new home on Android.  And we on Mac break weekly yesterday had Renee Richie who has some sources who says this is what he believes.  It's going to be a kind of a new launcher on an HTC phone.  He says it's not fully a new launcher.  It's a modified launcher.  And as you know if you're an Android user the launcher is the app that's running most of the time that gives you the desktop and the icons and all of that stuff.  I thought I posited it could be something as little as a new home page widget with Facebook functionality.  But he says more than that it's something more than that but something less than a launcher.  Now this is coming from Brian Chen and Nick Bilton at the New York Times.  They have very good sources.  They say the phone made by HTC uses a version of Android according to two people briefed on the announcement a special version of Android.  Some of the core features of the phone like the camera will be built around Facebook's services maybe an Instagram camera.  These are these are two people from according one one is a Facebook employee and I guess other people who have been briefed on Facebook's plans agreed.  Facebook of course isn't saying officially.  That's a that's a kind of a fork of Android kind of akin to the Kindle.  Exactly what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if they put it out there if HTC makes it a legal route basically.  Right. Yeah.  Presumably it's a version that you could put on your own rooted phone.  Well maybe too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's it would be in Facebook's interest to allow Facebook employee familiar with announcement said that when the Facebook phone is turned on it immediately displays a Facebook user's home screen.  God I don't want that.  No I don't either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of people that do want this though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there.  Yeah I think there are people who yes getting on the Internet means going on to Facebook.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah the same people who are getting on the Internet meant getting on AOL some years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but I think there are a lot of people who want a smartphone so they can check Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I talked to two of my Indian students and they said that's the case for a lot all their family back in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't deny that everybody's family all my family everybody that's how you stay in touch with friends and family.  But it's it's it's something you use because you have to not because you want to I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's just us.  And think about everything Facebook has Facebook has your entire address book messaging instead of text messaging.  You know you can call the dialer the messaging music we're talking about this last night and all about Android photos the things that you do on your phone.  Facebook has some sort of software that can do that so you can imagine a phone that's basically the Facebook phone.  I have family members I think who would love a Facebook phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Times point out that HTC once made a phone called the Cha Cha.  That had a button for posting photos directly to Facebook it sold poorly.  In 2008 INQ a phone maker based in London released a phone called the Inc.  One that integrated Facebook services into crucial areas of the device.  It was going to do an Inc.  Cloud touch which had Facebook services right on the home screen it pulled the plug on that said now we're going in another direction.  I I well you know if I'm Facebook of course I make that I think you should have a dedicated poke button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you still poke on Facebook.  No right.  You can't.  Yeah I don't think so.  I think you can.  Deprecated that.  They don't poke anymore.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought that was that whole extra app that went after snapchat.  Oh right the snapchat app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got an app called poke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But let's see if I'm on Matthew Ingram's page can I poke him.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't wake him up.  I can't poke him anymore.  Poke the bear.  Oh well he's not a friend wait a minute.  I'm sorry I went to somebody who doesn't like me apparently.  Even though he's been on the show many times.  Let's see who else.  They've mixed all these people I don't know here Veronica Belmont.  Surely she's friended me.  Yeah.  OK message.  Yeah there's a poke it's buried.  OK.  Under message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  I better not poke her though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That sends a bad message.  You could poke people if they allow you to poke them says space guy in our chat room.  Apparently he's been inquiring.  Central poking.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So we'll see tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean I would you know look if Nick Bilton and Brian X Chen on New York Times say that this is the fact Jack then this must be.  This must be it.  This will be a phone an HTC phone running a customized version of Android that's not going to be available.  That puts Facebook front and center.  And we'll see how well it does.  It just shows.  I mean that's one of the strengths of Android.  You can totally do that right.  And HTC has got nothing to lose.  They have like one percent of the market.  So why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Isn't isn't Facebook doing what's it called Facebook zero that in developing markets they're paying the access if you go to Facebook.  Oh that's interesting.  And I think I said this in the show last week that what wowed me was the did I talk about this that the really inexpensive smartphones I saw in the airport on the way back from India.  No no.  No.  OK so this is no news to to you.  I don't think but a Samsung brand three inch low res screen smartphone for one hundred dollars.  Right.  Unlock.  Yeah you get those here too.  Right.  I didn't realize it.  They're not pushing on Android smartphone Samsung again for about sixty eight dollars.  And then you know that just amazes me for the next three billion to come on.  It's it's it's an Internet access device.  That's right.  Not great but as good as we had that long ago.  That's right.  And if you but and the and the staller on a lot of that is data charges with telcos.  Well if Facebook came along and said we are the Internet.  Well and if you come to us on this phone we will pay the freight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That could be pretty powerful.  That would be interesting.  I don't think they do that in the US would they.  No no.  Only developing markets third right third world.  Yeah.  Now H somebody in the chat room said this is true that HTC because they're a big part  of the open handset alliance would it would not behooves them to release an Android phone  that didn't have the Google products on it.  So for sure this will have Google Maps and G plus and if it's jelly bean it'll have you  know Google Now and all of that.  There's no question about that.  It just may not be the here is they actually said they're saying they're going to be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Android as opposed to Amazon which tries to mask all evidence of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah you're exactly right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And by the way it's not their but their bosom buddies Microsoft.  It ain't a Microsoft product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a good point too.  It's not running Windows Phone.  Right.  RDO is doing video.  They're going to RDO is the social music site like Spotify.  They are going to do a new service a streaming video site VDIO.  It's been enclosed beta.  It's a rental and purchasing platform not a subscription service.  So it's more like Voodoo than it is like Netflix.  But it does have social which was what RDO did so well with music.  Gina's watching.  This is 40.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Leo's watching.  This is 60.  You sign in with your Facebook account.  You have to be a RDO unlimited subscriber in the US or the UK if you want to use it.  This is going to get crazy soon.  This whole cord cut in space.  I find this fascinating.  You saw that Aereo won its cord case which I thought was great.  I'm sure the networks aren't happy and the channels locals aren't happy.  We have mentioned Aereo before many times.  It's the Barry Diller company that started in Manhattan is now spreading to the rest of the country.  The local channels have been suing them saying you're reselling our content.  We're not getting any money.  Aereo says no we're not.  What we're selling is little tiny antennas in New York City that are connected to the internet.  You log on to your account and you can see New York City local television in real time live without a cable account.  But what you're leasing is an antenna.  And the courts agreed.  It's not copyright violation.  They're not selling the content.  They're leasing an antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That was the if you if you care about this the good news.  The bad news of the week was the resale decision.  Digital resale.  Tell us about that.  Oh you didn't see that.  So I forget which level of court said that digital properties are not like real properties and there is no first sale doctrine.  No right to reselling digital properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And what would that how would that change things.  It has to do with music for instance.  So if I buy if I buy it's in other words illegal to sell used digital music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Or books or anything.  So so you have no you have no rights.  Does that apply to domain names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's content we're talking about content content is a copyright issue.  Yeah.  Now this judge is a federal judge in New York think it's trial judge.  So now this could go on to appeal of course.  You know this week's ruling judge Richard J. Sullivan talking about a service called re Digi which is an online marketplace letting you sell your legally acquired digital music for free.  You can acquire digital music files and buy digital music from others at a fraction of the price.  So I bought you know the Jay Z album the black album for ten dollars.  I'm going to sell it on this site for five dollars.  You could buy it.  I get some money and you get a half price Jay Z album.  Judge Sullivan says re Digi infringes capital's exclusive right of reproduction as well as its exclusive right of distribution.  The court cannot of its own accord condone the wholesale application of the first sale defense to the digital sphere.  Well you know is that is that bad news.  It actually kind of makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But here's here's where it goes.  And I don't understand the implications of this and they'll be fought out.  What does it mean in terms you know somebody said afterwards well Apple really does own my music.  Yeah you're licensing it.  You're licensing that's it.  But but you pay the price to supposedly buy it.  And you're not.  So the hope was always that yes I did buy it.  I can move it across my platforms.  I can do this with that I can do that with it because I bought it.  I could give it to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But no so apparently this ruling doesn't really address that licensing versus selling distinction.  It's merely saying that you're making a copy for somebody and that is an unauthorized reproduction which you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're going to be fought out and the implications will come out.  Yeah.  You know I'm surprised somebody hasn't said it's easier to give a gun in this country than it is a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In 2001 the U.S. Copyright Office argued strongly against allowing consumers the right to resell digital works.  I don't think you know this is also that issue of well if I die what happens to my music collection or my e-book collection.  It goes away.  I can't handle it.  And I think this is not unreasonable to say well if you want to hand down books buy books.  If you want to hand down records.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No because because what if what if books just aren't.  Let's make up this world.  Dystopian though some will think it is can't afford to print books anymore.  There's not printed right there just digital.  So now it's not an alternative to the analog product.  It is the product.  It is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well in return for the convenience and the and the reduced cost of that you don't get to hand it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But the reduced cost is BS because because the manufacturing cost was actually got down to a nub.  If if if if your uncle your your smart uncle Jed had a library of 12000 books that you inherited.  That would be a fine thing.  Now they would go up and smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  Because they because they are smoke their bits.  I don't think I did.  I don't think a digital native generation sees this as a problem.  I think a generation like us that's transitional between the physical goods and the digital goods might.  But do digital natives.  Gina you're the youngest person here by a mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I'm still pretty old though.  I mean you know I burn mixed CDs in college.  I'm still pretty okay.  You're too old for this.  All right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think my 18 year old thinks he owns any records.  And it's reinforced for him because if he loses the iPod it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And doesn't care.  And he's like fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In fact increasingly people aren't even buying records.  You're just listening to Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I think that that's the thing right.  I think that the concept of ownership is changing.  I think there is this you don't have the collectors you know my dad he used to like tape TV shows.  And then he would like label them.  We had this entire shelf full of like stuff that data tape.  Now what do you do.  You don't want that.  You don't want it.  I mean I know a lot of people who have big hard drives full of media they've been collecting over the years.  But I think increasingly that's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the truth is even though the law doesn't support it you can give that hard drive to your heirs.  I mean they've got it.  It's not like it does really go away.  It may not.  They don't have legal right to it.  But it's not I mean it's not really disappearing.  It's not like it goes up and smoke as soon as you die.  Right.  So you know and I don't know if your heirs want that hard drive.  They certainly don't want the VHS tapes with every episode of Cheers on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah I have.  Now I got to confess this from my days I have boxes and boxes of videotapes with me on them.  Every appearance I made I thought it was a special thing that I was on TV and I'd say that and I can't throw them out.  You don't want those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it.  You got to you got to trans convert them to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  People ask me didn't you save any of the shows that you didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The one thing that I wanted to finally came out was my appearance on Moonlighting.  That you should save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And thank God for YouTube.  It's too bad they closed down last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think when you get to the place where you're like if I really want a song if I want to hear a song or watch a show I feel reasonably confident that I will be able to find it online.  I don't need to keep it on a hard drive in my house.  I think that it completely changes right.  The need to like hoard the things that you love goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13

So if you if you've got your phone in your hand you've got only one finger available  and you're in Google Maps you know you can pinch with two fingers to zoom on a map but  you can also zoom with one finger.  So the way that you do it and it's kind of hidden it's not very intuitive.  You double tap on the map and then you pull down with one finger and it'll zoom you in  and out on maps really super super handy especially if you're you're navigating around town you've  only got one hand to do so awesome little video there showing this this working.  So double tap and then pull down pull up.

I was that I just cheated.  No that's not cheating.  I'm a cheat too because I don't use this tool but Google has released for the iPad and now  for Android and iOS as well a way to if you're but you have to be.  So I'm not a Google Apps user.  I mean I am technically I think but they have released.  Did you even mention this in the changelog.  Did you know what they release a new tool a new app that lets you open these.  Let me see if I can find it here.  I'm well prepared.  It was it's in the it's in the notes.  Here it is.  Quick office for apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No I didn't mention this.  All right.  See I found something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Free iPad Android and iPhone.  You have to be an apps customer.  Quick office is meant for business users that have to share files and collaborate with users  who don't yet use Google Docs.  I think they acquired this about a year ago and Quick Office and it was always a great  little app.  So now that you can get it for free because it used to be quite expensive it will open  Microsoft Office Microsoft you know Word PowerPoint Excel documents should save them back into  Google Drive.  You could do round tripping so you can edit office files and save them back out so that  those poor people who don't use Google Apps for business but do use Microsoft Office can  see your changes.  So this is nice.  Quick Office was acquired on June 2012.  They had native apps at the time for iPhone iPad Android and Symbian.  I don't think they'll do Symbian anymore but Quick Office for iPhone now free for Android  as well.  And that's good actually because you can round trip Microsoft Office Docs.
