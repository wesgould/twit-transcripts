Transcript:  We've had problems with headsets and it's not unusual when you throw them in a suitcase  They tend to get the damage and the mics sound bad so that I think they'll do better. I hope it will yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's much better  general B had me that came with a  Holder which would weigh twice as much as the mic get rid of it. Yeah, so I have a little tiny tripod  Mike goes it my headset goes into the bike itself. I know it's that nice nice

Thanks for filling in while I was gone  Also here Matthew Ingram Stacey's out today, but Matthew is here chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review  CJR org and Matthew is in snowbound Ottawa. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't think we've been in this room before have we Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is new so we move you move. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Julie the Nazi books behind

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had something like this in no no Nazi book no he had the third Reich or something behind him over his shoulder  I said maybe I'm okay. I mean it's important, but  So I  Got the pixel four while I was gone unfortunately didn't get to bring it on the trip  Which would I've liked and I both are orange mm-hmm for the orange twins  I  Am kind of amazed at the negativity  We're on a Madia who I love writing for ours Technica  Slammed it back and forth left and right basically the conclusion even Florence Ion said it's not worth it. Don't upgrade  People are I think miffed because Google didn't change didn't do enough in this new one to make it  Different enough from the pixel 3. I don't think they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a nice phone, but it still doesn't justify the price. I'm gonna show you two reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all let me just do this again  Don't you think the face recognition is ice Ron said it's slow. It's not slow. It's not slow. It's fantastic  My own works pretty good. I have logic forever  No, it was it was the lights or something normally finger on the back and it's boom. It's done. No no no no no no much better  It no no no it was almost instant  It's almost instant in fact  I took it out of my front pocket a second ago  And it was already unlocked them in like the minute it caught sight of me, so I like that do it again  Well, this is not a good. It's got a light shining right in it and my face is at an angle to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know if this is a good mine is working in this not even in front of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's yes, see it's not I have to do, but see if I do that so let me do it again with me  That's all just just have to go you have to face it around look how fast that was it's pretty quick  I'm facing it. You don't want it to unlock if you're not facing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then it would just unlock willy-nilly every now and then it struggles with my sunglasses, but for the most part  It's really quick

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean this is the same thing and I have to say part of the reason it doesn't bother me is the same thing we  went through with iPhones a couple of years back where they took the fingerprint out and  You know you just get used to it  But this to me is the killer I mean absolute killer feature of this first of all and Google showed this at Io  But the idea that I can make a recording and while I'm making the recording it will live transcribe it and quite well  Even down to punctuation. I don't even have to say you know exclamation mark period  comma new paragraph  Well, you know that's one of the things that's interesting about this it will go back and amend it does editing after the fact as it  It seems to understand context. Yeah, you use this as you're going out to do reporting you got a  Yeah, that is a killer pretty high quality and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dependent upon that hardware is it I think it is because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the new Google assistant on on device so one of the reasons  It's so fast is it's doing this super accurate transcription, and I have to say super accurate transcription  Nobody comes close and it's doing it on device, so that's one thing  I really like I'm gonna save that out and then this to me, and I had to put it in the  Control panel the widgets up here because it was on by default. It's called live caption now  The idea is if you're ever watching video or listening to audio it will automatically transcribe it  I'm gonna play a little bit of my tech guy show  So I'm listening to a podcast and it's live captioning it as I'm listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty daggum fast. I'm gonna use that cheating trying to watch the impeachment hearings when I was you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's watch the impeachment hearings great idea. Let's watch so we'll go to MSNBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you go already Melbourne, that's okay. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Nicole Wallace and and so now it's this the delay here is it's opening the stream to MSNBC  It's buffering so same thing and you can move this by the way  Yeah, now how much would you pay so and it does that it works with it works with YouTube too  So if you're watching a YouTube video  It's gonna transcribe that as you're watching it  So I have to and it's very accurate. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you kill for this in your come reporting days? Oh, yeah, I mean this is this is worth the price of admission

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus I could turn the sound down and I could continue to watch the hearings while we do the show. Yep  YouTube's transcripts it's a thousand times better than that  It's better to you know, sometimes on TV, they'll have closed captions, but they're often done by computers and they're awful usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually kind of stunning you save the file

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of this I don't know. That's a good question. You can't of course when you record

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't see much of an option so it is more of a turn it on or turn it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do recommend adding that live caption button to your controls there. I want to save the file sometimes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it actually shows up under your volume menu as well  Yeah, it shows up under your volume if I do volume I can also do it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you don't need to add it to the controls. That's nice interesting. It was on by default  I first I couldn't figure out what is going on  And you can move it anywhere on the screen so  Google mentioned this at IO. Yeah, I feel like  You know all the negative reviews I've read are well, it's just kind of more the same  I think it's pretty good. That's a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Resident on there and everything else that can come with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right amazing. That's right the camera. What do you think yet? You're the photography guy the camera is really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it better than the three? That's the question. I think it's just a touch better. It's not much better  I have a friend that's using the three and we put some side-by-side comparisons up and  His name is OB. I'm not gonna say his last name his name is OB and  We all know it's one Kenobi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay, you know some famous people and and when we put them side-by-side

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can see a little more detail in the four  Yeah versus the three not to say that the three is bad, but there's still just a little more detail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the zoom because remember that was one of the things in the announcement stop at 5x. Yeah, don't optical zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still smooth, you know soft. Don't don't go any further than 5x. Okay  2x is really good though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really good. So one of the things Ron complained about and a lot of complain about I don't blame them  Is that every other phone now has three lenses including a super wide this didn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess that's a preference though. I don't particularly care for those super wise  Don't look great right because a lot of times you're gonna get soft edges  Yeah in your images and distortion. I just don't care for that. Yeah, give me a tele any telephoto any day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  So I mean in this the 90 Hertz everybody said oh come on Google because you have to turn the  Brightness up to a certain point but and I mean, I think everybody knows this but I'll show you anyway  If you turn on developer options, which you know you do by tapping  The build number seven times once developer options are on you can say I want 90 Hertz all the time  And I don't know do you notice a difference with 90 Hertz I did not I've turned it off actually  It's it's it's gonna kill battery a little bit faster, but but they they say people say it's buttery smooth animation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's buttery. I didn't see a difference  The button in the 60 and it looks and feels just fine  And my battery is lasting pretty much most of the day. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're not against it and you're just saying I think is overkill

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not really doing anything for the user experience for me. Anyway, it's really for people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at numbers and say I want the phone that has you know, the bigger number

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what phone did you have before and I forget the pixel 2. Oh you you jumped you skipped

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're gonna be even happy. I mean anybody who had a pixel 2 probably should get a 4, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be the only way I would upgrade I wouldn't necessarily go from 3 to the 4. Yeah, it's not a huge of my 3a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  But that transcription see I mean if you if that's pretty damn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  APK out there for it and well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said by the end of the year that the captions and the transcription will come to the we'll see welcome to the three

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the new assistant and so the issue is how much it's all on it's all on phone  So the question is how much hardware do you need to do that?  And is there specialized hardware to do that and so right so as we've seen with some of the camera features you can put  It on the 3a  But it's not gonna be quite as good as enough on a phone with the additional hardware that kind of thing now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of the camera we talked about the night sight  Astrophotography feature just built in have you played with it?  It's AI and a lot of people tend to forget that it's AI  I've played around with it, and I've also installed a manual camera app  to where I could actually set up like a 10 second exposure and I compared the two and  The AI does a pretty good job, but there's nothing like setting up your ISO

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is a phone it is yes  Although you make an interesting point if you're going to do astrophotography do it right you're gonna want to do it with a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know no it's well. I'll have to show you I guess I could put it into believe it. No, that's all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We get the idea  And there's a lot of examples in fact even in the twit community a number of people posted there  You know just quick and dirty. I I took a picture of the sky right it's pretty  I mean, it's kind of neat that you can do that. I have that capability

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a proof of concept  And I could spend a little more time with it  Hopefully I'll be able to spend a little more time over the holidays while we're not in the studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a hands-on photo all about using the pixel for that's what I want okay asking you shower

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When the president says he'd like something does that mean it's an order

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again voluntold folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Leo did you order a pixel book go absolutely not  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Price why pricing again it's overpriced underpowered and it's you like the grippy bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just wavy. I think you like saying that I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cannot lie those other brothers can deny  When a pixel book comes in  The itty-bitty, I don't know what anyway. I think we're gonna have to stop right there. Yeah, please do  All right, so in other words, I just what do you why do you think the negativity?  From everybody all in sundry on the pixel for I don't know I again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a lot of people were really down on the battery life for a good reason  But I think there was because they were testing the pixel for another I think they were prejudging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was they saw the size of the battery which is smaller than the pixel 3x right and they said oh that can't work  All right, but I got to point out the iPhone  11 has a smaller bad. It's not a big battery. I was not it's not a huge battery  But there's a lot you can do with software and chip tuning and I feel like there's some phone fatigue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there is that they want they want every new one to be orders of magnitude better  it's not enough that it's just better or a little better has to be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Change the world better. Yeah, but is that fair? You show off these days is to criticize tech company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a thread on the twit community. Mm-hmm, and I've seen it and read it in other places saying I  I don't want to read tech reviews anymore because I'm all excited about my new  XYZ and they're just dumping open on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because they went from one extreme to the other from utopia dystopia from fanboy to smash it and  And that's the way people show off now and it's turned into kind of almost a tech nihilism

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it that those negative reviews get more clicks more views you bet, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I also think it's in the it's in our psyche because we have these same  conversations about big tech and of course Jeff's defends big tech and and others sometimes me say are  And you know, what? Oh, can you get me my grumpy cat cover?  Sunday Times did you see that this week the New York Times Sunday magazine? Oh, yeah  the whole magazine that was devoted to how  Crappy the internet is that's Kevin Ruse's article online cesspool got you down  Bugs the F  I don't think they're actually covered with whatever that round stuff  So this is the cover of the magazine  Which has grumpy cat  Who's passed away so it's a symbol simulator or sauce  Simulated grumpy cat so the internet did this is the the tagline the internet didn't turn out the way we hoped so this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We thought it was gonna convert everybody to a good form of Catholicism and instead we got a darned reformation and a 30 years war

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somehow he got Gutenberg in there without even  Impressive very very impressive  No, I think that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I mean I've talked about that with people about how when I first discovered the internet and blogs and Twitter  It would all seemed so fantastic and it was all gonna be this wonderful sort of democratizing force  Which it has been but we've seen all the downsides of it in the last little while

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's downsides of mankind though, isn't it Matthew? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what comes to mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whose fault is that? Is that is that the fault is in our stars or is it on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a bit of both to me so you can't like obviously people, you know, Facebook did not invent  People trolling or believing things that are wrong or  conspiracy theories the good Facebook the Facebook does  use the algorithm to  Make those things travel faster and farther and more people see them. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the good and bad about it. We we have this  Everybody has a voice now, you know regardless of who you are regardless of your stature  Everybody has a voice and see we all that would be a great thing, right?  But at the same time the trolling crap that I see on a daily basis. Everybody has a voice even

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry Matthew I didn't hear you there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just saying that some some of those voices get amplified and those are choices that Facebook and Twitter make

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think I think that that's that software is still dumb right so so  Retargeting advertising right you looked at those boots once on Amazon. You bought the boots and they still following you around six weeks later  That's just dumb software. It doesn't mean that it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dastardly software. It's dumb software, right? And I think you can blame us a little bit in our expectations  We were naive. We were sure we thought oh everybody gets a voice  And we didn't think of the you know, everybody gets a voice  So it's so as you said instead of getting the the great Catholic  You know explosion we got the Reformation but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yesterday called black software  which  looks really good as by a I think a provost at New York University and  I just got through the first five ten pages  So I don't know yet, but but what he's arguing is that that all the  But as far as I can tell the talk about Black Lives Matter and such he said no this goes back 30 40 years  where  African Americans were left out of this technology and there was a core of kind of renegade people who used it  I think we can't  Overlook yes, so far right wing bozos and Russians  Misused this stuff. Yes, but there's other people who were always left out who now have an opportunity and have tools  To gather an act and I think that gets left out all the time, especially by mainstream media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your times and it's definitely like the pendulum has definitely swung, you know at first it was way over on me  This is the best thing ever and it's gonna you know, it's gonna usher in like  Democracy around the world and make people's lives better and now it's you know  We're everyone is focusing on the negative for a pile of reasons  Not me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That man can't even type

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfectly well look at his twitter feed  You know, but there's lots of symbols there's there's Russia there's lots of symbols of everything that's gone wrong  I think it's it was foolish of us to think that it would all be some utopian  Wonder wonderland, right but in in I and this is what I guess what I want to  Say for myself anyway  I do think I've been a little bit the pendulum had did swing for me and I went from being a utopian to a dystopian and  Oh glum about and I think I want to kind of get back into the middle where thank you Jeff  There there are clear benefits and there are clear documents and that's life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a good way of swinging back to the good side of it is is one of the things if you've already implemented  And that's the community is is finding that I didn't you hope you know  That's really interesting these finding your tribe if you know if you're gonna have if you're gonna use social media  Have your followers or what have you but trim down that that stack of followers that you have and you'll see the difference to just  in your mood

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Automatically I read design it too, right? I mean so Jimmy Wales has started a new social network  I went I can't figure it out. I love you. I can't figure it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing there. That's why you can't figure it out. It's it's like  multiple chat rooms about completely, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mostly about  cryptocurrency as far as I can tell  Here's the funny thing. Here's the funny headline in the BBC  Thousands flock to wiki his Facebook forever. Okay, if that's success you got a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Said like like calling it a Facebook rival is like me  My neighbor has a garage sale and I say my neighbor is now an Amazon rival, right?  Technically that's true, right?  But there's no way in a million years like I want to see where it goes and I think it's interesting  But to cast it as a Facebook rival is ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did Wales call it a Facebook rival or did the headline writers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we can't blame Jimmy Wales for actually an extension of wiki Tribune of his  Effort at new where he was to try to empower people to do news  but it  Yeah, I love Jimmy and I just haven't been able to get dug into it. Yes. I only have two friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not gonna bother myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not much there. So will it become something maybe but at the moment it's there's a lot of over the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  efforts to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God diaspora remember that Mastodon. Hello  Mastodon's more against Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mastodon still around people use it. I use it people still use it. I asked her still around. Yeah, I think so so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how it works if you give them money  $100 a year at $12.99 a month you can jump the list. I'm currently  $73,940 on the waiting list to get in  Oh really?  but I when I first signed up and when you first sign up you will get in and  Get to pick a bunch of topics and I'm not kidding 90% of them were cryptocurrency related. Yeah, which kind of turned me off  That's what that's actually when I said I'm not gonna give you a hundred bucks. All right jump the line and get in here  So that might be part of the problem. I don't know  We've seen this  It's over and over again. Yeah, I one of the reasons that I'm John Mack if he have anything to do with that  One of the reasons I agree with you and that  Local communities might be the solution and one of the things about Mastodon that makes it interesting is it's federated local community small  Is that a local community then has this natural affinity and I think also avoids because people almost feel like they know each other  Avoid right some of the worst excesses of Twitter and Facebook, right? So our twit community I  Think is in a way a template for the future of social  Online which is I think smaller because it's really been the conversation's been fascinating  smaller local or or maybe more  aligned around certain interests  Things but then is there still a role for a big global thing like Facebook and Twitter?  It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you still want to keep in touch with  Auntie so-and-so or cousin so-and-so then that's that's where Facebook is kind of that network effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also even a lot of Facebook is going towards like private groups, right? A lot more people using private groups  That's good. I mean even Zuckerberg said like the future is encrypted  Ephemeral, you know, what's app groups?  Lots of people are moving into those people are using like next door and stuff like that as sort of community  So I think that sort of broad mass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social network is already going away. We're seeing another transformation and that's what you're gonna see is continuous  Yeah transformation. I'll tell you the thing that both bugs me and amazes me is the the and you knew this already  Because you're in Canada  Matt and Matthew and because Jeff you travel all the time is the predominance of what's app?  Every everywhere world it is the default everywhere for for communication for community for group everywhere  I went and now listening to the impeachment testimony  Apparently, it's also how government gets done  I found that kind of both disturbing and amazing that all of this back channel stuff with Sondland and others was going on on  Unprotected cell phones and what's app?  Mm-hmm. So and those of us who are in the tech community know how insecure it is and how problematic it is  It's owned by Facebook, but the rest of the world everybody it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was at my the final meeting in my transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression  In Milan last week in Bellagio  And one of the people there were the really bright people former Obama White House  Kept bringing up tick-tock and kept saying we have all these nice little rules  We're trying to make for Twitter and Facebook and it's meaningless  When you get a company like tick-tock there, that's gonna have wholesale  Erasure of content about even though they apparently they're letting it in Hong Kong stay in in the US these for a while  But what do you do with companies from other countries where you're not gonna have the control that we think we're gonna have over them in our  regulated worlds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tick-tock is owned of course by a Chinese company the CEO of tick-tock this week said, oh no, they don't tell us  They don't tell us what the fact that there is no Hong Kong content  They don't tell me anything  He said he said with a straight face that if the Chinese government asked him for information he would say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not Chinese though  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess he's been along with the purchase but yeah, it's owned by a Chinese company a Chinese company is always gonna do as  Like American company is always gonna do with the Chinese government whatever the government says you have to call your bluff. You don't have a choice  Is there a guy's have you guys used to talk? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just fine you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you guys used to talk yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just vine you it's fine basically you ever used vine you've used to talk. Yeah. Yeah, I have no desire

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No desire  I think you could do that  But see you have that and you have snapchat and when I look at the audiences for both of those platforms  I just don't see that my audience is on any of those platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Jeff and you've talked about this before vine has created stars it has and  It was on it. Yeah. Well, that was the weird thing is that Twitter bought it and killed it which is insane because you have this  That's so stupid so along comes well they killed it along comes tick-tock and they just it was originally musically  And they just said well, we'll do the same thing. Yeah, and it and the same thing happened. You've got stars. You've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there was a woman who was doing nothing but throwing slices of processed cheese to have them stick to things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's funny the car brilliant. Oh man. I want to watch that over and over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where my audience is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We sound like old farts there's great there is so there's at least unvined this happened  Comedians who became famous on line batch  I I think there's some of that similar stuff easier to make from snapchat stuff. I  can't  Okay, now you really sound old I  I  Made an account and I posted a video and I just to just see it and I don't I don't know  Here's the real housewives of tick-tock  Yep, my audience. Yeah, it's them. It's the mime machine imagine Trump on tick-tock  Why is the neon tip tick-tock? Yeah, he's getting well these people got to get him on there it will be yeah  What's that could Brad Parscale's got a Brad  See, that's the problem with having a social media maven  their their best buy date is  quick a  Year from now everything you know is wrong. Yeah. Yeah. What's Twitter Brad's like 40? Yeah, but that's an old man now  Oh, yeah, you know how to buy Facebook ads, but do you know about tick-tock Brad? Come on?  Yeah with a program  Our show today, I actually think this is the one of the few one of the few things  It really is great on the internet and I use it like crazy. It's privacy dot  Calm we tell you all the time don't use the same password everywhere  Right, but you'd use use the same credit card everywhere. Well, that's nuts with privacy.com  You get a brand new virtual visa or mastercard number for every purchase you make online with one click  I have it as a plug-in in my browser, which makes it very easy  But even better than that  You can lock it down. So as soon as it's used by a merchant only that merchant can use it  Nobody can steal it and use it. You can set a limit which I love  I know exactly how big my charges are so I have one for every for Amazon for everyone  In fact when I do business with somebody new that's the right away. I sign up for I just  Did a subscription with a vitamin store and I never had bought anything from them before  Right and here's the other reason you want to use privacy comm you can pause it  so when I sign up for subscriptions, I always use privacy comm because  You know, sometimes it's hard to cancel these subscriptions the easiest way to cancel subscription you pause the car  Then you get that great email. Hey, your car doesn't work anymore. Give us a new one and you go never mind. Goodbye  Privacy it is awesome and refunds work  Even if you pause or close the card, by the way, you could freeze and unfreeze cards on and off at will  You put the put it the Chrome web store has a browser extension  So you're doing chrome you can also buy which means also you do it in the new edge. You can do it in brave  There's an Android and iOS app  I I love it. You can link your virtual cards now this I should mention this  You either link it to your checking account or your debit card. So it isn't a charge card, right?  It is it is immediately gonna be debited from your county either through your debit card or your checking account  I don't mind that I don't you know, that's that's not why I'm using it  I'm using it because I really want security and this is awesome  Spending limits per charge per month or per year  And your virtual cards are locked to a merchant so you don't ever have to worry about your card gets hacked  No, but no big deal you if you freeze it or you destroy it and you don't have to change it anywhere else  You'll get a decline email or push  If somebody tries to use the card at another location then you know a hacker got my card, right?  They're PCI DSS compliant. That means they're real credit cards same security standards as your bank. I  Shouldn't call it a credit card. It's more like a debit card really sensitive information is secured using strong encryption  in fact  They they do they go an extra step with split key encryption and partial keys are held by separate employees  So it really is private now I  I use it all the time, but I don't think I ever do more than 12 a month and that's you get that for free  That's the personal plan up to 12 cards a month  But they but they notice there are people making hundreds of cards a month  So they created new plans pro and teams for $10 a month to get the pro plan you get everything in the free plan plus  Automatically 1% cash back on all purchases up to 36 cards a month if you're making more than one a day  I don't know more security more privacy features. That's $10 a month  And if you have a team in fact, this would be a great thing to do in a business  $25 a month you get all the pro stuff plus a dedicated account manager 60 cards a month transaction limits tailored to your business lead needs  This is so they're really expanding their offering since we started talking about privacy. We've they've been a sponsor for some time  I've been using them for even longer literally for years  Privacy believes customers should have full control of their data  So they give their customers access to transaction data via a webhook API  People watch the show probably know what that means. It means it's easy to get that information  Of course, I just have the privacy app and I get notifications  I get all the information about every single card to I always turn on two-factor authentication  They support that so my cards are super safe super secure. I use it for every subscription  I use it anytime. I'm on a merchant site  I don't know and I have one for every single site  I use a lot too because why not protect your privacy protect your money  Virtual cards this company does it so well and they have the best name privacy.com  To learn more get a $5 credit off your first purchase go to privacy.com slash twig  In fact do that anyway, because that way they'll know you saw it here and that helps us privacy.com  Slash twig and now they've got the pro and the team versions as well. So Micah Sargent was laughing at me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I started here. Yeah, cuz I was in the host office, you know making a purchase online  I pulled out my bunch of burner cards that you have burner cards for online purchases and he's like dude  What are you doing? It's all privacy. Yeah  I do now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much easier and I often have subscriptions I just go  I just I go through the list of privacy. I should show you I go to the list a pause it pause it pause it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and then he told me about the subscription idea, especially for like Netflix Hulu or whatever. I just set it up pause it  It's so much easier. Oh, thanks, but he laughed at me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey speaking of I see the chat room says new new story just came in  PayPal is buying honey. Oh boy  For get ready for this honey, if you don't know is a browser plug-in  Lisa uses it like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congrats honey, that's a nice payday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honey I'm home  I'm moving right along. Let's see here  Stadia, oh see I told you there was Google in this show. I  I don't none of your gamers. Are you a gamer? Not anymore. No, sir, Matthew. I don't think you're a gamer. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am now you want to talk about people ragging on some technology. Yeah, but deservedly I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so stadia has launched but it's a slow launch I checked and I won't get mine till November 26  So I cancelled that of course, I don't want it. How about you Karsten? Do you want it? Um, I'm I'm waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's not it's not a thing yet. It's not it's I spent $130 to get this magic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First-day controller and a Google Chrome ultra which I already had anyway, you know, they should have done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should have done they should have gmailed it they should have had it be an invite only service  Yeah, where oh, you're right make it a make it like sexy  Yeah, make it because they're obviously slow launching it so they can build their servers up infrastructure  Yeah, cuz this this kind of thing takes a ton of infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so you $130 one time per just  Listen at home and see if this is something you would do  $130 one time purchase you get a three month trial for that after that $10 a month  Do you get the games for free?  No, you get one game for free, but the premium games you pay for just like you would in the store $60  Now the difference is you don't really own the game it's on their servers. You never get a copy of it  It's on their servers, right and you lose out on a lot of game features like achievements  There's no achievements. So serious. I don't think a serious gamers gonna do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well in their defense if you're Xbox person or whatever you can buy the game  Did you put it on your Xbox you can buy it digitally and it's stored up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't get physical disk, but can I put it on my Xbox or do it?  Can I only play it on stadia? No, you know you can play it. I have I have like maybe 20

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PlayStation 4  physical this that you already bought and  hundreds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I own hundreds of PlayStation 4 games, no, I don't care about the disc no  It was just I'm just saying can I play it out other than on stadia?  I mean I bought a game, but I thought it was locked to stadia. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Word it, but I'm just not a really plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You better have a gigabit  You're right this streaming on it. The 4k is apparently not very good quality. I want to play Red Dead Redemption 2  That's one of the I think 15 games. It's available $60. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how did a really good job with his demo on hands-on tech? Yeah watch that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That hot episodes good. Mm-hmm  The verge spoke to bungee the developers of destiny 2  That's the free game and bungee said yes stadia's version is not the same 4k version as on other platforms  It renders at 1080p and then is upscaled. Yep, that ain't 4k not at all  Redem Redemption  Euro gamer confirmed the game only renders at 1440p and then is upscaled

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I love that. We live in a world where we can bitch and moan about oh my god. It's not streaming 4k

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but the thing is car but I'm paying for 4k. They're paint you're gonna pay for that and you have it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The free tiers coming when's the free tier coming next year free tier. So here we go. This is a  this is a  Anthony's Mac book  Okay, and what game are we playing Anthony destiny to the free the freebie here?  I'm gonna have to prop it up. I can hold that with you. I got use those muscles for something  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is still loading loading

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loading that's normal. It loads that slow on Xbox to yeah  Oh here what that looks good there that looks more that looks like 4k. Watch me get greased in minutes  I'm sorry to do this to your account Anthony  Oh  Now I'm in the water

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That doesn't look bad actually. It looks pretty good. That looks better than what mr. Howell was showing up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, and now I should mention should I shoot this I?  Don't know how trigger it Oh triggers I forgot this is Xbox. I mean that PlayStation yeah, so  this is  This is  What I was gonna say I forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See now you like it, but see before mr. Carson  Tried to give us a little bit of grief. Sorry. Who is Google marketing?  Stadia-2 game what's the target audience for for Google market and stadia?  Is it the real gamer is it the casual gamer is it the people that play Candy Crush?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the weird thing is no Candy Crush is it's definitely not for the Candy Crush people right and it's definitely not for the  Real gamers because they're gonna shell out for a PC right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now you take that middle tier and tell them they're gonna have to pay X amount of dollars per month plus pay another say  60 bucks for a really good-looking game  Why would they do this and have the same lackluster performance when they could just go and get?  This is ps4 or Xbox or what have you Google failed on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Start adventure alright. I'm starting yeah, I kind of agree with you actually cuz I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean technically actually this looks great, and I don't feel like there's much latency. Did you feel Anthony there was a lot of latency  Latency would be the issue. Oh, I know what I was gonna say. We are on a 10 gigabit symmetric. Yeah here  Here I know those people know this is an unusually good connection  I don't know what's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a shield it looks this and this looks good just from here, but it's not gonna happen at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know have they solved the latency issues. Do you think that's the real question and can Google's magic?  Fix the latency problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your like too many variables

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't tell what the jitter and latency is gonna be alright, so I'm now regretting canceling it, but  That was pretty fun be fine with and I played destiny on the Xbox it very comparable right, but there's no achievements  There's no I can't play with anybody else or can I supposedly you can?  Only stadia. Oh and have you muted Jeff?  Yeah, you're sorry  You know just been quiet for like 10 minutes. I thought I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a social angle to all this sort of only against other stadia people only within stadia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing I thought was kind of interesting is you can be watching some of your you know  So you likes YouTube stream and then click the link and join them in game. That's not out yet, right?  I it's a very typical Google rollout. It's beta. I agree  I think this Martin wouldn't cars is right making an invitation only and everybody then we'd all be saying  How do I get in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Having everybody test it and pay a premium price for it. That's not Jimmy Wales is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True yeah, he lost me right at the front  Stand next to the microphone there so we can hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just come over here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know when you're looking at buying the next gen like PS 5 like that's another $500  That's the real decision. Yeah, like I could just buy a game and play the free tier right so like it's not right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So free is next year. What will you lose if you're not paying 10 bucks a month?  No 4k, okay, which you're not getting  Any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is probably probably you're better off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be and the other reason that people I  Think the whole idea for this was that you Jeff could play it on a Chromebook  Not that you want to but you could and that we could play it on our pixel  You have to have a pixel phone to do it, but if you have a pixel phone  clip and cable not included  You need some additional hardware, but that was that's the premise of this right is that  Low-end hardware could play high-end games, but that's not high-end  Well that looked what I was just doing for those of you couldn't see it on destiny to look pretty good  I would say the game experience was decent. You know as good as it  You know I would want it to be but it's 40 for titles confirmed  Cyberpunk 27 and 7 which is gonna be a very hot title that will be available Baldur's Gate 3  4k with HDR Mortal Kombat  We already have more  Controllers 70 bucks  You know the you know what the cloud already can I just say what the real problem is the elephant in the room  Google kills stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Randomly all the time I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know I don't think any gamer wants to invest because you are investing in a platform  I don't think they want to invest in a platform that could go away in months true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real gamers like he was like mr. Carson was discussing they'll go out and spend a couple thousand dollars on a rig  Yeah, just to play the games that they don't that they enjoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me take a break  I want to talk about nightingale and the Google health care project because I'm really curious what Jeff and Matthew have to say about  That when I was I was gone when this broke and I'm I don't know did we talk about it last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We did we did okay, so that's a terrible tease that none of us was here last week. He said and right no mr. Mr

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, no, I was here too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you were oh well, I'll tell you we'll also talk about I know this is news  The Supreme Court agreeing to take up Google's appeal versus Oracle  Not that case that will never  But a case that was very poorly decided and I  Think we have to investigate is what is the Supreme Court gonna take up because this is not the first time the Supreme Court's  rule on this case  But first a word from the best browser ever brave  Then you might say no chrome's the best browser ever most people use Chrome book brave is Chrome. It's taking the Chrome  Code base which is open source  Taking out the bad stuff leaving in the good stuff and adding some really good stuff on top of it  It's a next-generation web browser  built by a team that unlike Google is focused on privacy and as as a result of  Securing the browser you also get amazing speed much better performance with privacy by default  Brave gives you control over who has access to what you're doing online and that gives you  Super fast performance up to six times faster than the competitors, which also means on a laptop less battery life  It'll reduce data costs  I like brave because it looks like chrome and supports chrome extensions all the chrome extensions  You can use the chrome web store, but I don't have to worry about things like ad blocking  Tracker blocking in fact, I would say it does a better job of tracking blocking than any other browser including Firefox  brave is  impressive  It really and I've talked to be crypt in fact, we did a triangulation with her  She's one of the people who does the security side of brave  I know the people on the brave team like be crypt really are committed to making you  Have a great browser no sacrifices, but it doesn't have creepy ads doesn't have trackers  Now one of the things I think is really cool  You know one of the we've talked a lot about this ad blocking and doesn't that just take revenue out of the pockets of ad  Supported websites. Yes, but brave gives it back brave rewards you by having advertisers pay you for your attention  You can opt into brave ads which are very nice very simple and do not track you and you'll get rewarded with bat tokens  basic attention tokens  You know actually if you want you can even buy bat tokens and then brave will award content creators with bat  Tokens so so you could access premium content. You can reward your favorite content creators  It fixes this issue of how do you do ad blocking and still give publishers their fair share of web revenue?  I love this. This is really innovative thinking and I think they've done a great job  Fix the internet that was their mission Brendan Ike who created JavaScript and was co-founder of Firefox  Created brave with Brian Bondi you get private windows with Tor built in  So yes, it's a Tor browser as well if you want additional anonymity on the net  HTTPS everywhere I love that I turn that on it's all configurable though  If you go to the brave down do me a favor download brave anyway brave comm slash twit  I know you have a couple of browsers on your system  So add one more brave comm slash twit then go into the preferences. That's where you'll really see brave in action  You'll see all the features you could see that you could turn them all on and off  You don't have to use bat if you don't want to you don't have to see brave ads  If you don't want to you can you can configure everything?  You don't even have to use Google as a search engine. I use start page as my search engine  I just really love brave. I feel like I'm getting the the chrome experience without the chrome cruft. In fact  Brave slogan is great yesterday was about big tech today is about us brave  comm slash twit the only browser I use I love actually I've been using it for I think I  Switched off of chrome to brave about six months ago  It really makes the switch easy because it is chrome and brave sync  Oh, I love it because I use brave on Android iOS  Windows Mac and Linux and it's available on all of them and with brave sync you get strong secure sync between all of the same  So my even will open the same page. I was just looking at on my Android device when I get to my desktop  I love it brave comm slash twit. Please use that address that way. They know you saw it here  Okay, so is there anything to say about  Project nightingale is a first question. I wasn't clear. I also read the story about the NIH giving a hundred thousand  X-rays to Google and Google about to publish them is that a that's a separate thing separate separate thing  So these both surface at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead Matthew the thing to remember about nightingale is that all this as far as I can tell all this stuff that Google was  With this data partner is totally legal like it's completely allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's a loop. Okay, but I want to say that's a loop  HIPAA it's a loophole that if you look at it was clearly written for insurers  All right, so that insurers could snoop on you and reduce their liability  And you know the insurance industry went in there and said, you know  It'd be nice if you put that in the HIPAA law and they did and so yeah, it's legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a loophole and Google's take there are also the one piece I read I'm trying to remember where it was but they said  These types of data sharing arrangements are commonplace with lots of different companies  Yeah, and so it's just the fact that it's Google. I think that that got a lot of attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we said last week every there's a lot of other people doing the same type of cool and push for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't make it. Okay, we should stop them too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well awful either depends on what happens with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what I was saying if if Google is taking this information and it's going to use it to help  You know whether it's speed up and make more efficient with diagnosis and process things like that  That's that's a good thing if they're going to help us with you know  Finding not necessarily a cure but something to help with preventative medicine  Let them have at it. They have the  Horsepower with all of their computing to give us these answers possibly. So let them let them play around with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google wanted to provide if I know tools for Ascension Health, which is a big  Nonprofit provider thousands of facilities 23 states and the idea is medical, you know electronic medical records  Everybody wants to move to that. That's completely reasonable  Again, this question is what is what else is you know, what is Google gonna do that information about this the wrong way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right that we should we should deal directly with the fears  We have about people knowing our health data, right? So you can't cut me off insurance  You can't fire me you can't do other things that should be legislated and then once we feel secure in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there is clear benefit from sharing health data. So as soon as they legislate that then Google you go right ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but we need to legislate that and you know  There's a non discriminatory view on employment and on insurance and on renting you apartments and things like that  We should not discriminate on the basis of race sex gender or illness  But we do we do  Society is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the reason there's that loophole in HIPAA in my opinion is so that insurance companies  Could ultimately decline coverage to people with existing conditions and all, you know that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The insurance company tell you that straight up though. They tell you that before you even sign up. They do yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do we reserve the right to deny you need to know more I  Think it would be better if we knew more about these kind of data sharing  Arrangements not necessarily outlaw them, but at least know that this stuff is happening  I agree. I think the problem started know who's got our data and from where I think the problem started when it came off as if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google was trying to keep this information away from the public had they just said straight up folks  We're trying to find a better way to help you all out  So we are working with with these put these folks to help get the data and we're gonna go through it  We're gonna keep it private. We're gonna lock it down  But we just want you to know we have some of your personal information for a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so many I saw so many headlines that said Google is trying to secretly get health data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna get smashed that's the problem is that if you're if you're PR if your comms at Google  You are trying to me the other story that drove me bat

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  poop

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This last week was the Wall Street Journal of Google changes its algorithm  And let's do fifty six hundred inches of text about how  So it was awful and and there's a I won't say his name because I won't give the credit but there's a  there's a trade association guy in  Publishing industry who spends his entire life now smashing Facebook and Google. So when I  Criticize, you know it is I criticize this story. He got all after me. Oh  a lot of  Renowned Google critics I know said what a ridiculous story. Yeah. No, it's ridiculous because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Greg Sterling and Barry Schwartz said a really good job of  Going through all like point-by-point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anybody who listens to this show can immediately understand the problem  This is the headline from the Wall Street Journal how Google interferes with its search  I can't even say it with a straight face it interferes with its search algorithms and  Shocking changes your results. It uses blacklists algorithm tweaks and an army of contractors to shape what you see  Well, hell yeah, that's what it's the same company the Murdoch Wall Street Journal  Is was scathing about Google, you know not doing that so  Yeah, so, you know, this is a hit piece from from and you can expect this from newspapers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because well and also from that particular newspaper with that particular owner

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's interesting how if you took all the adjectives out  It's actually just a straightforward description of how search works, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly what it's supposed to do. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Works  Google made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big businesses over smaller ones and at least in one case made changes on  behalf of a major advertiser  Yeah, but what were the changes that made what did say? Oh eBay should be higher up. No the changes were  Let's make sure that the people the results people want show up  Yeah, Google engineers regularly make behind-the-scenes adjustments to other information  The company is increasingly layering on top of its basic search results for knowledge panels the featured snippets  Again, if you've used Google and this is one of the reasons people use Google is because you get all that addition you get the Wikipedia  Article on the right. I mean, I think there is there is a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a sort of debate to be had about Google doing things like, you know  Privileging its own properties and we could talk about that  But that's all misters doing that in Europe is antitrust, right? Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well  I went into Wall Street Journal go after the likes of YouTube because YouTube pretty much says the same thing with this algorithm  Far as trying to show what exactly this particular profile has a history of looking at and clicking like on and watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The so I duration I don't want to be a Google apologist and I'm sure that's how it sounds to some people. So  Honestly is is is this article revealing and by the way, they said they interviewed a hundred people  Is it is this article revealing anything that we didn't know  Okay, not really no, I kept looking for it now just casting things that we knew in an unfavorable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it's doing. And yes, we're in a different perspective to wear in it when the tech bubble if you will  So we're gonna see this bull crap has this printed out there, but a lot of people will read this and go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know right? Everybody's gonna freak out  Especially this this aligns with the conservatives who said all along Google is deprecating  conservative search results and while it never says that here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Objectivity neutrality I guarantee. Yeah, I guarantee there will be a bill before Congress that we use the term search neutrality  Yes, oh yes, I think I think they're already our efforts. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's two other things Google's doing to gather more data  A lot of this is slanted by your view of Google, right?  So Google bought fit in a lot of fitbit people are throwing their fit bits in the trash  Yeah, they don't want Google know how many steps I took  Yes, they already know dude  They already know if you carry an Android phone they know your Android phone knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think though. I do think though because I've heard that we had this discussion  I had this discussion with a friend of mine who has a fitbit and  You know there it's just sort of a free-floating  Fear or  Panic Matthew moral panic just their data getting loose somehow or  Big companies knowing about it or and there's nothing tangible like you can't really pin it down  It's just this kind of you know fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right Matthew and it's and it's the problem with the online harms report in the UK  Where they're saying the things that are harmful  That could I don't know we're not gonna say what it is  But if it possibly could be harmful, we're gonna go and I didn't talk about this in the show  I talked about the book a few weeks ago. So I put up a long post  Saying that harmful speech is the new porn  So I got an amazing book from 1970 that went into the the  Presidential Commission on pornography at the time and the parallels are amazing. It was like a book porn is gonna is gonna  ruin our youth  Well, we're still here that's all guys  You know, we're okay, okay didn't hurt us  Most of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sometimes I feel like Jeff though you kind of  You lean towards everything's fine and and don't it and maybe ignore potential harms

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, if you can define the harm fine, that's my problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean he was just saying well, I could define plenty of harms with porn and the UK so the UK

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Report is not good at that. They just say no some things are harmful and you should stop them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to be specific because on the other side of it, there's harms to stopping  Data aggregation because there are benefits to it. So what you want to do is as best you can weigh  Real legitimate harms with real legitimate values and see which you know what the trade-off is  We so rarely see that now. Well, I have to say there is some culpability on the part of Google  Because for instance Google didn't tell people they were doing this deal with Ascension. There was there's no patient  They did actually  They told people you're right on in fact, they told them on an investor call  But they didn't give the patients a chance to opt out. In other words, I think there's some disconnect  I think there's some culpability on on both sides. That's about the comms issue. It is a comms issue  It's also but it's not merely a comms issue. It's also a settings issue. It's also a default issue  It's Google needs to more and more do what Apple does  Which is we got to get permission before you do anything. Well, let's not get too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wushy about about virtuous Apple Apple made a business failure into a feature  The fact that I had  Yeah, and so it didn't really need the data and so now it's making that into a feature but apples no, it's a it's a real feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For whatever  Okay, so  Maybe their their motives weren't pure as the driven snow, but now that they can't make money in advertising  They're not gonna be collecting the information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think more you know if I could put my finger on sort of the fear  I think more and more people are concerned that or afraid that all of these things that Google and Facebook and other companies  Say they're doing for us that most of the benefit is going to go to them so that maybe  You know the fear is they're gonna maybe do like this much for you and then this much for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's a little most of the data will help them our work with ascension is exactly that a business arrangement to help a provider  Ascension with the latest technology similar to the same thing  We do with dozens of other health care providers these organizations like ascension use Google to securely manage their patient data under strict  Privacy and security standards they are the stewards of the data  We provide services on their behalf and I have to say when they say it that way  It sounds to me like this is a tempest in a teapot that there is no problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but another way to put it is that how much of your data is on AWS  Or all of these tons of it because it's in all kinds of places and and  No, we figure together but in the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't knock people first saying hey  I don't want them to know my data because they're gonna cap capitalize off their right and make a  Gazillion dollars off of it and they're not gonna make anything. I I don't have a problem with that  I do have a problem with people just being flat-out fearful and not knowing why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think our larger complaint is you every I think we all agree everybody should have the right to choose yesterday  Yes, the larger complaint is if Congress the FCC  Rupert Murdoch whoever weighs in and shuts stuff down that would give us absolute societal benefit on the basis of these  Imaginary or hard to define harms then the harm really is that we lost the benefits of these technological  innovations and so I think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Jeff had a point that if you trace the fear  It is it is that Google or Facebook is going to take the data and give it to somebody and then that  Somebody is going to penalize you in some way or your insurance is gonna cut off  Get cut off or your banks gonna shut down your account or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, which is which is a matter of so in my regulation group. I was in I got everybody yelling at me  I said that  We're not the issue here really isn't regulation of technology companies at all  It's regulating the human behavior that the technology companies enable that we don't like  and yes technology companies do things too, and they have user power but a lot of what people complain about is  That there's things we don't approve of we want the technology companies to get rid of  Right, or there's things that other companies do that we want them to because they seem all-powerful now  And I think that's part of the problem is we give them too much credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think also the problem is that  We give the notion that we are reasonable too much credit that we really all act via emotion and really what's happened here  Is that the tides have turned on Google which we used to think was the greatest thing ever and now everybody's doesn't  It doesn't trust it and like it and so that's all just as ridiculous as being

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Overboard the love with it. It's yeah, it's a company. It's a company. So that's it's really emotion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really how you feel about Google that really colors this period

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't help when these companies start offering facial recognition to the military for their drone strikes or when they start offering  You know back doors to China or whatever that stuff doesn't help. Well, you know, okay, I'm gonna recast that let me recast that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is America. Well, you're in Canada  If this were World War two and Ford said let's build tanks  We'd get yes, you're patriotic I don't this is something again, this is emotional  Yeah, it is a long history of American companies building  Products for our defense or our offense  It's a long history that there's nothing wrong with that Amazon Jeff Bezos said if the military wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But tanks didn't roll into your neighborhood tanks didn't follow you to the  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon or  Your problem is with the US military using drone strikes. That's a different problem now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's it's it's technologies like facial recognition that can be used in different like tanks  You know you use a tank in one way you facial recognition if that technology  But I got a trust I'm gonna trust our great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonderful military that is good  They're gonna use this in an insensible appropriate way to defend this great nation of ours  And what the hell is wrong with Google helping them out or I'll freak you out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is the problem is the leader the problem is the leader of the military

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's trust in that so not just military but also immigration and naturalization  So I came through I mean I have global entry  Which is the machine right you put the passport in a few questions and then you go right?  Ah, they changed it facial recognition now you come in it is facial recognition only  Yeah, take a picture of me. It says you are Jeffrey Jarvis. You gave them that face when you signed up for global entry  Yeah, well, I didn't know it was facial recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is that it's pretty amazing now  So if you want to freak people out about how good visual recognition is have them go through the global entry line  All right. Yeah, but you signed up for it. I know I'm not complaining. Oh, I'm saying it's gonna freak people out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a slightly off off subject question if we look at regulation and  the people in our leadership that are wanting to  Put this type of regulation on Google or whatever tech company that it that they have an issue with  Should these people be people that are well versed in the sciences like computer sciences or have degrees in that or is it okay that  They just have people under them that understand this technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  World and I want ignorant idiots to run

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody in Congress has a degree in computer science

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can get things right right I saw I saw someone I guess it was on Twitter someone had put that out there  It was like I need our leadership to be people that are competent in computer sciences and engineering and yada yada yada

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's why we used to have the office what was it called the office of  Gingrich killed it in the 80s and actually at least some of the candidates for  President have asked or encouraged I know Elizabeth Warren has the return of that office of technology and whatever it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like them to be human beings like I'd like them to be you know functioning sort of thinking  emotional human beings

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think he was or he or she whoever that posted it  Thinking of more along the lines of we don't want the the speaker to be at the mic saying well asking  Zuckerberg why his iPhone wasn't working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always been staffers  The member of Congress is there just to raise funds and get votes the staff is what does all the work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those hearings are all about getting on TV. You know and making like grandstanding you hold up your  Cardboard cut out or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the Office of Technology Assessment  1972 to 1995 okay, it was designed to provide Congress its members and committees with objective  objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century the fact that it was  disbanded isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More and more now consumer web

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just as Netscape on public yeah, it's really sad. I fear though if it comes back  It's gonna come back as in every possible technology. That's bad for you right we're in the finger-wagging age

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was killed because newt gingrich decided was hostile to GOP interests  What are those  Well these climate talk, I don't know  One more thing you can get mad about Google wants to start  Checking account for you next year Google wants to be your new bank

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually pretty fine with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about that last week. Oh you did. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm bringing back all the old stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't trust them any less than I trust my bank, so right that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he's that's what he said is like. What do you trust the least?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the mail I got a box of candy from a company called your point financial it said happy birthday leo  Oh boy  It's my birthday's coming up.

They would know I couldn't they'd send me some meat  I think we're going to regift it as stocking stuffers like give you my address

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty funny though it was nicely packaged PowerPoint or whoever if they want to send some boxes of candy pure point financial

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll find you missing the reason it turns out Lisa created this yeah, it was pretty good candy  I didn't need it  But Lisa set up a savings account with them because they have like really high say they have the highest savings rates like point one eight  Or something one point eight something like that anyway. Yeah one point wait wait wait by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, how hard was it for you to stay on your diet on vacation? Oh, I didn't know no  It would have been possible people in Greece would have been slapping you around how dare you so for those who don't know I'm I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eat carbs. I'm on a keto diet and  Yeah, I mean I had a little pita bread. I had some hummus. I heard it was some nice pastries

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not know you know I was pretty good. I didn't do desserts for the most part

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I did you know the ship they had fresh baked rolls every day. I thought I'll have one of those  Actually the worst thing was our cabin was mere feet away from a very good pizzeria on the boat  Spacchanapoli and the guy was Italian. I'd say bon giorno. He said but John I have a pizza. Yes, I couldn't really say no  Around here just walk in and say bonjour. No give me a well. That's the nice thing about a cruise  You already paid for okay through the nose. Okay. Yeah, so it's like it's free  I  Like it's free they're not gonna do a TJ IF meeting this is a sign of a company becoming big  They're cutting back on the all-hands means just once okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I have never worked for a company that had all-hands meetings every week Friday  Yeah, that's a  Transparent the axon is not having no we don't even a transparency meeting actually we do but we don't have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a very Silicon Valley thing. We have a Wednesday all-hands meeting Wednesday lunch  Yeah, but we're so much to or Tuesday all-hands, but we're smaller. Yeah, we can get all hands in one room, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've worked for a company. We have all-hands meetings, but it wasn't every week  It was more like twice a year at the most I've seen once a quarter. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's the I think that's the the slant on this is  Oh, you know there was a lot of dissent at these meetings people would ask tough questions  And then people would leak the public forum people said I  don't you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just find it interesting that Facebook which is which is known for being incredibly  Secretive and closed-mouth when they had leaks from an audio like audio leaks from a meeting  Yeah, then Zuckerberg said okay  We'll have public meetings that and Google who has typically been pretty transparent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had leaks and so now they're just not having meetings. Well, or maybe there's an amemies because it's not practical. I don't I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you get when you were all in Mountain View and you can stand on a staircase  Yeah, pretty cool. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Karsten's son is worth worried that the FTC is gonna find him forty two thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's completely freaked out like so how old is he 16 he's 15 15  He has he's had a YouTube channel for about a year  and  All of his content is kind of video game related. So it's aimed at kids his age. Yeah, but it's not like  aimed at kids kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is Zach is not gathering information about the people who watch his channel  YouTube is but YouTube is telling its creators. It's your problem  You have to declare  That you are kid  What if there were two ways you could be kid attractive or you could be kid targeted  And and if you don't declare it, right, you're the one the FTC is gonna find  They're not gonna find us but who's gathering the information?  YouTube Zach doesn't know anything about his audience  Not yet  So this comes from coppa the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  the FTC had a had a press conference in September and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care about  Their fine about their fine  on Google so if none of our programs are aimed at kids, right, but maybe some of our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what if we did unboxing videos of toys? Yeah  That would be considered kid attractive in either case you have to declare that it has to do with your monetization  Right your kid directed you can't monetize you can't have ads  But again, it's not because you're getting any information because Google keeps that all close to the vest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost just like saying that you're not a kid attractive. You'll be safer  But but then if you are and you say you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's when you get the $42,000 fine  That's what he's worried about yeah under terms of the settlement with the FTC you YouTube made a settlement  YouTube is required to quote develop implement and maintain a system for channel owners  Zach to designate whether their content on the YouTube service is directed to children  Creators who strictly make children's content can have their entire channel designated as directed at children  But even if you only make one video your channel may be  Right designated that and then you can then once a video is labeled as kids content all the personalized ads are shut off  And they're replaced with quote contextualized advertising in other words advertising  That's designed for people who might watch that kind of content like our ads our ads are contextualized right?  We don't gather information about our audience. I think you're right Leo  I think it's unfair to put all this on the side of the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right Leo. I think it's unfair to put all this on the creators like it says in their video  YouTube explicitly declined to tell channel owners when to label a video. We can't provide legal advice  It said we're unable to confirm whether your content  You don't label it right good luck. Yep, thanks your ass and grass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Outstanding so I I think we're not kid directed I  Don't think we could attract it could be kid attractive. I'm talking about candy you were just talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cop a survey  subject matter if you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Subject matters appealing to children for example kids jokes well most of mine are childish  music kids games  Video computer games oh, I like how they talk  Children's TV shows or stars cartoon characters sports sports  Sports hey watch it stories toys children's books  Fantasy well most of the show is children's arts and crafts  Pets you mean if I had a pet channel they would call that crap we showed those cats products primarily  Purchased or consumed by kids like snack food. No, I'm sorry everybody buys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slang or pop culture phrases like whatever free stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna fix it right here. I'm gonna throw in a phrase like nihilistic epistemology there you go

Transcript:  Let's take a break and get your picks of the week this has been a lot of fun. Thank you everybody  How was it be back Leo? It's I you know back in the saddle  Actually, I had a long conversation this morning with Paul and Mary Jo  I realized that the only reason I like to travel is because this is actually a flaw in the human brain  Your normal daily life becomes humdrum. It's it's the same it's  Routinized and your brain is trained once something is routine ignore it  Because you're supposed to be looking for the gut the Jaguar that's about to eat your brains, so you're looking for novelty  We're trained for novelty and I realize there's no novelty in my life. There's very little novelty  We I do much the same thing every week, right?  And in fact, that's why I am feeding dopamine to my brain by buying stuff  You know or try, you know trying to do new things when you travel. It's all new. It's all different  It's very exciting very stimulating  and so the temptation is to look at daily life as being  The undesirable boring and I just want to be on the road all the time  But then I realized I really don't want to be on the road  I take it from somebody who does I like to be with you guys. I love the  I love I miss the brain food because I was kind of turning into a vegetable  Oh  That's the funniest thing that happens on a cruise it's like people haven't been fed they  They have a shot midnight chocolate buffet and people storm it like they have they didn't need anything  Three hours we eat constantly you're on a boat. You're on a boat  All right  Get a massage get in the hot tub. Yes have a dinner casino second dinner casino gamblesome  Anyway, I am thrilled to be back and I missed you guys and it's my job.
