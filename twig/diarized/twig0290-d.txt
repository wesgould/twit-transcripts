I am for Twig this week in Google,  the show where we cover all the googly goodness  out there in the universe, the cloud.  And we throw in a little Facebook, a little Twitter,  this a little that, a little geek-sparing news.  And speaking of which, Jeff Jarvis is here from...  Oh, excuse me, I was just reading a little bit Gutenberg.  Gutenberg and the impact of printing.  That's not your book, that's somebody else's book.  Somebody else's, Stefan Fussel.  Off.  You have written, of course, an Amazon Kindle single  called Gutenberg the Geek, which is quite good.  Highly recommended.  Thank you, thank you.  It's short, that's the benefit of it.  It's short and cheap.  Yeah, he's also...  99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I keep on forgetting, it's been there so long  I should just make the thing free now.  Yeah, you could, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can do that, right?  Give it away, we're giving it away.  And Geeks Bearing Gifts is his latest  and that's available on Amazon as well.  Thank you for the plug.  Reinventing journalism, I saw you put on Facebook,  you want to, you're starting to talk about what to do  to make Facebook a better news outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did a post about what Google could do for news  and what news could do for Google  and next in this series, now a morning, is Facebook.  And Facebook's actually already doing interesting things.  I talked to them yesterday and so...  Neat.  They're doing neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neat.  And joining us in the house, Aaron Newcomb is here.  Yeah, glad to be here. He's with NetApp,  but he's also a regular on many of our shows,  like All About Android, Floss Weekly.  He looks like you brought a game controller  just in case you got bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I know that this is in the rundown today.  I don't know if we're going to talk about it,  but there's some gaming news with NVIDIA from today.  New Shield, I'm excited.  So we can talk a little bit about that.  Are you a Shield user?  Oh yeah, absolutely, this is mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have the K1 version.  Yeah, yeah, the first one.  Yep, the Shield tablet.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, yeah, we'll talk about that in a little bit.  Yeah, in fact, Mobile World Congress going on right now.  Mike Elgin is there, Miriam Jouar is there.  I hope you've been watching our live coverage,  not only on TNT and TNTN2, our news shows,  but we're also streaming live specials each day.  Day two went up, and day three will be going up soon.  Mike wanders the show floor in search of cool stuff.  And we did cover live.  I got up at nine in the morning, Pacific time on Sunday,  to cover the Samsung event.  I didn't get up for the HTC event,  which was like even earlier.  But HTC announced a new version of the HTC One.  It's very much an evolution of the one, the M9.  You guys probably talked about it last night  on all about Android.  Yes, most certainly.  Love the M9, I've been a big fan,  but there's nothing to knock me out there.  They replaced that silly ultra pixel,  what was it, four megapixel camera on the back  with a 20 megapixel real camera,  but they put the ultra pixel on the front.  Everybody's doing better selfie cams.  You know where I'm a little disappointed?  I really thought that we would start to see  better audio DACs in phones, high res DACs, this year.  I really expected HTC to do it.  I thought Samsung might do it, neither.  And so that's a little disappointing,  because I thought this was going to be the year  for high res music to take off.  Not so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm waiting for a phone to have kind of  those accordion, stretchy things,  so you have a built in selfie stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, built in.  Press the button, the phone grows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The kickstand thing didn't work out, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting bigger.  If you just make them a little bit bigger,  you wouldn't, you know, just take a picture from the top.  It's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately that phone though,  takes up a lot of space.  The OS.  OS is those, that's what I've read anyways.  The OS takes up.  On the M9?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, a lot of space. Like free space storage.  So I think it takes up, you know.  The new Sense.  Even though it has more storage included,  it takes up, what is it, like 30% of the storage,  your available storage is just taken up from the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samsung, I think, actually has the phone of the show  with the new Galaxy S6 Edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you convinced with the double edge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me, I'll say a couple of things.  First, it's disappointing that Samsung,  which really that was the last holdout  for removable batteries and SD cards, you know,  the back would come off.  Yeah.  But in order to do that,  you have to have a crappy plastic ugly back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they've gone to this full aluminum design  with a glass back of all things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of like the iPhone 4.  But supposedly better battery life anyway  with a better battery and more juice protection  in the Exynos processor.  It comes in 128 gig version as well as the 32 and 64.  So I guess that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it's okay.  I still like to have the option.  I mean, we've seen this before, right?  I mean, no one's gonna need more, was it?  No one's gonna need more than four meg of memory.  Yeah.  We've seen this before.  For most people, it's fine.  I think for power users like me,  I always wanna have that extra capacity  just so that I can switch stuff out, change things around.  But at least they're not giving you a device  that's 16 gig and no SD card.  That's awful.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah.  They've also touched,  TouchWiz is, they've continued to step back with TouchWiz.  It looks pretty pure lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's still, the thing I'm still worried about is,  even the underlying OS in a Samsung phone,  the settings and stuff like that,  I just find its logic different.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is.  Here they're comparing their own two phones.  I guess that's an S5 with the S6,  or is that a Note 4 with, no, it's an S5.  Looks like an S5.  The new design.  I think the thing that really is interesting about the S6  actually is the edge.  This is not the same as the Note 4 edge,  which I did not like.  Note 4 had two screens, a flat one and a curved edge run.  That was a completely separate screen  and could do a lot more than the Galaxy S6.  You could have screen savers on it  and you could really set a lot of different things in there.  But it just, it didn't work very well.  It was upside down for one thing, which always bugged me.  I could never get it to work the way it was supposed to work.  This is not, this is one screen that just curves.  They're melting the screen and curving it around.  And so it doesn't actually add a lot of functionality.  I guess you can't have,  because it's a Super AMOLED screen,  you can't have some edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fact that you can have these five friends  who are constantly on the edge,  but I don't use my phone for connecting with people.  I use it more for connecting with information than people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is, yeah, but this is, I think the edge,  that's just using the extra screen real estate  for something else.  The edge really is, I think about beauty, about design.  Yes, it is.  It is.  In this case.  And I think it's very pretty.  And of course everybody's worried about the fact  that this phone is almost entirely glass, glass back  and a curved edge screen,  which will make it very vulnerable,  although it is Gorilla Glass 4.  I think that's actually quite lovely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we'll see.  How did Mike and Jorah and company say it felt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miriam liked it a lot.  Miriam was raving about it.  I don't know what Mike said.  I don't know if Mike liked it or not.  I didn't hear him talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the pricing, we don't have confirmation  on the really ridiculous pricing we've heard about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unknown, April 10th.  But you know, Apple sells a phone,  the iPhone 6 Plus, that is $1,000 if you load it up.  There's a market for that.  They sold quite a few of those.  So maybe Samsung has decided,  in addition to the low end phones they continue to make,  to have one really nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what you're gonna get out of the edge.  You're gonna get a pretty expensive device,  probably eight, nine, somewhere around there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Note 4 edge is I think 120 bucks more than the Note 4.  Something like that.  For that extra little screen on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if it's worth it to me.  I don't think I would go for it.  I mean, unless there's some sort of functionality there  that I just can't live without, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's style points more than anything, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why I want it,  because I'm a stylish guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I want it to look good in my hand.  I think it'll feel good.  One of the things Miriam,  I think it was Miriam who said this,  on phones where you're swiping in from the edge a lot,  that having a curved screen like that  where it just kind of flows over it,  is kind of, it feels good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  That's just a thought.  So camera on the new S6 is,  the same number of megapixel, 16,  but they have OIS in it,  which the Note 4 has, but not the S5,  and they have a f1.9 aperture, very fast lens.  That's faster than anything else on the market.  So we'll see.  I mean, it looked pretty good.  They showed low light performance  head to head against an iPhone  that was really remarkable,  both in stills and video,  but that's Samsung's demo.  Here's the big news.  The demo was normal.  There was no Broadway numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, which was great.  It was about the product.  It was, and two of the three presenters

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were professional women.  So the kind of the subliminal sexism  of previous Samsung events is gone.  They obviously were sensitized a little bit.  They're finally listening.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember the Broadway one.  I think you and I did that.  Horrible.  It was just, it was really bad.  Embarrassing.  The problem was here.  I mean, we didn't know what to make of it at the time,  so I'm glad they're coming around.  I mean, you need to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, and there was no fashion show  with weirdly dressed models prancing around.  It was just really-  No ridiculous skits.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, let's live life on our phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think companies tend to do that.  They try to appeal to a broader audience.  And when they start having a product  that goes beyond the techie-verse, right,  and they want to reach that consumer audience,  they start to say,  well, we need to do these things  without knowing what those things are, right?  We need to have Broadway shows.  That'll appeal to people.  And so it's nice to see  that they're finally coming around.  What typically happens is that people go too far  with that stuff without realizing it.  And it's nice that they're pulling it back in  and connecting, hopefully,  connecting better with their core audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They even said the words were listening.  Now they were doing it in reference to the phone,  but I think they're also listening  to what we're saying about their press events.  Yeah, yeah.  This is kind of a chase in Samsung.  The S5 was such a flop that they realized, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's part of it too.  I think they've got it.  They've maybe learned that understatement  is better than overstatement.  And even if you consider,  Apple invented understatement in its own weird way.  It became a new form of overstatement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I talked about this last week  because I hadn't received it,  but Wednesday morning in advance  of the Mobile World Congress,  Motorola sent us this E.  Now this is the other side of the spectrum.  Here's a phone that's 150 bucks out the door,  the Motorola second generation E,  but it's a great phone.  You make some sacrifices.  This screen isn't as high res.  It's not as big a phone.  But I thought that was,  I think to me, more people will be interested in this.  And what that's gonna do is,  and I think Samsung realizes is,  if you're gonna make a phone that is more than 150 bucks,  it better be premium.  It better not compromise in any way.  And I think the HTC M9 is that.  I think the Samsung S6 is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one plus one is starting to look a little utilitarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, it is, but I think it was interesting  that it pushed the market.  It did.  When they said no compromises, I mean, they meant it.  I think the Nexus 6 is a better phone,  but it was a heck of a phone for the price  and to show you what you could do  and tried to put in the best of everything they could  that was available to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three gigs of RAM in the S6, that's not an improvement,  especially since they have a 64-bit processor  and they could go quite a bit more.  They're putting their eight-way new Exynos in there,  although it may be in the United States  they use the Snapdragon.  That's what they've done in the past.  That has to do with the system on a chip  more than the processor has to do with their radios.  I think they're sticking with Exynos.  Are they gonna do Exynos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure they're sticking with Exynos here in the US.  That's what the rumor was.  Is that confirmed?  Actually, that's a good question.  I don't know if it's confirmed.  Samsung, what was the say, of course?  But from what I've read-  Samsung didn't mention the Qualcomm chips at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, let's see, what else?  I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any other features we're missing?  I wish the battery removable,  but I think if they have better battery life,  maybe it'll be okay.  They have, oh, fast charging.  Yeah, fast charging.  Oh, and they're using-  No water resistance.  They're using DDR4 RAM, no water resistance,  which just shows that maybe that wasn't a selling point  anybody cared about.  Some did, but no DDR4, which is faster,  and EMMC storage, which is faster.  So we'll have to wait and see,  but everybody's played with the phone,  and Barcelona says it's really snappy  with that fast processor, fast memory, and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we'll see.  We shall see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is interesting, though.  We're talking about Samsung making changes and listening.  On one hand, they did, right?  For such a long time, people have been complaining,  myself included, about kind of the design aspect  of Samsung devices and how, you know,  I'm just not a huge fan of plastic, and it feels cheap,  and so they've gone this other direction,  and they're putting a lot of focus on design  and peeling back TouchWiz and everything.  On the other hand, a lot of their success was built  on what they were doing, aside from this year,  which wasn't so successful,  and what they were doing included removable battery,  included external storage, included water resistance.  So they're really kind of betting on the fact  that these changes are gonna get them back  to where they were after such a difficult year.  So they're coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  too timid?  You know, okay, okay, we'll be like everybody else,  and we'll just do it more expensively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that could be it, too.  I don't know, I'm very curious to see  if this works for them, because they're really changing  a lot after having so many years of doing,  of kind of following a very particular path.  Yeah.  They're straying off that path now, big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a big bet.  I wonder if the, kind of the, I mean,  it's just about a flop of the S5.  I mean, I wonder if that kind of taught them a lesson,  or they're trying to come back from that,  because I think that if the S6 is not as popular,  then they're in big trouble, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, two in a row would be bad.  Yeah.  The Note still sells very well, though,  which is interesting.  The Note 4 was a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably if I'm wrong, but they invented the phablet.  Oh, yeah, I think they were the first.  They pushed the whole market to the giant phone,  and then didn't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it wasn't until Apple did it that it was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  BlackBerry announced an interesting phone,  a five-inch touchscreen for only $279.  That's the leap.  BlackBerry does need to do something  to leap back into the market.  You know, the last BlackBerry all touchscreen  I had, the Storm, was so godawful.  I'd have to really think twice about this.  It will run BlackBerry 10, five-inch HD display.  HD, though, is 720p, not 1080p.  So only 293, only.  Only.  293 pixels per inch, only.  But I have to say, that's plenty, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On a five-inch device, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's plenty.  But when you look at the 5.1-inch S6,  which has 577 pixels per inch.  That's crazy.  Numbers-wise, it doesn't look as good.  I don't know if that matters at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time I see somebody with a BlackBerry,  now I have to admit that I giggle.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eight-megapixel camera, 1080p HD.  They're just a little behind.  1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm.  Two gigs of RAM.  16 gigs of storage for firmware.  Does have a micro SD card slot.  25 hours, they're claiming a battery life.  So, you know, I don't want to leave BlackBerry out.  You know what I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bring back the trio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why you say that,  but I'm glad you say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be nostalgic for some old brands.  The trio.  I loved my trio.  I adored my trio.  Yeah, people did love those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I love?  My Scion 3A.  Now that was it.  Of course, it wasn't a phone,  but you could put a phone in it.  Nowadays, it'd be a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I loved my TRS-80 at the time.  Yeah, you know what I love?  My Atari 400.  You know what I love?  We could go on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai spoke at the Mobile World Congress.  Google is going to give details of its US mobile network  in the coming months.  Yes, Google is going to do a US mobile network.  He also talked about the Loon balloons.  They're apparently close to launch.  Yeah, that's global.  That's global internet.  An experimental mobile network in the United States.  They want to do an MVNO that is sitting on top of,  we've mentioned this before, the other carriers.  In fact, apparently what they're planning to do,  although Pichai did not confirm it,  he said it will merge selling Wi-Fi networks  in a seamless way, but apparently what they want to do  is just pick whatever network works the best right now  and use that.  Right, which would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My guess is this is aimed primarily at Kansas City  and Austin and such,  because they keep on saying it's small and small and small.  If they have ubiquitous Wi-Fi around the markets like that  and you can do 95% of the time you're on Wi-Fi  and only when it fails or you're out of town  is it on itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the wireless does that.  That's how our public wireless works.  They prefer Wi-Fi and since there's so much open Wi-Fi  around now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not really open.  That's the problem.  The fact that I have to go to,  I used to have an app that would sign me into Starbucks Wi-Fi  and it just doesn't work anymore.  And the fact that I have to go through the stupid page,  I've said this on the show before, I'll say it again.  Folks, I want a universal statement  of giving up my rights and my firstborn  and I'll sign it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whenever it hits a Wi-Fi, say he's already signed it,  he's already agreed to do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That does work, not that this is a great selling point,  with Comcast's Xfinity service.  So you remember, it's been a little controversial  if you're a Comcast Wi-Fi customer  that your Wi-Fi router also has this public network aspect.  And here in Petaluma, it's a Comcast town,  I can get Wi-Fi almost anywhere.  And once you sign in with Xfinity Wi-Fi once,  that's now a registered Wi-Fi network.  So I don't have to sign in ever again.  And I often find I'm on Wi-Fi,  mostly because it's not working.  And I have to now, gosh, just sign in  to Xfinity Wi-Fi again.  Right, I hate that.  I had to turn it off.  So sometimes you might want to forget it.  But as they get better and better  with better and better signal and better connectivity,  that's a mesh network.  It's a very interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or could we have balloon balloons  or some other strange thing that they're thinking about?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that Mark Zuckerberg said it isn't sci-fi  that's gonna get internet to the next billion people.  It's just carriers doing the job of wiring.  And I think he makes a good point.  We talk a lot about Facebook's drones, Google's balloons.  If you want waterproof Android phone,  there still is one, Sony Xperia M4 Aqua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long is Sony gonna stay in the business though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that's the funny thing  because there was some talk of them  exiting the phone business.  I think their CEO, some executives said  we're probably, we're thinking about it.  And then it was very vigorously denied  by another Sony executive yesterday or the day before saying,  no, we're in the phone.  Well, maybe that's as long as the M4 Aqua is available  and then they'll get out of it, I don't know.  It's kind of a mid-range phone.  64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615, lollipop,  two-day battery life, waterproof.  Up to one and a half meters, fresh water.  No salt water allowed.  No scuba.  And chlorinated, not so good.  And you should rinse it if you get it chlorinated.  I'm just reading the specs.  Starting price of 299 euros, that's about four or 500 bucks.  It'll be available in 80 countries, but not the US.  Not the US, they're gonna stick with their flagship phones  in the US, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a question for you.  Do you think Sony could Kodak?  Could Sony die?  Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely.  That's phenomenal.  I think there's a big chance they might.  As important a company as Sony was  in the consumer electronics revolution.  Jesus, I mean, yeah, it's been suffering, suffering,  suffering, and I keep on just waiting.  Somebody will come in, somebody will fix it.  No, it could really die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they announced a plan for revitalizing Sony  and some of it involves spinning off.  They have been spinning off a lot of stuff.  They spun off the music, they spun off TVs.  I mean.  Yeah.  By the way, the Samsung phone, the S6,  has a new form of payment.  Remember, they bought Loop Pay.  That's kind of an interesting technology.  Jeff Needles uses it.  It allows you to hover your phone over a swipe terminal.  The phone sends out a magnetic field,  which is read as a real credit card being swiped.  So in other words, Samsung's Pay will have touch to pay,  but also this swipe capability,  which will make it the most compatible.  That's gonna work far better, I think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in Europe than here.  I mean, in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they swipe still in Europe?  Well, yeah.  No, you do the chip card.  I thought they did chip and pin, yeah.  But I think those terminals,  when they come in a restaurant in Europe,  they do swipe.  You pay at the table with the device.  Yeah, the chip card.  Well, it's pinned, but I think they also have a swipe there.  And I don't imagine you can hold up against that,  but in the US, there's a hell of a lot of purchases  for which this won't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, swiping is going away, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  How are you gonna pay for a restaurant check?  Well, they just get these new touch terminals everywhere.  Well, that's a big deal.  Every restaurant, every waiter in the country.  Well, they're mandated to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're mandated to.  This is all changing.  Is it that definite?  So we're moving to chip and sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instead of chip and pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By October of this year, no more swipe.  So there'll be a chip,  but it won't be necessarily pin-based.  You'll still maybe sign.  So that sounds like the waiter,  if he comes to your table,  will have a thing that you touch.  I'm getting a new American Express card.  It's on its way with a chip in it.  I think all your credit cards will be replaced  the next few months with chips.  That's, I think, NFC, right?  You tap it and then it registers it.  Still may have to print out a receipt and sign it,  although it doesn't mean you can't do chip and pin.  It just means that they're giving them a little more time  to get used to that notion.  So chip and sign, though, is by October.  And it may be chip and pin in many of the places you go.  So that's to fight fraud,  although we'll see how well that fights fraud.  Yeah.  But that's why everybody and their brothers  announcing these new payment systems,  Samsung and Apple and everybody else, because, Walmart,  because they realized that all of the terminals  are gonna be refreshed in the next six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, this is a huge opportunity.  Real opportunity.  Everyone's trying to take advantage of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Android Pay even exists.  Sundar Pichai talked about Android Pay  to replace Google Wallet, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To tie in with Google Wallet.  Okay.  Yeah, because that would get really confusing  which actually wouldn't be too surprising knowing Google.  But yeah, it's more like APIs for developers  to allow developers to kind of tie mobile payments like this  into their apps and services.  So they're not gonna deprecate the wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll still be able to use my wallet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it will provide a secure store.  It will have an API.  Apps will determine when and where you can use payment cards.  The Google system will tokenize card numbers  much like Apple and Samsung Pay do.  That's one of the real advantages of these payment systems  from the privacy point of view.  And a security point of view,  you're not giving the merchant your credit card  or any personal information, merely a one-time token,  which they can use to verify that you are paying this amount.  Google's Android Pay will use NFC for transmission,  will support biometric authentication via hardware.  Oh, that's another thing on the S6.  They figured out a way to touch without swiping,  Touch ID fingerprint.  Right now, although I have to say,  I've gotten used to the Note 4  and I'm pretty consistent on it.  But see, I just did it and said,  no, no, you did it a little sideways.  You have to do it just right.  I do like this and it does unlock Google Wallet.  It unlocks LastPass.  So there already is a standard kind of API  for the Samsung fingerprint reader.  But one that works like Apple's,  where you just put your finger on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it reads it and you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's works so well.  But you know what, Leo?  You know what I don't want on my Nexus 6?  A button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, well, as a result, you have a physical button.  And this is why the Apple iPhone is a physical button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Samsung, it justifies Samsung's continued  devotion to the home button.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they knew.  So Pachai said that they're not trying to compete  with Samsung's offering.  It's just to give them another choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess it will work with the Samsung fingerprint reader,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is cool.  No timeline.  I guess we'll find out more at Google I.O. in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am glad that they're stepping this up a little bit.  I mean, for a while it was unsure.  I was unsure, certainly.  I think a lot of people were,  what was gonna happen with Google Wallet?  You know, was it just gonna go away?  I mean, I was really starting to wonder  because I use Google Wallet whenever I can  because it's more secure.  People ask me, why do you do that thing with your phone?  Why don't you pay by credit card?  And I tell them, there's a pin.  You know, I can revoke things very easily  if someone gets my phone or something.  But I've been going to stores and it hasn't been working  because stores are, I guess, not subscribing  to the service anymore or whatever.  So I was getting really worried,  but I'm really glad that they're stepping this up.  I'm glad that they bought ISIS,  or whatever it's called now.  Soft card.  Soft card, thank you.  Because I think that, and I think that they,  I think the reason they did it was just because  they got so worried with Apple Pay.  I think that kind of forced Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They weren't worried, or they saw an opportunity.  I mean, I think that, just as we said, this is the time.  If you're gonna put your flag in the sand,  this is the time to plant it.  Yep, yep.  You know, Wallet was hurt because the carriers,  chiefly Verizon, wanted to use Soft Card.  And said, well, we're not gonna let you use Apple.  I mean, how many times have I installed Google Wallet,  or tried to, on an Android device  that says your carrier does not support it?  Yeah, yeah.  But that changed at some point.  Now everybody does, right?  Have you had problems on Verizon with your,  with your Wallet? Well, I have not had problems,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I run a custom ROM, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you wouldn't even know if you did.  I wouldn't know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google actually, specifically, took it into their own hands  and changed the way Wallet authenticated.  They fixed it.  The secure element, something along those lines.  The details are a little shady,  but they basically went around the carriers and said,  okay, well, if you're gonna block it there,  then we're gonna do it this way.  Now. Well, whatever happened,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was real thrilled,  because suddenly my Wallet was working,  and I put all my credit cards in there.  As far as I can tell,  it's functionally identical to Apple Pay.  The only difference is the fingerprint reader.  I think it's great.  Use a pin instead of a fingerprint reader.  And now that's coming.  And everywhere that uses Apple Pay, it works.  Because Touch ID is Touch ID, you know, or whatever it is.  Touch to Pay is Touch to Pay.  So I'm not sure what's going on,  and this is not good because consumers need to know  with some reliability what's going on.  Maybe that's why they've,  it almost feels like they've rebranded  Google Wallet Android Pay.  In the same way they rebranded Google TV Android TV.  Maybe it was the same.  Google likes to rebrand its things.  It's all Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's the more consumer-friendly brand.  Yeah. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. People know Android.  Google Wallet, that sounds scary.  I don't know it.  Don't people trust Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they went, and remember,  they went the opposite direction  when it came to the market, right?  It was always Android market,  and they said, oh, but that's too limiting.  Well, our bigger brand is Google, so we need to open it.  So let's make it Google Play.  So they're going in all sorts of different directions.  That's Google in a nutshell right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android Pay, I'm being told by the chairman,  is basically an API.  And in fact, Samsung Pay could in fact incorporate it,  could be built on top of Android Pay.  So it's just an API.  GDC, we'll talk about that.  We're done with Mobile World, right?  Anything else to talk about, of course, Lauren?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did your correspondence touch the,  howay, whee, whee, wha, wha watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sapphire Display, first,  it's an Android Wear watch though, right?  So functionality, it's gotta be the same.  Here's CNET's video of it.  It's a pretty, pretty, did they say a price?  It's kind of a premium, am I getting an ad?  You're probably getting an ad.  I'm gonna get an ad.  It's 1.4 inch circular display, 400 by 400 resolution,  which is higher than, yeah, that's higher than most.  It's a little bit smaller.  That looks like an ad.  Snapdragon, 512 megs of RAM,  four gigs of internal storage, heart rate sensor.  No flat tire.  No flat tire.  Round is great.  Yeah.  Round is great.  There's not gonna be a lot of room on my wrist  because the Apple Watch is coming.  They're gonna announce it on Monday and ship it in.  Oh yeah, two wrists.  An ankle watch.  I do have two wrists.  But I'm already wearing a Moto 360.  So here's CNET's, now that we've gone through the ad,  CNET's first look here.  Scott Stein is, yeah,  so no flat tire.  You know, the problem with Android Wear  is the outside may be different.  The inside's always the same, right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  But I guess that's not necessarily a problem  in case you know what you're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sapphire crystal on the screen, I think, is a good move.  Already on my Moto X, I'm getting these little scratches  because it turns out when you're walking,  and especially when you're as clumsy as I am,  you run into things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see any scratches on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't either yet.  No, I'm one to the scratch.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're definitely going for  a little bit of the higher end.  Yeah, look at the band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a millionaires name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's very smart of them to go for,  hey, look, a watch is typically a higher end purchase  for most people, so let's go ahead  and incorporate some higher end features.  A little bit smaller so it may, it's still really thick,  but a little bit smaller so it may appeal to  women more than the huge Moto watch.  So I mean, I think it looks fantastic to me.  I'm really seriously looking at this  as a potential watch to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So bummed that the Apple Watch is iOS only  because it has to switch back to iPhone.  And I've really become fond of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have one of the stories that,  it's the opposite problem though.  If you're iOS OS that you can use Android,  Google's gonna supposedly make an app  so you can use Android Wear with your iOS phone.  You want the opposite.  You want to hold on to your Android phone  and have an Apple Watch, which I think makes sense too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the one watch that serves them all is Pebble.  And they made some big announcements,  including they are now the most successful  Kickstarter campaign.  Went back to the well and they got what,  15 million so far for the color Pebble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these things, but you saw Amanda Palmer,  is that 13 grand a song on Patreon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a crowdsourced world.  For now.  Let's take a break.  We'll come back with more.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is here.  Aaron Newcomb, we're talking twig.  Let's say we're done with the Mobile World Congress,  but the GDC is very exciting.  We'll talk about that in a little show and tell  with Mr. Newcomb.  That's gonna be fun.

What did you bring us here?  This is a, this is your shield.  This is my shield tablet.  And now this was the tablet to get  for the last few months  because it has the Nvidia Tegra K1 chip in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right, that's right.  And it is a fantastic, fantastic tablet.  I recommend it for anyone,  but especially if you wanna play games.  And Nvidia is really raising the bar when it comes to games  because they've added this service called Grid Games.  So like Steam?  These are online.  So you've been able for a while to stream games  from your home PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, like on live kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like on live.  So you can actually stream games over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So even though the shield is actually a pretty hefty device,  it's still only an ARM processor.  It's not as hardcore as your PC.  So the server renders the gaming offsite  and then streams it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  That's the way it works.  And we can try to load this up as we're talking about it.  But I mean, this is kind of, this could be a disruptor,  especially with a company like Nvidia behind it, right?  It's not a startup.  People know what this is.  They're familiar with the Nvidia brand.  How much is it?  The Shield tablet or the Grid Games?  The Grid Games right now are in beta.  So I'm sure these things will be relatively cheap, right?  Like 10 bucks a month or something.  10 bucks or something.  I mean, they haven't really announced pricing,  but if you have a Shield tablet,  you can actually try this out right now.  I'm gonna launch Trine 2.  What's really cool about this is it analyzes your network  and it takes a look at the wifi all the way out  to the internet and says, is it working or not?  Now I know that we've had a little bit of issues today  at the break house.  Yes, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do have to have enough bandwidth and low latency  to play a game because it's streaming in effect  from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we can try to connect and see.  But yeah, so that all it is, is it streams and then you can-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this plays local games pretty well too, right?  I mean, that's the point of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  It plays local games great.  And I've actually used it to play,  to do the streaming from my PC.  And what I do is I bring the tablet out to the living room,  plug it in because it's got HDMI out,  I plug it into the TV in the living room.  So instead of having to connect from the living room  back over to my study where my games are running,  I can just bring my tablet in there.  That's cool.  And then I pull in my controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it's like you're really gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you go pull in your controller  and then you're playing away.  Wow.  And the controller is really built really well.  We've done reviews on this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Shield, it turns out, is not just this device.  It's a name for products from Nvidia.  They're going to have a whole line.  They announced the Shield TV, which is a $200 Android TV set  top box.  They announced it at GDC.  They called it a combination of a revolutionary TV gaming  console and supercomputer.  OK, that's not overselling it too much.  But the streaming games, I think,  are a big part of that, right?  So you'll be able to do the same thing that you're doing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The same thing with that device.  That device looks really, really nice, actually.  More and more, I'm disappointed with my Nexus player.  I know people typically don't like it.  I've been using it.  We still use it every day, but basically only to do Netflix.  Because it's really unreliable.  It disconnects from Wi-Fi.  I think having a solid device like this  that you can hook up to your TV, stream games  either from your PC or from the gaming service, the grid gaming  service, I think it's really tremendous.  And then I'm also excited because since I  own the controller, I can just use the controller  to run the games.  I don't have to get anything else.  They're building an ecosystem.  So there's a free grid subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where you can rent games or buy games.  And then there's a paid one that's the all you can play  version.  You can do either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do either one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stream is 1080p, 60 frames a second.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the TV device is supposed to be  able to stream 4K to your 4K TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, it is more expensive than a lot of them.  It's $200, but that's still cheap.  Right.  It's more expensive than a Steam box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's what I was just going to say.  It's cheaper than a PC.  It's cheaper than a console.  PS3 or an Xbox One.  Exactly.  So and it's supposed to be more powerful than an Xbox 360,  for example, in terms of because they're using,  I believe, the X1 chip, the new chip.  This is the new Tegra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Tegra chip.  It will even be faster.  And that's a 64-bit chip as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's nice to see Nvidia capitalizing a little bit  on their chip technology that they've  worked so hard on for all these years,  building the graphics cards and everything.  It's really nice to see them coming around and saying,  hey, look, we can build devices that can compete based on our.  And the chip really is the thing that  makes the difference between this and other boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So look for that in May.  The grid service will probably launch at the same time.  It's in beta right now.  Good news.  I think that's pretty cool.  What else is going on at GDC?  Google has launched player analytics and custom native  ads for great game developers.  They're going to monetize this everywhere.  And here's something called Nearby Connections.  This is exciting.  This is a feature that turns phones and tablets  into a controller for your Android TV game.  Protocol will be in an update to Google Play service.  They're going to highlight Beach Buggy Racing.  There they are.  Beach Buggy Racing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all using basically their devices  as controllers for the Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like a Wii U. And it looks almost like they're  playing Mario Kart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what you want to do with your wife.  Right?  Just be able to play games together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to play games with my wife.  Lisa, because both her son and I are gamers.  And I have an Xbox One.  He has every game device known to man.  He plays a lot of games.  And she feels left out.  She says, I want to play games.  And I was mentioning this on Windows Weekly there.  I couldn't find any really good cooperative games,  Call of Duty style games, for the Xbox One.  But the Nintendo is loaded with them.  So we got a Wii U. And that looks so much like Mario Kart.  It's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a great game, by the way.  Mario Kart 8?  No, no, sorry.  Beach Buggy Racing, which is what they're  playing on the Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the funny thing is the Wii U basically  is a kind of clunky tablet along with a Wii.  And this is why I have a clunky tablet.  You've already got an Android device.  Right, right.  Use that for steering.  And that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's awesome.  I mean, they're really capitalizing on the fact  that the ubiquity of Android phones and devices  and doing something a little bit different with them.  And I don't personally like to use my phone as a controller.  I've done it before with other things.  But it's there.  And not just the controller aspect,  but if you look at just Dance, for example,  with their integration with Chromecast,  everyone can just, if they've got an Android phone,  they can pull it out, load up the app,  and they can all participate on the Chromecast connected  to your TV.  And I see this taking this just a step further.  And I think it's great.  It's bringing a Wii-like experience  into the living room without having to buy the console  and get sucked in, so to speak, into the Nintendo  verse or the Microsoft verse or the Sony verse,  depending on what console you choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now I want to know where I can get an Android TV.  Is it in the TV sets?  Are people putting in their TV sets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, you could get a Nexus player that has it.  Nexus is Android TV?  Nexus player is Android TV.  And Sony.  The Nvidia device that we just talked about.  Nvidia, Sharp, others are making those.  Man, that was another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the Nexus.  So maybe I should get this.  That's an Android TV device that will, when does this come?  So that I can play games and do all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The update that they're talking about?  Yeah.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you can get the Nexus player.  Yeah, you can get the Nexus player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when am I going to be able to do all this gaming stuff?  I want to play each buggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Available on an upcoming update.  Upcoming update, we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it says it's available in limited beta.  But allows select partners like Atari to display.  Oh, that's the ad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So soon, but Leo, especially because what you're talking  about is doing gaming, I probably  wouldn't recommend you get the Nexus player.  Because it's not enough juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe get this Nvidia.  It's a little underpowered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And even worse, it has eight gigs of storage,  which after system stuff, leaves you with basically five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nvidia, we should point out, only has 16.  But it does have the ability to expand storage with an SD card.  Right, it has an external SD card.  So all right, maybe I'll wait till May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Mars Worm in the chat room, that's right.  Razer has another one that's the same cost, $100.  That is definitely from a specs perspective,  better than the Nexus player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called the Forge TV.  And Google Cast is the underlying technology  for all of this, right?  That I'm able to use Cast to interface with this.  So this looks like a good one too.  Razer is a gaming company.  They even make a controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like Razer products.  I still use my Razer.  I have a Razer Boomslang.  Remember the Boomslang?  I still have a Razer Boomslang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have a Razer Boomslang.  Yeah.  They make good stuff.  I mean, it's pricey, but it works.  All right, well, I think we have to, what do you have?  Which one do you have, Jason?  Oh, you got it working?  Oh, he's got the grid stuff working on his shield.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this is the Lego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is streaming from grid.  Well, actually, this is a cut scene right now.  But it's going to stream the game.  And that's the supercomputer in the tagline.  This computer is not this.  It's the thing it's connected to, which is the server.  But it's going to stream down Lego Harry Potter.  And you're going to be able to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I paired this with mine.  This isn't mine.  Yeah, I did already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now we have to do a review on all of these.  We've got to buy all these new Android TV things.  So not the Nexus.  You have that already, Jason.  You say that's too clunky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nexus player?  Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the Forge TV or maybe the NVIDIA.  I have to say, NVIDIA's got the inside track,  because they make ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little more expensive.  But I'd say it's probably worth that extra price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the Forge TV available yet?  No.  So nothing you want is available now.  All right.  And apparently, coming soon also from Sharp, TP Vision.  And even Sony's getting into this game.  Sony, who made the original Google TV, remember,  is going to make a Bravia television set with Android TV  built into it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  We'll see.  No, it's not.  Network interference.  Our Comcast has been not doing so well.  So you're not playing this on the Shield.  You're playing this on the server.  Shield's just streaming it down to you.  On live, when out of business, nobody acquired those assets.  This is not on live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure what ever happened to on live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been around for a year or two.  Yeah, I think they just went to bed.  Yeah, network's not going to help us today.  That's the problem right there.  There you have it in the nutshell.  Illustrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Problem with that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  GDC is going on right now, the Game Developers Conference.  It's a fun event.  I think next year we should go down and do GDC.  That'll be a lot of fun.  Interesting.  One of the complaints about the Nexus 6.  I don't know if you've noticed this, Jeff, or if you've  noticed it, Jason, but the Nexus 6 was encrypted by default.  So when you got it, it was encrypted.  And a lot of people complain that that's really slowed  down file access on the device.  Google has decided not to do that anymore.  Google is not going to encrypt new Lollipop devices by  default, but it may be required in future versions  of Android.  So get ready.  They very quietly have backed down.  I think they acknowledged, in fact, we saw the benchmarks.  There's a huge differential in speed on the Nexus 6 because  of that encryption.  It's because there is an encryption  hardware built into it.  You know what?  I never really noticed it.  You notice it in the benchmark.  It wasn't like I was sitting there running my hands.  Oh my gosh, this is slow.  But it does make it slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It should have been a choice anyway from the beginning.  I mean, it's OK to pop up and say, would you like to  encrypt your device?  You may notice a small sliver.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Android's always allowed you to do that.  You go into the settings.  You have to have a passcode, either a longer  number or a password.  But then you can encrypt, which I recommend because  otherwise that data is all visible.  It's not encrypted when the phone is on, though.  So remember, you have to turn it off for best results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if it gets stolen or something like that, you're  protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But ours, Technica notes that that new Moto E we're talking  about, which is one of the first non-Google lollipop  devices, is unencrypted.  The new Galaxy S6 demo units at the Mobile World Congress,  not encrypted, according to ours review editor, Ron  Amadeo.  It appears I cannot turn off encryption.  No.  On the 6, you have to root it and modify it.  And it's a little shaky on that.  So Google has backed down a little bit.  It needs to support full disk encryption, but it doesn't have  to have it turned on.  That's the key.  It should be enabled.  It should be, but it doesn't have to be.  It is very strongly recommended that you do it,  according to Google, as we expect this to change to must  in future versions of Android.  But that's fine as long as future hardware supports it  with hardware decryption.  And you have fast MMC or something faster in the  storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's important to note, too, that encryption  affects compression.  Once you encrypt something, you can't compress it.  You can't compress it really at all, because the data's  basically been scrambled.  So there's no duplicate data to compress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  We're going to take a break, and then it'll be change log  time.  Yes, we're bringing back the change log in just a moment.  Actually, there's a couple more things from GDC we'll  talk about, too.  Just looking down the run down.  John Carmack says, Samsung is going to put all of its might  behind the Gear VR.  All of its might?  All of its might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd recommend that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't Carmack go to work?  Oh, yeah, he's working for Oculus Rift.  Oculus Rift powers Gear VR.  That's why he's talking about this.  Our show today brought to you by lynda.com.

It's a good way to get them up to speed.  Absolutely.  Time for the Google Change Log.  I was shocked when I went to contacts.google.com.  And I said, what is this?  I don't know.  Don't show this yet.  Yeah, I won't show it.  I won't show it.  It's going to show all my phone numbers and everything.  But if you are a Google Contacts user, you might want  to go there and take a look at it.  It's pretty sweet.  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just brought it up today.  It does look pretty nice.  It's a lot nicer than the old one.  Right away, you notice that they've separated.  And I don't know whether this is virtual or in reality.  But contacts used to be under Gmail.  You click on Contacts.  And it would still be in Gmail, but your  contacts would show.  Well, it looks like they're perhaps separating contacts out  a little bit as a separate app.  Because now it's under contacts.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's always been there.  So that's not new.  But it always goes back to Gmail, though, right?  Well, it's the same one as in Gmail.  What I like about this, they've separated into starred  and frequently contacted, which is nice.  I think that some of the phones did that.  And the first thing I see, you have 86 duplicate contacts.  Would you like to merge them?  That's new.  Yep.  And it pops right up, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This has been a problem people have complained about for a  long time, the fact that your contacts come from all these  different sources.  And you end up with five versions of your contacts.  Oh, it did such a nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it really does it very nicely.  And it did it instantly.  Oh my god, I've been waiting for this.  So again, this is something some phone operating systems  offered you, I think Samsung might have.  But boy, it did that nicely.  It did it beautifully.  So I don't know, god, it's been how long since they've  updated contacts.  I use it like crazy, so highly recommended.  Also, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just going to say that the preview, if you go to  contacts.google.com slash preview, you should be able to  check it out.  And it doesn't work with apps accounts, I believe yet.  That's why I was moaning.  Yeah.  So sorry.  Sorry for your loss.  Sorry for your loss.  If you have a Gmail account, it should work.  So Jeff, you just don't use your regular Gmail account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I use my apps account.  And for god's sakes, those are the professionals and that's  work and all that.  I just can't, I do not understand how they make  second class citizens.  I don't understand it.  A, and B, I'm sorry I've complained about this before.  But even when I'm not signed in to my Gmail account  anywhere, I'm signed into my apps account, it is my  account, when I open a new window for various things, it  switches to my Gmail.  I'm not signed in at all.  It switches to my Gmail.  So sometimes when I try to open a document, somebody sent  me a document, I can't open it because it keeps on insisting,  no Jarvis, you're going to open this in the account where  you can't open it.  You're going to open it in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is annoying.  And what I found is that I get really good at changing the  URLs to go to my second, third or fourth user that's  signed in just so that I can get back to the feature that I  wanted to do originally because it always defaults to  that U0 user.  And so yeah, I find myself getting really good at hacking  the URLs just to get to the right account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you do it, Aaron, seriously, would you do a  little tutorial on that, a little Google Plus thing?  And I'd kill to have that.  Yeah, absolutely.  I can absolutely do it.  And you know, the thing about this is, and Sundar's in  charge of both on Android, it's easy as pie to go back and  forth from accounts.  It doesn't confuse the phone.  It doesn't confuse the OS.  It works really well.  Within the applications, you can easily switch.  I would just kill my Gmail account entirely and switch my  Google Plus to my apps.  But I have grandfathered stuff.  All of my Play Store stuff is on my Gmail account.  And if you switch it over, you lose all your stuff.  So I'm stuck.  I can't do it.  I'm sorry for the rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a big problem.  I completely agree with you.  And I wish that, I was hoping that when they brought out  Inbox, that that would be the merge.  I wasn't so thrilled with the features of Inbox, but I was  really thrilled because I thought it was going to merge  all of my apps and all of my mail accounts, five, six, seven  different mail accounts that I have.  I thought, oh, now I have one place to go to read all my mail  from all my accounts.  Nope, sorry, you're an apps user.  You can't use the Inbox yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you know what, Aaron?  Now I'm really stuck.  So now when I go to contacts, it insists on taking me to the  preview in my Gmail account.  I can't get to the contacts in my apps account at all now.  That's not good.  Yep.  I cannot switch.  You're not allowed to switch accounts.  I'm stuck.  I now can't get to contacts in apps.  Hello, Google.  Is there anybody there listening?  Hello.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  There.  OK, now it came up.  See, they fixed it already.  They clicked the switch.  Wow, that's quick.  And I tried it, and then it says 404 error because it's  insisting on now sticking with the preview because it wants  to show me the preview.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's another one that's, I guess, maybe a way to get you  to upgrade your smartphone.  Remember, there's an issue with early versions of the Google  browser, not Chrome, but the Google browser that came in  Android, the AOSP browser.  It's not secure, and Google says we're not fixing it.  And that's been the case for some time.  If you're using, when did they eliminate that browser?  I think it was in KitKat, or maybe even,  must have been KitKat.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was KitKat.  But the fix for a long time for pre-KitKat phones  was to get Chrome.  You just download Chrome and just don't use the built-in  browser, you use Chrome.  Chrome 42 will be the last version to support Ice Cream  Sandwich earlier.  So you'll still have Chrome, but no more fixes after Chrome  I think we're at version 40 right now.  So there'll be an update or two.  Let me see.  The last version for ICS is currently slated to arrive in  mid-April.  You will not get any more releases after that.  43 and above will not work on Ice Cream Sandwich.  Of course, the version you have will continue to work, but it  may not be secure.  And don't go back to the browser built in on earlier  versions of Android, because it's really not secure.  So go to Jelly Bean at least, KitKat, Lollipop, all of them  will continue to have support for Chrome.  This is something kind of new in the Google space.  Microsoft and Apple have always done that.  After a certain amount of time, an operating system dies.  Google's problem with operating systems with Android  is there's too many versions in use all the time.  Maybe this is one way they can push that along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm assuming that's only, I'm looking at the graph here that  shows the usage.  It looks like there's only 5.9, maybe a total of 13% of  the user base is using Ice Cream Sandwich and below.  But that's tens of millions of people.  It's a lot of people, but I thought it was going to be a  lot higher than that.  Yeah, I'm surprised it's that low.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe those people will finally get a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, or just switch to Dolphin or one of the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, you could use another browser.  You can use another browser.  You don't have to use Chrome, right?  Problem is they're not going to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, HTC is making a virtual reality head.  So we talked about the Galaxy Gear, the VR.  I don't know if it's this picture or if it really is  like honking big.  It's called the Vive.  Geez.  Maybe she's got a small head.  I don't know.  It's pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is big.  But HTC is not going the Samsung route with this.  This is a true standalone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the Oculus Rift.  It has its own screens and all that stuff.  Which makes it more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the gamers.  I'm not.  Is this stuff going to be a big market?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm alone in saying that.  What do you think, Aaron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  There's potential here.  And I think that's why everybody's into it.  There's potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook spent billions to acquire Oculus Rift.  Samsung's doing it.  HTC is doing it.  Here's my take on it.  It is for gaming, I guess, because it's immersive.  And in games, you do want to.  When you're playing Call of Duty,  you want to be on the battlefield.  But we talked about this on Windows Weekly.  I'm so much more excited about HoloLens and augmented reality.  And Google, by the way, has a solution for that.  They've acquired companies, and they're developing very rapidly  an augmented reality solution.  Augmented reality means you still see the world around you,  but superimposed upon it in the glasses are things.  Whether they're menu items, controls, a game you're playing.  And I like that, Ben.  More like a heads up display.  It's a heads up display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also able to see infinitely.  You can see infinitely.  I was just talking to some friends of mine  from our local makerspace.  And actually, their company Designs,  they've worked on the James Webb telescope and some other things.  So they're into ocular technology, right?  And they were saying that the true benefit here  is more in the heads up display and the ability to look out infinitely.  I think so.  As opposed to these Oculus Rift type things  that are a little bit limited and make you sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make you sick, and they seal you in a room  where you go to another place and you're sitting there  as sitting duck for burglars.  And I don't like that.  I don't know why I'm so paranoid about it.  This is a deal with Valve that they're doing.  And these are dual 1080p screens,  which are more than we've seen so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Nicole Lea and Gadget actually had a pretty great review of it today  and just explained her entire experience with it.  And you read that...  Did she get sick?  No, she didn't get sick.  In fact, she walked away from it and basically said,  this device has convinced me on VR.  I was very skeptical going in.  And this particular experience is VR done right.  That's funny because somebody said that when they saw the Oculus Rift, right?  But the Oculus Rift also, from what I understand,  kind of a lower res display.  And I think as far as VR is concerned,  it's all about immersion and being able to escape your reality  and enter something else.  If you can get that view to be as clear and crisp  as it sounds like we're kind of heading,  then it becomes a pretty revolutionary step, I think,  in the success of this type of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it says something, too, that the fact that Valve has bought into this, right?  I mean, because they've been investigating this type of technology for years.  And the fact that they've chosen to maybe, you know,  put their skin in the game with this device.  And obviously, what's interesting is Valve...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry Ellsworth was working for Valve when she created their CastAR,  which is an augmented reality gaming solution.  And when she was fired from Valve, along with lots of other people,  she went to Gabe Nolan and said, can I keep CastAR?  And he said, yeah, we don't want it.  So Valve probably at that point had made the decision,  we're not going to go for augmented reality, we're going to go for virtual reality.  And I think VR makes sense in gaming.  I do think it makes sense.  Because it's an immersive thing, although Minecraft in the HoloLens  looked pretty dang awesome.  So HTC and Valve are making the Vive.  Be interesting to play.  I mean, it'd be fun to play Portal in this thing.  We're going to skip the Xfinity ad here real quickly,  given that Comcast is killing our bandwidth today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, VR could be as big of a deal as gaming kind of has been, right?  Gaming's always been, for the longest time, it's been this kind of passion,  passionate section of technology that a good number of people are into.  But, you know, it's just the kids.  They're into the gaming and blah, blah, blah.  And now it's overwhelmingly mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  VR could be more too, like you could go to Paris.  You could go to the Playboy Mansion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that would be neat.  I just see it being a huge gaming referral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's also going to be expensive, right?  Yeah.  I've broken the stream.  I was going to somehow broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, ultimately, we all want the holodeck, right?  I mean, the holodeck would be VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Except wait a minute.  Well, no, it could be AR.  Oh.  Well, would it?  Because the holodeck, you're in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're moving around in it.  And it was a room, right?  It wasn't a, you weren't lying in a chair with a helmet on.  Right, right, right.  You were physically moving through space.  So it's a technology that doesn't exist is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just doesn't exist yet.  But I think AR is closer though, right?  Because AR can take those lines on the wall and then paint over those with  something different, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that really, ultimately, VR isn't going to work until you jack in.  Yeah.  If I can jack into the metaverse, then maybe I'll play your silly little game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was pretty interesting, though, also to see HTC kind of spreading its wings a little bit.  Right.  Being like, you know, we've kind of struggled.  We've made great hardware.  People love us for our hardware.  But we've still ended up struggling in the smartphone tablet space.  Let's try this new kind of emerging trend right now and just make it, you know,  partner with Valve, which they've done interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you guys think of the new Google campus?  Are you excited about it?  I want to go there.  I want to live there.  This is hubris.  Jeff, isn't there kind of an axiom in business that when you start building the massive  corporate headquarters, that's the sign that it's the beginning of the end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Apple too.  You know what kind of bothered me, though, Leo?  Is that I've been in the buildings.  They're absolutely fine buildings.  Those buildings have been for many, many years.  The waste of creating, you know, landfill out of tearing down those buildings just  bothered me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a restored natural habitat around permanent Greek near the proposed landing project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the other thing that occurred to me.  So what they're basically doing is putting a dome around the campus so you can't  wander around Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be you can you can bicycle inside it.  Right.  And you'll never leave it.  It's the bio dome.  It's bio dome.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, drive by Facebook and it's boring as hell outside.  Inside is Disneyland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Now, this is the existing Google campus, right?  This is which, as you say, works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a building.  It's a it's a building with cubies, you know, cubies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to hoolie it.  That's what they're going to do.  Yeah.  They're going to turn it into hoolie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're from what they're describing, they're creating modules like building modules that  can move.  So you're working with a team and you want to coordinate with another team.  Your module actually moves to another module to another section of the building.  It's like a hamster habitat.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hamster habitat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or when you're working on the wave team and it disappears, you suddenly get ejected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the helicopter comes down, picks up your module and everybody in it takes you  somewhere else.  Goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing about it is that I've been now I've gone to enough Google stuff out there  where you end up across one on one.  Yeah.  And people there's a real isolation then you really feel like you're in the kiddie table.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The other thing is they I think is also included in agreement to build housing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's how you get these deals done for the town of Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's critical.  Yeah.  And they mentioned that the canopies will also block pollution.  Maybe they're planning for global warming.  Let me in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the TV show The Dome.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'll bet I'll bet somewhere in some report there, there's the zombie scenario  how to keep zombies out.  Knowing the geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you can, but if you can, if you can retrofit these buildings and make them more environmentally  friendly and save, you know, power and lighting costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But are these existing buildings under this dome?  Oh no, no, no, they're tearing it down.  It's all brand new.  Brand new.  We're tearing them down.  It's biosphere three, I'm telling you.  Look at that.  They have a giant faucet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This could just as easily be a sculpture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the water they're wasting.  Net zero parking.  They want a net consolidated parking below the building.  So once you get there, they take your car, they crush it and you have to stay.  Your car will never be seen again.  It does look beautiful.  But I'm just saying when companies get this big and this grandiose and they spend this  much money like Apple, that is often the beginning of the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's often the peak moment, said the guy who built the million dollar studio in Dagtown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long does it take to build something like this?  Like are we talking five years, 10 years?  Decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not like Sagrada Familia.  I mean, first they got to get approval.  That's what this process is, is getting Mountain View to go along with it.  Apple's campus I think was a five year build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This can't be that much more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet it is.  I mean, only because it's so much bigger.  If you go for the full view, the full enchilada, that never happens anyway, right?  This is a rendering.  This is something that someone came up with and said, here's what it could look like.  It's like a concept car.  It's only a concept.  Yeah.  It's not going to be like this.  If they went for the full enchilada, I think it would be more than 10 years to get everything  done.  But you're right, that's not going to happen.  So yeah, we're probably looking at five years, eight years to get the majority of it done  if they choose to go this route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess they can do it as fast as they want.  Just hire more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They certainly have the money.  How much do you want to spend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some of these, like that image right there, that's why I said it looks like they were  repurposing the buildings, right?  Looks like they've taken the sides off of the buildings.  It doesn't look like they're completely tearing down the buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like the notion that these canopies make you, that you're outside but you're also  inside.  So you don't need walls in the buildings because it never rains.  It never, you know, the climate never varies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a perfect place to do something like this because it doesn't rain that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the goals Google has is to put its campus entirely on solar, be carbon neutral.  And this might be a part of that project as well.  But they've got, there's no, you got to get rid of hobos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'm just saying the hobos are going to love this.  It's so big, I'm just joking, but it is so big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how you keep it secure.  Looks like you can just, like it's not sealed, right?  Oh no, I'm sure it is.  Is it?  You have to go through an airlock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would imagine that's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if the planet, if all of the oxygen boils off the surface of the planet, it will still  be safe.  It'll still be okay at Google Biosphere 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The front door is actually in New York, but then you transport it.  All right.  What's the tube, the fast tube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Hyperloop or the other?  Hyperloop, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hyperpneumatic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube has a billion viewers and no profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon has gazillion customers and no profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that in order to do YouTube, you have to spend a lot of money on infrastructure  and bandwidth and hardware.  YouTube has revenue, $4 billion in revenue.  That's a one-third increase over the year before that.  It's 6% of Google's overall sales, but I think we talked about this last week, actually.  I don't think Google's worried.  No, YouTube is a engine for Google.  Walmart has pulled out of a deal with Google over shared data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's so much an issue of consumer privacy as it is Walmart's privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google ended up knowing too much.  That's our data, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Walmart had signed up for Google advertising service that showed shoppers where products  are available at nearby stores, but a month later, they pulled out over concerns about  sharing store inventory and pricing data with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go.  I'm just looking at a quick...  What's this about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google wants to help you build, put solar in your house?  Because I want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's just it's the rental deal.  I mean, it's not a bad deal, right?  They own it and they lease it to you and you get the net value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is nothing new.  Their power purchase agreements for many companies do this.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just investing more.  This is actually in conjunction with SolarCity, which is one of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's a good way to do it.  The school that I serve on the board is thinking about doing this.  The company comes in, they build all the infrastructure, they don't pay, charge you anything.  You get effectively free power, you save a lot of money and yes, it's a smart...  It's actually a smart for everybody.  It's a good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I new thought now that I have ice standing is I wonder if it helps with snow on the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, I think I forgot to ask Paul about this.  He posted he had to have his snow cleared off his roof.  He's all sorts of damage and really leakage and I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's...  So we had guys tearing ice off the roof today and I talked to somebody in Connecticut and  he said, I said, sorry, I didn't call you back.  That's why he said, oh yeah, well, I got somebody on my roof right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good news.  In Mississippi, Google was being prosecuted by a local district attorney in Mississippi,  actually attorney general of Mississippi, Jim Hood.  And then in the Sony Pictures Entertainment Hack, emails were released that showed that  Sony actually had approached Hood saying, would you mind going after Google for us?  So the judge has decided, Henry T. Wingate, US District Judge, has temporarily barred  Hood from forcing Google to comply with his 79 page subpoena saying it was an illegal  censorship campaign cooked up by Hollywood agreeing with Google.  The judge said Google has the better side of the legal arguments.  Pretty embarrassing, frankly.  Hood was trying to figure out if Google was violating Mississippi laws by exposing internet  users to drugs and pornography across state lines.  He is moving pornography across our state lines.  Project Goliath, Goliath being Google, was revealed in the hack of Sony and it was something  the MPAA was involved in.  They found Hood.  I can't remember.  They got a previous attorney general from Mississippi to lobby Hood to do this.  Paid a lot of money.  Google just bought, we talked about this on Security Now, just bought the entire .app  domain.  So I guess ICANN is selling custom domain names, the GTLDs, generic TLDs.  .app is one of them, .app.  Google spent $25 million.  They bought a number of them.  They've applied for .docs, .android, .free, .fy, .foo.  No worry about .bar, who gets that.  And .app, ICANN has been gradually auctioning these off.  For instance, .tech LLC spent $6.7 million on the .tech domain name last year beating  out Google.  Amazon bought .buy for $5 million, .spot for $2.2 million.  People got .blog and they say, well, we're going to make it easier for people who are  on blogger.com to, without any domain name fooling around, have a .blog address.  But the .app, I don't know if they're going to make that public or keep it to themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's another gold rush.  I mean, we're all old enough to remember when this happened back in the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember sex.com sold for a lot?  I really thought that the generic .com names like tv.com and sex.com would be worth something.  Business.com sold for a lot, I think.  And they were worthless because they were generic.  Precisely because they were generic.  Turned out Google.com was worth a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other issue of that is, what we found when I worked on newspaper sites is that if  your brand didn't match your domain, you lost all kinds of value because people didn't  recall you.  But if your domain is generic and you think that's valuable, you can't trademark the  brand then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So Google, because they are a registrar, lets you currently register.  You know, Hover does this.  They have a lot of crazy names.  Google has .how, .soy, .minna.  They want .dad, .here, .eat, .new.  But some of them, I think there was one that they were going to keep to themselves.  They were just going to own it.  I can't remember what that was.  .god.  .god.  They're keeping that to themselves.  .universe.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's important to mention, so we had the story last week, Leo, and we talked about  it at the Fairmount, that Google was going to ban adult content on Blogger and then not  very long after the show at all, like a day or two, they decided to reverse that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We had an interesting debate and I mentioned on Twitter that you got involved in a Twitter  conversation with a pornographer who said, we support it because we think it's better  for us and for kids if there's neighborhoods where adult stuff is.  If you think about it, if you're in the adult business, part of the hassle is all the people  trying to shoo you away.  So am I characterizing it correctly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he said.  Yeah.  But then what's her name?  Blue.  Oh, Violet Blue.  Violet Blue and others had an entirely different rationale saying that basically, I think a  lot of it is just people who are just different in life and are going to be discriminated  against because they got rid of this.  And so I think on a basis of free speech, I'm glad it's still there.  Of course, I never look at any of it.  They reverse themselves completely.  Never see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Steve Gibson just signed in the chat to tell me that the domain Google bought  and is keeping to itself is .dev.  So if you're a Google developer, you'll have your own TLD all to yourself.  Look at this on Street View.  I don't know.  Is there somebody doing ziplines on?  Yeah, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got the backpack on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's ziplining through the Amazon.  I don't think I can look at this.  I think my palms will sweat.  Ziplining is fun.  Of course, you would never want to do this.  Look at this.  He's wearing the backpack on a zipline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would literally have a heart attack halfway down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun.  We're in Belize.  We have a zipline up the Rhodopeus in the Redwood Forest up here.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've done it a lot of times.  It's great fun.  My mom did it.  My mom at what, 70?  She did a couple years ago.  72, 73.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so fun.  It's a little sweaty palm, but that's...  It can be, especially if you're afraid of heights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what scared me more was we had to go up.  We were in Hawaii and it was the climb up to the top of this huge tree.  The zipline part was no sweat, but the climb up there on this little rope ladder to get  to this 50 feet in the air.  That was the part that was a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had to lay down.  That was scary.  That was a little disconcerting, but once you're up there, jump off.  Here's the thing you'll really like, Jeff.  When you're on top of these trees, you're very high up.  You're hundreds of feet up.  They sway about five feet in each direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like being on the outside of a tall building.  Like, woo.  Not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  Now you're going to have nightmares.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will.  My palms, my literally my palms are sweating.  Galvanic skin response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't do it.  Celebrate good times.  Bradley Horowitz is back running Google+.  Which is great news.  That is very good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But notice, I can't figure out the criminology of the wording of it because he said photos  and stream.  Isn't that weird?  He posted this on his Google+.  He doesn't even use the word Google plus by name or mention hangings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's just saying, hey, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  He doesn't even use the word Google plus by name or mention hangouts.  He calls it photos and streams.  Remember that David Bespris had taken over.  But Bradley was originally a Google plus guy, right?  He was part of the original team, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  But under Vic.  Vic left.  So now I guess it's basically Vic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead of giving it to Bradley, they gave it to Bespris.  And now I guess it's Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Bradley is so smart and such a good guy.  He's a great guy.  Really a great product guy.  Love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But photos and streams, that tells you almost a little bit about what they see Google plus  as being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep, absolutely.  And I think they're, you know, I think that the photos especially is the one service that  everyone universally loves.  Love it.  Because they can just set it and forget it.  All their photos are backed up.  Everybody I talked to that has used the service tells me a story of when they dropped their  phone in the toilet or something happened and they were able to get their photos back  and how great it is.  So I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the auto awesomes.  Yep.  I love the playfulness that they do stuff on, you know, special days like the Hasselhoff  summer.  Oh, yeah.  That was funny.  They need to do something like that again.  That was fun.  What was that?  Is that April fools?  When did they do that?  I was here.  I've got a picture of my son on the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's laying on the couch with his phone and David Hasselhoff is next to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you what?  Hey, Bradley.  What are you doing in three weeks?  April Fool's coming up.  What you gonna do?  Something good.  Something good.  OK.  No more of this toilet internet stuff.  That's a waste of your energy.  Do something fun for the users.  OK.  Best person.  I don't know.  Or is it baby?  I don't know how you pronounce his name.  Did he I don't know if he changed anything at all.  I mean, Google Plus has just been kind of well, he was already in charge of all kinds

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of engineering stuff.  I think it just was probably I don't know why they didn't.  I guess it was a whole rank thing.  I mean, as a friend of mine tries to convince me that Google is like the military and then  there's all these ranks.  So Vic, you know, was a Brigadier General left.  You needed a Brigadier General to replace him.  But then the truth is that that Google Plus is actually like a base in the Philippines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now what's the deal with Hangouts?  This is also Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I can't tell.  That's what I can't understand.  And in the.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This article in CNET says it's not yet clear what will happen to Hangouts, the communications  feature of Google Plus.  In December, talk Horowitz said the new leader Hangouts is designed as an all purpose communication  tool, marrying video, audio and text messaging.  I love Hangouts.  I live in Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too.  But you know, Leo and you know, I'm Google fanboy and all that.  But the fact that I'm now on a Mac doing Skype kind of hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's a part of Hangouts is the video conversations.  I use it for my texting.  I do too.  I do that too.  The default texting and all my Android phones.  Because I get desktop texting.  I make calls with it.  It's my phone call feature on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I get Google Voice is integrated.  Google Voice basically is.  I get all my voicemail in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I really love the ability to draw.  I didn't even know this was possible.  You can do drawings in Google Hangouts.  Did you know that?  I did not know.  OK, this is so weird.  If you hover.  Show it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put the phone down so we can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should I do it on the phone?  I can do it on my desktop.  The problem is I don't want you to see phone numbers.  So maybe I shouldn't do it on the desktop.  Maybe I'll make a new one.  Let me let me text you, Aaron.  Sure.  I don't know if it's going to show your phone or something.  Let's find somebody whose phone.  Yeah, I think it just shows your email.  You don't care about that, do you?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's fine.  OK, so here I am.  Let's make it a little bit bigger.  So I can now.  This is Aaron Newcomb.  I could video call you.  I can text you.  And if I have a phone number for you, it will also allow me to choose SMS or Hangouts.  But watch as I hover my mouse over on the right.  I didn't know this has been around for more than a year.  A little pen shows up.  You don't see it.  And now I can draw it to you.  Oh.  And that's going to send that to you.  And if it's if we're sending text message, it'll send it as an MMS.  Isn't that funny?  That is cool.  Oh, isn't that?  Nobody knows that, you know.  But you do know if I type Woot, a little Woot man comes out.  Yeah, yeah. So you got see, got and now the little Woot man pops up.  You know about that.  Yeah. See, I'll see if I can get it on my drawing.  And there's some other ones.  What are some of the other?  Other little things I can type.  It's a ha ha ha ha one.  Oh, I know. Happy birthday.  Oh, there's a message for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The message for me is an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see that? Happy birthday.  If you just type this in the text.  OK, I'm sorry. I'm just easily amused.  That's cool. Did you know that?  No, no. Did you know ponies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you did it? Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to send you ponies.  Wait a minute. It'll show up on your phone.  Maybe it's not. What was it?  Is it? Oh, here we go.  Is it slash ponies?  I thought that. Yeah.  Look, little ponies are running across your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do the happy birthday one again. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun. There's a bunch of these.  I'm sure David will add.  Bradley will add more.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woo. Woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool. Pitchforks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other one. P I T C H.  For chaos. Then the peasants are very angry.  Now, I guess you have to do slash.  I guess that's for the big pitchfork salesmen were upset.  Here come here. Where? A.  Oh, you forgot the P. Oh, I spelled it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Itchforks is an entirely different graphic.  It's a different kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The title of the show. Itchforks.  Here they go. Here come the natives.  Oh, they're mad. Oh, they're mad.  The peasants are revolting.  So fun. That's awesome.  These are Easter eggs in hangouts.  Somebody pointed out they've got Nick software  and all they've done with it really is make SnapStream.  And but they could incorporate that into photos.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  Bradley, we're expecting big things of you.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Anything else before we wrap it up?  John Carmack's I mentioned this says Samsung will  really be throwing its weight behind your VR.  Who cares?  Apple passes Samsung and Q4 are smartphone sales.  But I think this number is interesting.  1.9 billion mobile phones were sold last year of all kinds.  1.9 billion.  In one year. In one year.  Crazy.  What are there? 7 billion people in the earth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. 1.9 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And apparently there's a big problem in Canada.  Leonard Nimoy has passed away.  I love this story.  And turns out the $5 bill in Canada,  whoever that guy is looks so much like Spock  that Canadians have taken to drawing hair,  eyebrows and a little Vulcan,  a little Starfleet symbol on the collar.  And these Spock bills, big problems.  According to the Toronto Sun, the Bank of Canada is urging,  urging Star Trek fans to stop defacing currency.  That is Canada's seventh Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,  who happens to have the strong resemblance to Leonard Nimoy.  There he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really is. God, that takes an eye to see that.  I wouldn't have seen that.  Once you've seen it, you can't unsee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can't.  Apparently there's all kinds.  There's quite a few of them.  Because everybody does their own thing.  I love it.  Everybody's doing their own thing.  I thought the one we showed first was the best, though.  They did the Starfleet emblem and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I appreciate that Spocking is now a verb.  With Spocking, you're a $5.  Do not Spock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a tribute worthy of Leonard Nimoy, I might say.  Uber is buying a mapping company.  HBO has set its price for its cord-cutting version of HBO Go,  $15 a month, a little high.  Well, it's pretty much what you pay on cable.  Right.  I think that's what the upshot of this is.  You won't be able to cord-cut to save money.  No.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can save everything else.  Right.  I don't know.  If HBO and Showtime were available,  then I would start to consider it.  Yeah, but then you're going to have to pay for your internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the time you add up all the services,  it's going to cost exactly...  I guarantee you.  Yeah, they're going to get you.  They're figuring this out right now.  It's going to cost you exactly what you're paying now.  You'll go, oh, I saved a dollar.  Or maybe it costs a dollar more.  It'll be so close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I...  Well, I also wonder if I go and threaten to cord-cut,  what they would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll do what they did for me.  And I'm now in my second year of free HBO.  Nice.  There you go.  Oh, there you go.  See?  Two solid years of free HBO.  See?  And a bunch of other discounts.  But I don't know if it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, is HBO really...  I mean, Netflix is still, what, $7, $8 a month or something?  Yeah, $9, I think.  Yeah.  So I mean, is that really worth it to get those HBO shows?  It is certain shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want girls, you want girls.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Who else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Game of Thrones tax is what it is.  That's exactly what it is.  Totally.  I am such a fan of wireless charging.  I actually...  It helps me determine what phones to get.  I was really pleased to see the S6 is going to be doing  both Qi and PowerMAT.  Those are competing.  I added Qi charging to my Note 4, which doesn't come with it.  But Samsung sells in a relatively expensive back.  And all it does is add a little circuitry.  You note that when most of the Samsung phones have,  you know, have little connectors for that.  So you just snap that on and Qi charges.  Not quite as well as the phones that has Qi built in.  But I love Qi charging.  Now, IKEA is going to release furniture with built-in chargers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Your night table has it.  You just put the phone down, that's it.  But you know what I really want, Leo?  I want a desk with Qi built in.  A Qi desk.  I want a Qi desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Qi desk.  Yeah, it seems kind of silly to have nightstands.  Let's have a desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, at night, you put it on the nightstand.  Are those lamps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are those lamps, do they have Qi charging bases?  I think so, yeah.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the question.  Is there a Qi charging laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  I don't think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that would be tough to charge.  It's using inductance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have a feeling, you know, it's just not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a Qi charging cutting board, apparently.  What?  I feel good.  Why would you want that?  It looks like a cutting board to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you have a wireless knife, I don't know.  Yeah, it does look like a cutting board.  Doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they've got it surrounded by food,  so it's like, oh, I'll just chop up my meat  and leave my phone on the cutting board to charge up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wireless is, I'm just, I love it.  And all phones should have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so brilliant.  Why they didn't think of it before,  just to make a phone out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those little pads, I mean,  I could have bed those into a desk pretty easily.  I mean, they should be selling a desk.  I don't know why they're not, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Richard Gingras shows off his  woodworking projects all the time in bars and stuff.  You know, I could imagine he'd make that.  Well, for that matter,  I think wireless is coming to Starbucks, right?  But there has to be little elements.  Yeah.  I mean, imagine if you went to a bar  and the whole bar was Qi.  You just put your phone down and it charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sad to say that one of my heroes, Matt Howey,  who created Metafilter 16 years ago,  and Metafilter, we talked about this,  was going through an economic crisis of kind.  It wasn't making as much money from Google ads  and so forth.  He's decided to retire.  He is...  Though he said it's leaving it in good hands.  Yeah.  Because the moderators are still there.  It's a community.  Yeah.  But it is, if you look at it,  it really feels like the latter day web, doesn't it?  It's kind of the good old days.  Yeah.  And Matt is a sweet guy and I wish him the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is a great guy.  And he's gone through this surus in the past.  Yeah.  He asked this question years ago when I was around it  and God bless him, stuck it out and stayed with it  and really built something amazing.  Yep.  So Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Watch every season.  Turn, turn, turn.  If you want a broadcast career, we got a place for you.  Just come on over here.  Yeah.  And this article from Kevin Marks,  Facebook, Twitter and Google plus shun HTML  and he blames that on the infographic plague.  I don't know, Kevin.  By choosing images over links and by restricting markup,  Facebook, Twitter and Google plus are hostile to HTML.  And it is true.  In fact, there's a new service that a new iPhone app  that lets you screen cap text and put it in Twitter.  And this is how people are getting around  the 140 character barrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not only that, I think medium has it built in  so you can do that in medium now.  Yeah.  That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's my plea for, wait a minute, 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that, oh, did I, how did I, it's my fault.  I put it in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How old is that?  No, no, it says on March 4th.  Unless this is an old article.  Maybe Kevin just typed the wrong year.  Please provide equal space for HTML.  That's not gonna happen.  And for authors and designers everywhere,  stop making giant bit maps when well-written text  with charts that are worth the bits spent on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and charts and charts and texts that are searchable.  I mean, you don't know the text that's quoted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in Twitter now.  You could say the same thing about podcasts.  No, this was originally published 2011.  Oh, sorry.  On his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was on mediums, I presume it was new.  It's my fault.  Yeah, I think he reposted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he did, yeah.  So good news.  It showed up at my feet.  Nothing has gotten better in three years.  Still sucks.  It's on my feet, that's why I put it there.  So yes, it's old stuff.  Kevin Marx's greatest hits.  We love you, Kevin.  He'll be back soon.  Do you wanna rant on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think we're gonna show the cover first one second.  If you click on it, just show the cover.  So Der Spiegel in Germany had what I thought  was an absolutely ridiculous year.  Oh my God.  So it has not the CEO of Google, but Sergey Brin.  Sergey Brin, Marissa Meyer, Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's this guy that Sergey's right?  That's Uber, Travis Kalanick, Uber.  Oh, Uber's Travis Kalanick and of course Tim Cook.  And it's Die Welt Regierung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means the world government.  How Silicon Valley is controlling our future.  Oh, come on.  And it's just obnoxious.  Now I use the German N-word to describe this  and I got accused of violating Godwin's law,  but my real argument is that they were using

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that kind of reference.  Whenever you're talking about ruling the world,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, the rhetoric is just over the top ridiculous.  And the thing is-  Actually, I kind of agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think these guys are mad.  They left out Elon Musk, they left out a few people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, they're just pandering to the,  I mean, a large popular opinion over in Europe, right though?  I mean, isn't this-  Supposedly.  They're totally pandering to a fear.  I think a common fear that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I for one welcome our new Silicon Valley overlord.  I do too.  I want smart people to run the world.  I'm ready to move into the-  Not ambitious politicians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna be a hell of a lot better than Congress.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm ready to move into the new Google verse  and shun the rest of society, right?  The new Googleplex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll live under the dome if that's what it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Live under the dome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, zombies be damned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Embrace the dome, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is the staple.  It has been for decades of a lot of science fiction,  in fact, I think Neuromancer,  corporations run the world, not governments.  And I think that we're headed that way a little bit.  When you see Steve Wozniak in a Cadillac commercial,  you know, times have changed.  Tell me again,  Die Weltregierung.  Die Weltregierung.  Die Weltregierung.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we don't need to go into any further ramp,  but Spiegel just answered me today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dr. Spiegel gets a big pass for me.  They've been one of the journals publishing  a lot of the Snowden material.  I'm gonna give them a pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have to.  I would respect them.  I think they're just over the top, over the top.  Too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too much.  Yes, let's move on.  We're gonna get your tips, picks, number of the week,  and we're gonna do an inside tweet right after.  Lisa has told me we want to tell the world  what's going on at this little business of ours,  this little light of mine.  I'm gonna let it shine.  Our show brought to you by HipChat.  Actually, I do have some updates on our website.  We've been using,  that's when I first encountered HipChat.  We've been using it with our web design team  in Austin down there at Four Kitchens.  And they're big Atlassian house.  They use Jira and all that stuff.  If you're a developer,  HipChat makes a whole heck of a lot of sense.  At first, you look at it and go,  well, it's just Instant Messenger.  Oh no, it's a whole lot more.  It's kind of Instant Messenger on steroids.  It allows you to do document sharing,  video chat, screen sharing.  It works with 57 services.  There's a sense of fun to it too, much like Hangouts.  It has emojis and fun things.  It's just a great way to stay in touch with a team,  especially if the team is spread out.  Email, too slow, it's asynchronous.  Meetings, oh God, not another meeting.  Regular Instant Messaging doesn't have all the features  that HipChat does.  And it even works with GitHub and Jira, of course,  and Zendesk.  We use it, I have HipChat running on all my systems,  all my mobile devices.  Works everywhere you are.  There's even a great HTML5-based web version.  So on a Chromebook, no problem.  Easy to use.  We've built a HipChat team for our engineering team,  our sales team.  It's just amazing.  Get your team on the same page in seconds.  Of course, HipChat has a freemium version  you can use free forever,  but for the next 30 days,  you're gonna get the full version of HipChat,  including bonus features of video and screen sharing.  You can try HipChat free, no credit card required,  at HipChat, H-I-P-C-H-A-T.com slash twig.  Of course, it supports Linux.  Of course, it supports Linux.  Sign up, click on start chatting,  and invite a few team members and try it free for 30 days.  In fact, I wanna kinda get it going here.  So for the first 100 people that respond to this ad,  you're gonna get 90 days free, three months free.  HipChat.com slash twig.  Get on in there.  HipChat, your team, your project, in sync, instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  HipChat's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you use at NetApp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We use a combination of things.  We use Chatter, because we're Salesforce.  Sales people use Salesforce.  We use Instant Messenger.  We use a lot of Cisco tools.  But what's nice about HipChat is  it kinda combines all that stuff.  It solves that.  It solves the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, the other thing is it's encrypted.  Yeah.  It's been encrypted.  So it's a really good choice for a team that, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And like you said, especially developers,  some of the things that they plug into,  the developer tools that they plug into.  Oh, it's so cool.  I don't wanna extend the commercial,  but I've looked at it, and it is a really exciting product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a lot of attention to Slack,  Stuart Butterfield's Slack right now.  But if somebody said, okay,  are you gonna use a tool designed by Atlassian  by programmers for programmers for teams?  Or are you gonna use a tool  by a guy who did Flickr and Glitch?  Right.  Actually, Slack is cool.  But HipChat is the tool we use, and I'm really fond of it.  Yep.  Aaron, you got something you wanna,  you're doing, I love all the projects and stuff you do  and the things you do.  Yeah.  Last time you were here, you brought an old-time radio  device that was really a Raspberry Pi.  I love that.  Are you interested in the Windows 10 version of Raspberry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am interested in it.  I'm interested in it, absolutely.  In fact, I just did a review for BYB,  which will be coming up shortly,  on the Raspberry Pi Model 2.  And I forgot to mention, it runs Windows 10.  Yeah.  You know what I thought I'd be fun to do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is make a Twit box.  Yeah.  You know, like a Steam box, but it's a Twit box.  Right.  Because it has HDMI out and everything.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Low power, we could charge 40 bucks for it.  Yeah.  And then just you plug it in and you get Twit on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you get Twit.  Absolutely.  Not all the time.  You could totally do that, and there's a lot more.  I mean, a lot of people run XBMC,  or not sign XBMC anymore, it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what we do.  We put Plex on it or whatever,  and then have, you could do other things.  And have it all set up.  But it's set up for Twit.  For Twit, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You turn it on and boop, there you go.  Choose your show.  I want to do that.  Could absolutely do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're doing refrigerator magnets?  Refrigerator magnets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I try to bring something.  This is great.  Because, you know, I'm a maker at heart,  and I'm always making something.  I figure we need to mix it up a little bit on Twig.  So I like to bring a project.  So my project today is refrigerator magnets.  So don't throw out those old keyboards.  Oh!  A lot of things we talk about at the Makerspace  is reuse those old electronics.  And this is a great way to reuse keyboards.  They already have the letters printed on them.  So why not just attach some magnets to the back?  Oh, and they can be...  And use them as refrigerator magnets.  That's cool.  Yeah, it's kind of cool and techy.  Really easy to do.  You can just pry those keys right off.  You don't have to worry about breaking them  because you're going to reuse them anyway.  Basically, you just saw off,  after you take the keys out,  there'll be a little post.  Well, here you go.  Here's right in the video.  See that little post in the back?  This is from Instructables.com.  This is from Instructables.  You just kind of take that little post off  where it plugs into the keyboard.  Amazing how easy it is to break off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, it's so simple.  Well, I've done that to clean keyboards, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just glue on those little magnets.  And you can even recycle these.  I don't know about you,  but I get these from real estate agents and stuff.  They send you a calendar that goes on your fridge.  Cut up the calendar and put it in the bag.  Just cut up those magnets,  reuse the magnets,  and then put these on your refrigerator.  Much better.  Yeah, if you've got a couple of keyboards,  then you can really start spelling some cool words  or doing some cool...  It's kind of like the poetry magnets, you know?  Yeah.  A little geekier, a little more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What fun.  Instructables.com, if you want to know more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, or just Google keyboard refrigerator magnets.  There's several good Instructables  and links to projects out there that you could follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God bless the hot glue gun.  That's right.  Do you have a favored hot glue gun?  No, just about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can even get them at the dollar store, right?  I mean, they work fine.  So just about any hot glue gun.  Mine has hot and cold,  hot and not so hot temperature control,  which is nice. I like that.  Yeah, I just want any glue gun to work.  Tepid glue gun.  Yep, tepid glue gun, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week?  Well, how do you follow Martha Stewart, you know?  I know, it's tough.  RR Martha.  So,  recode Lauren Good,  I presume it's Good, not Goodie, with an E at the end,  but I'll presume Good.  I think you're right, it's Good, I think, yeah.  I think it is, okay, good.  Said that Google says that the error rate  on Google voice commands is down to 8%,  92% of the time. Wow.  So she had a fun story where she just,  watching House of Cards, she just tried to use it.  And yeah, fine, it's a gimmick, it's a list.  You mean you hold it up to Frank Underwood

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it does searches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it didn't do that, that's too cool.  But all the questions she had, she just asked Google.  Yeah.  And you know, I forget to use voice command,  and it really does become changing when you do use it.  When I do dictate or ask a question,  it really does make life a lot easier.  And I like this story,  because it was a whole bunch of questions  about House of Cards plus other things in life  and what worked and what didn't,  and it does work pretty darn well.  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the number.  8% is higher than you think.  I mean, so for years we used programs  like Dragon Naturally Speaking to dictate,  and it was like 90% accurate.  That sounds really good.  Until you realize that means one in every 10 words  you have to retype.  Suddenly that's not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  The problem here I think is that it just  utterly flummoxes on some things.  Right.  You know, some restaurant names and stuff.  The thing that drives me nuts,  because I'm driving home  and I want to order out for food on the way home,  and so I use voice command, I'm not going to type anything,  and I'll ask for a rest, like there's two,  there's a place around here called Urban Table,  there's two of them.  There's one near me.  I ask for it by town and Google never gives it to me.  I know, that's frustrating, isn't it?  I can't figure out, I'm giving you the data, Google.  Why can't you figure this out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not perfect, it turns out.  That's the revelation of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that weird?  We all kind of have our own ways of looking things up  to make sure we get the right thing.  I mean, I'm sure that we all do that, right?  I do.  I'll type in, you know, I know that if I type in one thing  it's not going to give me the right thing,  so I type in the name of the restaurant.  You game Google.  You game Google.  You totally game Google after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just yell louder, that doesn't seem to help at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I have said some very nasty words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we all look ridiculous as we're driving.  Like we have road rage, we're just upset with,  Google can't hear what we're saying in our cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll bet there's somebody at Google  who has a running F count of people screaming at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, apparently, did you see that article?  Whose text to speech was being saved?  Siri, Siri.  And a guy, I can't remember if it was Reddit or somewhere,  said, hey, by the way, you should know,  I work for a company where we're going through  these audio transcriptions, there's quite a few of them,  and I don't know, they're mining data of some kind out of them,  nothing ominous, but he realized they were actually Siri,  and that all of that stuff's being saved,  and he says it's quite entertaining to hear  the kinds of things people say to Siri,  and apparently there's a database somewhere.  You should be aware of that.  I think that big furor over the Samsung TVs  always baffled me because I thought,  well, don't you know that everybody has to do that,  if there's no way that these devices  can do voice recognition effectively without being online.  The server is always getting your voice after you trigger it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you talked on this show about the fact  that all the voice searches you've ever done  while logged into Google are actually cataloged for you,  and you can hear all those audio files?  Yeah.  What I found really interesting about this,  it doesn't really creep me out that this happens  because I just kind of assume  that's just part of how the service works,  and it's gonna happen, and whatever.  What's weird is, as I've gotten so used to wearing  an Android WearWatch all the time,  all the random misfires that happen throughout the day,  you're talking, and then suddenly there's pop-ups.  I get a lot of those, yeah.  So when you look at the list,  you see all of these transcriptions.  Some of them are actual searches,  like, okay, Google search for blah, blah, blah,  but others are like parts of your daily life,  just like a conversation that you're having,  or something that you're listening to.  And it's really interesting to see it in that perspective  and be like, wow, a lot of the things that I intend to be,  past a Google are, and then there's a lot of stuff  that I do not intend for Google to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if there's a writer for The Good Wife watching,  you're gonna see an episode based around that.  Why did the words, murder her,  come up in your Google transcript?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm almost tempted to play some of these.  If this is in your dashboard, right?  Google.com slash dashboard.  Under audio, I think it's under audio,  because I see here under audio,  I don't know if I dare play any of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll see some of them, and I wonder if some of them  are, you know, look intentionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about this, you want to listen?  Okay, Google, how many tablespoons of sugar  are there in 16 ounces of soda?  That was at a pizza parlor.  Man, you have to have a misfire in there though.  About drinking soda?  Yeah, we were talking, talking.  Here, how about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On my way home now, period.  Do you want me to come right home,  or is it okay if I stop at the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that one's intentional, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm recording.  No, all of these are, some of them are not.  I have tons that are not intentional.  Let me play this, yeah, I don't know if I want to play this.  This is at nine this morning.  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah, I know, right?  And by the way, only you can see these.  Yes.  And you can delete them.  But yeah, isn't that wild?  I don't know if people know that you can see all of these.  That's crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, enough of that.  Now, there's a time later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can all get in a lot of trouble.  I should have previewed these ahead of time.  Because I don't know what happened at nine this morning.  But it was my watch.  Did you do it intentionally?  Oh, no, it was not.  That's why I'm not sure I want to.  Hey, try it real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can have it in preview and then I can, no.  Oh, no, you just want to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious.  You saw it on my butt yesterday.  How much more do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's true.  I just, anyways, no comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't air it, but I was going through it.  We were showing how that the deletion  in the new iCloud photos, the beta that Apple's showing off,  when you delete it on one thing, deletes it everywhere.  And I had very carefully gone through my photos at home  before, because I know I show these on the air.  And I knew we were going to talk about it.  So I went through and deleted anything remotely scandalous.  But for some reason, there's like three pictures of my...  Yep.  Not deleted.  And unfortunately, Jason saw them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The way you would say this is  there's three pictures of your tattoo.  Right.  Maybe that's what that was about.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, there were pictures of your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Derriere.  My derriere.  A butt selfie.  Belfie.  A Belfie.  So I just wanted to give you an update.  Have you played with App Inventor at all?  Or of your kids?  I love App Inventor, and I'm loving it more.  You made it up with it.  Well, I just did, because I...  So in the radio show, I have to hit...  It's a network show,  so I have to hit out times very hard  by the second out times.  And I'm kind of perennially late.  And I had written a script for Apple script,  but it wasn't working anymore.  So I thought, oh, this might be a good use  for my Nexus 7 tablet.  I keep it on the charger.  So I went to App Inventor.  I mentioned this before.  It is so easy.  You drag and drop in pieces of the user interface  in the designer, and then you go in the blocks.  I have to admit, as somebody who's written software,  it's...  I found myself fighting App Inventor,  because there's no case statement.  So I'm building this giant if-then-else tree  and stuff like that.  But ultimately, I did get an app  that is really, it works and it's great.  And it was very simple.  And what happens after you build it,  you just, let's see,  go here and say, build.  You can either, they'll store it for, I think, a day or two.  You can have a QR code that you can just take a picture of  and download it.  Or you can save it to your computer and email it.  So I just saved it.  Actually, I saved it to Google Drive.  And all my devices have Google Drive.  So I can go to Google Drive and download the app,  and I have it now.  And so when it's yellow,  it means I have less than two minutes before the break.  It goes to red with the last minute.  If I'm in a, if I'm talking on the show,  you know, it's green.  If I'm in a commercial, it's blue.  It's just a countdown timer.  It's just a big,  but this was easy to write.  Took me a couple of hours.  Put it on my phone.  I could put it everywhere.  If there's limits to what you can do with App Inventor,  it's really designed, I think,  more to teach kids how to program.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It uses kind of the scratch methodology.  Yeah, it's like scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you play with things like Tinker, T-Y-N-K-E-R,  it's a very similar thing.  You can naturally graduate to this.  But I think they've done a great job.  See, I only have 30 seconds left.  I'm running out of time on the countdown clock.  That's awesome.  It works great.  Good for you.  It's just something very simple.  You're not gonna write the next great app on here,  believe me, but for a little utility.  And what I think is important is that  you gotta teach kids, you want yourself  not to just be consumers, but to be creators.  Even something as simple as this  gives you a sense of mastery over your technology,  and you're not quite as helpless.  And now I've run out of time,  and we're in a commercial break for 342 seconds.  No, I didn't do the thing where you make it  minutes and seconds.  I figured this is good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, doing that, there's no printf.  There's no, doing that is actually a little bit complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you just program in the times for the whole rundown?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I wanted to get fancy, I would put little buttons here  that would let you make it, other people do it.  But just the idea is that you could do something  so simple is really, really great.  It's App Inventor, and all you have to do  is search for App Inventor.  MIT hosts it.  Google developed it originally.  MIT hosts it now, and it's free to use.  And what's cool is you're programming on the web.  You could do it in Google Chrome.  It doesn't, there's no, the whole thing's on the web.  All your code and everything.  Right, right.  You don't need anything.  It's really quick and easy to get started.  Yeah, yeah, I love it.  Count it down to zero, and the bomb didn't go off.  This show has.  Thank you very much for coming up  and joining us here on New York.  Yeah, you bet.  I really appreciate it.  You bet, always a pleasure.  You're on the Google+, you're on the Twitter.  Anything else you want to plug that you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Floss Weekly.  I was on Floss Weekly this morning.  That's what brought you to our studios?  That's what brought me up here.  I said, yeah, I kind of coordinated that  between Randall and Jason, you know, trying to get that.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  No, it's absolutely, it was a really fun morning  with Randall.  If you haven't checked it out,  you should go check out Floss Weekly.  What was the topic?  It was a company called, I'm just pulling it up now.  I want to make a trick of the fling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every Floss Weekly is, these days has been  an open source project of some kind.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  For the last few years, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this one is a little bit of a surprising.  It's called Crisis Cleanup.  I don't know if you've heard about it.  It's an open source application for managing,  after there's a crisis, for managing volunteers.  Wow.  Getting them involved with mobilizing, essentially.  So you've got the Baptist Church and the Methodist Church  and the Lutheran Church, they all want to help out  with some sort of disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they don't want to get in each other's way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't want to get in each other's way.  Maybe some of them have facilities to do overnight  with housing, some of them have food capabilities.  So they can basically take this program and run it  and kind of coordinate a little bit better.  And it's all based on open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love seeing examples of how open source  is being used in business and NGOs and charity.  I mean, it's more than just geeks doing databases.  No SQL databases.  There's a lot of great stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So check that out.  One more thing while I've got the camera.  If you are in the Bay Area  and you'd like to come to a Maker Faire,  we're doing our very own Maker Faire in Benicia.  Oh, fun.  It's on March 28th and it's for the whole Bay Area.  So if you're in this area and you'd like to check it out,  it's benishamakerfaire.com.  Buy your tickets early  because there's going to be a line at the door.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  We've got all kinds of cool stuff.  Maker Faires are so great.  There's an eight year old, eight or nine year old girl  who makes something called cardboard video games.  I don't know what that is,  but I'm really interested to see what she's doing.  So she's going to be coming out and showing that off  and all kinds of other cool stuff.  So check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
