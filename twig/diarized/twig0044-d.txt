Ah, CUNY.  Let's not get that wrong.  Let's not get that wrong.  I'm tearing.  Jay Rosen is also here.  He's from NYU.  And it's good to have you, Jay.  Hello, everyone.  Thanks for inviting me, Leo.  Thanks for being here.  I'm a longtime blogger and observer of the press scene and really somebody I'm really  thrilled to get on the show.  We've been wanting to get you on for some time, so I'm glad we could finally get you  in here.  Excellent.  Yay.  And of course, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  Hi, Gina.  Hello.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Gina and I were talking before the show began about Android development because we're  both kind of intrigued by this platform.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Java and XML, baby.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You get your Android tablet and replace that closed beast you have now, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I did that with the iPhone already, right?  I'm doing a Nexus One and I can't wait to get an Evo.  I'm really excited about the Evo.  I'm jealous of your Evo, Gina.  She got one on Google I.O.  And you've been loving it, haven't you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I don't normally review handsets and I feel kind of funny because it was a  freebie, but man, it is nice.  It's really nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's that screen, I think, that puts it over the top.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The screen.  Yeah, the screen is the thing, right?  It's just bigger.  I love the Kix fan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's better than the Nexus One?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's definitely better than the Nexus One.  Wow.  It's got this kickstand, which is like this is my favorite part about the phone.  It's got this little flip out thing on the back that you can kind of prop it up on your  desk and you've got, you know, an alarm clock, a desk clock.  You can watch YouTube videos while you kind of two hand your lunch.  Like it's it just makes the phone stand up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's almost you know, it's funny.  A little bit more real estate makes it almost a pad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does.  It does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's not even higher resolution, is it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no, same screen.  But it's just a step below having, you know, a tablet up to your face.  You know what I mean?  Just to that point of like if it was any bigger, it would feel awkward to your ear.  But but yeah, it's a really great handset.  I'm digging it.  Front facing camera.  It's FM radio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you call anybody with that front facing camera?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I haven't I haven't tried that yet.  I haven't tried video conferencing.  How would it work?  They got kick installed quick.  Quick QIK.  Yeah, QIK.  So you can live stream video.  But I haven't actually tried a video conference call.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Fring as I remembered because I had the front facing camera on N900.  I think Fring does it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I should try.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, when I get my Evo, I'll get Fring on it and we'll just call each other.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We'll just call each other.  It'll be fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the problem.  It's like having a video phone.  There's only three people in the world you can call.  But but you know, someday.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the big thing about the phone is that it's 4G, but there's no 4G support.  And so, you know, I turned on 4G for five minutes.  My battery was practically gone.  You know, I was in San Francisco.  So we'll see.  We'll see how that how that goes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But to your point, but to your point, Jeff, I actually am now thinking that what makes  the iPad successful is the hardware.  And I do think an Android tablet might be a very compelling product.  And so and this is what Gina and I were talking about.  I was learning iPhone, you know, I paid 99 bucks and joined the developer program was  going through the tutorials.  And I decided, no, wait a minute, I want to I would prefer to develop for an open platform.  And I think if you take an and you make an Android tablet from the things that announced  at Google I.O. between 2.2 and Google TV, because when you develop for Android, you  develop for all of those platforms.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what really strikes me is is I've said it before, but what the hell?  I'll say it again.  Mobile, where you see the death of mobile.  Let's declare it dead already, because it's it's it's death.  The same because the same stuff will be on all these platforms.  Sitting on the couch, you're not mobile.  You're not using Google TV or mobile, but you'll be using apps the same way across all these things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  John Doar at Disrupt, didn't he say that mobile was the third wave of computing?  You had first you had computers, then the Internet.  Now you have mobile.  And now it's dead already.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's trying to name it something new.  He said it was a combination of mobile and social and new e-commerce all mixed in together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's several things, not just one.  I think it is, too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you're three to one to two to three.  Right. But he's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that is clearly where everything is kind of what is happening right now.  So let's talk briefly about the Facebook announcements, because as we go to press,  to use an extinct term, Facebook has just completed its press conference.  Mark Zuckerberg and Elliott Schrag taking the stage to explain that they may a culpa.  We blew it again.  We were just trying to do the right thing.  And we're going to do the right thing this time by simplifying the privacy settings.  And now it looks like, although we haven't it's not rolled out yet, but it will be rolled  out in the next, I don't know, week or so that there will be one click privacy settings,  kind of some defaults, friends only friends and friends of friends and public or everyone.  And while Facebook has a recommended, which is, you know, basically they recommend they  would like everything to be public because there's more future for them there.  They do give the opportunity of pressing.  It looks like we'll see one button that says friends only.  Is that satisfying?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Anybody?  This vision of steel walls coming around you as that happens.  It's like get smart.  No one can see you now.  Yeah, I think it's a smart thing to do.  It's a meta layer on top of this.  You know, the more I think about it, the less as everyone else is getting more vitriolic  about Zuckerberg and Facebook, I'm getting less upset about them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You were appeased by their statements today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I was even before that.  I think that I do take Zuckerberg at his word that he believes that a connected world is  better and that we and it's part of what I'm going to write about in my next tome.  But I think he really means that.  And all this talk about it being business oriented.  Well, what isn't?  You know, NPR sells ads to.  Oh, we saw ads.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, you know, I think they screwed up and they've made a business strategy of screwing  up. And when it was just geeks back when they could do it, he said today at the press  conference that the furor over newsfeed was still many times bigger than this furor.  And, you know, then I think 10 percent of the audience ganged up against him.  But in fact, he was right then.  I think that that's what affected him is that, all right, they yell, but I was right.  Right.  You know, I don't I don't I don't see the venality in this.  Tell me where I'm wrong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I have to admit, I felt a little appeased by this, Jay.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, I didn't see the press conference, but I did read the statement and it seems  like if the changes that are described there go through, that will be good.  And I think they they made some smart moves.  But what strikes me, Leo, is I always feel when Zuckerberg is talking and Facebook is  talking to me that I'm being infantilized.  Yes, they they refuse to treat anyone really as adults.  If you if you look at the rhetoric of this statement, if you look at the way that it's  written, there's this funny use of the word you where they're they're telling us he's  telling the users how the users feel and what they wanted in this language of you said to  us that you were we asked each of you to look and you chose what you wanted, where  you're they're preempting how I think they're not addressing me as an adult.  The other thing I don't understand is and maybe maybe you guys can enlighten me about  this is Facebook is a company that depends completely on users and good relationships  with users. And where is the Facebook ombudsman?  Where is Facebook's Robert Scoble back when Scoble blogged from Microsoft?  Where is the panel of users who advise them about things but don't work for the company?  Where are any of the kinds of measures of openness that you would hope to see in a  company so dependent on the goodwill of users?  I just don't get it. I don't get any of Facebook's public facing strategies at all.  And I feel like I'm being talked to as a as a child every time they open their mouths.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it anything like the way Apple treats its users?  There seems it strikes me lately that I've seen a certain commonality between Facebook  and Apple that they decide what they want to do for business reasons.  This is what you were talking about, Jeff.  But then because they don't feel comfortable saying, well, this is good for business, they  somehow try to say, but it's what's good for you, too.  And that strikes me is what Apple's doing these days a little bit, too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right. I think that there's there's a slightly different  different relationship here, though.  The past has been they have a product you buy, you don't buy it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook is absolutely in your junk.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where Facebook is the only choice we have for our social graph.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Apple creates just better products that with an emphasis on simplicity.  I mean, the whole thing with Facebook is that there are 170 options.  And and, you know, Zuckerberg, I think he did a piece in the Washington Post.  He said, like, you know, we thought you wanted granular controls.  But, you know, so we gave you granular controls.  But I guess, you know, we were a little too ahead of our time.  And that's not exactly what he said.  But that was kind of the I felt like that was the the implication.  Like, you know, you're not there yet.  So we'll dumb it down for you and we'll kind of, you know, usher you along.  And that bugged me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's when the airline person says, let me explain our policy.  Yes, sir. Yeah.  They talk and talk and talk and talk and what I want you to do.  Yeah. Right. Yeah. Listen to this, Leo.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Listen to this sentence.  Get just just pitch your ear to this.  Unless you feel in control, then you won't be comfortable sharing  and our service will be less useful for you to hear how they're  they're telling us how we think about them.  Right. Instead of telling us what they're going to do and what they want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But maybe they're only maybe their only crime is a tin ear.  I mean, maybe it's it's just they could be.  Yeah. Or maybe not.  I mean, I'm not sure.  I've been grappling with intent.  It's very hard to determine intent.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is. But, you know, Jay's point that they don't have very many kind of people  within the company who I get to tech conferences all the time.  I meet people from Microsoft, from from Google, especially,  and even a couple of Apple employees.  But I don't I don't know anybody from Facebook.  Like, I don't I don't know anyone who works at Facebook who's like,  maybe maybe you do, Leo, who's like, you know, writes about  who does kind of better public relations, who explains things like,  Matt Cutts, I feel like I can go to Matt and get some kind of answer  about something that Google is doing.  Oh, you know, Scobel from Microsoft.  And I don't feel that way with Facebook.  I feel like it's the I'm going to I'm going to.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  It's like Chloe Sladen from Twitter, who's in charge of relationships with the media.  Who is that person for Facebook?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  David Corden is going to be at food camp.  I'm going to food camp at the end of the month.  And that's one of the I'm hoping I don't want.  He may not. He may like avoid me like the plague, but I'm hoping I could just sit down  in a nice, congenial way, because food camp is congenial.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Who is the place to do that?  Friends of a ride.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. And I'll tell him this is completely off the record.  What do you think? What's going on? You're inside.  What's your sense of it?  So I know I have to say after these moves, one thing they did,  which I think was really, really good,  is they let you completely close off access to third party applications.  That's good. This was a huge problem.  This Yelp, Pandora, you know, Farmville kind of access to your guts.  You can just say no.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not now, not ever. Not now, not ever.  And it's future proof, right?  So you say this is my setting now and any news partners that you partner up with,  you're going to assume that that's my setting.  I said they said it.  They said it. That's the key to me, because, you know, opting out one by one  as they create new partnerships was just total BS as far as I was concerned.  Right.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Can I identify another dynamic here, Leo?  Yes.  And I've seen this in other places in the tech industry, too, is  you have these companies and they do things that are kind of hard to figure out.  And the people who get on to what they're doing first are naturally  the pundits, bloggers, techies, early adopters, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they blamed us.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah. And so then then what happens is that as that din  from the more sophisticated users grows,  they try to split off that group from the larger user base and say,  well, that's actually just the techies.  That's just, you know, they explicitly did that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said, oh, no, it's the media and the techies that don't like it,  because everybody else loves us.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right. And so.  But if they're making it hard to understand,  then the only people who are going to be upset are the people  who put the extra effort into understanding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I never bought that and and was perfectly willing.  I've been accused of grandstanding and being a publicity hound and so forth,  but I was perfectly willing to suffer those slings and arrows  because I thought it was important to raise the issue.  And by the way, my Facebook account is gone as of now  because I deleted it two weeks ago on Twig.  And I don't I'll be honest, I don't I don't really miss it.  It's like, so what?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I'm the same way.  I think Twitter replaced the functionality of it to a great extent for me.  But, you know, one thing about about two interesting things about this is  I think Jay's right about the ombudsman.  I see my my editor at Harper Collins, Ben Lohan,  just just put in Twitter that he likes the idea. I agree. Yes. Yes.  You know, I wonder if if what Scoble did wasn't really new.  That we in newspapers had ombudsman, but they were there to act as a kind of a  of a wall, more than a bridge in some cases.  And Scoble was just a guy talking through the company  and creating a human relationship with the company.  So there is great irony that doesn't exist.  But the irony further is that I think Facebook operates like a very old company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is ironic, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. The other thing is that is that at TechCrunch Disrupt,  Michael Larrington always tries to get numbers out of people  who will talk about the by the way, did a really good job.  It was a really good car.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I loved the Carol Bart's interaction. That was a serious.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah. I love to talk about that.  I watched the video. Oh, my God.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll come to that. But Chris Cox, he asked Chris Cox  had a privacy, I think, right, at Facebook for numbers on how many have quit  and didn't get any.  But part of what Zuckerberg said today in his talk was that when a million people  complained about about  newsfeed going back to the day, that was a huge proportion of Facebook.  But Facebook is now many, many, many times bigger.  And so a huge number can complain.  And it might be the size of New York, but it's a smaller proportion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one of the things they said today at the press conference was we have this  net meter that shows our what's going on.  We haven't seen anything from these Facebook quitters.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This I mean, I think it's a real problem for them because that's a bad thing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to say, by the way. That's that's really not passing.  Oh, it doesn't hurt our business. Go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Quit. See you. We don't hear you.  We don't care. Oh, you don't matter.  Right. You don't matter.  So small. You don't matter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is the problem of success. Right.  You think that a group doesn't matter and you can't listen to them.  You can't. It's like becoming the public sphere.  They're as big as the whole public now.  And they've got to recognize the groups within and respect the groups within.  And it's a real challenge for them. I don't think they recognize still.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, those that net meter doesn't show them what the influencers are doing.  I mean, Leo's an influencer, Baratunde is an influencer.  These are people who are, you know, have great reach and are, you know,  explaining to the folks who aren't who aren't the geeks, you know, what's  what's going on. I don't that that that that bothered me, too.  Yeah. You know, we didn't feel it when when they say when Zuckerberg says,

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  as he did in his statement, we've listened carefully in order to figure out  the best and next steps.  What is this listening process about?  Where does it happen? Where is the we know anything about it?  Yeah. Where's the ear of this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the prior in the prior kerfuffle,  Jay, in the prior kerfuffle, they had remember this, I think they had a poll  and they had a poll and they had people, you know, try to write it.  And I forget who it was at the time.  Maybe it was you, Leo, that suggested a constitutional convention for Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, I wasn't me. But that's a great idea. Yeah.  Yeah. But that's they're not going to do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the ear is, you know, the New York Times made fools of us  by pointing out the length of our privacy policy and the fact that,  you know, there are 170 privacy options.  That's what I feel like it is.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  And I'm supposed to believe that nobody at Facebook knew that they had 170  privacy options and that it was a complicated system and they all they just.  You know what? We just took a look at it.  And wow, you know, it is kind of bad.  You're right. I just don't buy that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, their argument back is you wanted you want to control.  Damn it. We gave you control.  You want to leave the vowels out. You can leave the vowels out.  You know, they didn't think with any sense.  They didn't think like their people. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. All right.  Enough Facebook.  A couple of other things going on.  You were at disrupt, which is the Mike Errington.  I guess it's the replacement for TechCrunch 50. Right.  In New York City. Nice that it could be out your way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that was a beautiful thing. Mayor Bloomberg came and talked.  And it was interesting to hear him because he spoke not as a mayor, really,  but as an entrepreneur.  He was among entrepreneurs.  And of course, there was a mayoral message here, which is entrepreneurs  come to New York, follow the light, children. Yeah. Yeah.  And he announced.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think that's credible, by the way?  Is everything tilting to the left to the West Coast?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. You got a problem with that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really interesting to watch Silicon Valley versus Silicon Valley.  And a lot of talk about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is a different culture, dammit.  And I think which is great.  Fresh and different here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there should be an Austin culture.  There should be a Seattle culture.  There should be a New York culture.  God, if everything were like San Francisco, I would I would cry  for the future of this industry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other interesting thing about about about this, go to Jay's heart, I'm sure.  But about Errington is that he and I, we are walking down the hall  and reminiscing about how we got into a huge fight at an online news association.  You too, huh?  Years ago. Yeah.  And the thing is that that Errington.  Was acting very journalistically through this whole thing.  He's asking good questions, he's asking the questions you want to know.  He's probing and doing things, he's bringing in the interesting people  you want to hear.  And and he really has his journalism, I think, has matured a great deal.  Not that I don't mean by that that he's followed the old ways.  He does things his own way still.  But he's now figured out what his way is, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I would I would agree 100 percent.  And it's very clear that he started to realize that his job is as a proxy  for his audience.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And he feels that that loyalty that he feels that as a mission to do that.  Yeah. And a great journalist always does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that's really great.  And you know, that's a maturation process.  This is what happens when people don't go to J school  and they have to learn this in the in the world of hard knocks.  And Mike has taken a lot of knocks.  And I think he's really learned from it.  This sounds very patronizing.  I don't mean to sound patronizing.  He's he's he's huge.  And I but I would agree with you.  I really enjoyed the conversation.  And I particularly enjoyed that.  Carol Bart's back and forth.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you know what? That's vintage Arrington.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But more power to both of them.  I like her response.  She she basically said, F you, Mike, which is something I've said.  And and but it was  I didn't seem disrespectful.  I don't know. You were there.  Was it disrespectful?  It seemed like it was a very nice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was a joke the rest of the time.  But I think it's funny.  I mean, listen, Yahoo deserves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ridicule, it does.  But she made a good point, which is you're a tiny company.  I'm a we're a big company.  It's hard to move on a dime.  I think that was a reasonable point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a great moment today with the cash.  Aurora from Google was there.  And Arrington played back that line about about how Google has to grow  a Yahoo every year.  And Aurora just said, well, I don't know what their strategy is.  It depends on what you know, what what Yahoo is going to be as to  whether we have to grow one of them or not.  I think that there's a lot of questions about Yahoo.  And there's a lot of questions about AOL.  Tim Armstrong was there, too.  And I think tough question and tough answering is exactly what we need more of.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  I didn't like the interview. OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tell us why there.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  But I watched it on video.  I didn't think it was appropriate for Arrington to start by saying,  how are you? And I don't think he would have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I missed that. I didn't want I only watched the exchange.  I didn't see that part. That was the first line.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, no wonder. No wonder she swore at him.  How the fuck are you?  Which I don't know. I don't know.  That's not appropriate.  But I didn't think he would say that to Eric Schmidt.  You know, no, that's not appropriate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's known for being kind of foul mouth.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  And maybe that was I didn't really mind that so much.  But I think it was a license to her that maybe. Yeah.  I I didn't.  One way I judge an interview is whether I believe the  interviewer is asking questions that come out of what he just heard,  as opposed to what's on his notebook that he thought of to ask before.  And I didn't hear or see Arrington  asking questions based on what he heard her saying.  I heard him list some of the things that he had already in his notebook.  I also wanted him as my representative,  as a tech crunch reader, to ask her about Yahoo's new editorial push.  They're hiring all these journalists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this associated content deal is associated content.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Also, he didn't ask about that either.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would ask about that because that's an odd play.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  I'd love to know what what the strategy is. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's the play.  That's that's the funny thing going on here with AOL versus Yahoo  is the two last old style media companies are digging in to  demand down the old media media, which is, I mean, I'm sure you guys

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  consider that anathema to journalism.  I mean, it's not I mean, this these five dollar bloggers.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  That's not exactly our view.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's OK. Good. This is good. I want to talk about this.  Actually, we've had this conversation a little bit, Jeff.  In fact, we we we started one at the end of a show, which I cut off.  So maybe we can get back into that.  Let's hold that thought, though, for a moment, because  we do want to pay a bill because we pay people more than five dollars.  And so in order to do that, I'm going to do a commercial now for GoToMeeting,  our friends at Citrix, who make it easy for you to meet online  without all that travel that it just kill your bottom line.  GoToMeeting is the way business gets done these days.  We use GoToMeeting a lot.  I think we have several GoToMeeting accounts because it's gotten to the point  where we frequently will have two meetings on at the same time.  So we need multiple accounts.  If you go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig, if you haven't tried this already,  you can try it absolutely free for 30 days.  Here's what will happen. You'll go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  You'll sign up literally a minute later, probably before I'm done talking.  You will have it installed.  And now the next time you're on one of those long, boring conference calls  or your challenge to go across town to meet a client or across the country,  across the world to meet a client, you say, now let's do a GoToMeeting instead.  You can show them your notes, your spreadsheets, your PowerPoint  presentation or your keynote. It's Mac or PC, any kind of meeting.  They now have an iPad app that is so cool.  It uses the built-in microphone and speakers on the iPad and the voice over  Internet that's built into GoToMeeting.  You don't even need a phone call.  You can just meet. I went out in the backyard using Wi-Fi and I'm having a meeting.  GoToMeeting. Try it free for 30 days.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  T-W-I-G. It is the future, I think, of a business.  Eliminate the problem.  Eliminate all that travel, all that, you know, just expensive pain in the butt stuff  and make those conference calls much more engaging.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  So, Jeff, would you tell me what demand media is before we get into this conversation?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Demand me, Jacob, I'll do a better job, but I'll give it a shot.  Demand media does a few things.  One is that it listens to search requests to see what the public wants.  Which I think is a key insight of demand media.  That's not the way it works in the news.  We decide what the questions are and the answers are.  This is a way to listen to that.  They listen at the same time to the ad rates and ad demand.  And an algorithm spits out a headline.  It says that basically if you write something under this headline, you will make money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the example you gave was Harley Davidson belt buckles.  May have been.  I don't know if it was you, but somebody did.  So if you check search keywords and you see a ton of search keywords for Harley Davidson belt buckles,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  you say, aha, and there's ad demand for it.  It makes it.  Now, they tried this with editors and they found that the algorithm is 4.1 times more effective than the editors at picking winners.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Now, what is a winner, though?  Winner means to add sales.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A winner is their arbitrage in Google juice.  Hits.  Right. That's hits.  If you write this the right way, it'll get Google juice.  And we know there's an ad demand and we'll leverage that to the highest value we can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But but but but but but but it is the two of them together.  If there's no ads.  OK, OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So then they turn around.  And the other controversial part about this, the most controversial, is they put it then up in an assignment board and anybody can come in and write that piece for 20 bucks.  They sliced up the function of creating content into 11 pieces.  So somebody makes 20 bucks.  A human looks at the algorithm and says, yeah, it's right.  They maybe write the headline a little bit.  They then write the piece.  Somebody copy edits the piece for two dollars and fifty cents and so on and so on.  And it gets up and it's a machine.  And they say they are using, in their words, the spare cycles of writers out there who could earn a few bucks.  Yeah, it's little money, but it's a resource that's waiting for old print editors to answer queries.  So while you're waiting, make a few bucks and do these things.  Now, I think that it's and they're going for an IPO, no doubt.  The one thing I think about it is that that as search becomes more personalized, as Google gets more signals to location and activity and all that, the ability to.  Play this game of arbitrage on Google juice, I think is going to go down and down the dark art of SEO, I think goes away and with it, some of the demands efforts.  But again, there is a model here in terms of listening to what people want and then coming up with structure with outsiders to do it.  And there are others doing this.  AOL Seed is one associated was not doing the same model associated.  Oh, I thought they were. I thought they were kind of associated.  The writer decides what to write.  It's the old not as successful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they say they have like thirty eight thousand writers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. It's that's the problem with it, I think, is the business model.  But they have so much stuff and you're motivated.  You know, in a sense, it's a manual sense.  You're motivated to write things that are going to make money.  So you do that.  And there are some newspapers now that have hired demand media to fill sections like, I think, travel sections and stuff with stuff.  So journalists don't like it mainly because in their view, it lowers the value of what they do.  But welcome to a competitive open market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have nothing on Harley-Davidson belt buckles.  I just want to point that out.  I think you didn't say that.  Somebody did. I thought that was a really apt because it's such a narrow niche.  And yet there's huge advertising money in it.  So anything anything to add to that, Jay, is that?

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, another way to look at demand media, Jeff's description is good.  Is to say that they start with the revenue that is available online.  And they try to invent the editorial routines that work for that kind of revenue, as opposed to starting with what it costs to have quality editorial workers and trying to figure out how to get the revenue to pay them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But Jay, it's no different from starting a food section or starting circuits in the New York Times when there was ad demand and then killing it when there isn't.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah, sort of.  Same moral difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is exactly what happened at the New York Times.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Also, another way to look at it is because everything that we do online is recorded, because there's all this data about how people use the Internet, they are trying to integrate that knowledge into editorial production.  And that's the part that I feel Jeff, I think, agrees with me, is in fact innovative about what they're doing.  And that's the part that journalists and news organizations should learn from.  But the other thing, this is why I want to talk about it on this show that really interests me.  And I'd love to get Gina's take on this or yours, Leo, is by encouraging demand media to become a big producer on YouTube, for example, and by seemingly allowing them to game search with their kind of low quality content.  It seems to me that Google is kind of shooting itself in the foot, because if this low quality production routine successfully clocks up Google with content farm produce, how is that good in the long run for Google?  I don't see how it's good for Google in any sort of longer term future.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so this conversation is interesting to me, because when I think about demand media, my first reaction is like, yuck.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Me too. I think it's cynical.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. But then I think back to my four years running Lifehacker and...  That's what you did.  ...search results all the time.  Sure.  Absolutely. And we tried to write articles that people wanted and that people would search for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do the same thing. I don't want to show if I don't think anybody's going to listen to it.  Of course not.  But I do the editorial judgment as opposed to the mechanical...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. I mean, this process that we're describing with demand media just does sound particularly kind of awful.  But I mean, so the question here is the quality of the content.  Like Jay was just saying, stuffing the Internet with low quality, mediocre content is going to be bad for Google and bad for the Internet.  But I mean, who judges what's low or high quality content?  The fact is, if there's better...  Google has to get so good that if there's a better article than a demand media article, then it should be ranked higher in search results.  Exactly.  No one else has written an article about Harley-Davidson belt buckles.  If the demand media article is the first one that comes up because there's nothing else, that's good for Google, even though it's kind of crappy content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How does Google do that objectively, not subjectively?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Matt Cutts said on the show that they were looking for two things.  Right. One is a signal of originality, which is also an issue in news.  Right. The 43rd Associated Press rewrite of a story cuts off the links in the link economy to the original Washington Post story.  That's kind of unethical.  You shouldn't lose the provenance of the original journalism, I think.  The old system wasn't set up for that.  So Google's going to look for more signals of original content.  They're doing that in Google News now, Matt said, where they look if there are a lot of attributions.  The Washington Post said they'll give more credit to the Washington Post.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google has the capability to do this for sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then they also are looking for signals of quality, and I don't know what those are.  Do you have any idea, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  I think that authority, they have the PageRank or some sort of authority ranking citations, inbound links, reputation over time.  I'm not sure. I don't know how an algorithm would judge quality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This reminds me of the free market dogma that the free market can do everything and will never break.  And there's this dogma that PageRank can do anything.  That PageRank is an algorithm that no matter what, will come up with the best content.  And this is a really interesting challenge case because...

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  But demand doesn't depend on PageRank. They depend on...  Well, don't they?  Narrowly, not really, because if they cared about that, they would care where they place these things.  But on the whole, they don't care where the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I disagree, Gina. I think they do care.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They need to come in first in the search or they don't make money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They care like about.com. All he did was automate the structure about.com has.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right.  But why aren't they trying to build... This is the key to me about demand media.  Why aren't they trying to build a brand, demand media, out of what they do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because they don't think that will help with Google Juice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They don't need to because their ads don't come from sales to brands.  Their ads come from...  They're automatic.  It's just like about.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all about Google Juice and nothing else, right?  So if reputation doesn't help Google Juice, then they don't need to worry about reputation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the tyranny of good enough.  If they're good enough and they don't want to game the system, they can hire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But this is the test of PageRank.  Because if PageRank really is good, it should recognize reputation,  authority and all of these things.  But these are ineffable qualities that are very difficult to objectify.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Can I tell you something happened when I interviewed Richard Rosenblatt,  the CEO of Demand Media?  Yes.  I asked him, what happens if your algorithm tells you there should be an article on  belt buckles that are Holly Davidson inspired?  And your other algorithm tells you there's a certain amount of search revenue available  for that article.  But in order to produce a quality article on that, it costs you more than the available revenue.  What do you do then?  What happens?  What is the company's philosophy?  Well, you don't do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't do it.  You're in business.  You're not a charity.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Unable to understand my question, I had to keep asking it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He understood it perfectly well, Jay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He understood your question.  That's the cynical part.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's not doing news.  That's part of the reason they say that they're not doing news.  They can't do news.  They won't do news.  That's why they don't do news.  And that's their solution is they're saying, no, they're filling a store shelf with content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We grew up in an era where news was pro bono, where Edward R. Murrow said we do the news  because it's right to do the news.  And it was a loss leader for networks for years, but it was the right thing to do.  That era is clearly dead.  All you have to do is watch a network newscast for a minute and you realize that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was a false market anyway.  It was the price of your spectrum in the day.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Demand media takes it one step further, which is CBS decided a long time ago that the news  isn't a loss leader anymore.  The news must profit.  But demand media pushes it one step further because now the only articles worth doing  are the ones that are profitable, which is one step further.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no public interest involved at all.  There's public interest in the sense that they're interested.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's no different though morally than this old house magazine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's fine.  I just wonder who's going to cover the story the public isn't interested in,  but is in the public interest.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We'll train those poor suckers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm counting on you two.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other bigger story to me is that you again, you have AOL,  it's where it got us here.  You have AOL and Yahoo, each saying they want to be the premier creator of content,  the biggest creator of content on the internet.  Tim Armstrong says quality content.  I think that in a new Google world where Google figures out quality, that will matter.  But the content business isn't such a great business.  The real message of demand to me is that we're in a world of unlimited content creation,  and that's where I think the value shifts to the curator, to the filters.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, what strikes me about the demand model is that it isn't  pointed at creating trust.  That's what I don't know is whether editorial brands that are  focused on creating trust in the product will be able to realize a market differential  over an operation like demand where trust is not a factor at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that because that's exactly what we try to do here.  We still make the calculus though, can we make money on a show before we launch it,  because it costs money to make a show.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right. But you aren't asking are we making money on this 15 minutes?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. It's a question that actually we've been talking about today, our salespeople are in town.  And it's a big question, but I think that ultimately,  I would hope that in the long run, trust and quality would in the long run beat these things.  Why does Yahoo buy associated content?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know. I would love to know the answer to that.  That's what I can't figure out. They see it as a volume game.  Just more. More is better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they're already, by the way, we talked about this a few months ago,  they're already huge in terms of content volume.  They're one of the biggest content companies in the world.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The way I put it in a really dorky blog post with diagram I did a few weeks ago  is that I think that in media we assumed that brands were the magnet.  We came to buy the paper, we come to watch the show, and that's still going to be true  to some extent, but through both search and through the human links of Facebook and  Twitter and such, and algorithms, all of those means of discovery,  the brand instead becomes a label.  And once you're there, once you see all these search results on Google, then the question is,  is the brand enough to push you over to click on the second or third link instead of the first one?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's a person. I think it's about people.  People come to Twitter to watch Leo.  And you.  And Jeff.  But I think it comes down to people.  I trust Google enough that I think that if Jeff does a blog post about Harley-Davidson  belt buckles, that it will beat any demand media article in search results hands down.  And they could do that.  Because you're a trusted blogger who have been doing it for years and years.  You have authority as a person.  I think that it's easy for Google to grok people who have been doing quality work that has  consistently had authority over the course of years versus some non-brand with non-famed  freelancers.  Algorithmically.  That's what Clay Shirky wants.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has to be algorithmic.  He says the next big challenge is algorithmic authority.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It has to be.  Reputation and authority are very difficult, but if this is to work, it has to be solved.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It won't be one size fits all though.  That's the key to this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  We interviewed the guy who founded Mr. Tweet, which is the presumption of it is that we  are going to show you who's got authority.  He said, well, to my kids, I have a lot of authority, but I mean, not to you.  It is totally subjective.  How does Google do that?  I don't know.  What about Jim Fallow's article in the Atlantic about Google saving journalism?  Is this part of that?  Is this what Google needs to do to make that effort succeed?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was no news whatsoever in that piece.  Everything in there was old.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's because you wrote the book, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the attitude was new.  That's what was important.  The presumptive relationship of Google to news has been one of hostility and blaming  Google for news' problems.  And Fallow's, I was delighted to see, came and said, whoa, no, they care.  And let me tell you what they're doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, not just Fallow's.  Eric Schmidt said, we're all in this together.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's been saying that nobody believed him.  He would tend to sneer when they were quoted.  And Fallow's took him at his word and his level and admitted that they were personal  friends in doing so.  And I think that's what was important.  Jay, what did you think of it?

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Pretty much the same.  It was a tone poem.  It wasn't a information-filled article.  But I think the way I read it was Fallow's was talking to the professional fraternity  of journalists and telling them, look, you think you understand Google as a threat to  news, but you don't really understand how they think about news.  And it wasn't so much informing Atlantic readers about Google.  It was signaling to his peers in the profession that they need an attitude adjustment, that  their presumption about the company was off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, did you learn anything?  Did you see the piece?  Did you learn anything new about what Google's doing with news?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm embarrassed to say that I saw the piece two minutes before we started it and my  immediate thought was too long to read it later.  Very long.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's been an hour and a half.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jim Fallow's never wrote an article.  It didn't take a day to read.  That's just the way it is.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  I also have to say that I think Fallow's is pretty much my number one guy in journalism.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've loved him for decades.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  I would name him the number one journalist in America.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  That's pretty high credit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's been open about other things.  He did a test.  We talked about this on the air once of Google versus Bing.  As an old style journalist, he was coming at this new stuff and by the way, he gave up  because he kept on going back to Google.  As have we all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's talk about some of the announcements at Google I.O. because unfortunately, our  twig show was after day one, which turned out to be not the day.  Not the day.  The keynote, the big keynote was the next day.  That's where Android 2.2, where Google TV and I think some under reported Google announcements.  There were so many at Google I.O.  There were.  There was some stuff that I would like to highlight that maybe wasn't highlighted in  the mainstream.  We'll do that.  Yeah.  We'll do that in just a second.  But before we do, just one more commercial before we get into that and it's for Carbonite.  My friends at Carbonite.  David Friend, aptly named, is a friend.  He's the guy who created Carbonite and we have a little bit in common.  Among other things, he started Carbonite when his daughter went off to college.  Well, you got Jake going to college in the fall and I've got Abby going to college in  the fall.  Of course, Abby's saying, okay, you're going to get my laptop right.  I said, yeah, but I'm going to tell you and I may not tell her this.  I'm putting Carbonite on it before she leaves.  Carbonite is backup done right.  I'm not going to, there's no way at this point I'm going to be able to train Abby to  back up her system.  It's just not going to happen.  She hasn't backed it up all year.  She's not going to back it up when she gets to school.  However, if I put Carbonite on her laptop, and this is PC or Mac, whenever she's within  access of the internet, which is probably most of the time at school, and the computer's  not busy doing something else, it will back up her files automatically, her personal files,  unlimited amount from that hard drive.  Whenever she calls saying, dad, I threw out my thesis or the dog ate my homework, I could  say, oh, good news, log into Carbonite and it's all there.  Best of all, $55 a year, less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup for any PC or  Mac.  Great for a laptop because they do get lost.  They do get stolen.  Great for a student or maybe you, if you're one of those people who just forgets to back  up.  Frankly, if backup's not automatic and if it's not off site, I don't consider it a backup.  Carbonite is backup done right.  Free for you.  You can try it.  You don't even need a credit card.  If you go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT right now, 15 days free.  Just to give you, and I do recommend this, but don't run out and buy it just because  I said so.  Try it first for 15 days because it does rely on your upstream bandwidth.  If you don't have a good connection to the internet, this is not going to be a good  choice for you.  It also takes a little while to back up.  If you've got hundreds of gigabytes and you could on your internal drive these days, it  may take a while to back up.  You want to understand that.  So try the trial.  Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.  If after the trial you say, you know what, I do need this, then what I suggest you do  is you use the coupon code TWIT to sign up because you'll get two free months and that  really reduces the cost.  13% of hard drives crash in the first year.  43% of people lose files they consider irreplaceable every year.  This is from a CMU, Carnegie Mellon University study.  Over 600,000 laptops lost or stolen at US airports every year.  600,000, that's 10,000 a week.  If they've all been backed up by carbonite, there'd be a lot less anguish in the world.  Carbonite, back up done right.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.  So we were talking before the show and I said after Google I.O., Gina, I was learning how  to write software for the iPad because I'm a hobbyist.  I'm never going to write anything serious.  I got so excited by the notion of open, by where to Android is going, the notion of an  Android tablet, the notion of Google TV running Android apps.  They showed an Android app just running out of the box on Google TV.  I said, who wouldn't want to write for this platform?  You were there.  It was a developer's conference.  Were developers stoked?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I, they were.  They were.  I was going to say, you know, in retrospect and they kind of proved the point when they  launched the Pacman thing.  It's like Google is incredibly good at winning the hearts and minds of developers.  I mean, it was just like a wonderland.  Every five minutes it was like, oh, there's this other API that lets you do all this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They know their audience.  They know their audience.  They know their audience.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And despite the kind of awkward nerdy and sometimes there are problems during the demos,  you know, some of the speakers weren't the best, although Vic Condotra was awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Vic is the new Steve Jobs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, Vic is the guy.  But there are some other demos that weren't so good.  Still, it was really, it was awesome.  And the general feeling was total excitement and kind of this feeling of buzz.  And definitely this, you know, you'd overhear conversations like, oh, I'm going to take  another look at buzz or I'm going to take another look at Android or this phone is really cool.  Wow.  Okay.  So yeah, it was a really good conference.  And so yeah, I'm excited that you're developing for Android.  That is very exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not, you're never going to see an application for me, but it's just, it's fun.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm really excited about Android now with Tutu.  You won me over.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I was fighting against this idea that Android versus Apple and this open versus  closed. I was fighting it. I was really fighting it. And I, and I've been won over.  And I think it's chiefly by you, Gina, because, but I've always been a believer.  I've always been a believer in open, you know, but I always thought, well, there,  there are times when proprietary and closed makes sense.  And Apple, because it's a closed space could do such elegant things.  2.2 for one thing is, is pretty amazing when I can take my Nexus one and turn on  wifi access and turn it into a my five for no additional cost and have, have all these devices  using wifi off of this. That's great. You can't do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And saves me 80 or $60 a month. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what open does. That's to me, that's kind of in a nutshell.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, are we really going to be able to do that? No extra cost or is that going to be a game?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I did it. I've been doing it. T-Mobile hasn't said a thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now T-Mobile, no extra cost. That's T-Mobile.  You know, other carriers, you know, like Sprint, I'm sure is going to,  they charge 30. They charge an extra 30.  Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it's going to depend on the carrier, but right now T-Mobile is just like,  yeah, I mean, it's, it's unlimited. You can do, do what you want. I mean, it's obviously,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it's very slow. My question is how would they know?  They would have to get the handset. It just looks like more data access to them. They don't know

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  that I'm tethering. Right. Right. So, so then, right, exactly.  So these unlimited data plans, are they going to throttle you at some point?  I don't know. It'd be interesting to see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Five gig. Most have five gig. And I think T-Mobile does. Now I have to say,  this is going to hasten something that's bad, which is the, the, we're going to start seeing  pay, pay as you go, not, not flat rate plans. It's funny because the same thing happened in  the desktop space where internet service providers have for a long time said, oh,  we want to charge for the amount of bandwidth they use. And there's, they're starting to tiering,  Comcast has different speed tiers. They are putting caps on. They, they really don't like  all you can eat. And I have to say, this is just going to hasten the death of all you can eat on

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  the unspent mobile plans. Yeah. With 4G, like coming in with really good speeds, people are going to do  it more often. So yeah, yeah, it'll be much more usable. There was little talk about this as disrupt.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It really goes to what I keep arguing that, that mobile becomes irrelevant. And one panel was  pushed on the idea of where does, where does this, where does this stuff go? And finally,  I think Dennis Crowley from Foursquare said, well, yeah, you'll end up with something that's  attached to your head all the time. Well, it's called a cell phone.  Wherever you are. And, and when you have that, you start to ask, he talked about the stuff they did  at NYU's ITP. You know, you ask new questions. Who's in this room now? Who do I need to get  in touch with? Who knows friends of mine? Who has answers to my questions? What's around me?  Uh, ubiquitous connectivity becomes wholly different. And so I think at some point then  to try to throttle, to put the clock back on that. It's hard. It's going to be really,  really hard. It was the guy, I don't know if I've mentioned him before on the show named Tom Ebslin.  You ever heard of him? He's the unsung hero of the internet. Tom was the head of AT&T World Net.  And he was the guy who created 1995 flat rate pricing. First AOL did and took the ticking  clock off the internet. And then when we started to browse, before it was tick, tick, tick, tick,  I used to want that damn thing. Tick, tick, tick, tick. Right. So as soon as the clock went off,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  look at what exploded. Very interesting. So you think it would be retrograde to do that and it

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  can't. Horrible. Horrible. I hope so. But it'll be no different from Rupert Murdoch putting his  paywall up any day and he'll learn the hard way. We'll suffer because we don't have, you know,  you can not buy The Times of London, you can buy five other papers in London.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I kind of had this epiphany because what I realized is that the reason that the PC space exploded,  the desktop computer space exploded, is because it was essentially open. Anybody could develop for it  on any platform they wanted, anything they wanted. You didn't have to go through anybody to buy it.  And we're going exactly the wrong direction with these closed platforms. It's not good for  innovation. And if you want the same kind of explosion that you had in the desktop space,  on the mobile space, you've got to be open. I keep complaining about the idea that apps

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  are going to close down data from things like search. I thought it was very interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  John Doerr, when he talked to Charlie Rose at Disrupt, was really saying it's an app world.  Now he's got certain investments that involve apps. So it's in his best interest. And I was  saying, no, it really bugged me. It really honestly scares me. It's too closed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. You guys have won me over. I have to say.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At Google, it's an HTML5 world. It's an HTML5 world. And the people with the fastest browsers  that can render web content well in a browser are going to win. That's our best hope. Scribd showed

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  amazing work with HTML5 at Disrupt. Isn't that the coolest thing?  Because it can take a magazine that still looks like a magazine with every fancy font in it,  but now the font is seen as a font and it's searchable. So it kills the PDF. God bless him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When I saw this, I thought, Jeff's going to love this because it means that anybody can publish in  an open way on any platform. It's a web browser. Jared Friedman from Scribd said they're amazed at

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  how wonderful this is on HTML5. It only makes them think how the last version was crappy.  They didn't know it was crappy at the time. It's quite amazing. So that frees up content  to be searchable and linkable again. That's what we've got to go with. That's what we've got to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  fight for. It's back to the open world. Definitely.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Can I say something about that, Leo? Go ahead.  I've noticed this dynamic in this tension between open and closed systems where  some of the children of openness, people in the tech world who've benefited hugely from  the web and from the open web, after a while they begin to think that their own religion, as it were,  isn't as savvy and realistic as they want to be. And so they start to turn against it, not so much  because they are against it, but because after a while they fear that they're beginning to sound  like apostles. Like hippies.  Like hippies, exactly. Gosh darn hippies.  And it's the fear. Yeah, and there's this fear of I don't want to be with the hippies. I want to be  hippies. I want to be with the cool people, the savvy people. And what happens is that  then they begin to say, they begin to find appeal in arguments that they used to reject.  Like it's too complicated for the users, and people want protection, and maybe in the end  that's just the way the internet's going to be. And I just find it really fascinating that after  a certain point, the very people who have benefited from openness in order to be savvy  start to turn against it. And then they start ridiculing their former colleagues as  kind of these clueless hippies who have a religion that-  Who do they want to be savvy for? For investors, for stockholders, for fellow executives?  For grownups. I think it's more self-image than anything else.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know who's the poster boy for this is Steve Jobs, who is absolutely the ultimate hippie and  still thinks of himself that way, but is in fact an incredibly savvy capitalist. I mean, there's  no question about it, right? And he has totally built an empire. OS X is built on open source,  totally built an empire on open. It's true.  And is now saying, okay, thanks. We'll pull the ladder up here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So will Larry and Sergey grow up? God, I hope not.  Grown up. Is that the problem?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the big question. You know, when I, to this morning, by the way, one of the announcements,  which is so exciting is that there's finally an API for Google Buzz. And you're now already seeing  third-party, Seismic, Seismic Web immediately adopted it. You're going to start seeing third-party  apps. Gina, can you comment on the API? It looks very nice to me, but I'm not an expert.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I just started actually looking through it this week and it looks really good. I haven't  written anything against it yet, but I'm going to write a think tank plugin for it very soon.  So I'll be able to tell you more. I mean, it sounds, it seems like it's in its beginning stages,  but it looks really good. And I'm using it, I think TweetDeck. Does TweetDeck have it yet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, TweetDeck Web has it and Seismic Web has it, but not the apps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Those guys are super fast. It looks really good. I'm just glad. I'm glad that it's out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People understand the import of this. One of the things that really put Twitter over the top is  its third-party applications. In fact, few people use the web to tweet. They use third-party  applications. And the lack of third-party applications was severely hindering Buzz,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  in my opinion. Definitely. Twitter was like a case study in how to launch a very simple API that,  for better or for worse, I think it was for better, you could authenticate just passing in a clear  text, username and password just to try it. Having that API front and center and it was so easy to  implement that developers just jumped on it. And I think other web apps should be launching with  an API that simple and that easy from the get-go, just like Twitter did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you think that the thing we talked about before of Twitter now competing with those developers,  does that affect Buzz in developers' views? Does this make Buzz perhaps an alternative platform?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I definitely overheard a lot of renewed interest in Buzz at I.O. But I don't know that Twitter  necessarily triggered that. I think that the feeling is just like we can all work together.  You have these aggregators like TweetDeck and Seesmic who are saying,  here, some of my friends are here, some of my friends are here. It's kind of a bad reality  for users because it's fragmented communities of friends across other communities. But it lets  developers create products that are open to all, whatever network that you like. And that's a good  thing. So I don't think the people are jumping ship from Twitter. I love Twitter and I'm kind of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You still tweet first, Buzz last. See, I buzzed first, tweet last.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm definitely taking a look at Buzz, especially now that I'm going to do some development for  Think Tank too. So the API certainly will be a good thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That'll make a big difference. So this morning I'm on Buzz and I thought, well,  maybe I'll use Orkut instead of Facebook. And people asked quite reasonably, well,  what makes you trust Google more than you trust Facebook? Isn't it all the same?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We keep coming back to that question on the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a fundamental question and I don't know if I have a good answer for it. Maybe Jay can help us.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, when you decide to trust or not trust, I don't think you look at this policy and that policy,  you make an overall judgment about the company in which every interaction that company has  with you is factored into your judgment. And the reason I trust Google is not that  I'm unaware that they're just capitalists like everyone else. I know that.  I know that they put their own interests first. I don't buy, you know, don't be evil.  It's I'm not a victim of their public relations. I don't think. I think instead it's that  in the full range of their interactions with me as a company, they justify a certain amount of  trust more so than other companies that I deal with. And that's what I don't understand about  Facebook. Facebook is never actually does anything as a public facing company that causes me to trust  it more. It just doesn't. It doesn't have any ear for that whatsoever.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jay, let me ask you this. When Gina described how developers were walking around all excited  saying, oh, I'm going to build things on this and this and this, my dream is that a news company  should be operating the same way as a platform. And that relationship and that mood is what we  should have. And we just our culture doesn't have it. Facebook at the same time has the same  developer community building tons of apps. But it just seems such a different, even with just  developers alone, it's such a different ethos now. Well, Jake, your son was a Facebook developer.  What's his attitude these days? He thinks that people have been overly harsh on Facebook and  that he kind of gets what they're doing. And, you know, the problem was simple to him. They were  too granular. Okay, now they have something simpler. All right, let's move on. Will he  continue to develop for Facebook? I think that we got to wait till the last finals are done. But I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  think he's also interested in Android. I'd be very scared to develop for a platform like Facebook.  I mean, I think that's part of the issue now. You don't know, you know, you're really out of

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  control. Jake gets it. I mean, Jake is younger than all of us and he's, Facebook was part of his life,  you know what I mean? In a way that probably I assume wasn't part of any of our lives. You  know what I mean? Like he trusts it because it's like the telephone that he uses to call his friends,  you know, all of his friends. So it's kind of different. So I can see him having, you know,  being a lot more forgiving than we are. I mean, I never really quite was embedded in Facebook,  the way I have been in Twitter. Or even as a developer, you know, but look at just look at

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that subset that that public for each company, you have the developers now, I think, trusting  Facebook less than Google and trusting Facebook less than Twitter, even though Twitter has recently

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  gone in competition with. Is that fair? You know, I wasn't at F8. I would love and I really don't  know very many Facebook developers. It's hard to say. I mean, I think that the notion is that  Facebook has all the users, they have the social graphs, you can build things that, you know,  connect people to their friends easily. I mean, I think it was really exciting for Pandora and Yelp  and all those, you know, partner sites to build those things. I mean, I think some developers got  really excited about writing apps that showed you how not private your profile was, or like all the  people who are going to a strip club and had no idea that you could search their status updates.  I think that was there was some excitement there. That's just kind of like the zing got you,  gotcha, you know, of the kind of particular part of a developer community. But I mean,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  yeah, I would say the developers trust. There's also a good group. There's a large group of  developers who will go where the money is. So, you know, they may not love Apple, but they  love the revenue potential. They may not love Facebook. I mean, this is what people say, oh,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  you want to develop for Android? Go ahead. We'll take all your money. Like, this is like,  we'll take all your revenue, which drives me wild, by the way, because you can sell apps in  the Android market. And now that Leo has shamed me into the fact that all my apps are free, I buy  Android apps now. I buy all my Android apps. Yeah. And there are lots of apps that I actually wish I  could buy that are just free. Yeah. I mean, it's true that the open source culture does emphasize  free. That is true. But yeah, so there definitely is this perception that the app store, that iTunes  store is where you go if you want to make money. But I think that is total BS. I think people make  money out of open source software all the time. I have my full-time job as developing an open source  project. There's ways to make money, you know, that... Well, Android is a mix because, I mean,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it's a commercial, I mean, it's open in the sense you can develop for it, but it's certainly on  commercial platforms. People buy the phone, they buy the service. There's money being exchanged.  I don't think that it's somehow some magic, you know, money. I go back to what I was asking,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jay, I think this is exactly what should be going on in the news industry is that when we push  newspapers to think of the blog network around them, they should be looking at them as Google  does developers and Facebook does developers. How do we make them succeed? If they succeed,  we're better off. Life is cheaper for us. They'll spread our message. They'll spread our software.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, the Guardian is way, way ahead on this, Jeff. I mean, did you check into what the Guardian  is doing with their API now? What are they doing? Well, yeah. Well, they just announced  an open Guardian program in which not only do they let you have access to almost all their data,  but they'll build businesses with you. And that's how they hope to make money is they  will either give you a syndication deal if you use their content or they'll do a revenue sharing  thing with you. But they expect people to build businesses on what they publish. And they're trying  to make it as easy as possible to do that. And they are all in on open. That's basically what

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it comes down to. I love it because now you have something to compare against Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. And Emily Bell, who's soon to depart and compete with Jay and me when she goes  to Columbia University, who's the head of digital there, has said it well that the Guardian sees  they need to be part of the fabric of the web. It's this idea of trying to get people to come to  a brand as a magnet doesn't work for them anymore. And they've got to go where the people are.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Meanwhile, it's becoming clear to me that the New York Times is going to try and do something  hybrid. It's not really correct to call what they're doing a paywall. I think that they believe  that a lot of people will pay for the Times voluntarily. And they're clearly going to design  their metered system so that if you really don't want to pay, you won't have to. And it's not what  a lot of people thought originally. They're not really going down the same route as Murdoch,  but they are also not going down the all in on open route of the Guardian.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is such a great discussion. I hate to cut it off, but we're running out of time.  I think we got to do our tool and tip and number of the week. But can we do this again next week?  Yeah, this has been great.  I just find this so fascinating. There's so much more to say about Google I.O. We didn't really  talk about Google TV. And one of the little things I loved was the support for fonts.  I just think that's fantastic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's one of those little API things. You're like, oh,  better web pages for everybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just so many little things like that that came out of Google I.O. I don't know if Google's evil or  not. I guess it's a silly thing to even ask the question. But I like where they're going. I

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the fact that they ask is the key, Leo. The fact that they give license to their employees  to question the company and try to define evil every day there. At TechCrunch, I got into an  Arrington moment where I was in line and the question I wanted to ask Chris Cox from Facebook,  somebody asked, got up and said, is Facebook evil? And I sat down. And I said, no, what I want to ask  is what's your definition of evil? What's your definition of evil? That's the key is what's the  thing that you have to do to maintain the trust of your public? Say that and then that gives  principle to everything else. And Zuckerberg started to say it in his Washington Post piece.  I don't think he rose high enough, which I think was Jay's complaint too.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  That was a piece of crap, that piece.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's another way to look at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mark is not the guy to explain what he's up to, clearly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Neither is Elliott Schregg.  Nor is Elliott.  Definitely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You hit the nail on the head, Jay, when you said they need an ombudsman. They need a public face.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody who's funny and charming.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Serious.  I'll do it for 50 million a year.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, you wouldn't.  I'd have to think about it. That's a lot of money.  But you wouldn't do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you're right. I don't know if I could face myself in the mirror in the morning.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We need mirrors when you got 50 million.  Well, that's my point.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  That's like the old advice. If you can sell out, you should sell out because you will sell out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's good.  And if you can't, you won't.  Do you tell your students that? I like that.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah. If you can sell out, sell out because you will anyway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eventually, they're going to get you.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, a lot of people can't sell out. That's the point. And they don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think I could sell out. I don't know. I'll have to check. That's my wife.  Jay Rosen is a professor of journalism at NYU and just a great guy to have on this show.  Please come back.  Thank you for having me.  Follow him on Twitter. It's at JayRosen.nyu. And his website is www.pressthink.org  if you want to read more of his stuff.  And Jay, if you want to stick around too, but it's time right now for Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a really simple one. Next time you're in a coffee shop or on an open Wi-Fi network  and you have to search for something kind of embarrassing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I love it. I'm so glad you did this. I forgot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is huge.  Have more cures.  This is huge.  Whatever. Add an S after the HTTP when you hit google.com. They just launched  Google searches over an encrypted connection. So https://google.com. And all your search terms  will be encrypted over the wire. So if you're on an open network, people can see what you're  searching for.  Will it still be the history, Gina?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. It's completely blank, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No. I think it's still in your history.  It's in your web history.  Yeah. In your computer's history.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not that it matters. My life is an open blog. I don't care.  Of course it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Unless you're in incognito mode or security.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just advice to our secretive users.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, if you use Chrome, which by the way is all I use now, they've now released the Mac  and the Linux version.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Those are out of beta. Yeah. You can go in incognito mode, which won't save things  to your history. So if you use the encrypted version, no one on the network can see what  you're searching for and it won't be in your history. And actually Matt Cutts did a nice  write up about how difficult, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's kind of a difficult  feature to roll out for a company like Google. It's got so many servers. And so that's linked  on the on the front feed. And also if you want your Google searches to default to HTTPS all  the time, there's a Firefox add-on that will do that. And I believe a way in Chrome as well  to do that. So anytime you hit google.com on the search, it'll just redirect to the HTTPS  version. And those are linked in the front feed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To me, this is a perfect example of Google, not evil is, I mean, this harms their ability  to track what you're doing. It's private surfing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Really? They still have a record of what you're doing there, don't they?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They would still have a record, right? But like no one in between. So like, you're ISP,  you're the router, you know what I mean? So it prevents people from sniffing your searches  while you're on a network. So, but Google definitely, Google still has the, yeah,  because it hits their servers and they decrypted it, right? They decrypt their request on their

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  end. Well, I'm going to give you, my tool will be something that proves Google's not evil,  but first, but I, and by the way, HTTPS searches from now on. That's awesome.  Just for the principle of it. Yeah. It's like encrypt all your email just to, cause you can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep. Heck with you cable company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what I've always said. You know, when people talk about privacy, you say, well,  you know, who knows everything, your internet service provider. Yeah.  They see everything you do. Are you worried about them? They've got a box in there. The FBI put

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  in there. Yeah. That's why you use SSH tunnels and VPNs kids. There you go. There you go. There

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you go. And now only the Google will know. Hmm. Our number of the, hmm, our number of the week,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis. Numbers as the obvious one that I had to do, of course, is that the Pac-Man wasted,  according to recipe time, 3.8 million hours of time, which added up to a $120 million of productivity,  which also shoots down Google's announcement this week that they did a study and found that  they believe they've added 54 million, sorry, $54 billion of economic activity for American  businesses. And one of them, just note on that, I just from a higher level here,  I think it's interesting that they've added up what they feel businesses have made because of  Google. There's some argument in some quarters while they would have made it anyway. I think  that's beside the point. But to me, there's another economic impact of Google and the internet that's  huge, which is how much money we save. The internet dividend. That's what's throwing the  economy into craziness now, I think, because innovation doesn't necessarily yield growth.  It yields efficiency now, economically. Yes. And that's a huge impact on the economy,  but we don't know how to measure it because we always measure growth, growth, growth.  So anyway, Google came out with $54 billion, then took some of it back with wasted efficiency,  but I think also causes it's untold, uncounted efficiency in the economy. And so I think it has  an even bigger impact. And by the way, Pac-Man is now permanent at google.com slash Pac-Man.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  With full on gender equality, by the way, is Pac-Man on the two player? Yay.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  If I joined the show, I would add clown of the week. What's the clown of the week?  The tip of the week, the number of the week and the clown of the week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you'll just, you will be the clown of the week.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  No, I will. I will. If I were a regular on the show each week, I would come to you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you have a nominee? Yeah. Kara Swisher.  Oh, wow. Okay. Kara is going to be on Twitter this week. Tell me why she's the clown of the week.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, I got highly annoyed with her last night because she  published a post about Rob Glaser getting a new job as a venture capitalist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He quit Real Networks shortly. He did for Real Networks or quit.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Quit or whatever. And I just felt that as a journalist, if you write about Rob Glaser  and you do not mention that his product, Real Player, was one of the most hated products on the  web and that it was almost the definition of bloatware, that if you just pass over that,  you're revealing yourself as an industry-centric journalist and you don't have users  in the center of your consciousness when you're writing that because from a user's point of view,  that's who Glaser is. Well, maybe she assumes we all know that.  Well, maybe, but there are a lot of things in that piece that we all would know. Anyway,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was very annoyed by that. I should from now on, when I say Rob Glaser,  comma, the jerk who brought you Real Player, comma.  The jerk who brought you Real Player. Why not? That's what I would do. Absolutely.  Well, I should disclaim this a little bit. Rob is a college classmate of mine and I know Rob  somewhat. But I agree with you. When he repents, then we can stop saying it.  He did inflict a nasty thing on us all. Thank you.  Yes. I will buy that. Now, I really should make my two tools. One, of course, is that Chrome is now  out now on all three platforms out of beta. I have to say, for a long time, I continued to use  Firefox just because of the rich set of extensions available. There is a very rich set of Google  Chrome extensions out now. I would say that Chrome has parity in that respect. My God,  it is so much faster and better and lighter. I just love Chrome.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I did something really stupid, Leo. I saw, oh, it's out. I downloaded, installed it and realized  that I had installed the old beta. Of course, Chrome had already updated for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. Some might say that's not a good thing, but I like it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, it's fine. I double installed it, but I'm fine now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the easiest upgrade and install in history.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Before you do anything, folks, look at your version. You probably have it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anytime I installed Linux, the first thing I did was put Chromium on there.  Maybe you can clarify this for me. Is it still called Chromium or are they going to call it  Chrome now going forward in Linux? Do you know, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's Chrome. I think Chromium is the open source project and then Chrome is the Google  product. I believe that they're calling Chrome on Linux.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess I'll go get Chrome. I don't know. I use Chromium. I don't know what their difference is.  It seems functionally identical. Yes, it is.  Pardon me? I have to go.  Okay, Jay. Thank you. Great to have you on. Jay Rosen. Oh boy, when he went.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jay's a determined man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and he's right because I've been dawdling and here it is. This is my tool of the week.  This shows that Google is not evil. The Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.  Ladies and gentlemen, if it bugs you that sites like mine collect analytics, which we do,  you can now opt out by just adding this browser add-on available not only for Chrome but for

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Internet Explorer and Firefox. Whether you tweet like it or not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Right?

And some journalists said,  oh, well, this is in response to complaints about privacy from the EU and so forth. I don't know.  Maybe it's proactive, but it just seems like this is a kind of thing a company does that says,  okay, you don't want us to do this. We won't do it. I like it. I can't see  Facebook ever releasing something like this. I'm going to opt out Facebook.  The Google Analytics opt-out browser, just search for it, tools.google.com.  And it's called GAO Output.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, I forgot the other numbers I should have done real quick. Real fast.  Google released the AdSense share this week. They've been saying since January they were  going to do it and they did and they give 68% of revenue on content ads to the publisher site  and 51% of search to the publisher.  They're telling people now.  They're telling people that. Italy kind of wanted it, but they said since January in Davos,  when I asked about this, among other people asking about this, of course, that they were  thinking about doing it and they have now revealed that. They've not revealed the YouTube split  because they say it's too new or the game split. They've revealed this.

Transcript:  You're never going to pry the amount of money I give back to you guys out of me,  so I'm pretty impressed. I'm impressed. They're less evil than I am. Let's put it that way.  That's really good news. That's really great stuff.  And by the way, Google was applauding when Apple bought the other company because it meant that  Google didn't have a monopoly with AdMob and in fact, they got approval now from the FTC  because of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Another reason to write apps for Android.  They got ads.  They're going to make money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, that ad platform looks surprisingly like iAds, I have to say.  Hey, thanks for being here. Jeff Jarvis is, of course, the author of What Would Google Do?
