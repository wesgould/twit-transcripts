Ant Pruitt  is joining us. Host of Hands on Wellness, Hands on Photography. Good to see you Anthony.  Thank you kindly sir. Good to see you. Yes. Also joining us is Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard  Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the  City University of New York. Blocker at BuzzMachine.com. Got off work a little early today. Thank you.  Appreciate it. Got off the Zoom. This is work too. This is pleasure. This is work. Yeah it's so funny.  It's an obligation but it's a pleasure. I was listening to old WNEW air checks with a chat room  earlier and it was one of the hosts last shows and that was mostly his bi-monologue was how  much work doing radio was. This is a job. Okay fine. That's how you feel goodbye. You just lost it.  Yeah. Stacey is not here today. She has another engagement. I can't remember what it was but she  told us last week she was going to be busy but that's great because it gave us a chance to say  hello to Mike Elgin. Long lost Mike Elgin. Yes. Still lost. Yeah he's up in Washington State.  So Mike's moving to Washington State. He wants to live among the firs and the pines. Yes that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right. That's right. We bought a piece of property 17 acres up here and it's just a magnificent  forest. I mean I actually hesitate to post the pictures because people are in lockdown. Yeah don't.  Make us jealous. But if you've seen Bambi or any number of other audio visual entertainments you  might be familiar with this scenario. But are you nervous about living amongst the trees now that  they're all burning down? Well it rains here so that's the thing. So you may not believe this but  actually drops of water come from the sky occasionally. No. And yeah I've read about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it on the internet but it's true. Wow it rains a lot. Where were you when your world travels

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  COVID hit bad? It was in Mexico City and we were actually contemplating because we didn't really  have a home base at all and we were thinking well maybe we should have a home base. Maybe our home  base should be in Mexico City. And we were essentially living there and it all went crazy  in California. There was sudden lockdowns. People were in masks. There's social distancing. People  were freaking out. And there was like two or three weeks where we were in Mexico City where that  hadn't really happened yet. You'd find the occasional canister of hand sanitizer here and  there. But mostly nobody was social distancing. People were out and about doing their thing.  And we flew back to California and it was like major culture shock. But yeah we were in Mexico  City and we were thinking maybe this would be a good place to wait out the pandemic. And then  I noticed that hospitals in Mexico City already have six hour waits. This is before the pandemic.  So I thought I really don't think I want to be here if I do happen to catch this thing. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that was back in March right? Something like that. February, March something like that. I don't  recall exactly. It's hard to believe it was only 12 years ago that this all began.  And since then every day has been Wednesday.  So it was March 17th for us, March 16th for us. And so that's what now six months.  March 12th for me.  Yeah six months ago.  Wow. Pretty crazy.  So we've been hearing drumbeats and apparently today or in the next day or so hasn't happened  yet. The Justice Department is expected to brief State Attorneys General on the Google  anti-trust lawsuit. We're days away from this. Remember this was the lawsuit that staff attorneys  at the DOJ did not want to file. They said we need more time to work on it. But that the White House  and AG Barr pushed them into doing. Two people familiar with the matter confirmed,  this is from the Washington Post, confirmed the Justice Department's early plans but they cautioned  it could change. As with anything in Washington these days it could change and that a lawsuit may  come later than anticipated. I really don't know what that means. It's expected that it would be  an anti-trust suit from the DOJ and it would focus on search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep that's been the word. You just can't tell now what's political and what's not.  It's really. The DOJ just filed is going to go after section 230. The DOJ went after  Melania's former best friend for the book she was going to write or she wrote. You can't tell  what's what. That's the problem. And now you live in an anarchist city. I'm proud too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just crazy. The fog of war or is it the fog of Trump makes it so hard. There's no footing.  We spend a lot of time talking about the TikTok story and it's almost like I don't even want to  tell you what the latest is because by the time it's out of my mouth it will be changed.  It'll be different. And it makes no sense anyway. And it's hard to make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From all of the other issues going on with our government.  Which are much bigger issues. Yes.  I think that's probably the point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today is a really hard day. We're doing this on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. What's hard about Wednesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well just between Breonna Taylor and Justice Ginsburg's memorial at the Supreme Court.  It's a very somber, difficult day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The Kentucky AG announced what? An indictment of one of the officers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For nothing to do with Breonna Taylor only for endangering the three neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The neighbors. The neighbors. But not for her death.  Yes. But it was so dangerous for the neighbors. It's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But fortunately there is still a federal investigation in process. So there is hope  that there will be justice for Breonna Taylor. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny because according to the information, one of the things Google did, which I think a lot  of us thought, oh this is really good. Which is to make it harder to spy on people  with the Google browser, actually may stimulate increased antitrust scrutiny.  Increased antitrust scrutiny. Google said in January it was going to follow Apple's lead  in increasing privacy protections by blocking most online advertising trackers, publishers of  news and entertainment websites whose business relies on the trackers hit back according to  information. And so they went to the Justice Department and they said, hey, Google's blocking  ad trackers. Can't you do something about this? So this might also be involved. Oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is a case of regulatory capture. That is to say when Google and Facebook welcome regulation,  it's because they can afford it and others can't. So when Google says, oh, cookie's bad. Okay. We'll  go with the law with that. Cookie's bad because we got all the data we need. And we're going to end  up, you know, the regulators will help them hurt every competitor out there. And I'm not saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's their motive, but that's the result. Isn't that fascinating? I think a lot of users think  that what Apple's done now with Safari 14 and what Google's planning to do is great. And many of us,  I do run either anti-tracking browsers or anti-tracking plugins on our browsers to prevent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that kind of tracking. Because you're paranoid and in the middle of a moral panic, but that's okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo. So you would never use anti-tracking technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not worth my trouble. It's no trouble. What are they going to do to make it so easy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still not worth my trouble. You're right. I mean, I have the same argument sometimes where  I say, well, but what's, tell me the harms because a lot of the harms are imaginary harms or, you know,  kind of hypothetical harms. What are you worried about? And a lot of times, you know,  Dvorak would always say, well, they could sell that information about you visiting Dunkin Donuts  to your insurer and they won't give you insurance. But really the logical response to that is, well,  actually, the way it works insurers ask you before they give you insurance, they ask you all that  stuff. And then if you lie to them, they welcome that as a great way to deny you coverage after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Deny or increase your premiums. But at the same time, you take that insurance scenario,  you have someone like me that gets asked about their weight and you're considered overweight.  Right. Because you're so buff. Stop tracking my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you could also, obviously advertising. I agree with you, Jeff. I don't mind targeted  advertising. I prefer it to non-targeted advertising. So that's not what I'm worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about so much. Well, speaking of antitrust, I think the biggest harm, if anything, is the fact  that the major trackers, which by which I mean Facebook, Google and Amazon, it really kind of  makes the powerful more powerful. They use their, you know, the login system and other systems to  really have an advantage over smaller companies. That's very hard. You know, if you want to go up  against Facebook, for example, by doing contextual advertising, good luck. Because if you don't have  Instagram and all this other kind of services, the login system that they have, the use of  WhatsApp and et cetera, you'll never get anywhere close to Facebook in terms of being able to  offer targeted advertising, especially I don't know how they do it or why, but  the targeted advertising on Instagram is amazing. I mean, it's really amazing. You're almost like  you think they're reading your mind or something. And that's an advantage that helps them  financially. It helps their market share, et cetera. And we'll see how damaging that is to free,  you know, free enterprise and competition later on. But again, I don't think anybody's really  looking at it from that point of view. It's more of a sort of a paranoia system. I mean,  I was shocked today, you know, opening up all the articles from the rundown and one of them was CNN  article. If you ever want to be entertained, just launch any sort of CNN.com page. Oh,  do they have transfers? Watch all the stuff. Oh, it's unbelievable. It's  a couple hundred things load when you go to CNN page. It's really amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's where I think we are. Go ahead. Well, actually I'll let you talk because I don't,  because you're doing a good job defending the trackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's, I mean, yeah, I just think it's the mood we're in now. So stat news,  which is a brilliant, the best site out there for medical news right now,  had a good story today about a woman who uses AI at MIT around health. But the headline really  struck me when AI is the opposite of sinister and MIT researcher is held up as a model of how  algorithms can benefit humanity. Right. And the story is very good. And I'm not making fun of  stat there. I'm saying that's that reflects the attitude from all you moral panic people now,  where every bit of technology, whether it's cookies or AI or any of that is presumed now  to be a bad thing. And it's a surprise when it's a good thing. It's an overreaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have selective moral panic, Mr. Jarvis. Because I do believe in AI. AI has some outstanding  advantages in our world. It's just not totally refined as we've discussed many times on this  show. But yeah, I'm a little bit more selective about my panic here because I don't necessarily  want the folks at Comcast seeing exactly what I'm doing and what I'm not doing and then taking  that information and selling it to the highest bidder. And I still have to fuss with them about  my internet disconnect and every day at five o'clock PM Pacific time. There's definitely,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is a boom time for anti tracking technologies. Not just Safari and Chrome Firefox does it.  Duck Duck Go has just released a privacy tracker. And I have to say, when I get these trackers,  I run them against twit.tv because I know what our website is running in the background.  And according to Duck Duck Go, we get a D, which with site privacy protection,  they've upgraded to a B plus. They block six trackers. Most of them are Google Analytics.  I mean, geez. Yeah, all of them are analytics. New Relic isn't exactly an analytic. We use New  Relic for caching. So all of them are analytics. I don't know if, I mean, look, sites need to use  analytics to keep an eye on how many people are using it. They also said unknown privacy  practices, even though we have a link to our privacy policy right here at the bottom of the page  where it's supposed to be, according to everybody. But this is, you know, I think I'm running it.  And in fact, when I go, there's another new site called The Markup. They have something called  their Blacklight, which is a real time website, Privacy Inspector. This is not a plugin you use  as you browse around. You enter the URL. I just out of curiosity entered CNNs and it has 34 ad  trackers. They say that's more than the average of seven we found on popular sites. 50, 50 third  party cookies, which is more than the average of three. The average is three. Yeah. This is the one  I really bothers me. And I use Firefox, Facebook. I don't, I don't have a Facebook account, but no  matter that you don't have an account, Facebook, as we believe creates shadow dossiers of people,  even who aren't Facebook users. And in this case, even as a non-Facebook user, if I go to CNN.com,  it sends a signal to, to, there's a Facebook pixel. Yeah. I'm not talking about the like button,  but a Facebook pixel. And the reason they, it bothers me. I don't want Facebook. I don't have  Facebook and I don't want Facebook to keep track of where I go because I don't, I'm not even a member.  I don't want it Facebook. So I actually block Facebook in my Firefox browser. So Leo, have you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have you been seeing the new Jill Lepore book, If Then? Yeah, I haven't read it. What's it about?  I'm going to order. How Simulmatics Corporation invented the future. And it was, it was in the,  I think it was the sixties that data can predict things. Data will predict things. We're going to  win elections and we're going to win elections. We're going to win elections. We're going to change  the world. Right. And it was the, you know, it's being called the Cambridge Analytica of the time.  And just like Cambridge Analytica is a bunch of hooey. They don't really have all this power that  we think they have. Right. Right. And so I think a lot of this is the presumption that what could  happen or my God, they're smarter than we know. And the truth is there's few conspiracies in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  world because the world's just screwed up. But that is by the way, one of the non-hypothetical  threats this tracking poses is the threat in politics. Some people think that Cambridge  Analytica had a large hand in, in Brexit. Oh, everybody. Do you think that they were that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  effective? Every, every, every research scientist I know who knows their stuff just completely laughs  at Cambridge Analytica said it was a bunch of hooey. It had no real influence. It promised a  power it didn't have. That's not to say it couldn't happen. Well, that's my question is, okay. So they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  were, they were selling snake oil, but that doesn't mean that somebody else couldn't actually go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  along. And always have a culture. But what I'm saying is you go back to symbolmatics. We thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the same thing for all those years. Yeah. Yeah. Well, so this gets to, I think the core of what  as pundits and thought leaders, so I think we ought to be focusing on, which is not the tracking  itself, but the abuse of tracking. So for example, we've heard the stories about how police are  increasingly going and buying data or getting data from phone companies and so on. If there's a crime  in an area, they're like, let's see who is here and what they were doing. That if that's an abuse,  if we decide as a society that we don't like that sort of thing, then we should crack down on that,  not the tracking initially. And the other thing is transparency. So what is Facebook doing with  that data that they're collecting on CNN? What are people doing? And in the case of Cambridge  Analytica, one of the transgressions of their system was trickery. They said, hey, fill out  this personality quiz, find out who you are. And they were actually gathering data from political  organizations. They were compared to the Obama administration who did at that time unprecedented  and precedentally aggressive data collection and so on. But the Obama campaign said, hey,  we're the Obama campaign. We'd like to get you to participate in this thing. They were transparent  about it. Cambridge Analytica were sneaky and pulling a fast one on people. That was the  bigger problem, not the fact that they were just collecting all this data. The problem is transparency  and abuse of the tracking that we ought to focus on. Yeah, it doesn't really let them off the hook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that they weren't any good at it. Yeah, right. They tried and failed, but doesn't mean somebody  else won't. And the fact that simulmatics couldn't do it in the 60s doesn't mean it can't be done in  the 2020s because we have a lot better tools and a hell of a lot more data. But here's the question,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo. Is it's fine as Ant inspired this riff here, right? Because he's saying I'm selectively moral  panicked, which is fine, which is the right way to be. But then then what you need is decent data  about how moral panic you should be. I just reread this really good book by Axel Bruns called Are  Filter Bubbles Real? Yes. And I'm going to give you a spoiler. The answer is no. Right. Tons of  research in this really, really. Yeah. And and so we have this this fear brought on by Cass Sunstein  and Eli Pereser about about echo chambers and filter bubbles. And then the research doesn't  bear it out. And it's a fear about us because the fear here was people are so stupid. All they want  to hear is the same things. And they reject all their friends and their family if they don't  grew them politically. And they and they get. Don't you think I understand? Is that what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  happening? Eli Pereser's thesis, which is you tend, you know, because of Google's algorithms,  you will get more and more of the stuff that you look for. That alone is not true. And that  will put. OK, wait a minute. Let me just explain what we're talking about. I'm setting the ground  work and then I'm going to ask you a question. So that's Eli's Eli's premise is that you get  inside a filter bubble and then you just get reinforced in your existing beliefs. You're saying  Axel Brun came up with research that said, in fact, that's not in fact, I think we all understand  that the Internet due to serendipity plus poor tracking, plus poor recommendation engines,  plus the failure of companies like Google and Simulmatics does in fact give you a broad variety  of inputs from other sources. But don't you think just on the face of it, Jeff, that people tend  to look for and and absorb information that agrees, you know, confirmation bias, they look  for information that agrees with what they already think, even if they're seeing articles that  disagree, they don't even see them. And and even if if the filter bubble is not real, I do feel  like people are always looking for confirmation of what they believe, not for the thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  disproves what they believe. Is that true, Jeff? But the argument here is they don't even see those  things. Yes, I understand. Yes. And they do see those things. Yes, they do. And and the other  argument was that they act on this in certain ways that they that they reject friendships,  they reject family. Well, some of us have really bad family members. So we have but in general,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no, we don't do that. And I don't know, I think people on Facebook will unfriend people with  different beliefs, especially nowadays, we're so polarized with different beliefs from them and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really only see the people who agree with them. The problem is, this is what he says, I think I  have the quote mark because I was putting it in the book. The empirical research drawing on surveys  and small scale observations and on advanced and innovative digital methods and big social data  demonstrates clearly that echo chambers and filter bubbles not only do not exist outside the  very fringes of mainstream society where they do exist, but that the incessant and continuing  focus of media coverage, media scholarship and political debate and ants moral panics  on these ill defined ideas over emphasizes the role of platforms and their algorithms and current  political crises. Here's the point, and obscures a far more critical challenge the return of naked  hyper partisan populism and political demagoguery. This is where the moral panic stuff comes in,  we're saying, oh, it's all Facebook's fault. No, yeah, yeah, that's true. Facebook is reflecting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something going on in our society. Yes, we've got to get to that. I grant you that. So it isn't the  problem that Google's only showing you stuff you agree with, or Facebook's only showing you the  stuff you agree with. But it is a case that we are in a hyper partisan society. And and you kind of  it's the confirmation bias I was talking about, even though you might be seeing a broad variety  of inputs, you're not listening. You're not seeing it. Also, if you believe in QAnon, everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  confirms QAnon. Well, okay, that's where I go back to there's there's also data here. This is the  people who got their information offline are worse shaped than those who get their information online.  I mean, yeah, I believe that. Yeah. But but this is where we challenge that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt. But I would challenge that if you if you lump  the Atlantic along with Fox News into not online, then you get one result. But if you separate like,  the other the offline problem is cable TV news. Yeah, but it also I get all my news from I get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all my news from liberal sources, the New Yorker, the Atlantic, the Washington Post. So I don't know  how different that is from my relatives who only watch Fox News. Am I not also? But are you aware

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of those arguments out there? That's the other part of this is that because we see fighting,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that makes us aware of other sides existing. Yeah, and actually, I tune in Fox News, but as  much as I can, as much as I can take it, but they're in an alternate universe. What really is  we were talking about this before the show, you were talking about Dana Boyd's talk at South by  three years ago, where she talks about there's an epistemological crisis. That is, there is there  there's what you know, and what I know. And they never the twain shall meet. If I don't like you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to like your facts. Right. And so when we think when we think people believe this  QAnon stuff, no, it's performative. I I'm they don't believe it is because I think it could be  true, or because it might as well be true. And, you know, when we have a view where we say, well,  but no, the experts say that in this epistemological war says Dana, what some people say in their head  is the experts are an elite and they're tied in with the other elites. And thus, I don't like the  elites. So I don't like the experts. So I don't like what they say. So yeah, child rings in pizza  parlors, because it might as well be true in their view. There's also though, and I don't figure that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out. I don't think that this there's also perhaps maybe this is the larger issue, which is all of  the things that we are churning about, are really superficial issues that are designed to attract  our our our magpie like attention, where under the surface, there's really general agreement  between the left and the right, that we should let the people with the money run the place.  And that the the laws of the land and the and the way things work should be always  designed to encourage those people to make more money. I mean, if you're really a leftist, maybe  that's you know, if you're noam chomsky, all of this sound and fury is not important,  because it obscures the real facts of the matter, which is a deeply rooted inequality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bingo, bingo, bingo. And also the sense that you know, this, this, this resentment of elites  business comes across on multiple levels. One of the interesting things about QAnon is that those  of us who are interested in facts, journalists who are into fact checking and all that stuff,  actually getting the facts exactly right, are kind of more likely to dismiss QAnon in its totality.  This is gonna sound ridiculous, simply because it's completely wrong. However,  the idea that this pizza parlor thing and the pedophile ring, the idea, the core idea behind  that is that elites are getting away with pedophilia because they're elites, because they're  connected, because they're this, because of that. That's exactly what the Jeffrey Epstein story  revealed that in fact is happening. There's a pedophile ring, and they get away with it because  they're elite, because they have money, because they have power and connections and all that stuff.  So the outrage behind the false story of the pizza parlor is actually  justified because that sort of thing is happening.  That's the best I've heard to explain, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you get the most justification I've heard to QAnon yet.  No, people know there's something going on, but they ascribe it to the wrong source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know, I read a book. I'm gonna try to keep up with Mr. Jarvis, who reads way too many books.  I read a book once.  Man, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That offline media can't be true.  I actually listen to him, man. I listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually listen to this one too. Rushal Shorto book that you probably read. It's a great  book about the history of Manhattan. Loved it. One of the things I learned from this book is  there was deep concern among the elites of the time in Manhattan that the poor people in the  Manhattan would make league with the black people, the former slaves and others in Manhattan,  against the elites. And so their goal was always to divide the two. And the same thing in the south.  In the south, the rich plantation owners knew that, I mean, they were way outnumbered by the slaves,  but if the slaves were to make alliances with the poor.  Political force.  Political force with the poor whites, they'd be in deep trouble.  And I think you even see this going on right now where the main thrust of the rhetoric is to keep  the repressed elites, the repressed poor at each other's throats because otherwise we're in trouble.  There's only a handful of elites at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's only a handful. That's why it's called the 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And if black people and poor white people realize that they had common cause against the  rich, the rich would be in deep trouble. So the best thing they can do is say, hey, white people,  watch out for those black people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. So I wrote a piece for an Irish newspaper. Sorry, you go first. I've been talking to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just agreeing because that's pretty much what I've been taught.  Is that your experience?  Yeah. That's what I've been taught in my family, that is, when I was growing up. Not necessarily  taught that in school, but that was pretty similar to the discussion that my family had with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You definitely got to keep them away from the Hispanics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. As much as you can, polarize people. So we focus on the polarizing thing saying,  I don't know what that... But really what the point of it is, is if you want to maintain control,  you keep these people polarized because otherwise they could align and we'd be in deep trouble.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's something else happening now, which is, and I wrote about this for an Irish newspaper. I  don't know if I've talked about the show, but my worldview now is that it's the last stand of the  old white man. And I say that as an old white man, where old white men know that they're going to  lose the power. And rather than sharing the institutions, they're now destroying them  because they know they're going to lose them.  Oh, that makes sense.  So that's what we see happening right now is it's a scorched earth.  That really makes sense.  Everything. Presidency. But I talked to a journalist from La Nacion in Argentina yesterday  and he was doing a story about Trump and institutions. And I said, it's not just  Trump though, that the disruption of the internet has challenged every institution in other ways.  Look at banking. Buzzfeed had a huge story this week about all the corruption of banking that  wasn't tracked.  Really fascinating.  Fascinating. Look at policing. And now we're finally as a society saying this institution  doesn't make a lot of sense the way it's set up and it's dangerous to people. Look at journalism  being questioned from all sides. Look at media. Look at the way democracy is being challenged by  a certain part of, you know, by the old white men. And so these institutions are under challenge  anyway. And the old white men are going in for the kill because they know they're not going to have  them in a few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last chance. If I can't have my gold toilet seat, no one can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  But I wonder why, you know, white people are afraid of being a minority. It's not like  minorities are treated any worse, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's so funny.  And what were you told in your family? Can you say more about that?  Yeah, I think it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The talk that some of my family members had was,  I believe I've mentioned to you all before, I was brought up to love. We need to love everyone.  And in the black community, there is a lot of fighting amongst each other that shouldn't be  there. And my family would talk to us about why are we fighting one another? And they would break  down the reason we would fight. For example, let's say sneakers or something like that.  You remember back in the 90s and 80s when people were getting killed over sneakers?  They brought it to our attention that, you know what, you know who's making money off  of those sneakers? It's not any of us that are fighting for them. So it was a lot of  discussions like that. It's just, we have all of these different limbs thrown in between us to  divide us and fight against each other. And it started from us fighting against each other as  black people, but just fighting against our neighbor, whether it was a black or white or  what have you. We were all in the same neighborhood for a reason. It's probably because  we weren't rich. That's right. Go ahead, Mike. Oh, sorry. I just wanted to bring this whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  conversation back to social networks and so on and actually do something that I haven't heard  before, which is to advocate for filter bubbles. Basically what's happened over time is that  there's a lot of discouragement, a lot of this people's belief about the world has changed a  lot in the last few years because of social media. You hear people describing Twitter as a hotbed of  racism and friction and misogyny and all that kind of stuff. And I always tell people, you got to be  aggressive with that block feature. But when you do that, when you actually, you want to hear other  points of view, but you don't want to hear propaganda. You don't want to hear bots coming  at you with Russian propaganda. None of that stuff. What you want is to have a carefully  tailored Overton window. Okay. I don't want to discuss pizza parlors and pedophile rings.  I've been there. My mind is closed on that. It doesn't exist. That thing, that particular,  and I don't want any propaganda. I don't want this. I don't want that. And I've been active in  doing this on Twitter, especially of, I don't follow anybody who's going to be calling the  libs Marxist or block lives matter, a Marxist organization. I understand why they say it. I  understand where I understand all that. I don't want to talk about it anymore because I need to  maintain, I need to get my work done. I need to maintain a positive worldview. And I think that  at the end of the day, when you do blocking right and you know what you want to talk about, who you  want to talk with, you end up with a filter bubble, but that's not what a filter bubble is.  A filter bubble is caused by algorithms and so on. So it's like a filter bubble, but it's something  you construct. And I advocate that people construct it because one of the most damaging things about  social media and how it all works is we think the world's gone crazy. And the only thing that's  really happened is we have a lot more information from a lot more people. We're seeing everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  instead of just our, we're out of the filter bubble. In fact, it used to be just Walter Gronkite.  Yeah, that's really interesting. Would you say the same thing, Mike, if I am a QAnon follower and I  say, I don't want to follow anybody that tries to debunk QAnon. I wouldn't recommend following

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  QAnon or taking that point of view. But I'm just saying from their point of view, it's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thing. Look, I don't want to, I've already decided that QAnon is true. I don't want to hear these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doubters. Well, I think that's why. On the streams that does happen.  Yeah. And I think it doesn't matter really because you can't really convince conspiracy theorists to  get off their conspiracy for the most part. 99% of the time it can't be done. That's the really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  none of the matter at this point. We've got, let's say two sides. There's really probably many more,  but let's say we've got two sides. Have we decided at this point it's impossible to convince the  other side of what we think and just we've given up and it's over and there's the left part of the  aisle and the right part of the aisle and never no more crossing over. No, no, no, no. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the main point of the propagandists that there are two sides. The right is not QAnon. The right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't even Trump and Magoworld. Right. No, George Wills voting for Joseph Biden. It's like hell has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  frozen over hundreds of Republicans. He left the party. In fact, he's no longer a Republican

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because of Trump. But the point is that I used to think George Will was the right of Attila the Hun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now he's my body. That's right. But he was always a process guy and the rule of law and all this  kind of stuff and a conservative. And it's refreshing to find people who are intelligent  and honest and free of the propaganda of their side on the other side, no matter which side you're  on, on your political. So for example, there are lots and lots of very intelligent, thoughtful  Republicans who are very conservative and their voices are just completely drowned out by the Fox  News Breitbart types in the public sphere. But when you can seek them out and bring them into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fold and interact with them on Twitter, it's a beautiful thing. And maybe 62 members of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  United States Senate. Well, they're just cowering and they're afraid of mean tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they're not afraid of mean tweets. They're afraid of a Trump base that will go to  the polls November 3rd. And they are literally terrified of them. And maybe they should be.  You can point to people like Jeff Flake and say, you know, even Mitt Romney is cowering at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  point in his boots. Well, no, Mitt Romney is running for president is what Mitt Romney is.  Romney is going to have it both ways. Oh, I voted for impeachment. Look what a good guy I am. Oh,  but I put your justice on the court. Look what a good guy I am. No, he's pure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This pisses me off about him and Bloomberg as well. If they really wanted to stop Trump,  they should have run. They should have gotten on the ballot and divided the Republican vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bloomberg wouldn't have taken the Republican vote. He would have taken.  No, Romney would have. Romney would have taken the George Will vote. No,  I'm very glad he's not there. Very glad. Okay. All right. Anyway, is it the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that it's foolish to pursue persuasion with people of differing opinions?  No, it's not. Not at all. It feels like a waste of time. I can't talk to my relatives. It's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tougher. You still do that. You do that still. Yeah, I do. But then I also filter it and say,  you know what, these people or groups or whatever, they have the right to their opinions. They have  the right to their choice. And I try not to take a lot of things personally, because part of  conversations are disagreements. So I just sort of roll with it. And if I can persuade someone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  great. If not, you're completely wrong. No, just kidding. I'm just kidding. See, come on, man.  But I think the secret is to identify whether the person is arguing in good faith and if they are  genuinely coming from a place that is not a place of propaganda or whatever.  And then you have to cherry pick the points. You can't change someone's entire worldview. But I  had a very constructive argument with somebody on Twitter recently where we were getting into  it on a whole bunch of things. And he happened to say that Biden has done nothing to denounce  the looting and so on associated with some of the protests of Black Lives Matter.  And I said, yes, he has. And no, he hasn't. Yes, he has. No, he has. And I was able to just go back  and just find news reports in June, July, and so on, where he spoke very forcefully against the  violence in favor of the protests, but against the looting and the violence. And the guy goes,  huh, I didn't know that. But it was one little piece just to let people know that their source

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of information is not necessarily reliable. But here's the other. What has happened in our  society, I say this as a media guy, we're all media people, since what we're doing right now is media,  is that things were controlled in such a way that society lost the ability to hold a conversation  and to debate and argue. And now we suddenly can hear voices we couldn't hear before. And now  people can disagree with each other in ways we can hear it. We don't know what to do with it.  Right. And we think that it's all blowing up. This is what society is. This is what democracy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the hurly burly of the intellectual marketplace. It's the cacophony. And we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing it badly. We need better tools. We need better structures. We need better training. We  need more education. We need better training. Training. Yes. We need better parents like  aunts, who you know, as family members are told to be wise, things like that.  And so we're going to have to relearn these skills. The same thing happened, my friends,  you're going to hear from me. Watch out, get your drinks ready. Drink time. From Gutenberg  is that it led to a 30 years war for God sakes. Right. When new technologies come that allow  people to speak who couldn't speak before the people who could speak before that, resent them,  try to stop them and don't know what to do with them and don't know what to do with the noise  that's created. Oh my God, a reformation. But then also good things can happen. I honestly believe  that I'm coming to believe more and more that Black Lives Matter is the is the reformation of  America. It is like the Luther reformation. It is really it is potentially now we could screw this  up. I don't want to act like a hashtag. He's going to suddenly do it 400 years of struggle  and slavery and death so far haven't accomplished. But I think that there's a moment here where it's  Luther's 17 or five, nobody was it, 195 theses in 1517 on the Wittenberg door, that there's a  moment here where people can use this technology to say, but you don't like all those other voices,  but let me get my voice out here. Let me see what I've been seeing going on. Finally, I can say it.  And we don't lose sight of that. That's the thing I keep screaming about is that when journalists  say, oh, Twitter, it's a cesspool. When Leo Laporte says, oh, leave Facebook, it's a cesspool.  My fear is you're going to leave behind those voices who were not heard in mass media who  finally can be heard and finally have something to tell us that we need to hear. I think they need a  blog. Yeah. Or a perhaps a Silverstack newsletter. Yeah. I saw on Twitter plenty of ways to get your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  word out these days. Well, we go where the people are, though. You got to go where the people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to say you're a destination. No one's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journalists. Twitter is the ultimate filter bubble. It's 300 million people who are mostly journalists.  I don't think real people use Twitter. Maybe they do. Maybe that's changing. They do.  Do they? They do. I know. Black Twitter is great. I love Black Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My Twitter following that I follow myself, they are real people. It's not just technologists.  It's not just photographers, but I follow a ton of people that I love and care about dearly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they're regular people. It takes work to find them. It takes work to meet them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it pays off that work. I have to agree with Mike's principle, which is, and I always said  I did this, but I don't think I did it very well, which is follow freely and block even more freely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing. I'm blocking somebody every day. Not everybody's worth hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did not block for a long time. Recently, I've started blocking people again, mostly because I  just didn't want the vitriol and the outrage. I was sick of the outrage. So then you're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to find that it's actually a pleasant place theater. Yeah. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Exactly. I think the point of view that we have to get to is to understand that  we are not going to interact with 99.99999% of humanity ever. We're always going to only  interact with a tiny, tiny minority. We have the opportunity with social media to decide who that  minority is. That's good. I like that. By crafting a filter bubble, I think I have  thousands of people blocked on Twitter at this point. It's a beautiful thing. I'm taking  deliberate action to decide which ridiculously tiny minority of humanity I'm going to  engage with. I want them to be representative. I really do, but that's my choice. I want a little  bit of that. The only thing that I will not tolerate and don't have time for is people who  are dishonest or who are acting in bad faith or have some agenda that I disagree with or whatever.  But beyond that, it's a beautiful opportunity. Just forget about the idea that you have to be  on a social network that everybody is on or that you will even ever interact with the vast majority  of the people on any social network. We're talking about a tiny, tiny sliver of humanity.  And that's all we'll ever have the time to engage with. Because you and I love to travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what I would venture. It's certainly for me and I'm pretty sure it's for you. The  main purpose of travel is to broaden the variety of people you get to know and interact with.  They're shallow interactions, but at least they're interactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you travel... Google Plus was going to save it all?  Yeah, well that's... Yeah, those are the days. Not when Google Plus was the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would still be on Google Plus if we were around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I miss it. I miss it so much. That was such a wonderful social network, at least for me. But  this thing about travel, I think that with the way we're headed, where people can work remotely,  I think they can travel in a way where they really have deep experiences. I mean, this has been my  experience and I feel like the travel that I've done, the depth of the relationships I've had with  the range of people that I've interacted with has made me an entirely different person than I was  10 years ago. I mean, I've lived in all kinds of really mind changing... I've lived in Kenya.  I've lived in places that just completely changed my whole world.  Because you stay there. You're not a tourist. You stay there. You live there. You become...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Total nomadic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. But the result of your perception of humanity is that you look at everybody  completely differently. The way I look at people now, compared to how I used to,  is just night and day. It's just a completely different world.  So hopefully there'll be a lot more of that. People will be able to go to another country  and live there, have neighbors, shop in the same store and get to know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me and my mask. I'm going to be traveling. If I get a really good mask...  Yeah, Bane kind of mask.  Really good mask. Hey, let's take a break. It's so fun to get together with smart people  and learn. And I feel like I do that every week.  And Ant.  No, Ant. You're one of them.  No, Ant. The smartest of us.  Ant Pruitt, twit.tv slash hop for Hands On Photography,  H-O-W for Hands On Wellness. Mike Elgin. Great to see you from elgin.com.  Great to see you too.  Mike's List. And of course, getting back on the road soon, we hope. Knock on wood gastronomad.net.  What is the prognosis at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to fire it up again next year. We've got Morocco. We've got two provinces in the middle  of summer. You feel pretty confident that you're going to be able to do it?  I do. Yes, I do. And I don't think we're waiting for a vaccine. I think we're waiting for a whole  bunch of other things. But in any event, our experiences are very socially distant anyway.  For example, in Provence, we live in this farmhouse that's outside of this village.  I mean, the nearest neighbors are like half a mile away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, if we had good, reliable testing, you could just say, hey,  you want to go on the trip, you got to test before you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are going to test people before they go. So everybody will know that every other person  is negative. And then when we interact with winemakers and stuff, it's just us. We're never  interacting with tourists. The alcohol does kill the virus. So I think we're safe. No, I'm kidding.  Yeah, but we're going to do a lot of expenses next year.  You're not just covered here in a jar with a bunch of brine being pickled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't judge me. I'm not judging. I'm in the jar with you, buddy.  Yeah, I'm glad. I'm so glad because I think this is a really great way to travel. And  you know, I'm thinking maybe that's what my retirement will be is just getting nomadic,  especially if Starlink happens and we can, we can get online wherever we are. You have to bring a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pizza box with a dish in it, you know. Yeah, it's the size of a medium pizza. You were  showing like a large pizza. Oh, a medium. More of a medium. A medium. Yeah. But I think that  the ideal amount of time to stay in this place for me personally is three months. Three months.  So three months. You stay in a place for three months, move to another place for three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I could do four places a year or three places a year with three months at home.  That's a good, that sounds like a plan. Isn't it? Let's do it. I might just hang with you guys.  Just come with us. Jeff, you want to come with us? Come on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this week I've spoken, tomorrow I speak in Hamburg. I spoke in Chennai. I spoke in  Sao Paulo and I spoke in Munich. This is the worst kind of travel. All those frequent flyer miles  I've lost. This is Zoom travel. Worst kind of travel. Zoom hell, man. I'm on constant Zoom.  But I mean, on the other hand, it's not Zoom hell. I zoomed into a class in Chennai, a journalism  class where they were just fantastic students. They were just great. And I wasn't going to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to Chennai. So it's fine. It's good. You're keeping this kind of quiet, but I think you're  getting an award tomorrow in Hamburg. Well, of sorts. Yes. The scoop award. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scoop award. No, it's not a scooper people. This is you're going to scoop camp. That's exciting. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's tomorrow, right? I'm doing a talk. I have to be up, I'd be on Zoom at 6 45 AM, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New York time. That's nice. And people can participate virtually. Yeah, they can come in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  free. If you go to the site, it's in German. Don't worry about it. Just get the digital thing.  Look at that. Look at how serious Jeff looks in that picture. Looks like you're castigating  somebody with your stare. Yeah, somebody who is more, it's Germany. They have moral panic.  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, should Zitra act like to shoot. Yeah. Harden, Biden, carbon. By the way, a number of  Germans sent me notes saying, you know, that's not a real German word at all. We never say that.  That's something the British say to pretend they're speaking German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're an American pretending to be a Brit, Brit, pretending to be German. It's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty much what it was. Right for me. That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Twilio. Love the Twilio. I'm a Twilio subscriber for many,  many years. I got a Twilio phone number. I love to play with the Twilio API to try different stuff.  Twilio is where you go to build things, build things that communicate. The world is changing  fast. You want to build new ways to help customers in a kind of socially distanced,  appropriate way. And that's what Twilio has always done. Engage customers on any channel,  anywhere. I mean, when I say channel, I mean, text messaging, emails, phone calls, newsletters,  video, one platform does it all. And man, do they do it at scale. Twilio powers 795 billion plus  interactions across channels with five nines of uptime. 99.99% uptime. Over three billion  phone numbers available across more than 100 countries. That's at scale. And I love Twilio,  but I'm not alone. Many, many companies use Twilio. When you do that two-factor authentication and  logging into your Netflix account, that's Twilio. Shopify uses Twilio to run their entire global  contact center. More than a million customers. That's Twilio Flex. Blue Apron uses Twilio. You  get a Blue Apron newsletter. That's being sent with Twilio Send Grid. And Lyft and Uber, you  ever get a text message from Lyft and Uber? Yep, it's Twilio. You guessed it. Product and operations  teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their users inside applications ranging from  account notifications with text messaging to chat bots to securing online accounts with two-factor  authentication. You use Authy? I use Authy. It's the two-factor authentication program we recommend.  That's Twilio at work. In fact, I love Authy. You can always tell if somebody's a Twilio customer  because Authy works better. They go right to the top of the list. Twilio is really kind of amazing.  Customer service teams, of course, use Twilio Flex to build global contact and support centers.  Flex is a programmable contact center application that you control. Look, you don't need to be  a specialized telecom network engineer to use Twilio. Leo Laporte uses it. That should tell you  something. It lets developers control the global communications network with a few lines of code.  If your developers are already building web applications, they already have the skills they  need to build apps that text, call, chat, and video conference. There's just no easier platform  for building. Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire  business. It's easy. Just go to twilio.com. Set up an account. Play with it. It's fun.  Twilio.com. It's time to build with Twilio. Twilio.com. Thank you, Twilio, for supporting  our show. We really appreciate it. Thank you for supporting us by checking out Twilio. Twilio.  Okay. Kevin Toffle is ringing down the crepe. We mentioned this last week as a supposition,  but the Pixelbook is now no longer in stock at the Google Store. It really does look like the  end of the line for the Pixelbook. You can't even buy it if you want to. Google told and gadget.  It's pointing buyers to the Pixelbook Go, which is kind of their silly schoolbook version of it.  They say it's a similar high performance, but it isn't. Third-party inventory not gone.  People like Kevin and others have pointed out that the Acer Spin, for instance, which is  $500 or $600, is as good as a Pixelbook. There's really good choices out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the question. My battery is about zonked. My keyboard has problems. I've been  panging up this thing for three years. I'm going to have to do it. I was going to get the Samsung.  The battery sucks on that. But the Go was Kevin's Chromebook of the year for 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Go is not bad. I don't know if I would go with the Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Spin 713. Which one?  I would go with the Spin.  I don't really want to fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't remember if it has a fan, but you can find out next Monday on Hands on Tech where Mr.  Jason Howell is going to be reviewing the Acer Spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good plug. Well done, plug sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does have a fan because it has an Intel chip in it, but it's kind of concomitant with these hot  Intel i5s that you're going to have a fan. It also has 8 gigs of memory. It has NVMe storage,  which is really fast. 128 gigs. Not that storage is all important, but for things like power  washing, that'll be a lot faster. Booting up should be faster. It's got a beautiful screen  that's very high res. 2256 by 1504.  That's boring.  Boring. It doesn't have little nubbies on its butt. Is that what you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm just unhappy. I lived at Google for so long and they've abandoned me.  Some people got upset about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is odd. Honestly, I don't feel like the Go is going to last that much longer either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no more not pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's a color by the way.  People think that Jeff is saying something weird. It's one of the colors that the Chromebook  comes in. Well, we have a Google event coming up on the 30th. Who knows? A week from today.  In fact, right before the show, we're going to start Windows Weekly an hour earlier, I think.  Then we're going to go to the Google event and come right out of the Google event. We know it's  a Pixel 5 event. Actually, I don't think there's any surprises come to think of it.  I think Google's already said everything they're going to announce, right?  Or could they have one more thing at the end? Oh, and for those of you who missed the Pixelbook,  for Jeff Jarvis, we've decided to sell one more Pixelbook. Yeah, no, I don't think so.  Why is that? Because there's no question that Chromebooks sell well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin's argument is that they proved the point. Chromebooks at first were all cheap,  tinny, plastic, rock-o-things. They wanted to hire and they proved it. They proved it at a very high  price. But as you say, the 713, which can you give me a spoiler here? 629 bucks.  So it's a good machine, but it's a premium compared to what was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, are you going to buy a Pixel 5? Because that's going to come out next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My wife will kill me. No, I'm not. Listen, I'm not going anywhere. So yes, I use my phone. Of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  course, I use my phone, but I'm home. Right. This is, by the way, the difference between your wife  and my wife. I was saying last night, I said, I don't want to buy a new iPhone. I don't want  to buy a new Pixel. I'm so done. I just want to keep using this one. She said, I will kill you  if you don't buy the new phone. So that's really quite a big difference. What was that show when

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you traded spouses? Yeah. Would you like to be married to Lisa? Just for one day. Just one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the tech guy. This is your job. Of course you're buying the new stuff.  I have to say I did in a fit of economy, trade in the Microsoft Duo. I've never sent anything  back. I sent it back. And yeah, I know. But don't get your hopes up because I applied the 1500 bucks  plus a $500 trading of my old Note 10 to get the Galaxy Z Fold 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I want to see- Which is looking like to be a better device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I want to see. And you know what? I will without hesitation return it if it's not.  Right. Right. Because I think I'm going to get the Pixel 5. I think I have to. I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like you're not into gimmicks. You just want something that's going to work and get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  jobs done. I don't want to buy a new phone every year or let alone five new phones every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so over that. Quite frankly, Mr. Laporte, I don't want to buy a phone for a long time,  especially at the thousand dollar price tag. I know. I just want to stay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But it is kind of- And I forget, I ask you this all the time,  but I keep on forgetting which one. You have the 4? The 4 XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  4 XL, right. That's what I got too. And I got the orange back. I like it. It's a beautiful phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Mrs. has the 4A. Good choice. And holding that 4A was a little weird to me because it's  smaller, but there's nothing wrong with that phone. Right. And she wanted to complain about  the camera one day. And I looked at it and I said, maybe if you just clean the lens off or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something, because the camera is totally fine. Oh, it's probably just schmutz on the lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And it's been fine ever since. That's a quality device for that price point. And  just seeing that right there, it really just tells me, hold on to this 4 as long as I can,  because they're charging too much for these phones. And if we continue to buy these phones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're going to keep charging those prices. Well, now there is some rumor going around that  maybe the Pixel 5 will not be the thousand dollar phone. There have been price leaks from  Europe and so forth. So I don't know. There's a lot of leaks as always. What happens next  Wednesday probably won't be much of a surprise from WinFuture and 9to5Google. Six inch, 90 hertz  display, 432 pixels per inch. That's a lot. That's plenty. Gorilla Glass 6. That's one step up from  the Pixel 4. Still breakable. Yeah. Still breakable. And there's no glass that's not, I'm afraid.  The chin is still there, but it sounds like it's pretty narrow, the bottom bezel.  They say this in the leak, again, Google hasn't said, is 100% recycled aluminum, IP68 water and  dust resistant. Now the thing that perked my ears up is big, big, big, big battery, 4,080 milliamp  hour battery. Wireless charging, reverse charging as well. That would mean really nice battery life.  A wide angle 16 megapixel, F2.2, one micron pixels, which is as Ant will tell you is a good  thing. The bigger the pixel size, the better the low light performance. Same 12.2 megapixel main camera,  but it now because of the extra processor will support 40k, 60 frames and 240 frames.  You just got the new GoPro Hero Black 9. Have you been playing with its 4k and 5k video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I played with some of the 5k yesterday and so far the only weird thing about it is it allows you to  shoot in a flat profile. They don't necessarily call it log, but they call it a flat profile.  It's really not flat. It's still pretty vibrant. I don't really expect great video from a GoPro.  I don't know now. GoPro is really good because of their stabilization.  It's better than what you would think considering the size of that camera and the size of their  sensors. You're going to review that next week on Hands on Tech? It won't be next week, but it'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be soon. You got to take some time to really put it through its base. But that's the thing.  Do you need a GoPro if you're getting 60 fps on 4k and 240 fps on 1080p on this phone? The  front facing camera is the same, but it's got a wider field of view, 90 degrees instead of 83.  Snapdragon 765G, 8 gigs of RAM, a lot of memory, 128 gigs of storage.  There will be 5G, but it will not be millimeter wave according to WinFuture. This is again a leak.  It'll just be the sub-6 frequencies that T-Mobile offers. But maybe that's just the European  version because this is a European magazine. Right. Could be different in the States.  Micah Sargent will be very happy to hear, not that he's going to buy one,  there'll be a green version. I had the orange last year. He probably would because it's green.  He likes the green. He'll buy it just because it's green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a question though. We talked about the demise of the Pixelbook. What's Google up to with  phones? We all remember the Nexus phone, which they got rid of in favor of the Motorola phones,  which they got rid of in favor of the Pixel phones. At first, the Pixel phone made a lot of  sense because they're putting some proprietary AI into it. They were doing some interesting things  with the camera. There's all kinds of stuff going on. Now it feels like the 5 is going to be just  over the top speeds and feeds, which there's no reason for Google to do that. Samsung can do that.  Lots of companies can build powerful phones. So why is Google still making phones? And the  second question is, will they continue doing this? Is this the last Pixel phone? And should it be?  Wow. That's interesting. I thought the  forward mouth of it, man. Jesus.  I know Jeff Jarvis wants the Pixel phone, but why, as a company, why is a company like Google,  their main business model seems to be to disappoint users. I mean, that seems to be mainly what they  are in business to do. Yeah, it's tragic. But still, we have to ask why are they doing it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  will they stop? I honestly thought the 4 would have been the last iteration because of the way  the sales went with it. The 3A got a lot of promise and great hype because it worked out  to be a great phone, but it seems like it really did just fell off the cliff with the 4.  I haven't seen the numbers on the 4A, but I still just thought, yeah, Google is just going to sign  off and just continue to do what they do with big data and not necessarily worry about hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, what's in it for Google to go through all the trouble to be a phone maker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To make me happy. That's what Mike is just for Jeff.  Because I want my Google devices. That's why. You're not going to be happy, Jeff. You're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to be happy. I think it's not about hardware anymore. I think Google really wants a pure Android  experience available somewhere so that you can compare it to the crap that Samsung and others  put on the phone. But again, that's another case where maybe it's not as necessary because Oxygen  OS is pretty pure. Motorola's Edge has pure Google on it. The days of these weird adaptations  of Android, even the Duo was pretty pure Android. It had a few features. So I don't know. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  great question. I don't know. Mike, you're just bitter. You lost your Google Plus. You want me  to lose my gadgets. That's what it is. I know. Believe me, Jess, I'm also bitter because I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  losing the Pixelbook too. I have a Pixelbook and love it. I did have the Pixel 3 and I loved that.  I want to lower expectations because when has Google ever launched a hardware platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and stuck with it? Never. No. You're still a little frosted. You're still a little hurt over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus, I can tell. Yes. That's true. As much as I love Google Plus, Mr. Elgin, I had to  step away from it pretty early. And I remember doing it quite vividly because I was so sick of  the troll controls inside of it. It was really bad trying to manage my happiness in the feed  because it was just a bad experience. I loved the people that were there, but it was just  more stress trying to keep that environment clean for me. And you reported and reported  and nothing would ever happen. And then I was part of one of those elite groups, whatever it was  called. I can't remember what it was. And you go into that group and you fuss and tell them,  hey, you're asking for our feedback. Here's the feedback and nothing is happening. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, I just had to let it go. Google Plus was great for four years and then they lost the plot  completely. And it just kept getting worse and worse after that. Trolls were coming in and you  pointed out that they wouldn't stop the trolls. They would also flag half of the good comments  as problematic. It really sucked from 2011 to about 2014, something like that, 15. Am I getting that  right? Yeah. The first three or four years. There was a change in leadership there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was his name? Vic Gondotra. That's it. Yeah. So I want to get our crack production team to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  work on a special TikTok. You're producing crack now? Yes, they're cracked. They're cracked. I want  them to work on a TikTok bumper until we have one. I'm just going to use this.  Oh man. These are the days.  Light travels through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One o'clock PM. Take it down for that. On a summer day at Antwoord's great aunt's house.  Monday. She's telling us to go outside and play because the stories are coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's Wednesday, it must be another lawsuit. So you may remember if we're picking up the plot  that WeChat and TikTok both were supposed to be turned off on Saturday. WeChat sued and got a  restraining order. TikTok went the Oracle route. They got a friend of the president to invest. Not  a lot. Now TikTok is asking for an injunction from the court on a ban that would require Apple and  Google to remove TikTok and I presume WeChat as well September 27th. So that's four days from now  saying that this violates the First Amendment rights of the people on TikTok. It shuts down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a platform. Which is all I've been screaming all along and on this show this is a First Amendment  issue. This is the press of the people. Yeah. And I'm so delighted that's how the court ruled  on the WeChat ban. Yeah. This was First Amendment for those folks. Yeah. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's also hard to come up with. You know people I get a lot of hate mail on this one  because I'm trying to defend TikTok and so forth. They say you just love China.  You're just a commie. But actually it's not that's not the case. What it really is is I think we  clearly have a threat from China. It's exercising its economic soft power all over the world. I  don't think they're going to invade the US. It's not a military threat. It might be a cyber threat.  But it's a very complicated strategic relationship and it requires diplomacy and some subtlety and  it requires a lot of work because on the other hand we have a lot of stuff made in China. It's  a giant market our companies would like to be in. Apple is critical to Apple's finances that they  sell phones in China and on and on and on. So it's complicated and I think it needs a strategic  complicated vision long term vision to address it. You know diplomatic and otherwise and to say oh  well the problem is these apps. If we just ban the apps everything is going to be fine is more  theater to distract you from what is actually a much more serious problem. So I'm not saying oh  China is a great country. We got to let them do anything they want by any means. But I do think  that it's a much more subtle problem and banning an app is a trivial response to it and has unintended

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  consequences for its users. In your defense I have seen you on several shows here on the network  including this one here. Whenever you talk about TikTok it's never much of anything about China.  What you seem to enjoy is just the way you're getting good content that suits you and their  AIs just getting it right. Every time you pull it up you get stuck in the time suck and you're  enjoying the content there regardless if it's TikTok or whatever. You just like what it's giving  you and I don't see anything wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah so we'll just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just shocked Leo. I'm shocked that you think Trump isn't bringing subtlety and a long term view  and a technical sophistication to this argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's probably not the right man for the job but we still have a  semi intact state department and I'm sure that there are things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other weird part about this too is there's the five billion dollars.  Now are they really paying five billion dollars to the treasury under what structure or is that  merely the taxes they think they're going to pay? Who pays it? Does Oracle pay it? Who pays it?  That's unclear. It's all unclear but then now we have a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TikTok by the way TikTok's latest plan is to do an IPO and pay five billion to the treasury out of  the IPO which wouldn't be for a year or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why does the treasury get a penny out of this? It makes no sense but here's the thing.  We have to pay for the re-education camps.  It's for the re-education.  Well it is re-education. That's the problem. You have both Oracle, not surprising because  run by a fan of Trump's, but you also have Walmart now saying we're okay with money going into Trump's  white supremacist anti-1619 project education plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the education plan that the five billion dollars is supposed to be enough for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart is saying this needs a reaction.  Well of course they are.  No but of course they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No this needs a reaction.  Well I agree but Oracle and Walmart don't want to offend the president because they're hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well how about Walmart offends every African American customer they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that might not be so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And every not just African American customer every customer believes in  in history in the New York Times and Nikole Hannah-Jones and 1618.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well get ready because the latest is.  Making reparations.  The Trump administration is now questioning Epic Games and Riot.  Oh Jesus.  Tencent by the way has huge investments into pretty much every website you use including Reddit.  So Fortnite, League of Legends.  You know if you want to, this confirms what you were saying earlier  which is the white men don't intend or expect to continue to rule.  They just want to burn it down before they go.  And because clearly if you ban these very popular programs all you're going to do is  get more people hating you which doesn't seem like a good electoral plan.  Yep.  It maybe appeals a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're cult, you feed off of hate.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also doesn't make sense to kill your voters but that's he's doing that too.  So yeah but I mean it just.  Yeah it's burning it to the ground.  Initially started talking about with whether the antitrust action against Google was going  to happen when nobody knows.  The way it's become clear that President Trump governs and I don't want to get into a pro-Trump  anti-Trump let's just talk about how he approaches things.  He sees himself as a negotiator and he likes to have everybody on the ropes.  So he like he like and once Google worried going to the election he just you know he  thinks in a very simple way apparently and he says OK Google has some control over what people  see and hear and what they search for and all that kind of stuff.  So let's just dangle this threat vague threat of antitrust action out there.  We don't move on it yet not till I say so.  And then over here we got TikTok and I'm going to I don't like it so I'm going to you know I'm going  to mix it all up and then it'll be up to me to decide who gets what and where and all this kind  of stuff.  I'll do the re-education camp thing because that'll own the libs etc.  But he likes to have all these plates spinning and all these things in play so that he can come in  and just at the at the opportune time make a make a big change.  That's his change and so he seems to operate in this way and you can explain a lot of  what happens at the federal level based on this sort of I guess you'd call it a negotiating style  to to have to throw everybody off their game so that so that you have all this leverage.  And that's one part of it but I do also want to do a kind of a full-throated look at the fundamental  problem.  So I agree with Jeff.  I agree with you Jeff about the First Amendment rights of TikTok users.  I agree that you shouldn't be banning apps and all that but I do want to acknowledge  that there's a problem and separate from all of that.  And the problem is you have an authoritarian government who has as part of their laws that  they can go and muck with data with any company operating in China.  So you have an algorithmically generated content source that's just exploding in popularity  globally.  You have a government that bans other social networks from operating in that country so  Facebook doesn't get to play in China but TikTok gets to play in the United States.  So you have this disparity and you have the government of China who is slowly building  these advantages in the coming cyber war, propaganda war, hot war, cold war, whatever  may come they want to have all the advantages in place that they can.  And TikTok has a potential advantage for propaganda.  So you can imagine in an extreme case let's just say they outright they do ban certain  things but let's say they just said you can never mention Winnie the Pooh on TikTok globally.  You can never mention Tiananmen Square on TikTok globally.  You can never mention any criticism of the Chinese government ever anywhere on TikTok.  And let's say TikTok became by far the world's town hall.  You can see how that's a problem.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what the world says about us, Mike.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  Let's look at Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's look at Hollywood, for example.  Hollywood movies.  In Hollywood, in Chinese movies, you can criticize the United States but you can't  criticize the Chinese Communist Party.  In Hollywood movies, you can criticize the United States but you cannot criticize China  because Hollywood will voluntarily, does voluntarily censor their movies  because they want that market.  So we're entering into a world on many sources of content where China is always the good guy  and the United States is always the bad guy.  This is an issue, I think, that has to be dealt with.  I don't think it's banning apps is not going to get us there but I mean we barely even  talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would agree with you.  There are many, many issues.  I mean China is acting strategically on a 100-year plan and we can't make this single  plan for a week.  So I agree there are issues.  I'm not saying, but I don't think banning TikTok addresses the deep underlying issues  that we need to address.  So anyway, who cares if you ban TikTok?  It's just a stupid app anyway.  Actually a lot of people on TikTok care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People will be upset but there will be another app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe, you know, but everybody learned how to use TikTok.  Why should they have to move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and TikTok was a step change, I believe, because it was the first one that really  enabled people to collaborate in a string like that.  Right.  I think it was the next change.  It wasn't that I'm going to make something that you're going to comment on.  No, isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the resharing, the reuse.  It's exactly what people like Cory Doctorow and, oh, I forgot his name, Larry.  Magic?  No, no, the...  Not low?  No, yeah, Larry Kudlow has been arguing for this for years.  Murdered!  Murdered.  The Creative Commons guy.  It's what they've been arguing for for a long time, which is the best that you have to have  a Creative Commons lesson.  Thank you.  You have to have a Creative Commons so that people can...  Walt Disney wrote his stories based on long public domain fairy tales but then immediately  pulled up the ladder and said, you can't reuse my stuff.  It's important that the public domain exists, the public commons, the public sphere exists  so that people can build upon it.  That's what TikTok does really well.  They've been talking about this for years, but here's a platform that actually formalizes  it and it works beautifully.  It's really cool to watch people do that and even do music.  In fact, so much so that it's pushed companies like Facebook to say, oh, we've got music  you can use.  Facebook's licensed apparently a significant amount of commercial music so that people,  creators on Facebook can use it.  I think that that's definitely a response to TikTok, right?  It's not the same though.  It's not at all the same.  Yeah.  It's very interesting.  Let's take a little...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a parting shot against Facebook, it doesn't take a whole lot for Facebook to copy  what somebody else is doing in the social sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the interesting thing is one thing they haven't done well is copy TikTok.  Instagram created Reels.  They really tried to make a TikTok clone.  They're not the only ones.  A lot of people are trying to do this.  YouTube has a similar plan and something about TikTok.  It's that magic sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trump was not able to...  Trump used all every other platform.  He wasn't able to use TikTok to his benefit.  That's part of the reason here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say though, if you look for it, there is a lot of pro-Trump content on TikTok.  Maybe the algorithm does not forward it along.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the algorithm...  There was a story about the algorithm last week.  To my mind, the algorithm is extremely simplistic.  That's what Matt Cut said when he was on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, oh, yeah, I could do that.  It'll be a deal.  I can write that algorithm in five minutes.  Actually, he was on Twitter when he said that.  I want to just take a little break.  Keep us on schedule here so we move along.  And then we have the changelog still to come.  Lots of other stories.  That's some good stuff on the run.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  I like to do this.  When we come back, you guys...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about this for a teaser?  Show a picture.  Can you find the cat?  Can you find...  Line number 152.  The cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I do that before the commercial?  If you do beforehand, of course, you're going to see anybody in the break.  Look for the cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're listening to the commercial, I know.  But they might also be able to multitask.  And can they find the cat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is on Reddit.  The Find My Cat Challenge.  Those of you who are...  Should I play the video?  What should I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not a video.  No, no, no, it's not a video.  It's the picture.  It's the Reddit picture.  It's a still picture.  I see that cat.  It's not it.  That's not it.  No, where is it?  I see...  Keep going.  Keep going!  You're frustrating me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so many ads.  This is a comment section.  No, no, it's up.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's up.  It's up.  It's up.  What's going on?  Oh, here it is.  No.  You found it.  No, that's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not it.  This is a parliamentary meeting  in which a tail wandered through the video.  But you're not talking about that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a Reddit picture there.  The one earlier today.  In this photo...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm clicking this link.  This is from the subreddit r slash aw.  That's it.  That's it.  Find...  Let me make it a little smaller  because we've got to get it all in the frame.  Somewhere in this photo...  There is a kitty.  Okay, so should people screen cap this?  I'll just leave this up while I do the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Find my cat in this photo and on Reddit.  We were listening over...  Did you find it, Jeff?  Were you able to find it?  No, I didn't.  Oh, I had the cheat.  I had to go to the spoiler.  Yep.  I didn't find the cat.  So just we'll come back.  We'll find the cat.  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is the cat?  The cat.  There's a cat.  Now you got me.  This is a fun game.  Is this a game?  It's a fun game.  Is this a game on Reddit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Burke found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want more of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't tell us, Burke.  Burke says he's found it.  When we come back...  I see it too.  Oh, Burke and Ant will reveal the cat.  I see the Samsung phone.  I see two remote controls.  I see a coffee cup.  But is there a kitty cat in there?  Is it big or is it little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you said no, that you're cheating.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Nice try.  Don't do your commercial.  Is it clearly visible?  Just go do your commercial.  Go do your commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I showed today.  I got a new game.  Find the hot cloud storage.  It's right underneath your sushi there.  It's that green ball.  It's called Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage,  which is the best deal on storage since the zip drive.  Let me tell you this.  Wasabi.  There are many, many businesses these days  who generate a lot of data.  We generate a lot of data.  Every show we do, we generate a ton of data.  Terabytes of data.  And we know we're going to have to store that.  What do we do?  You go out and buy more hard drive capacity?  Yeah, that's what a lot of people do.  But did you know you could buy cloud storage on Wasabi  for less than just the annual cost of maintenance fees  on the same amount of on-premises storage?  Just the maintenance fees alone  cost more than Wasabi for the same amount of storage.  Wasabi is amazing.  And now somebody might say, well, but yes,  but my on-prem storage, I can see it right there.  It's more secure.  Oh, I don't think so.  First of all, Wasabi stores your data encrypted,  even if you don't specify it,  on premier tier four data center facilities  that are highly secure and fully redundant.  Wasabi does active integrity checking.  Do you do this on your on-prem?  Every object stored is checked for integrity every 90 days.  And if it's not exactly perfect,  it's replaced from the redundant storage.  That means they've got 11 nines of durability.  Do you have 11 nines on your hard drive?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Wasabi follows all the industry's best security models  and design practices.  They have access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs.  But I love this even more.  You can't do this on your on-prem storage.  Your data will be immutable.  You can set data so that it can't be erased.  It can't be altered by anything from ransomware,  other kinds of malware, hackers, even from yourself.  And frankly, let's be honest, human error is really the biggest threat to data.  But if it's immutable, none of it matters.  Wasabi is amazing.  Now, let me on top of that say,  it is one-fifth the cost of Amazon's S3.  One-fifth.  And it is about six times faster.  So, okay, let's recap.  More secure, faster, less expensive.  It's Wasabi.  It's pretty much a no-brainer.  The problem is it's a brand new company, a brand new product.  Maybe you hadn't heard about it before.  I want you to try Wasabi because I think you will love it.  And by the way, if you're an MSP and you resell storage, resell cloud,  you're going to love it because you can make more money  and charge less to your customers.  Everybody wins with Wasabi.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Wasabi is highly secure disruptive technology  that's turning the industry on its ear.  And it's 80% cheaper and six times the speed of the industry leader.  Oh, and by the way, and it bugs the heck out of me.  I put stuff on S3 and they charge, you know,  hey, that nice price, I store it on S3.  And then they charge you to get it.  No, not Wasabi, no charge for egress, zero, no charge for API access.  Now, this is the topper.  It uses the Amazon S3 API.  It's API compatible with Amazon S3.  So all your tools, all the stuff you've written,  all the tools you use, it all works.  Wow.  I should mention they have this.  Now, normally it's just a flat rate.  It's very affordable.  But they do have this new thing called reserved capacity storage.  If you are like us churning out a pretty consistent amount of data every month,  you know you're going to need this much storage every month.  You can reserve your storage for one, three or five years,  whatever amount you need.  And you'll get even more discounts, it'll be even more affordable.  The longer the term, the greater the capacity, the more you save.  So that's Wasabi's reserved capacity storage.  You got to check that out too.  I just, I don't know why, you know, everybody says,  oh, Amazon or Google or Microsoft cloud.  No, no, you got to be doing Wasabi.  Calculate the savings for yourself and kick yourself for not doing it earlier.  Start a free trial of storage right now for one month at wasabi.com.  Click the free trial link.  And please, if you would, enter the offer code TWIT  so they know you heard it here.  Join the movement, migrate your data to the cloud and do it with confidence.  Wasabi.com.  Do the free trial, but do use the offer code TWIT.  Thank you Wasabi for your support.  Thank you for supporting us by using TWIT as the offer code.  Wasabi.  Hot cloud storage.  All right.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  And you want to give us, don't tell me, give us, let me zoom in and look at different parts.  Is that the cat there on the, no, that's not the cat there.  No.  Is that-  You're close.  Is the cat in the chandelier?  Negative.  No.  Is the cat in the Buddha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stay with the stairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stay with the stair.  Oh, there's the kitty.  There's the kitty cat.  Oh, thank you for the hint, Ant.  The cat's just look peering around the corner.  You see all you see is one ear.  It's kind of great, isn't it?  That's a great cat photo.  Sometimes I see too many cat photos, but this one-  You can't see too many cat photos.  Not in this case.  No, impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have cats, Jeff?  Well, I see.  So I'm a dog person by birth.  Yes, as am I.  My wife's a cat person.  Of course.  And when the debate came, she would wake up the children on a really cold, wet, miserable morning and say,  if we had a dog, you'd have to walk it now.  Oh.  Pick up its poop.  I lost.  I love the cat.  I love the cat.  The cat's wonderful.  That is, that's just going-  It was unfair as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going below the belt, man.  Wow.  But have you-  Casey Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Casey Newton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leaves the verge.  Leaves the verge?  What?  Where's Casey going?  Didn't see that.  Line 156.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Line 156.  I love this.  It's like a deli.  I'd like one from 156.  He's going to Substack.  That's not even a place.  It's a newsletter.  He's doing his own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Charging for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's really interesting.  So basically he says, I'm going to make my-  You did that, Mike, didn't you?  You said, I'm going to make my own way.  I'm going to do newsletter.  Oh, Mike, you're muted.  He's a muted.  I don't know if that's us, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was me.  Sorry about that.  No, I re-enabled my newsletter.  I started my newsletter literally 20 years ago.  And so I brought it.  It sort of went away for a few years and I brought it back about three years ago.  So, but newsletters have, obviously they're-  same things happening to newsletters that happen to podcasting where for a long time,  there was a lot of people doing personalized things and then larger and larger publications  nowadays are getting in the newsletter publishing.  So it's a crowded space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Substack is interesting.  Tell me about Substack.  Does anybody use Substack here?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People, I mean, they're doing neat things.  They're creating a lot of stuff for the writers.  They're looking to try to get the libel insurance, I think, and health insurance and stuff like that.  They have various services.  They're very smart.  They're going out and recruiting big names like this and paying them money to do it.  Very much like the podcast world.  Oh, that's interesting.  They take, I think, 10% of your revenue, which some think is high.  And they're doing neat stuff.  So I got into a discussion today with Matthew Ingram and others kind of saying,  he was noting this and saying, where is this going to go?  And how applicable it is to the long tail of journalism as opposed to the high profile  writers like Casey, while others come along.  Carolyn McCarthy came along and said, something that I think will have to be addressed is that  people simply do not want to open that many emails.  And I couldn't agree more.  I agree.  I feel like-  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the newsletters I subscribe to go into a pile where I don't read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she said, I feel like some kind of custom consolidated hub is the next step, to which  I responded.  That's medium.  Email is not a very good delivery mechanism for email newsletters, as it turns out.  We might need something new like RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, geez Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To which Carolyn said, okay, let's queue all the morning for Google Reader being gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a newsletter that you would pay for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's $10 a month or $100 a year, or there's a $100 a month level.  But you don't know what the real benefit is until you're inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Casey's newsletter is going to be called Platformer.  News at the intersection of Silicon Valley and democracy.  Okay.  Now I have to point out, you know, medium is another way people are doing this.  The problem I've always had and I've always been very nervous about is,  if you live on somebody else's platform, you're at their mercy.  Bingo.  Whether-  Here's the difference, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  I was talking about this.  I got in a discussion with Matthew about this too.  As he was saying, you know, podcasts were all independent and then they went to big companies.  You know, now-  Not me.  Newsletters are independent and go to big companies.  Not you.  Not you the whole time.  Not that we didn't try.  You're the old lady who won't sell her property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I would have if they had given me enough money.  But not that we didn't try, but nobody wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the difference now, I think, is the independent person.  We have a new degree program.  We have a new rather educational program at the school.  Our remade entrepreneurial program is for this.  You're not going to be on one platform.  You're an independent person.  You're going to have a newsletter.  Maybe it's on some stack.  You're going to have a blog.  Maybe it's on medium.  You're going to have videos.  Maybe they're on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always said that.  You should make use of as many different forms, not just different places, but different media as well.  Right?  Record, audio, video, do as many because you want to reach people in whatever ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as somebody said in this exchange, I forget what it was.  You're going to use Facebook to promote, but you're not going to put your whole business on Facebook.  You're going to use these platforms rather than be used by them.  Sorry, Amp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I agree 100%.  I just consider it being a jack of all trades and master of none.  Just sort of picking and choosing just enough to be able to get your message across.  Like the way you pick your moral panics.  Right.  And still have your own place, like your own domain that you run.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, I'll give you a good example.  Lisa wrote an article about how podcasting is changing in COVID.  And she thought, well, I could put it on my blog, but why don't I put it on medium?  So she did.  And as you know, if you use the word COVID, you're going to get a big banner on medium that says,  now we don't vet any of this stuff, so don't believe anything you read.  Okay, fine.  And then for reasons we'll never understand, they suspended her account.  One article.  What?  Yeah. And furthermore, without a warning, without any recourse, there was nobody to contact.  She was, her account was down for 10 days.  And then they sent her a note saying, oh, that was an accident.  Sorry. And she's back up.  So this is why I don't like being on somebody else's platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So whatever happened to Jack's plan to do the open source version of Twitter and that,  what was that called? What was that plan called?  You remember where they brought people in?  Yeah.  So they were going to go to value layer on top of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's it called?  Like a federated Twitter or something?  Hello?  Yeah. What was that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Twitter?  Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Who cares what it was called?  I care about it because I want to write about it.  Oh.  You basically want us to do your research.  Yeah, I do. I do. Exactly.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're failing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me just Google that and I'm sure I could find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chat room, you got it? Your chat room won't fail me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is. Open source is happening. Twitter OSS.  Our philosophy, heat, light and love.  I don't know if that's, I don't know who that is.  I thought it.  Projects.  It's called Pants.  It's called Pants.  Please write your article about pants.  If it's not pants, it's bijection or finagle.  No, no, no, no.  Finatra, dodo, risulis.  Wow.  Common.  Rabbit hole.  Rabbit hole.  Rabbit.  Tweenmoji.  Hogan.  They got a few of these.  Ambrose.  What is it called?  I know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  Chat room, are you going to rescue me here?  No, they're coming up with worse.  They used to mastodon.  No.  No.  Geocities.  Gowalla.  Path.  Peach.  Oink.  Any of those?  Any of those ring a bell?  MySpace.  People, people, people.  You're not helping me out here.  Twitter plus.  All right.  No.  No.  No, no, no.  Anyway, I just.  How good are you people?  But I've always said that.  That's why we've been very reluctant.  When Facebook Live came out, people said, oh, you should stream on Facebook Live.  I've been very reluctant.  Yeah, I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were right.  You were right.  I said you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are on YouTube, but it's not important to our revenue.  Some of this, it's out of my hands.  I have a marketing department now, which I'm not a big marketer, as you know.  I think the best thing is what we do, which is you have an RSS feed  and people subscribe to it.  It's called the podcast.  And I'm riding that all the way down to the very bitter end.  I'm just going to stay.  Was it Friendster?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No damn help at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  No, no, we got an article.  We got an article.  This is from Carsten.  Jack Dorsey wants a decentralized Twitter.  Carsten bless you, my son.  He should hire him as your research assistant.  Activity Pub?  No.  No, no, no.  Mastodon?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He started a group working on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I remember.  And they were the reason we found out is they had a listing for jobs.  It may not have a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it did.  It did.  I know it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing that comes to my mind is Aloe or something like that.  Yeah, that sounds familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Avalon, something like that.  Yeah.  That sounds familiar.  Well, all right.  Afterlife.  Marston Olmos.  Second life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ello.  Small independent team.  Yeah, all that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Quibi.  What about Quibi?  That would be a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's so funny.  That's so friggin' funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So apparently Quibi.  Well, you're just, that's called Schadenfreude as I remember.  Oh, it is.  Quibi, which was of course the highly, almost $2 billion financed attempt to take on YouTube  from Hollywood with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitten at the helm.  They released it with some misgivings during the pandemic.  Turns out their misgivings were well-guided after the three-month free trial.  Pretty much everybody left.  And now they are apparently shopping themselves after six months.  Trying to find a buyer.  Been there, done that, Quibi.  Good luck to you.  Maybe Spotify.  Do you ever think of Spotify?  They make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's to buy there?  What the heck is to buy there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That great sideways phone technology.  You can watch it wide or watch it tall.  Doesn't matter.  I don't know.  What is to buy there?  They also say they're looking for other options.  It may be the buyer, whatever.  Strategic options.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got a lot of stars.  Chrissy Teigen didn't really turn around.  What it does, that tells you that it didn't go that well, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Because if you go to the 2001 crash was we're going to buy audience.  The use of investors' money since then is we're going to buy stars.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of the money which pays off.  Because PewDiePie is not for sale, my friends.  That's the thing that drives Hollywood crazy.  What's with the PewDiePie guy?  How come he's so big?  And how can we duplicate that?  We need our PewDiePie.  Where's our PewDiePie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go find a PewDiePie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't drive Hollywood crazy.  It drives me crazy.  He just...  No, I should say that.  I remember thinking this is a guy playing games and he's just swearing into the mic.  Right.  And people love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, what made Kim Kardashian famous?  I mean, I realized 21 seasons of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  A sex tape.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that...  That's what did it.  That wore off after a few months, a few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, in our day, we don't have Stacey here to make fun of us for age,  but we don't...  Ant can do the job himself.  I remember.  In our day...  You're a film.  Remember these game show contestants, these celebrity game show contestants who were famous  for nothing but being famous on the game show?  Yeah.  Kitty Carlisle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  There were a lot of them on all the game shows.  They were famous for being famous.  Yeah.  We've always had them.  But then did you read last week in the New York Times, the long piece on Paris Hilton,  who is...  No.  She invented famous for being famous.  In fact, Kim Kardashian was her assistant.  Was her buddy.  Yeah, buddy, assistant.  And it...  But then it turns out, maybe Paris Hilton does work for a living because she's got 93  cosmetic brands, lines.  She DJs 250 events a year and gets paid a million dollars per event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, F me.  Oh, just F me.  There is no justice in life.  At least she's working and not just tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DJing.  So she...  I mean, you could say she's famous for nothing but...  Or a sex tape or whatever.  But in fact, she works her butt off.  Yeah, at least she's working.  It's actually...  The reason for the article was that YouTube has a documentary called This Is Paris,  which I'm sure Edward Armourow is just rolling in his grave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe it...  I believe it mentions her dealing with some abuse from her parents and things like that.  Yeah, so this is the thing about...  Pretty dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is...  Well, you got to remember a lot of this is about cultivating the brand and everything.  I don't want to be cynical, but what she revealed is that she was sent off  to one of those kind of...  Juvenile delinquent scooch boarding schools.  Yeah, it's not just a regular boarding school.  They kidnap you and they realign you and stuff.  And she said she was actually pretty horribly abused.  So I feel bad for her.  But anyway, she was the original, wasn't she, Paris Hilton?  Well, Arlene Francis in our day.  Arlene Francis.  Kitty Carlisle was like a socialite, right?  I think that was her.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  She was married to Moss Hart.  So that's not...  She was like famous by association.  Right?  Her grandfather was the mayor of Shreveport.  So there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at a tech conference in Armenia last year.  And it was pretty technical stuff going on.  But Kim Kardashian came and spoke, actually.  And it was standing room only.  I couldn't believe it.  It was just at a tech conference.  And I had a grudging respect for her.  Did she talk about the latest Intel chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the punchline is I had a grudging respect for her based on her...  Grudging respect for her based on just figured she's an entrepreneur,  she's involved with the game somehow.  I didn't really pay that much attention.  But once I heard her spoke, I lost all respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Somebody is reminding you...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just couldn't...  I mean, she came across like...  I mean, she had nothing to say.  I was a little shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know here recently she is...  I want to say she's passed the bar and has done some things with civil justice here.  What?  In California.  Kim Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, her father, of course, is famous for being OJ's attorney.  But what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Here recently she's been on the path of trying to fight civil injustice for  some people here in the state of California.  I don't have the names in particular.  Well, good for her.  But yeah, she's been trying to fight the good fight.  And even...  A lot of people talked about her canceling, well, not canceling,  but taking Kanye out of the limelight on the television show.  But it's the smart thing to do because she's not willing to make light of mental  health awareness and things like that.  So she's growing.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, we have to mention, since we're talking about Kim Kardashian,  that they just canceled the Kardashian...  Well, that's what I brought up after 21 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  21 years.  Exactly.  21 years.  That's what fooled me.  They said 21 seasons.  I thought, my God.  But it was...  It's like 28, right?  It wasn't 21 years.  It was 21 seasons.  It was over only like 14 years or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the question that I think is being raised by this story  and some of the other things we've been talking about.  Is celebrity over?  Are people fed up with celebrities?  The Paris Hilton doc seems like a very savvy move to humanize somebody who is just  worshiped for being a fabulous personality.  Are we just done with celebrities?  Is it impossible now in the culture to have a popular show about celebrities' lives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Well, what if we still have TikTok and as long as we still have  Instagram stories and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but TikTok is an example of how people who are not celebrities are getting all the attention.  You know who deserves attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do in turn become some sort of a celebrity and try to pivot that into other brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But can any of us name a single TikTok celebrity who became famous?  We can name a hundred people who did it on YouTube.  I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ever heard of Lil Nas X?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  I can't name Mr. Elgin because I don't get on TikTok.  That's the only reason why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like you heard of Justin Bieber and all kinds of people who came up on YouTube,  for example, where the celebrity manufacturing process resulted in major household names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excuse me.  I'm going to once again say Lil Nas X.  He had the longest running number one music hit in history, beating the Beatles, Stevie Wonder,  and Michael Jackson in 2019.  Remember Old Town Road?  I have to, if I play it, I get taken down, so I'm not going to play it.  Can't play it.  But don't listen to it.  Oh, I do remember that.  Of course you remember this.  It was really an interesting song because it was kind of country, kind of rap.  He caught a lot of heat.  Yeah.  And by the way, he became famous on TikTok.  It was people on TikTok not only watching the video, in fact, especially not watching  the video, but hearing the song as others reused it that made Old Town Road a big hit.  So that's somebody.  There he is.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lil Nas X.  I didn't realize it was TikTok as the origin, though.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that cool?  I think actually that's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Mike, to your point, there's a neat post I put up today about, where the hell did it go now?  Jesus.  Generative entertainment that you're going to get so good at making fake stars, fake people.  Doesn't matter.  It's working for therapy now.  It's going to work for everything else.  So you end up at a time of unlimited entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think we're there.  Yes.  We're there pretty much.  I think we're there.  Well, but I think what Jeff's talking about...  TikTok made Sarah Cooper famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. Yes.  Right. Is she a celebrity?  I guess she is.  Yeah, she hosted The Tonight Show.  She's famous, but yeah.  Anyways, so I think what Jeff's talking about is the use of, correct me if I'm wrong,  the use of artificial intelligence to create not only entertainment and articles and things  like that at a just colossal scale.  Yes, exactly.  Thousands per minute.  So we may be having the same conversation, but instead of wondering whether celebrities  still have the same juice they used to have, whether people do.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's something in human nature, though, that we like celebrity.  We want to have celebrities.  It makes us feel connected in some way.  Maybe media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's an echo chamber.  Media has convinced you of that.  Really?  Yeah, it's the media structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think you could make a strong argument that the president is the president because  of The Apprentice.  Oh, yeah.  But I think you can make a strong argument that Joe Rogan is the most successful podcast  of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the end of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the man show and the fear factor.  I think being on TV...  Not man show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not man show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wasn't on the man show.  Rogan was.  That was Corolla and Kimmel.  And Rogan was on that, wasn't he?  I don't know.  I didn't watch it, so I have no idea.  I know.  Well, Corolla and Kimmel are famous because of the man show.  So, okay.  I rest my case.  So I think television has a remarkable connection to our brains through our eyes.  We think we know these people.  We love these people.  And I don't think that's going to go away.  I don't think you can do art generally enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's what I think we can all agree is changing.  The number of celebrities that exist just keeps growing enormously.  And the number of people to whom each celebrity can relate is shrinking.  So you're talking about television.  Yeah, television is mass medium.  And so if you watch the man show back when there were slightly fewer channels,  then you know Adam Corolla and Jimmy Kimmel.  And now you follow the careers and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here is Joe Rogan on the freaking man show.  Okay.  Okay.  You got me.  So I'm just telling you, TV has a remarkable ability to create.  I think it taps into the part of your brain that is about social and about friendliness.  And there's something about it that radio doesn't do this as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But your show does.  The same dynamic exists with this show and with your shows, Leo.  A lot of people feel like they really know you.  No, but you know why I'm successful, Mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I was a minor celebrity and a little known cable channel for six years.  That's what this whole thing came out of,  was six years in a very minor cable channel called Tech TV.  And I don't think I'd be here today if I didn't do that.  So I'm not sure I agree with you, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you picked up a lot of audience and brought them with you for sure.  But the video medium does have that powerful effect.  My point is that the number of people who were in front of video  is growing exponentially.  And the number of people who tune into each particular video personality is getting smaller.  So yeah, we'll have celebrities, so to speak.  But I think the audiences will get smaller and the number will get greater.  It'll be sliced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I would submit that most people will end up having five people that they really zoom into  and connect with.  But it's just there's going to be different five people for everybody, right?  Exactly.  So you won't have the mass celebrity, perhaps.  Although I still think you're going to have number one hit records,  number one hit movies, and number one hit people.  That some people will rise to the top and become somehow universal.  I don't know why, but I still believe that.  Yeah, maybe I'm wrong.  We'll see.  I'll be dead, but we'll see.  And now.  Now what's going to happen?  What's going to happen now?  Time for the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google change log.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten stacked this thing like the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  He really loves the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He added so much more in.  I had other stories elsewhere.  No, no, no, no, that's change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to start with this.  The Google Doodle contest that they do for kids.  The Doodle for Google contest, according to Google, was one for the books,  tens of thousands of entries from students all over the nation.  The prompt was, I love the prompt, I show kindness by dot dot dot.  A few weeks ago, they announced their five national finalists from each  one from each grade group.  But it is now time to announce the winner of the 2020 Doodle for Google contest.  Texas fifth grader, Sharon Sarah.  And there is her Doodle.  Together is one highlighting the importance of inclusion and acceptance.  See, there's your people right there.  And see, each one is wearing a different letter in the word Google.  Don't you love how massive corporations pretend to be human?  Oh, that's true.  That's true.  By making contributions to political parties and nominating fifth graders to win a contest.  So she's barely been entering since third grade.  So there you go.  Yeah.  And what does she win?  She will receive get ready.  She will be seen by the nation on the Google homepage and then a $30,000 college scholarship.  Her school Vaughn Elementary School receive a $50,000 technology package.  So Chromebooks, they're going to get the Chromebooks.  I'm not getting the kids.  And they're going to get all the old Pixelbooks.  So congratulations, Sharon Sarah.  She's a real, she's a celebrity that deserves the name celebrity because she drew a nice little  drawing.  Hey, did you know that Flutter will now work with Windows?  Yes, it will.  Oh, sorry.  Google gets a Cuvid layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what.  I put this one on.  I put this one and he moved it down there.  It's going to tell you where there's more COVID cases.  There's Cuvid over here.  So stay away.  Oh, is it my problem?  I do it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I said it.  I decided I decided from now on I'm calling it Cuvid or the Rona.  So there'll be so in addition to yes, like Cuvid, Cudies.  It's the Cuvies, Cuvidies.  In addition to satellite layer traffic layer, you can add now a Cuvid 19 layer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stay away from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Is it?  Yeah, look.  So here in this map, North Dakota is red and South Dakota is pink, but Nebraska is yellow.  So just consider that the data comes from Johns Hopkins, the New York Times and Wikipedia.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, files by Google can now open PDFs and adjust video playback speed.  That's good.  Good.  Files is, you know, nice.  Good to have.  Google Takeout now lets you thank God select photo albums to transfer them directly to Flickr  or OneDrive, Microsoft's product.  So it used to be added download these files and there's be XML files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're also supposed to be able to take an individual photo and now share it  directly to like Twitter without going through that whole McGill.  Hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hallelujah.  I don't know.  You already sent your Pixel Buds back, Jeff.  I'm sorry to say twice.  Twice.  You don't have any more, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and I was waiting for them to fix them, but this is not the fix.  Oh, so there is a different problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a fix that addresses the audio cutouts that happen every 110 seconds.  I thought that was the one you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the one I have.  They're still saying this is this defines a lemon.  They're still admitting they haven't solved the other problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're getting cutouts, but it wasn't every 110 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, it was that this was a whole new problem.  It's sad.  They fixed, but they have still not fixed the problem and they're still selling the  product, which I think is.  Oh, that's really sad.  Unconscionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does everybody have this problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's the weird thing.  But but they acknowledge that a lot of people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hard hit hasn't complained in a long time.  Is that what he's here is quite regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he using the originals or the new ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He bought his right when he came out.  So they don't have a wire connected them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just two separate ones.  Okay, that's the new ones.  Google is moving Android 11 to the Android TV platform.  I actually am happy to hear that.  I have a Nvidia Shield is my favorite Android TV devices pricey,  but it's got a nice processor in it and all that.  So why am I hearing myself?  Is that coming from something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's your ego talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's your contra here.  I think my bicameral mind has finally split right in the middle.  I'm talking to myself again.  Hello.  Is that from Mike?  Who's that coming from?  Can you tell?  Someone's got need a headphone.  Somebody's got headphones too loud.  The phone app is being renamed to not a phone.  No, no, it's going to be called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't take a note from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be funny when it's going to be called the phone by Google.  In case you didn't know.  Google has launched a work tracking tool  that's actually kind of like air table, which is a really cool product.  It's called tables.  This comes from the incubator area 120.  It lets you track projects.  There are just so many other things.  Not only that, just tables are sponsor Monday.  There's so many other things that do this.  Jira, Atlassian's Jira.  But now there's tables might be worth trying.  I looked at the UI and I thought this does not seem really very attractive.  But you can import data from Google Sheets or a comma separated value file,  share data with your Google groups and assign tasks to people found in your Google contacts.  They also have templates and there are automated actions.  You can have grid views, record lists, can ban boards and maps.  Yeah, sounds just like Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, pricing and what's the value of that far as what features you get in under that.  That's what's going to matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $10 per user per month.  Very pricey.  Well, you can use it for free for 100 tables and 1000 rows.  But if you want to get more tables and more rows, $10 per user per month.  You also get bigger attachments, more actions, advanced history, blah, blah, blah.  Maybe worth looking at.  This is certainly worth a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone that needs it can't necessarily afford some of those other products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $10 a month is about what the other guy's charges are per user.  Google, which has always had trouble with paid Chrome extensions,  they put them on hold, they limited them, now they've just shut them down.  Developers can no longer make new paid extensions.  There was a temporary policy, temporary suspension back in January because of the  number of fraudulent transactions surrounding paid extensions.  They're going to just phase them out.  By February 1st, any existing extension will no longer be able to charge customers.  So here's the timeline.  The announcement of deprecation happened a couple of days ago.  The new item ban is now permanent.  Free trials disabled December 1st.  All payments disabled February 1st.  And the licensing API will shut down later.  In case you have a paid extension.  I'm sure there are legit paid extensions, but it was the abuse that was causing a problem.  And I believe in a record amount of time, we have now completed the Google changelog.  Couple of quickies.  I wanted to give you, Jeff, a chance to mention your new product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So thank you for the plug.  At my center, at the townite center,  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, we run communities of practice.  The first one we started was run product.  We had about 25 people from mainly New York, but also around the country,  who in this new job title, it didn't exist in newspapers, it didn't exist in news,  who were in product and it grew.  And then friends at Temple and Mizzou came and said, we want to make this thing national  and we want to make it international.  So as of today, there is the opening of the news product.  What is it called?  Alliance.  NPA.  Right.  So we also have communities of practice around audience and talent and inclusion  and commerce.  We're starting one for the independent journalists for the Casey Newtons of the world.  One around data and the business of journalism.  But this one was the first one.  The bird flew out of the nest and I'm very, very proud of this.  And it was an example of collaboration.  Google, in full disclosure, has backed training for product people  through this group and our continuing education arm.  And I think it's going to be good.  What's the deliverable?  Is it a...  It's an association for people who work in product and news so they can cry on each  other's shoulders for nobody understands what they do and how important they are.  There'll be a conference at some point.  A conference.  We already have one conference in Philly.  We already have one.  Oh, good.  Okay.  That's where we launched it.  And with 300 people trying to come.  But this is the part I get is this and audience, our two audience development,  are two jobs that didn't exist in my field 20 years ago.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you for the plug.  This is the board of advisors.  And if you go to newsproducts.org, you can read all about it.  And if you want to pitch in, join the alliance, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The news product business?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh, the ignoble prizes are out.  I always look forward to the ignobles.  They're fun.  Yeah.  These are prizes not for great scientific projects, but less than great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a picture at the top from the 2009 that was really ahead of the science of the time.  It was really an important thing to see there.  That picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a brassiere that can quickly convert into a pair, not one, but two, protective face masks.  Invented in 2009.  She knew ahead of time.  She knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She knew.  This is the great thing about science.  You know, this is the day.  See, I had that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is I do know people who've turned their bras into face masks.  So this is not unheard of now in the acoustics prize.  A number of scientists received the president.  I want to read all their names for inducing a female Chinese alligator to bellow in an  airtight chamber filled with helium enriched air.  As a result, they got the paper, a Chinese alligator in heliox formant frequencies in  a crocodilian in the journal of experimental biology.  Sadly, there's no video evidence.  Alas.  Here's one I think could be very useful from the journal of personality.  Eyebrows cue grandiose narcissism, a method to identify narcissists by looking at their  eyebrows.  I have a method for detecting sociopaths.  Did you know that?  What's that?  Would you like to know what it is?  Well, if you yawn, and you know how yawns are contagious and the other person doesn't yawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're sociopaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what happens on the screens.  They have no empathy, no connection.  You're not empathetic at all.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I am what I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me look at your eyebrows.  Well, I don't know if that's a cue for narcissism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the frozen feces knife?  That was another gem from the awards.  I'm looking for it.  A guy named Richard Vetter.  No, I'm sorry.  There's another person.  It was a UK and US study to study frozen human feces could be made into usable knives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Journal of Archaeological Science and the title of the paper is Experimental Replication  Shows Knives Manufactured from Frozen Human Feces Do Not Work.  Who knew?  Do not work.  We experimentally tested knives manufactured from frozen human feces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do not work.  That poor postdoc who had to work on that man.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this was actually to debunk an ethnographic account of an Inuit man who made a knife from  his own frozen feces to butcher and disarticulate a dog.  It is apparently very common not only in popular culture but in academic literature.  So really, this is a valuable addition.  Debunking.  It's a debunking, a valuable addition to the literature.  You might have read this story in Shadows of the Sun and other sources.  So doesn't work, kids.  By the way, it goes on.  I'll read the story.  In the midst of a winter gale over the objections of his family, he made plans to stay on the ice.  An old Inuit man.  He wouldn't move.  He stepped out of their iglo, defecated, and honed the feces into a frozen blade,  which he sharpened.  See, there's details they left out.  Maybe they didn't try this.  He sharpened with a spray of saliva.  With a knife, he killed a dog and used its rib cage as a sled and its hide to harness  another dog and then he rode off into the distance.  I don't want that debunked.  That's a hell of a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, one of these things is actually real.  The Medicine Prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have that.  You have this?  You mean the one, does pizza protect against cancer?  Oh no, that was last year.  That didn't work for me.  You have arachnophobic entomologists.  No, no, no.  Here it is in the Medicine Prize, misophonia.  Miso-phonia.  Do you have misophonia?  This is the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a new psychiatric disorder.  A preoccupation with a specific aversive human sound that triggers impulsive aggression.  It's called misophonia.  Do they say what the sound is?  What's the sound that triggers you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The distress at hearing other people make chewing sounds.  I go berserk.  I go berserk.  I can't stand...  Stop it, Liam.  Stop it.  I can't stand chewing gum near me.  I can't stand people who open mouth chew.  It drives me crazy because my mother...  I think I may be with you on that.  Drilled this into me, man.  You do not.  You leave your lips closed.  You make no noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to learn how to deal with that the hard way because some of my colleagues were Indian,  Asian Indian, and it's very common to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not polite to smack your lips, but you can't help it with Fritos corn chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would recommend that you gentlemen not go to YouTube and search ASMR because half those  videos are people smacking their lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is...  They're making fun of this.  This is real, right?  This is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, misophonia isn't specifically just for chewing.  It could be other sounds.  The sound of a dog barking or something, but chewing...  Yeah, I've seen other people complain of that.  Yeah.  Is it that you find it disgusting?  Or you actually just get upset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Personally, I think it's just nasty.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nasty and I can't concentrate on anything.  I will move restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for the economics prize, excellent paper, I thought.  National income inequality predicts cultural variation in mouth-to-mouth kissing.  Apparently, it's not a human universal.  And in fact, has something to do with income inequality.  Okay.  And then there's the management prize, which I really enjoy.  This one goes to Guangxi, China.  Five professional hitmen in China who managed a contract for a hit job in the following way.  After accepting a payment to perform the murder, Xi Guan An then subcontracted the task  to Mo Tianxiang, who then subcontracted the task to Yang Kangshen,  who then subcontracted the task to Yang Guangshen, who then subcontracted the task  to Ling Xianxi, with each subsequently enlisted hitman receiving a smaller percentage of the fee.  The murder was never actually performed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like the enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but apparently there was a trial because here's a picture.  Boy, they have nice seats in the courtrooms of China.  Look at those comfy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They look like they're from a bus or something.  An airline.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  There they are.  There's the five hitmen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they in order of like how far down the line they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he told him who told him who told him who told him.  One got 10 bucks.  Yeah, and by the end of it, it wasn't a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Standing in a pyramid formation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Look at the judges' outfits in China.  I think that little Naz X wears that shirt.  Those are nice outfits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a Hawaiian hang loose hand signal?  It looks like on the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've learned a lot about Chinese jurisprudence here today.  All right.  I won't mention the entomologists who glued two extra legs on a spider to see how it would impact.  Do you want to hear the we actually have the sound?  This is the bellow of a crocodile in Heliox.  If you'd like to hear it.  I think you have to download it.  No.  Oh, I don't want to download it.  It's a move file.  I don't have a play it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I've got it.  I've got it though.  I can do it.  Could you play it for us?  Hold on a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many times have you been on a Zoom call and you say,  you know, the only thing missing from this Zoom call would be a goat.  Well, good news.  You can now hire a goat for the bargain price of five pounds to join you for five minutes  of your video meeting.  You can choose from Mary, Lisa, Elizabeth, or Daisy.  Daisy is probably my choice because it says what to expect from Daisy.  I think that's an outstanding icebreaker, even though I do not like goats.  Here without further ado is a crocodile bellowing in Heliox.  This is stuff you don't get in other podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't bother Jeff, but he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chewing drives me crazy.  Chewing bridges.  You're learning lots about me.  That sounded disgusting.  Open mouth chewing while crossing a bridge.  I'm done.  That's over.  Just kill me then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a little breather to consider what we've learned here today.  Coming up next are our picks and number and so forth.  Let's kick off the picks of the week with Mike Algen, I guess.  You're filling in for Stacey.  Do you have a pick for this week?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  Now, I'm obsessed with auto scrolling sources of content.  I like while I'm working all day to have information strolling by that...  This is one of the...  Actually, when we were talking about Google+, one of the things I liked about Google+,  in the very beginning was that you could do that.  You could actually have your feed auto scroll.  I've used extensions to allow Twitter to auto scroll, but I love to have  breaking news and other things scrolling while I'm working.  There's an old...  And I hope it's okay that I do an old tool.  But this is, I don't know, probably like six, seven, eight years old called  Scroldit.  I'm sorry.  It's S-C-R-O-L-L-D-I-T.com.  You can plug in any subreddit, including the new version of it, the hot version, whatever,  but you can put in any subreddit and it will sit there and auto scroll.  It'll auto refresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So whether you're interested in news generally or some specific area,  the second something's posted, it'll show up, it'll bump the other stuff down below,  and it'll just go all day long.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a subreddit.  What would be a good subreddit for us to...  Do you look at Reddit photography?  No, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how about like PIX?  Do PIX slash new.  And this is a...  It's for photography and also...  I'm sorry, P-I-C-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  P-I-C-S slash new.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand the...  Kids talk.  I don't...  Do I have to do the whole URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to just get rid of the K and then hit enter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's no K.  There's no K.  Oh, P-I-C-S.  Okay.  He doesn't follow instructions well.  What?  I don't understand.  Pick slash new connection error.  You sure the subreddit exists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might have to do the R slash.  Sorry.  This is a dynamite segment, isn't it?  Yeah, you got to do forward slash R.  Oh, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forward slash picks.  Boy.  What a pick.  What a pick.  Yeah, isn't it great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so old it doesn't work.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're really any Leo is the whole idea.  It's fun.  Yeah.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so if you're into Reddit, if you like various subreddits,  you can squeeze that screen down to the side,  to a column on the side of your screen.  I want to do that.  I would do that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me try a full URL, like everything.  Do auto add at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  It might be just me.  Let me just do.  I'm reluctant to do this, but I'm going to do the top stuff on.  Even that doesn't work.  So it's clearly my problem.  You know, it might be blocked.  I have so many blockers running on here.  It might be blocking it.  Let me turn off.  Let me turn off that.  Let me turn off.  Turn off that.  Is the website broken?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, let's get rid of all your cookies, Leo.  That'll help you.  So you have an HTTPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have an HTTPS there, Leo.  There's no S.  The little box that they have there, you just want to do.  It starts with a forward slash.  Start with a slash R.  Forward slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Just slash R.  Yeah.  It's just Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Oh, the fun.  I can't stand so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So much fun.  It's just not worth so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ever do a live demo in life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what to turn off now.  What?  I'll pick.  I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to turn off all your privacy protections in order to use this.  I'm going to turn off that.  Let's see.  Let's keep trying.  I hope this is worth it.  Oh, boy.  There it is.  So that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was it.  Boy, that was so much fun.  I can't bear it.  I'm going to have to just relax now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a terrible subreddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, what a pick, Mike.  Oh, that saved me all kinds of time.  It brought me new things in life.  Let's see.  This is.  Oh, don't Leo.  He's got to stop.  I'm exhausted.  I'm just exhausted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Why isn't this working?  All right.  Okay.  You win.  Casio is waiting for you guys.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to eat now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure this is going to work.  Just everybody go to scrolldit.com and try it for yourself.  Thank you.  I've got one.  This is good.  This came from Patrick Tellehandy.  I'm not going to go through it.  If we had more time, I would.  It's the tech aid quiz.  From Pluralsight.  If you go through this, it's really fun.  45 images of technology you may remember from your Ute.  Remember that?  What is that?  You know what that is?  Let's tell them.  It's a Tamagotchi.  And if you spell it right, it'll say you're right.  That was 1996.  You see that one?  That's an eight track.  This is kind of fun to go through this and see if you can identify some of these glorious.  There are Newton in there.  Oh, I bet there is.  There's a flip phone.  And a lot of this stuff I own, I'm embarrassed to admit.  There's a Walkman there.  So this is kind of fun if you want to play the tech aid quiz.  There are some things, Burke, that we were stumped by.  Like everybody knows that's a Simon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that an Altair next to the Simon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one, yeah.  I wasn't sure.  That sounds like an Altair.  Let's see.  Yep.  Boy, you're good.  The 8800.  What about this one?  Do you know what that is?  What is that?  I don't know what that is.  I can't tell.  I think somebody told me that that's a pong game.  Nope.  See that paddle?  It's just a knob.  So it's an old video game.  But I can't remember which one.  Is it an Odyssey?  Okay.  O-D-Y-S-S-E-E.  Nope.  E-Y.  E-Y-O-D-D-E-O-D-Y-S-S-E-Y.  Just like the standard spelling.  Oh, you're right.  It was Magnavox Odyssey.  So what's this one though?  This looks like Uncle John's...  Oh, that's a seat in front of a video arcade.  Actually, you know what that is?  That's a Feces knife.  Frozen Feces knife.  Yeah, I think it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It never really worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, that's kind of fun.  TechAidQuiz.com.  Jeff Jarvis, I would love a number from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see here.  Well, I'm going to mention one.  Then I want to mention one other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do a couple because there's a bunch of good stuff here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there was a village in the UK where every morning at 7 o'clock,  there's a number, for 18 months, the internet would go bonkers.  It wouldn't work.  That's what ants have.  Ants got that problem.  Yeah.  Every day, 7 a.m., same thing.  Yeah.  They finally figured it out.  They replaced things.  They did all kinds of tracking.  It was one guy in town who every morning at 7 o'clock turned on his old-fashioned TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  And they were all on cable.  So it was cable broadband and the TV would emit a signal which would interfere  with the entire village's broadband.  It took them a year and a half to catch him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The person said he was mortified and never turned it on again,  but asked his name not be revealed.  Oh my God.  So that's the number.  I want to mention something here.  This is a little egotistical.  I saw a tweet today from Justin Thorpe who said,  I wanted to thank you, my dad, Wesley Thorpe and I read public parts,  the only two people on earth who did so, together when it came out.  He was a former journalist, writer, and the idea of publicness really resonated with him.  Next tweet.  My dad passed away last Tuesday.  I now have over 3,000 priceless blog posts that he wrote since 2004 to remember him.  Look at this.  I'm so grateful that he defaulted to public.  And I spent some time reading through Wes Thorpe's posts and it's really amazing.  He never really knew his father.  He writes about the time he met him.  He wrote about his love for his wife.  He wrote about being a father himself, taking ministry to a prison, and enduring Parkinson's.  Wow.  So Wes Thorpe, rest in peace and blog.  That's why you write a blog.  It really is.  It really is.  3,000 posts of a life and it's really quite wonderful.  So thank you, Justin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need somewhere to kind of memorialize these kinds of things, right?  Because it's on TypePad but it's not going to go forever unless his son, Justin,  pays the subscription fee.  There's got to be some way to kind of, I guess, the internet archive.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been talks about trying to do this memorializing.  Yeah, I don't think anybody's ever actually done it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He started.  I think that there's got to be a way because I've been a fan of the idea of life logging  for a long time.  It's got to be a way where people can do a life log actually and then have that  existing activity.  Yeah.  But I guess there's no money in it.  So we probably...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, and there's really good journaling software out there.  I use day one and I keep thinking I want to...  J1 is kind of cool because it's on Apple's platform.  No, actually they have Android and Windows too.  But it does some interesting things like it'll get the weather automatically.  It'll get...  When I weigh myself, it actually...  The scale puts the weight in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it needs that kind of aggravation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It puts a lot of kind of daily stuff in there automatically and then it gives me daily prompts.  And I would think that would be something like that.  And then I don't know what you print a book out of it or something.  I'm sure day one has some idea of how to do that.  I don't know.  But yeah, this is a beautiful example of why you would write this.  And even if only Justin reads it, that's still enough.  And here's the family.  So thank you for mentioning that.  I think that's fantastic.  Ant, your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I have a few, but I'll try to be quick.  First up, I remember back in maybe April or May, and we said,  you know, things are going to be back to normal about September.  And, you know, we'll be able to go back to the offices and work and yada, yada, yada.  Well, no, we are still doing Zoom and remote conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I said September 2021 when I said that.  Oh, okay.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, with that said, Canon, they have finally gotten their webcam software out of beta.  It's now public for Windows only.  It's the Canon EOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does somebody else want to disappoint me?  Well, they're working on an Apple version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if you'll ever have a Chrome.  I don't think there'll ever be another four weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  If you look at how the beta was done, it took about four weeks for the Mac beta to come out.  And I've tested this and it works really well.  It works well with Hangouts, Zoom, OBS if you want to do live streaming.  They don't mention XSplit, which is what I use.  It works with that.  And yeah, it's pretty quick, pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, the whole idea here is that instead of having a capture utility, you could just take  the video from the USB port on the camera.  But most cameras, if you can get clean HDMI out, you can do that.  You just need a little capture dongle.  They sell them on Amazon, a huge range of prices from 30 bucks to 100 bucks.  And you just plug the HDMI out of your camera into that and then plug that into the USB port.  So most cameras, you could do that.  This big advantage is that it does it in the camera and software.  It streams straight out of the USB port.  So that's straight out.  And it works well.  You like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've tried it out a couple of times and it works really well.  I haven't had any issues with it.  And it works with a variety of Canon cameras out there too.  You're not limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I took one of the video cameras that we use for our shows, these Canon Vixias,  which aren't expensive.  They're like for 100 bucks now.  I took one home and actually it's such a good picture compared to the soft image that I was  getting from the webcam on the computer that I now have to shave before I go to meetings.  And I think I'm going to start wearing makeup to be honest with you.  It's just too good of a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use a Vixia for my overhead shot.  Look at that.  When I'm doing hands on tech.  It's really crisp, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would kill for a better camera.  I would kill so I'm not Pink Man.  Why don't you give me the instructions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we have any extra Vixias?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a Vixia?  Well, even if you don't, just give me the instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Burke's going to look because when we started this, we bought 40 of these cameras  and some have failed over time.  I don't know how many we use these days.  It's not 40.  So we have some extras.  I don't know many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, even if you don't have it, if you have instructions on how to do it, I'm just.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and this is one where you'd need to get the HDMI, mini HDMI out to full HDMI.  And then some sort of dongle.  I bought one on Amazon.  They're cheap.  You plug it in and it turns it into USB and then you plug it in.  And actually it is a great.  It would be worth it.  It's in our interest to get that to you.  So let's figure out a way to get Jeff.  I look like crap.  I know.  Yeah.  And you're doing it on a Mac, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Mac you gave.  Yeah.  It wouldn't work that well on a Chromebook, but it'll work on the Mac.  I don't know why we haven't done that.  We'll get you a nice camera, but you're going to have to start washing your face,  shaving, putting on a little face paint, a little lipstick, a little rouge, some concealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last time I shaved was for you, fella.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little bronzer.  Little bronzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, yeah, I should use the Trump stuff.  Then I won't be pink.  I'll just be orange.  Yeah, that'll work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll also be able to see that you've got the art of the deal on your bookshelf back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we will.  There'll be a lot of people scoping out what they can see now all of a sudden.  So be careful.  Be careful.  Yeah, I'm reading the Michael Cohen book, Disloyal, and he explains...  I'm not going to go into it.  If you want to find out, read the book.  Explains why the Donald's hair looks like that.  There's actually a reason.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  It's fascinating.  I'll pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Aunt Pruitt.  I don't pass you.  I wasn't done, though.  Oh, you got more?  Go ahead.  Do another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My other one, I've been talking about Adobe Max, and I urge people because it's free.  You don't have to be a photographer.  If you're interested in design and just getting into digital arts, this thing is free.  I highly recommend checking it out.  They've got a bunch of different sessions, and they've just recently announced the guest  list for the speakers that are going to be on there.  Chelsea Handler, Common, Annie Leibovitz.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Wow.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  I mean, it's a lot of good people that are going to be at this event virtually.  Yeah, but it's free, and I highly recommend it, especially just for the sessions in the class.  There's so much content out there that you can learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wes Anderson and Taika Waititi.  What?  Two of my favorite directors.  Wow, David Tennant.  They're going to have Dr. Who.  Yeah.  Dr. Who and Zach Braff.  Two of my favorite times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, sorry.  Two of my favorite times were seeing Questlove and Dave Grohl on the stage and just being  able to take photographs of them and listen to their stories and listen to them inspire  all of those thousands of people that were there.  I really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it, especially because it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think they would have this great list if it weren't virtual?  Do they normally have this many stars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so, because they had Tiffany Haddish was there one year.  Burt Munroy.  I love Burt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But okay, get ready.  Nick Offerman.  Mike Shamelon was there.  Oh, that's cool.  Nick Offerman and Stanley Tucci will be there too.  So you can watch.  Do I have to pay money for this though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't.  No, it's free.  Why?  Just give yourself, if you don't have an Adobe ID, just sign up for a free Adobe ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I've been giving Adobe money for years.  They ought to let me in.  October 20th through 22nd.  20th through 22nd.  350 workshops.  There's a lot of teaching about how to use Photoshop and Lightroom and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of their products, even down to Adobe experience design, that's where you're  prototyping apps or doing, heck, even funky little presentations.  They walk you through the apps to make it look good and be a lot more functional and  just be super duper creative.  Character animator, if you want to get into making cartoons and things like that.  It's so many different tools.  So many different tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to see half these people.  I would kill to just see talk.  This is incredible.  I love it.  Oh my God.  This is really a great lineup.  Look at that.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lastly, yesterday was the National Voter Registration Day, raising awareness to tell  people to go vote.  I want to piggyback off of that and say, you know what?  Make sure you look at these little pamphlets that you get in the mail that talks about your  voting bills and referendums or these are propositions.  Read those things.  Those things matter.  Read them.  Read them up.  See what it matters to you and vote yay or nay because that's the big thing.  That's the stuff that's affecting you right there in your own backyard.  So I highly recommend you don't throw this in the trash when it comes in the mail.  Take the time and read it.  Some of it you're not going to care about, but it can possibly affect your day to day  a lot quicker than voting for the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed.  Vote up the ticket, not down.  Do what Ant says.  Yep.  Start at the bottom and work your way up.  That's the way to vote because everybody goes to vote for the president, but they leave out  a lot of the other stuff and it's all important.  Corey Doctorow tweeted about a, this is just like really wild, a small race, the race in  Texas for railroad commissioner.  And he said, you know what, you might think that this doesn't matter, but these are the  people, the railroad commission is who approves, I don't know if I can find it.  So don't, you don't need to show my, I'll tell you if I get it.  But maybe I can find it.  Texas railroad commission are the people who approve one particular  thing that could make a big difference in climate change.  A lot of oil wells in Texas, we've seen it have flares as they burn off the natural gas,  which is a production of pumping the oil.  They could capture it and resell it, but it's not worth it.  So they just burn it and it's a huge source of air pollution and it's permitted in Texas.  And it's the railroad commission of Texas determines if this is okay.  They need one more vote to prevent flares.  So I actually donated to the campaign.  Yes, it's a huge amount.  And I think Cory Doctorow, if he tweeted it, I should find it so we can put it in the  show notes.  But if you, if you go to twitter.com slash is it Cory Doctorow?  Is that his, I can't remember what his Twitter handle is.  I'll look for it.  Shoot, I don't remember either.  I think it may be just Doctorow.  Yeah, it's just Doctorow.  Yeah.  If you scroll through, you might be able to find it.  It's actually great.  He's a great guy to follow because he tweets a lot of weird old stuff, like a 1969 Disneyland  coloring book next to the Gorgon portrait for the Haunted Mansion.  Anyway, and there's a Calvin and Hobbes.  And he's flat out brilliant.  Yeah, I love Cory.  We're going to get him back.  He's going to be back on Twitter in a few weeks.  The two smartest people I know, with the exception of those in the room, of course,  Amy Webb and Cory Doctorow are going to do our Halloween  Twitter on October 18th.  And I think Carson has persuaded them to all be wearing costumes.  So it'll be a costume.  As only he does.  Carsten, Carsten, Carsten.  Yeah, October 18th.  And I purchased a costume for the purpose.  So I will also be in costume.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  Excellent advice from Ant.  Read your ballot.  Be prepared.  Mark it up.  Bring it in or get an absentee ballot and vote by mail.  But however you do it, November 3rd is going to be a big day.  Mike Elgin, gastronomad.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And everybody's invited.  We do amazing things.  But check out the website.  Leo, can I just quickly plug Chatterbox because I think it's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin's incredible project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, my son, Kevin Elgin, is an entrepreneur who has what I think is a brilliant product.  Like a smart speaker, like an Amazon Echo.  And it's for nine years old and up.  So adults can do it as well.  But you build it yourself.  Then you program it yourself using a very simple visual interface,  learning concepts about APIs and so on.  No, this is not it.  What is the website?  Hellochatterbox.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  I had the wrong site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You build it yourself.  You program it yourself.  You use APIs.  It can do everything that an Amazon Echo can do and a lot more.  So it's more powerful than an Amazon Echo.  It's super private.  It doesn't listen until you push the button, which is by design.  It's just a fantastic product that teaches you or kids about how smart speakers work,  about how voice interfaces work.  The future of the interface is going to be dominated by voice, I believe.  And so if you really want to prepare kids for the future,  you'll teach them how all that works and teach them that the voice AI systems are not  intelligent.  They're not people.  They are.  It's all determined by people.  And it's a great project during COVID-19.  He's got a discount for people who have kids who are in lockdown  because it's just endless hours of creativity.  You can build things.  You can turn on the lights.  You can figure out how to do all these different things.  You can send text.  You can hear music.  You can do all the things that a smart speaker can do,  but it doesn't do a single thing unless you teach it to do that thing.  So it's just a lot of time exploring and learning how language works and all that kind of stuff.  So it's a wonderful project, nine years old and up,  and I recommend everybody get one whether you have a kid or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's Kevin working on his little chatterbox with his chatterbox friends.  And also a great little picture of him.  All the founders' pictures are hysterical because they're kids,  which is their kid pictures.  So highly recommended.  This is a great way to teach kids how to think, solve problems,  and a little bit about the future of technology in there too.  Hellochatterbox.com.  So glad to help promote that.  And right now, they have a 10% discount on the site,  so definitely take advantage of it.  Thank you, Mike.  We'll see you soon, I hope, perhaps in Provence.  Who knows?  Jeff Jarvis.  Good to see you, Mike.  It's always great to see you too, Mike and Jeff.  Good to see you too, Leo.  Jeff, you see me every week.  You couldn't care less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Gutenberg.  The book is Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it going to be a big scholarly tome or a book for the rest of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, scholarly you can't attribute to me, but it'll have a lot of footnotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am still blown away with the amount of research and reading you do every single day.  It's kind of mind-boggling.  It's very impressive.  Very, very impressive.  If you're lucky enough to study under Jeff at CUNY's graduate school of  entrepreneurial journalism, you're learning.  You're learning.  Of course, the fabulous Ant Pruitt, always a pleasure, Ant.  Hands-on photography, hands-on wellness.  As somebody in the chat room said, Ant's going to be running Twitch someday.  I look forward to that day.
