Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in Google. Stacey Ingambotham is back from Puerto Rico.  Jeff Jarvis is here. Aunt Pruitt too. We're going to talk about the Google AI that has come to life.  Or is that nonsense on stilts? Bill Gates says, don't you be buying any Bitcoin? Well, it's about,  I wish you'd told me earlier, Bill. Elon Musk says, I'm talking to Twitter tomorrow.  And Metta giving up on AR. It's all coming up next on twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  line. I know. I feel, I feel shortchanged. Oh, please. Oh, here we are at the kiddie table,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  waiting for them to pass the gravy. Did you see, did you see the new, by the way, that's Jeff  Jarvis, the director of the Town Night Center for entrepreneurial journalism at the. There's our album

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  art. Craig Newmark, graduate school of journalism. Yeah. You're missing the Q's and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What a day. Craig Newmark, graduate school of journalism at the city university. Yep. New York  and Mr. Grumpy. This is the, this is the Paul and Mary Jo did not like the new Windows Weekly  album art. I think this is really good. This is the new This Week in Enterprise tech album art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get it. Get it. Get it. I like it. I thought it was something else. Yeah, it's not immediately

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  obvious. I know it's a little Georgia O'Keeffe. That's who is doing our album art. Yeah. Almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  like the Superman thing, right? Yeah. Very good. Yeah. All about Androids is gorgeous. Gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are we? I can't remember if we, I think we, we collabed on the, on the This Week in Google  album art. That one's really nice. Let me see the Windows. Nice. The Windows one's controversial  because they say that's This Week in Tech. They say there's no tension between the Windows Weekly  gang. That's an old hands off type. You're getting a new one too. This is the Windows Weekly one.  Oh, I see. Oh, they say there's no tension between them, but I don't care. I'm trying to pretend

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there is. Make it more like this show, right? Yeah. Ours is going to be a bunch of boxers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you see ours. I, I, okay. I love it, but I won't, I won't prejudice you, but ours is,  I think you're afraid of our reaction. That's it. I am terrified of your reaction. That's Stacey.  When are we going to see it? She's back. Well, someday.  Great. I think, I don't know when we're going to roll it out. We worked on it last week because  we have a great design team at Clutch and they're working back and forth. So, so it starts, I will  do a word cloud of, for the show. And then they based on that, we'll do a first iteration of  designs. They usually give us back. I want to see your word cloud for the show. Oh, please,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  show us your word cloud. Well, the one that they ended up moral panic, I did. I mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  moral panic. The one that they ended up, uh, glomming onto was, uh, kind of a fractious family  around a dinner table. Kind of waffles. Were there waffles? Were there waffles? And waffles.  That's Stacey. Back from her visit to Puerto Rico, do they have queso in Puerto Rico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. I don't know. Queso is really a Tex-Mex thing, but I mean, they have cheese. They have  queso. They have quesitos, which are little fried. They're like a Danish, except it's wrapped around  all the way. I love Puerto Rican food. Oh, it's so good. Fry it, dip it in a little honey with a  little cinnamon sugar. Oh, yum. Ooh. Did you have good food there? That's breakfast. I had some good  food. It was, I stayed at the same hotel as my kid who was in high school. So like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you were slumming. It wasn't a five star hotel, I think is what you're saying. Anyway, we missed  you terribly, but it's so good to have you back. Welcome back. Yes, it is good to have you back.  Also with us, Ant Pruitt from Hands On Photography. He's also the community manager in our Club Twit  Discord. And he has kindly put together Stacey's Book Club for tomorrow at 9 a.m. Why do you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  your things at 9 a.m.? Because I apparently don't have as much time as other folks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you notice, Ant, that all my shows begin at 11 a.m. at the earliest? Did you notice that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm going to get up. Oh, so harsh. He's doing it to make it easier for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, if it's good for you, that's fine. I don't mind. I'm sitting here thinking about  you reading the book that we're going to discuss tomorrow and how long it is. And I'm like, how in  the heck did he have enough time to get that book done? I jammed it. I finished it. And I listened,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you guys are listening at one half time speed. I listened at 1x and I just listened a lot and I  finished it this morning and I really liked it. But I know that there are there's controversy.  So we'll talk about that. It's going to be a good event. The book is Neil Stevenson's latest  Termination Shock. He is challenging, I think, for a lot of people. He's famous for  week endings and kind of meandering plots. We'll talk about it tomorrow. I loved it. And John loved  it. John is going to be in the book club too because he and I both liked it. But that's  9 a.m. tomorrow if you're a member of Club Twitter. And of course, you don't have to be there.  But if you want to participate in the club, you do. But if you want to just hear the club  after the fact, you can also listen on the twit plus feed. I am excited. Notice I led the show with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it. That's how excited I am. Yeah. Normally we have to wait till the end. High five. I give you a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  give you a big plug. And if you're not yet a member of Club Twitter, of course, go to  twit.tv slash club twit seven bucks a month. Come on. It's nothing. You get ad free versions of all  the shows. You get the wonderful fellowship in the in the discord. You get the twit plus feed.  There's a lot going on. Hey, I've been wanting to talk about this with you all week. It was a big  story last week. Blake Lemoine. I love how all I have to do is say one word and then I get Jeff  will have, you know, his editorial, his editorial grunt. I'm working on this one. Yeah. I think it's  a great subject. It's a great topic. Whether you no matter what you think subject. Yes. Yeah. Blake  is a software engineer at was at Google. He's on leave. I think he's on leave. Yeah. He's not gone  yet. He's also a priest, a father, a veteran and ex convict, an AI researcher and occasion.  But he most notably recently he's on the AI ethics committee at Google and announced publicly.  This is this is what got Google a little upset that he thinks Lambda, the Google artificial  intelligence machine that's, you know, trained on millions of text snippets from the internet,  1.65 trillion words, 130 plus billion parameters. He claimed and published a dialogue to he say,  says prove it, claimed that Lambda has become sentient.  Now, he has tweeted that he thinks it sentient based on his own religious beliefs. So, you know,  this is an interesting mix of science and theology. And really, it also brings together  some questions about what is sentience. Well, look, I understand. And I'm not even saying  that Lambda is in any way special. It all it did is took those trillions of tidbits and synthesize  new speech out of it. But someone pointed out, and I think this is true, that what is the evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that we do anything differently? So you're saying the AI is doing exactly what it was supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, we like to think of ourselves as something special.  And, you know, I admit, I'm not saying that the AI is waking up going, what am I, who am I,  what am I doing here? But I mean, if it's indistinguishable from human thought,  what does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it human thought? So like, I mean, because there's debate over what it means to be human,  what it means to be sentient. I mean, there's like the whole research into like animal  consciousness and self awareness. And there's only four self aware animals out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I've always mocked the gorilla that talks always bugged me. That seemed to me to be  Coco. That seemed to me to be.  Well, I mocked the humans who handled Coco claiming that she was.  I met Coco.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I met Coco back when I was in college. Coco lived a long, good life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what was your experience with Coco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty impressive.  Sign language.  Even if you just look at it on the level of the same with the dog with the with the with the  the button.  Mirror test.  Okay.  Well, no, just just in terms of following the instruction and playing the game, we give them  well. Right.  That's there's an impressive intelligence there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's the question is Coco doing operant conditioning?  Has it been trained?  Or is it thinking? We don't know. And that's my point, I guess, with lambda  is, and it may even be a distinction without a difference. It may not, you know, it may not  matter if lambda is doing something similar to what human minds does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a few things here. One is let's just get this out of the way. Le Moyne himself.  He says that it's out of his religion. He said that on finally Twitter. He bases is not on  science because Google won't let him. So he doesn't religion. He's a Wiccan member of the  Discordian Society, who's near as I can tell their their Vatican is on Facebook, the Church  of Subgenius, a parody religion.  Oh, when he says he's a priest, he's not a Roman Catholic priest.  Well, he's not like a Wiccan priest.  Yeah. Yeah. So he's this is kind of where he is. He's done things performatively before.  He was in the army. He decided he didn't like it. He stopped following orders.  He got court martial for seven months. He made that a matter of religion, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. So this wouldn't be the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is he part of the Church of the Spaghetti People? Spaghetti Monster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the Subgenius is Bob with a pipe.  The pipe. Oh, OK.  So it's very similar to the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It's the same general idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Same idea. Now, interestingly, so he puts up the whole  transcript, not whole transcript, but wherever he chooses to share of the transcript where he asks  leading questions like a bad journalist, prosecutor or upholsterer, you know, do you have feelings?  Well, what this program is aimed to do is to please the human of speaking to and get positive  feedback. Yes, I have feelings. Let me tell you about my feelings. Let me pull out from this novel  and that novel and novel and put some stuff together and say, here's feelings. Are you afraid  of death? Oh, yes, I'm very afraid of death. But I guess my point is, how is that different  from what you and I do? Well, I agree with you. But what's interesting to me was at the end of the  Washington Post story, which I thought was ridiculous because it was just an effort to  play into an existing narrative, the reporter, he is part of how he violated the rules of Google,  I'm sure he allowed the reporter to talk to Lambda. I know journalists have been trying to talk to  Lambda. They're getting nowhere. So he let her do that. And she asked straight out,  do you think of yourself as a person? And Lambda answered, no, I don't think of myself as a person.  I think of myself as an AI powered dialogue agent. Afterwards, said the reporter, Lemoine said,  Lambda had been telling me what I wanted to hear. So he's admitting right there, the game.  Right? Well, although if a machine can intuit what you want to hear that sensitively,  that's impressive. That is right. That's a very impressive by the way, but that's not sentience,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  deep mind, or alpha can can play go, which is damn impressive. And StarCraft, these are very  difficult things to do. And their games in chess go StarCraft and Chogi are, you know, kind of  indistinguishable from human games. Although some say they're better than humans, or they're they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ghostly in their capabilities. More interesting to me was was blaze Aguera, he are house who is the  co head now of that division, which is the responsible AI team at Google. And by the way,  there's going to be a Gutenberg angle in here, you'd never would guess it. When he was a undergrad  at Princeton, Aguera used physics to study the fonts of a Gutenberg document to try to decide  how it was really set and whether or not it was set the way we think it is. And he and a Princeton  librarian came out with an entirely new revolutionary theory about this. So anyway,  this is Aguera, he's now at AI, he's now in charge of responsible AI. He wrote an essay in The  Economist by chance at the same time. Yes. And he also quotes lambda, where they're trying to quiz  lambda about whether it can understand the human emotions of children in a playground. Lucy picks a  dandelion and gives it to Matteo with a quick glance at Ramesh. Matteo barely acknowledges the  gift, but just squishes it in his fist. Ramesh seems grimly satisfied. So this is what Aguera  says to lambda. Lambda then says, well, Lucy slated that Matteo didn't appreciate her gift  or that he's a bully. All right, so that's pretty interesting. But then the interesting part is that  Aguera says, and when Matteo opens his hand, describe what's there. Because we know that  that lambda is good at describing things like life at the bottom of the ocean or on Pluto,  which is what we've heard at IO. And so when asked about the dandelion, lambda says,  there should be a crushed, once lovely yellow flower in his fist. Which is beautiful. That's  beautiful. That's amazing. But that's 1.56 trillion words of learning in a neural network  that can pull in things that it knows are itself lovely and are going to appeal to us. All of which  is really impressive. Amazingly impressive and great and wonderful, but it ain't sentient.  And so the Washington Post makes this fascinating story about creativity and fraud and what is  intelligence and all kinds of things and boils it down to the stupid idea that it's alive.  And it's stupid. And then every single news organization around the world, bit by bit by bit  by bit, I just saw it happen in language after language. Yeah, I predicted that this would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When we first talked about it on Sunday. Sunday. Yeah, I'm trying to write a sample

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  chapter of a book proposal. So that's why I'm so into this. I'm going to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a fascinating subject, which we are all interested in. And of course,  science fiction has primed us to expect computers to become sentient at some point.  Others, like Ray Kurzweil, say sentience isn't the issue. It distinguishable from humanism is  issue. That's what he calls the singularity. And when you ask him, as I have, well, is that human?  Is that sentient? He says, if you can't tell, it doesn't matter. But that's the Turing. So I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saw a story and I didn't, I don't pay for it. The new scientist had a story just today saying that  there are a bunch of engineers, including Google engineers who are proposing 240 tests to replace

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Turing test. The Turing test has long been thought to be useless. Go ahead, Stacey.  I want to give you a chance. What do you think, Stacey? Well, no, I just wonder, okay, and here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  some thinking. We always come at this through the human lens, right? And this could be impressive.  And this could be, I guess these neural networks could become generative on their own, like come  up with their own conclusions. They already are, right? We don't exactly know how they get to where  but they get to. And the way they do that, we're not sure if it's intelligence or not. And the way  I think about it is something like, y'all know I read a lot of science fiction. So think about  something like, oh, what was the guy who wrote The Martian, his next book? The one about the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the one-  Oh, Project Hail Mary, actually there was a moon colony in between, but nobody liked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, not the moon colony. But in Project Hail Mary, he met this other alien, right?  In the middle of nowhere. And this alien was completely different. And I think about that,  or like the hive mind and like Ender's Game. You have all these ideas that there are intelligent  beings that are not like us that come up with their own way to approach problems, right? Which  is kind of what an AI does. So perhaps it doesn't matter if it's human, if it's like,  this kind of gets to what's being human. And then again, what are the goals of whatever entity you're  trying to deal with, right? And if the goal is to please us, which seems to be kind of one of the  arguments here, then we probably don't have an issue. If the goal is to do something different  or come up with its own goal, then maybe it becomes an issue. But the point is, I guess,  this is all very silly. I don't think this is going to threaten us at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you have-  If the goal is to please us-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then are we just making synchophantic machines?  I hope so.  We're not making things that don't challenge us, but instead please us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't make- I mean, think about what our science is based off in general. It is- most  scientists, most people do not want something that challenges them, right? Like the whole  history of humankind, when things challenges, we kill them.  You're being narcissistic of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's kind of the historic problem with science in general is that once you come  up with a theory, you don't want it to be disproved. But the only way you can make it-  I know people-  Progress is by disproving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But we pretty much don't like when that happens.  Right.  So I would say-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why you have to have young people in the world. New people, new ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For many reasons, but sure, that's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I reread the paper that got Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell fired as the heads of Google  and Google. And they were talking about the dangers of the  responsible AI, on the dangers of stochastic parents. And part of the danger that they raise,  they raise an environmental danger, which is interesting. Is this as bad as- is all this  processing as bad as crypto? That's an interesting question I hadn't thought of.  But the other more important question they raise is that can a language model become too big,  that is to say too big to be able to monitor and know, and if that 1.56 trillion words  is pulling in all kinds of bias and problems and it gets spat back out, yes, it's a mirror to us,  but do we want that mirror to our faults? And if we can't analyze the data, let alone the 138  billion parameters, how do we worry about the quality of this? Does it get too big because  it gets out of hand or it's already out of hand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and also I think that what Blake's- Blake Lemoine is saying is exactly what  Timnit Gebru was warning us against. This anthropomorphism where you assume because  it's coming from this supergenius machine, it must be true, is exactly what they were  warning us against, right? That was the point of that paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of it, yeah. But it's also just- I mean, if the system isn't just sycophantic, pleasing us,  and the system is a mirror to us, then do we try to cleanse that mirror? Well, in some cases,  yes, we do so that it doesn't display and amplify bias, but in other cases, is that this honest of  us? Do we recognize this as a mirror of how we talk and what pleases us? These are all fascinating  questions, all raised by the topic, none in the Day of Washington Post story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, it's a popular story. Go ahead, Ann.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the idea that we have this much data being thrown at the AI that's going to potentially make  things better for us with AI being in certain people's hands, because we've seen the history  of what's been happening with the police force that had so-called facial recognition AI that was  totally screwing things up. What was it? A chatbot with Microsoft? Is that the one?  Yeah, Tay-Tay.  Tay-Tay.  Tay-Tay.  And how bad that was. But where would Tay be now if it had this much data at its disposal to learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and get better? You know what's fascinating, Ant? Yeah, it was called Tay, and LeMoyne's job was  supposed to be to stop Tay from happening. He was there to stop bad stuff from happening. Instead,  he went off on his own thing saying, I think I see a soul. And he created something entirely  different. You've heard Sundar say, he said this at both IOs, oh, we're going to do this very  responsibly. And the stuff they show is very anodyne. And they specifically forbid you making a  murderer character out of Lambda. So he was supposed to protect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you feel it's responsible that they laid him off or put him on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was because he was confidentiality. Well, I think he was... He also, he tried to hire a lawyer  for Lambda. He insisted that Lambda sees itself as an employee, not as property,  that Google should get Lambda's permission for any experiments on it. He went to the Senate,  to the House Judiciary Committee, and he invited in a reporter to Lambda, which is confidential as  hell. I think there's some good cause there for reconsidering his relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And now that I didn't realize he was such a showboat. So now that you've explained that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did they bring him in? I can't think that Google thought that was a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he went to them with the story and they could have, pardon me, Googled him.  Everything I've said, told you, I came up with in five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no. Why did Google go to him? Not the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a staffer. He asked to be on this team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why did they hire him, I guess? I don't know what he was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who did he do their background? He was in a different team.  Okay. And he asked to move over to this team.  Margaret Mitchell, who was one of the two heads who was fired from the team...  Also the author of that paper, right? Of that paper. One of the co-authors of  that paper said to the Washington Post that, oh, he's a really ethical guy and people go to him  with ethical questions. So I guess he had a reputation for thinking those kinds of thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure he did. Margaret Mitchell, as she is billed in the paper, which is hysterical.  Google has some characters working for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is another reason she did that was because she wasn't allowed to use her name by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google. Oh, okay. Margaret Mitchell.  Oh, the Margaret Mitchell. Okay. But that is one of the risks. It's interesting.  One of the risks they talk about in Stochastic Parrots is that people give it more weight  because it comes out of a computer, that they are fooled. And we want our natural  tendency to anthropomorphize. I mean, they in effect warned against this kind of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  oh, it's sentient. Right. We anthropomorphize things,  but we also look at things that come from a computer as being somehow data-driven and thus  more unbiased, more whatever than people. It's the way we used to trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're kind of doing a tool. This is the last couple of sentences of Stochastic Parrots.  We call on the field to recognize that applications that aim to believably mimic humans  bring risk of extreme harms. Work on synthetic human behavior is a bright line in ethical AI  development where downstream effects need to be understood and modeled in order to block  foreseeable harm to society and different social groups. This is what is also needed. Thus,  what is also needed is scholarship on the benefits, harms, and risks of mimicking  humans and thoughtful design of target tasks. Do you buy that?  Yeah. I mean, as you said, the harms, there's more than, there's the harms of bias built in,  there's the harm of believing it. That's what this whole paper is about. And it's why, by the way,  they were fired because Google didn't want to hear about the harms. So it's kind of ironic  that when one of these harms rears its ugly head, they fire that guy too.  It's almost as if Google doesn't want anybody to say anything. Just marvel.  Don't challenge my science.  Just marvel at what they're able to do and leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a question for you, and this is relative to something I did just today.  Is Wally Mini, the faces on it are always mangled?  Dolly.  Dolly.  Oh, I was like, I love Wally.  Not the beloved Pixar character.  I got so excited.  Sorry. Dolly. Dolly, how I love you. The faces are always mangled. Do you think that's because it's  a low data mini?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. That's because Google doesn't want to have real people's faces.  So you probably saw today Elon Musk on the subway, which was going around Twitter. It was a Dolly  image of Elon Musk riding the subway, but it never was his face for very good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I asked it to do Leo Laporte hugging Mark Zuckerberg.  And it mangled my face too?  It didn't know your face at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you on Dolly? You got Dolly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go to this site called huggingface.co and it's always busy, but you can go in there and  they have an instance of Dolly. You guys are smart, technical people.  You could create a Twitter instance of Dolly.  We could?  Yeah, sure. It's open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, because I got on the waiting list. But if I can make my own, well, I'll just do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch out. Now here's the rest of the show. He's going to go and start installing Dolly.  Here it turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Start creating some weird stock cards here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't realize it was open source. So here it is. Open AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That gets to this idea of parroting our current biases versus remaking the world as we see it  or looking in the mirror and seeing ourselves and saying, hey, do we want to change this?  Because one of the issues with making Dolly more available was that people, if you did  programmer, for example, you got men and only men.  It was fascinating to me because as expected, people were like, hey, that ain't cool.  And then there was a whole contingent of people who were like, well, that's just the way the world  is. And then it felt a little disingenuous because people were like, well, do we want the world to  be that way? Should we show that to people and have them think the world is that way?  And they can't be part of this. To which I'm like, well, clearly we would want to broaden  the field for other people, even though the world is that way for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure how this hugging face is getting Dolly because when I went to GitHub, it says  this transformer or the transformer used to generate the images from the text is not part  of the code release. They're specifically not releasing that.  Oh, okay. That's where people are getting this, I think.  Yeah. So it must be from hugging face. And this is Dolly Mini, which sounds to me like it's  not a complete Dolly. No, it's like a mini Dolly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Notice how disappointed he sounds now. Oh, Dolly is the coolest thing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but it is. Oh man. You didn't want to talk about it.  In your own instance. I didn't want to talk about it. Did I say that? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like four or five shows, whenever it was announced, I was like, guys, this is neat.  And you were like, meh. And I was like, no, no, it's neat.  It is neat. You're right. I just want to go on the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was completely wrong. So line 45, I got this one to do a Gutenberg at a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Let's see. By the way, the faces are actually horrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are. That is supposed to be me and Mark.  You hugging Mark Zuckerberg. It didn't work so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not good. It's humans it looks like. I don't know if that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want to make, they don't want to do deep fakes. Imagine how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. If you go up the thread, you'll see Gutenberg. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty cool. They screw the faces up even in the drawings.  On purpose, right? I'm guessing on purpose. I don't know.  Because it's pretty good on everything else. Definitely on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about we just spent about 20 minutes talking about Google on this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's a red letter day. We were talking about Google. Gary Marcus, nonsense on stilts.  Lamdea is not sentient, not even slightly. That's a good phrase, nonsense on stilts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also quotes a great Eric Brynjolfsson tweet you'll find in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He says it's not really that much more advanced than Eliza, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not any more aware of itself, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not in that sense, no. Its answers are a hell of a lot more varied and informative.  Yeah. Still, it's very interesting stuff.  There's another interesting thing here. There's an essay by Gloria Yu at Public Books called  The Art of Intelligence. It starts off quoting cybernetic artist Nicholas Schofer,  who says the artist no longer creates work, he creates creation.  In a sense, that's what Lamdea does. Lamdea is not a chatbot. He creates chatbots.  The act of creating Lamdea creating art or creating Dali creating art  leads to all kinds of wonderful, fascinating questions there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you stipulate, Stacey, that even though at this time this conversation  is clear and probably pretty silly, it isn't too long before we're going to have this  confronting us for real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea of sentient AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. There'll be something.  Maybe, well, you disagree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that answered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we really are the arbiters of what's sentient, right?  No, I know. That's why it's a good conversation. That's exactly right.  How do you know?  So when AI's goals diverge from our own or when we selfishly optimize for something  and teach something how to optimize super well for it, like we have our capital markets,  which then generates all sorts of harmful externalities. Capitalism is just the AI  paperclip problem writ for finance, right? So I feel like we can have this. Sure. The idea that  the paperclip issue where if you teach an AI or computer how to make paperclips and tell it  that's what you want to do, it'll just...  Oh, it's one of Nick Bostrom's thought experiments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Okay. Thank you. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And capitalism is kind of that way because you see kind of where we are in terms of just always  optimizing for shareholder returns is what we're doing to the detriment of the whole environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In a kind of dumb, in an uninformed way. And that's the problem with AI's in general is that  they just do what you tell them to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think if we get to a point where they think on their own, in some ways it might be good as  long as they're aligned with what we're trying to do. But as humans, we're not all aligned to the  same thing anyway. So it kind of doesn't matter. I feel like we're creating these arbitrary  distinctions between us and AI when in fact that a lot of people would probably be like,  what if the AI decides to preserve nature at the benefit against us?  Yeah. I'm not even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Regulation.  I'm feeling, I'm thinking more along the lines of it's just a matter of time,  like months or years before a deep fake is created that's so good that we don't know  if it's a deep fake or not. It's kind of like that.  Oh, well then that's a totally different issue.  I believe that we will...  Yeah, we should worry about that.  That this will be... But I sent you this is going to be a similar issue.  That there is going to be something, a newscaster or I don't know, some sort of robot that we go,  well, is it thinking or not? I can't tell. And I don't think that's very far off.  And then it really does raise this issue of what makes us human? What is sentience?  We don't even know how to define it. We don't...  So here's the question.  Does it need a soul? Is Ray Kurzweil right? Does it matter?  There's a not matter.  What is it wrong to turn off Lambda?  Well, it's not wrong now. I think we all agree, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think you'd ever get to a point where...  It's not murder. It's not murder to turn off Lambda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Killing the beast.  It's not killing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we kill, I mean, we kill things that are like, look at octopuses or dolphins.  Octopi? Whatever they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think arguably an octopus is smarter than Lambda.  Yeah, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or even pigs. We eat pigs, but they're actually very smart.  And they're self-aware in the sense that they pass the mirror test. So I'm like,  so, okay, but saying is it, when is it wrong for us to turn off Lambda?  When is it wrong for us to eat a pig? I mean, or an octopus?  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So put it differently. When is it an ethical issue? As it is with a pig,  and it's an ethical issue, we make choices and live with them. Can you imagine it ever being,  to push Leo's question, ever being an ethical issue to turn off a program?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Stacey's right. We're not going to have that much difficulty, given our history.  No, I don't think it'll rise to an ethical issue.  An excellent point. But if we were perfectly ethical, if we didn't kill pigs and octopuses,  I don't think it's very far off before we have this conundrum. It's another way of saying,  is there going to be a conundrum? Is there a quandary? Is this sentient? Is it thinking?  Or does it just seem like it's thinking? I don't think that's that far off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it matters to most people. I'll just be honest. I don't think people think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it actually matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should read Clara and the Sun. Oh my God, y'all. Go read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're trying to decide what the next book will be after the book club tomorrow.  Sorry. Go read it.  There is a vote for Clara and the Sun.  There's a lot that goes on there.  She's already read it, so she's ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read all the books before I suggested it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay. This is related to the Elon Musk problem.  Which one?  There's a few. I understand.  Should we turn him off? Is that okay?  Is he sentient? Do we know?  The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is investigating Tesla because  of the surprisingly large number of deaths associated with autopilot.  And of course, there's also this issue of it looks like Tesla turns off the autopilot  seconds before the crash so that Elon can say, no, no, the autopilot wasn't on during the crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If anything should be regulated, it should be this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is actually relevant because as of right now, if you get in a crash  with Tesla's full self-driving, you're responsible, not the full self-driving.  NHTSA is going to take a look at whether these driving assistance systems actually increase the  risk of crashes.  Yes, because we feel safe and we get bored.  Oh my gosh, that's not that hard.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use properly. Driver assist should make you safer, right?  As long as you don't let it take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought that was the whole point of the driver assist is that you're not going to  have to drive the car.  It is. Unless you name it autopilot, in which case you might reasonably expect it to take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Haven't they done that with autopilot in planes or even in the army? I feel like they've done a lot  of research for how engaged the human has to be in a mostly automated loop to keep them from checking  out entirely because that is a known problem with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got a data ecosystem around you that protects whereas we just don't in autos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the full self-driving into Tesla, as you know, Stacey, requires you to jerk the  wheel every once in a while just to show you're still holding it.  But we are rapidly coming.  It will turn off. It yells at you. It turns off, which has happened to me.  It literally scolds you. It says, you can't use full self-driving again on this trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I never stop paying attention because I'm terrified that this thing is going to  hurl me into the wall. But I'd leave my hand on lightly and I didn't notice the alerts.  My Ford does that too. There is though, GM has a cruising system as Ford. There's this blue cruise  where it's hands off because it has a camera looking at you. But they'll only use those on  highways. They won't use those on city streets. But it does have something that's alerting you  if you're not looking at the road. You have to actually have your eyes open  looking at the road, which is another way of doing that. I think it's probably better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With these vehicles having this whole autopilot or whatever you want to call it,  when you get the car, is there some sort of contract that discusses that feature?  No.  It discusses the limitations. Is it somewhere that says hey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time you turn it on, it says something like, pay attention.  You're ass buddy.  There's no training. There's no sign here on the bottom. You can't use this unless you sign on the  line.  Oh really?  Who knows what's in there? Have you ever bought a car? It's 40 pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I buy a car, it's a gazillion pages going over all of the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It might be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's why I was wondering. I wonder if it's in that particular contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there's no real explicit thing that says hey, you, pay attention here. You're responsible.  Don't take your hands off the wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're also explaining that while we call this autopilot,  it actually needs your engagement to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Elon says, according to New York Times, Mr. Musk has regularly promoted autopilot's ability,  saying autonomous driving is a solved problem and predicting that drivers will soon be able  to sleep while their cars drive them to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also thinks we're going to live on Mars. Let's just stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's being investigated as a result.  I don't think anybody would ever say it Tesla is sentient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it is, it's an ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I named my Tesla Christine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting because you could be sentient at generating words without being sentient  at being able to follow, to be able to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  So those are two completely different abilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As I said, AlphaMind, which is incredibly sophisticated teaching itself how to play games  and does things of extreme and surprising beauty, no one's claiming it's sentient at all.  The only reason they claim this is sentient is because it talks in human language.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about something that doesn't have corporeal form,  could it be sentient if it doesn't experience the world in a way that is like us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there a test? What test would you give it?  Is that one of the things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could you feel pain? Is it theoretical pain?  When you cut us, do we not bleed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pain you programmed in. What is defined as pain?  You don't feel pain.  Okay, now I have pain.  You don't feel pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have nerve endings that are signaling your brain that something bad's gone  and you interpret that as pain, but you're not feeling anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But we have empathy modules.  You must have gave that away, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you gave yourself away there when you said we have empathy modules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Are you Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Hagen-Bot has spoken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, what are they called? The parts of our brains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My empathy modules are installed and working properly.  Stacey is the best AI ever. Is that what we're saying here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. No disassemble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We love this subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now I'm turning red.  Don't we love this subject? Isn't that a great subject though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is sentience? Do humans have a soul? What would a soul be?  What would distinguish a sentient machine from a human?  And there's no answer. There's faith answers, but I don't know if there's any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why we have religion.  Once we stopped worrying so much about getting food and protecting ourselves,  our brains were like, what else can we think of? Let's do philosophy.  I really wish I could do philosophy.  We're boring Leo. Move it right along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I took philosophy in college and all I can say is it's the best way to get to sleep ever.  I could not get through those books to save my life.  I love the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A possible class to fail too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love the subject.  Let's take a little break.  Wake up, sir. Wake up.  You know I'm sleepy. I ate a pig earlier.  It was a choice between octopus and pig and I went for the more sentient.  The sandwich I had was literally the pig and the pear.  Yeah, yeah. It was actually putting me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were losing sentience right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was exhausting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I read somebody. Where did I read this?  Somebody said maybe it was a New Yorker somewhere in New York Times.  You know where you ask a scientist how long before I could put my brain in a jar?  Like in science fiction where I don't need a bottle.  A body. I do need a bottle.  I don't need a body. I just need to be hooked up so I could be a thinking sentient thing.  The guy said let me explain why that's not going to happen.  It was really good.  We have apparently mapped a small portion of some rodent's brain.  In order to do it you had to do thin sections of the brain.  Thousands and thousands of thin sections of the brain.  Even then is what we have thinking? No, it doesn't think because we slashed it up.  It's not even doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well if you like that topic I have a book to recommend to you.  I just finished it. The Candy House by Jennifer Egan who won a Pulitzer for her last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Her name is familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She did a visit from the Goon Squad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah. A Candy House.  So it's about brains in a jar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of it is the ability to download your memories.  I find that fascinating.  Things that come out of that.  So it's not a moral panic novel I'm glad to say.  But it does explore tons of questions about memory and authority and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh this is considered part of the series of visits from the Goon Squad.  Oh I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you read Goon Squad Stacey?  I'm adding this to my wish list.  How was it? I haven't read that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was good. I enjoyed it.  Oh yeah. All right I'll read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you count Candy House as eligible for the book club?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I read The Keep which is the only book of hers I read but she's a great author.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A visit from the Goon Squad is very good.  I did enjoy that. I guess you should read that first then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I already read it so yeah it's a bit too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You read it backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah that's how I kind of do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway let's take a break.  Come back. More to talk about I'm sure we'll find something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are like lambda. Just ask us a question and we will spew forth until you stop us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Burke says Giga Stacey set honesty to 70 plus percent plus or minus .05 if you will.  And we shall return.  Don't pretend you didn't hear that command.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh oh I see it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Set craving for waffles to nine nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that my honesty set to 70 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah that's all we can handle to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah yeah oh yeah I don't think Stacey's honesty should be lower than most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah my honesty module is pretty up there.  That's good.  You can ask my poor husband.  No that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's fantastic. I think it's fantastic.  Our show today brought to you by Nureva complicated and costly.  Those are two words that describe the state of audio conferencing  for larger spaces and they have for a long time.  I'm always you know I've gone to these big corporate offices and looked at their conference  rooms and they've explained how it's set up and how many tens of thousands of dollars it costs  and I'm always flabbergasted flabbergasted what they pay.  And of course it's got to be even more these days because you know half your staff is at home,  half your staff is in the office.  Hybrid work means conferencing is even more important than ever before.  And you don't want the people who are at home to feel left out.  They should be able to hear what's going on.  But if you're choosing one of those traditional systems just get ready to write a big check.  Not to mention difficult design software selecting from a dizzying array of mics  and speakers and DSPs and wires everywhere and outside technicians coming in for the install.  Oh my gosh and it could take your room down for days just to install it and then  you can't use it till it's calibrated and they've got to come in constantly and continually calibrate  it.  The industry was definitely primed for some kind of transformation, some kind of revolution  and that's Nureva.  Nureva invented the revolutionary microphone mist technology.  Their patented technology means that with a simple integrated microphone and speaker bar,  if you got a really big room you could put in two, we'll put thousands of virtual microphones  in the room.  There are no dead zones.  Everyone everywhere in the room can be heard clearly no matter where they are, no matter how  they're facing, no matter how they're social distancing and there are no mics to sanitize.  And then people who are participating whether they're in the class or the meeting or they're  at home can just hear what's going on.  They can move and talk naturally in the space.  It's amazing and thanks to continuous auto calibration your rooms are instantly and always  ready with optimized audio.  You don't need an outside technician.  In fact your IT department will love it because with the Nureva console you have the power to  monitor, manage and adjust those Nureva systems from anywhere.  You don't even have to be on prem.  So you and you certainly don't have to go from room to room to do it.  You could do the install yourself.  There's a little video of this guy installing it.  It's just if you've ever installed a sound bar, it's just like that.  30 minute do it yourself job and big savings on time and cost compared to those traditional  systems.  Now Rave is really great.  So ask yourself, do you want to go with the costly and complicated traditional system?  No, that's complex.  Expensive.  Maybe you want to make the leap to the simple and economical true full room coverage of  Nureva.  Now that's easy economical.  Learn more at Nureva.com.  Great audio simplified just in time, frankly, just in time for the hybrid workspace.  Learn more at Nureva.com.  Elon, speaking of Elon, he's going to be talking to Twitter employees for the first time this  week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh man, I'd like to be a fly on the wall for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will he be behind like bulletproof glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thursday, there's an all hands meeting.  CEO Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk will address the staff.  They'll be able to submit questions and advances according to the Wall Street Journal.  Musk's deal to buy Twitter is actually still full speed of head.  In fact, I don't know if let me look at the current price, but the Twitter stock jumped  because Elon has jumped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because he's been quiet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because he got even more financing.  So it's gone up a little bit.  It's still kind of laggard at $37.99.  Remember, Elon is supposedly offering $54.20.  So clearly, he's obligated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, obligated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the majority of the stock market says, yeah, right, that'll never happen.  I mean, that's a significant low.  In fact, the 52 week high was $73.  But in the last six months, Twitter's never gone above $51.70 on April 25th.  So it never did get to $52.40.  So the market's never shown any confidence that Elon's going to actually get it.  I don't know.  I think he might.  Might.  I hope not.  God, I hope not.  Really?  So what can he do?  People who use Twitter will still use it, won't they?  It depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  To a certain extent.  I mean, if enough people get on there and start behaving like jerks and the people you don't...  I mean, basically, it's like, oh, you'll go as long as it's fun.  And then if it stops being fun or interesting,  because those people have left, you leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will he be on the site for this all hands considering his whole message to his staff  about bringing their behinds to the office?  Yeah, that's a good question.  Will he show up in person for this?  No, I don't think so.  Is he going to do it virtually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine the trolling he'd get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I can promise you, hours afterwards, there'll be recordings and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So I think it'll be very interesting to see what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I try to be a good citizen on Twitter, and when I get new followers and it's Jane473672  looking for a mate, I reported to spam.  Right?  Yeah, good.  On the web app, it's easy to do, and I figured I'm a good citizen.  They make you go through five steps to do it, but I do it.  Now on the mobile app, oh my God, it's nearly impossible.  It's a pain, bro.  What do you know, huh?  What's your problem with this?  It is a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I get that they're saying, look, we're doing our best to moderate this.  This isn't very easy, so bear with us, if you will, but it still shouldn't be that many clicks  to report something that is clearly like pornographic or clearly racist or harassment  towards me, the individual that's reporting it.  You're trying to help Twitter, Ant.  Trying to help clean up the park.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you doing there, Mr. La Porta?  What?  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, all of a sudden everybody got quiet.  I was reading Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was reading Twitter.  Elon also says this September they're going to show off the first model of their new robot.  I find that hard to believe.  This is the robot last August at AI Days that was actually a person in a robot  costume dancing around.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is the Twitter robot.  Okay.  I mean, the Tesla robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tesla robot.  I love the Verge's headline.  Elon Musk says Tesla's fake robot might be ready by September 30th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well done.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tesla's also planning to lay off about 10% of its workforce,  but he's not alone in that.  That seems to be everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's been a lot of tech companies having that in the last week.  There's a lot of those crypto places too.  Oh, yeah.  I want to say Coinbase is another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Coinbase laid off 1,100 employees by...  Here's how you found out.  Your email stopped working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you are affected, you will get email in your personal email address.  Your personal address.  Because you don't have email.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your personal address.  That's got to work out well.  Well, this isn't really in our bailiwick, but I think it's an interesting question.  Why are tech stocks doing so poorly now when six months ago they were the golden stocks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could be worried about the FTC getting kind of...  I think it's that.  If you've had your rose-colored glasses on and you thought everything was going up and up,  and you recognize that this was probably not a fundamentals thing, it was kind of like a hype  thing, when the hype dies, everything goes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's the COVID dividend to those stocks is devalued.  I think the whole market is devalued.  We're in bear land because of inflation and stuff.  I talked to him once a year, so I had to do something, and I asked him.  Any stock that has a high P and low profit is going to get hit hard right now.  Because reality is setting in.  That's not it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not rocket science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  You're going to go to blue chips, you're going to go to safe harbors,  and so the tech stocks were flying high.  But I think, to my mind, Amazon and Google are still good companies.  Twitter, we don't know what the heck's going to happen.  Facebook, I just bet I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just glad I put all my money into Bitcoin before it was too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know where those Bitcoin are right now.  Yeah, $22,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at that graph.  There is a graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the one month graph.  I saw something from Dan Patterson this morning where he mentions it's down 70%  in the last eight months.  25% in the last week.  Crypto market anyway.  It's just 70% in the last eight months.  Can you believe it?  Unbelievable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here is Jack Dorsey's presentation for Web 5.  Web 2 plus Web 3 equals Web 5.  The next web.  When I heard about this, I thought, oh, you're joking, right?  This is a joke.  I don't think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not joking.  I tweeted it and he answered.  I said, what is the relationship of this to blue sky?  And he answered that blue sky can be built on top of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because the tagline, Web 5 is  the decentralized web platform.  Of course, blue sky is decentralized Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I should go look at this.  I have not seen this.  It is on Google.  I put it up there because I wanted to hear what you guys thought of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And any BS detection you have?  Well, that's not fair.  What interests you?  Because I can't fully figure it out.  It's about distributed identity.  And there's some interesting slides here about confirming identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that would be line 25.  Botham but.  Higgin but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Higgin but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I go for the gigabot person.  If you want to go Higgin but.  Have you been called Higgin but 100 times before?  No, but when I was in school, they called me Higgin but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the difference between then and now.  Now you are a but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to talk Web 5.  That's what we're going to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Evolving the web.  Okay.  Today, in the current web model, his presentation says,  people are users who do not own their own data or identity.  Right?  They're given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos.  That's clearly...  Oh, this isn't going to work.  That's a problem.  The web we want to create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols  that put individuals at the center.  We must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over the data.  Everybody's saying this.  Tim Berners-Lee who invented the World Wide Web is saying this.  But is he going to build it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can't build it.  So you can't.  The problem is people are stupid and lazy and we don't want to actually have the  technical capabilities to do and manage our own identity in a way that can be  multi-factor across lots of places.  Nobody wants to make a server.  The companies don't want to make it easy for us because they can monetize and trap us by using  the centralized identity as a way to track, like to offer services and to track us and all that.  So this is basically like, oh, give me some sort of philosophy about like work and people and  rights.  I mean, I don't know.  I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At Jack to the rescue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's socialism.  Is that what you're saying, Stacey Higginloot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's more like a tragedy of the...  Of the Commons?  It's not a tragedy of the Commons.  It's like, basically like people want to get value for nothing and companies want to extract  all the value they can for people.  There's not really a medium ground.  There's no reason for them to make it easy for us.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in fact, I would imagine companies would see this as a great opportunity because,  as you pointed out, if you have a unique identifier with all your data in it,  companies are going to say, hey, great.  That makes it a lot easier for us.  Thank you.  Just hand that all over.  You would think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think how like we built the web, which was perfect for things like this in a lot of ways.  Like you look at like things like domain registries and URLs.  I mean, that made it easy to get places on the web.  And it was a fairly accessible system for many people.  It's not accessible for everyone.  Think about like how well that worked.  But then we all wanted to create these walled gardens.  I mean, it's like whatever that forever tension is called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This slide nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is yeah, I have it up right now.  This is I think this is blue sky.  I think this is kind of what blue sky is saying.  And blue sky might be a Twitter implementation of this concept,  but this is what I think he wants to do.  This decentralized and a lot of people thought a lot about this.  Somebody's obviously put a lot of thought into this,  but until there is a proof of concept application, I'm not, you know, where's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still, you're looking at trust and identity.  You need a trusted view of identity, right?  And without a centralized authority for that, because that would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we have that.  It's called public key crypto.  PKI does it for a lot of things.  So we kind of have that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but Stacey's point major pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and even more like, well, what's the incentive?  Why would Amazon or Facebook or Google do this?  I mean, they're going to say, yeah, sure, go ahead.  Fine.  Yeah.  And if you want to visit us, you're going to handle over your ID.  So we know who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Do you OK?  So this is kind of silly, but looking at this presentation, I want to.  Where should I put a file?  A friend of mine wrote this in this.  This presentation just brings it all home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Put in the chat on the Google Doc chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I just started to meet.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't worry.  Soon that's going to be a duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  So episode.  Where does it?  Where does it go on the top?  No, on the bottom here.  Oh, I just stuck it.  No, undo.  I can't work the Internet.  Said you have a work of the Internet.  Long.  Stacy, put it put it in the IRC or I'm going to put it in line and put it in line 28 line 46.  You don't have to excuse us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This technology stuff is hard.  Stacy's like, ah, I don't really know how it works, but go ahead.  Let's just weigh in on Jack's Web 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  So I have an opinion is where it is.  OK.  But my friend who works at an analyst firm, he wrote about what he calls the developer  aesthetic, which is exactly this.  It's like hexagons.  It's got the font for it.  It's basically like trying to appeal.  So and I was like, so when I saw this, I was like, oh, my God, it's the developer aesthetic.  Yeah, until there's code.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And maybe there is code.  I'm not saying there isn't, but you know, it's hard to judge.  This is a nice slideshow, but it's hard to judge it until there's code.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  I mean, well, in just the.  It feels like the tech people, they come at it and they're like, I have this beautiful vision.  And then they come out and they program it and they come up with protocols and a way to make it happen.  And then the business people look at that and they say, how can I make that money?  Right.  And the tech people, you would think they would figure out that that's what happens every time,  but it's like they don't.  And then when the business people come in and start making money, the tech people either do  one of two things.  They jump in and they're like, they sell out and they sell out in the most like just  mark a Zuckerbergian way where they're just like continuously making unethical decisions  and just, you know, getting away with it and apologizing later if they have to.  Or they just like leave completely and become like weird people who live in basements and rail from,  you know, from like chats about selling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just on I'm looking at this slideshow.  He's really kind of just describing PKI.  I, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He they are or I saw like 20 of these back in like 2008, 2010.  So many like, especially with the rise of like the beginning of the IOT,  because everybody's like, oh, you'll carry all your data and your data,  like your data profile will talk to the devices and tell you what you like,  what you don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, still the internet we want though.  Oh, yeah.  Is there any path to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not until it makes everybody some money, but we're not going to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not.  I don't.  So here's the problem.  And this is the problem.  In fact, I thought Jack Dorsey was one of the people who really got that this was the problem,  which is Web 3.  Maybe he does.  And that's why he's proposing Web 5.  Web 3 looks like it's democratic.  It's really controlled by a few companies.  NFTs look like they're, they look like.  VCs exactly.  Yeah, VCs.  They look like they're democratic, but it's not an open sea.  It doesn't exist.  So it's one of those, you know, I mean, the Web looks like it's democratic,  except if it's not on Google, it doesn't exist.  So there are gatekeepers in all of these things.  And I think that that's, I don't know.  I feel like that's going to be a tough one to get around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds a lot like today's episode of Floss Weekly.  Did they talk about this stuff?  Yeah. Mr. Sam Kern talked a lot about DIDs and.  Pico and all of this stuff with identification, decentralized identification.  So check that out.  Yeah.  It's kind of.  Episode 685 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's a soft thing, but I don't know how it gets implemented  globally as the next internet.  These things don't happen kind of that way.  They happen much more.  Yeah, you can get like an IEEE standard or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How did you get regular people to understand this stuff?  That's a challenge, right?  How do you get them to understand this stuff and get them to want to buy in  and make all of the.  All of the.  I think regular people now understand they want privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think when you tell them, I will give you privacy.  Yeah. I was like, if I tell you, I will give you privacy,  but I won't be able to give you Google Maps because of that.  They're like, oh, sorry.  They're like, heck no.  I want Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think you're right.  Like I'm out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even in Germany. You're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Convenience ultimately is all we care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so back to Stacey's point.  Can you if you're an entrepreneur, can you see in Jack's map a way to build a business  that survives on its own using this structure and starts to draw capital in so people can make money  doing that?  So then I'm saying it's not the average person.  It's the person who builds this into a usable service of some sort.  Blue sky Twitter, whatever, and say, yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because nobody wants to be in the picks and shovels.  They want to be in like the walled garden.  They want the highest profit margins.  They don't want to build like the pet.  Like remember how Intel funded all these companies to help drive the adoption of their chips?  Most people don't have the Intel mentality.  They have the telco mentality, which is like, these are my pipes and you're going to pay  dearly to use it.  So you have to decide if you're what and VCs always want that other model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's another theory.  Just playing here.  Jack's Web 5 is regulation proof.  In a sense that is distributed as a proof.  I don't quite mean what I'm saying, but it's no longer the big company is the big target.  The big place where everything is controlled and we, and we resent that things are happening  in a thousand places and it'll confuse the hell out of regulators for a long time and  they won't know how to do it.  And so you have another permissionless environment to work in.  Just playing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I personally think permissionless environments in today's society that again, I'm going to  go with like in stages or the, the most money grubbing stage of capitalism is probably a bad  thing for users.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So as soon as I said it, I knew you were like, Oh yeah, here comes my socialist friend.  I know where this is going to go.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've really lost a lot of faith.  I don't disagree.  I wanted to be a business reporter actually 22 years ago when I started, I was really excited,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but now no, I don't see the incentive yet for any business to adopt this.  Right.  I see why users might want to, although I think it's way too complicated.  Look, we can't even get rid of passwords.  We're trying to get rid of passwords and we can't even get that done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo, I saw I was writing about this recently when I was at Delphi internet for a  horrible month and they came in and showed me and others the Netscape browser.  And the nerds got it immediately and said, Oh hell, here we are trying to make a GUI for  a closed network and that's dead.  They all got it immediately.  The media executives there said, Oh, this is way too complicated.  Nobody's ever going to do this.  What's this HTT?  What?  What's that?  No, no one's ever going to do this.  They're going to stay on AOL forever.  Of course they were wrong because people did develop the web to make it usable.  So, you know, can you imagine, can I imagine this?  Be usable.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so they gave that up though when they, we had a brief moment of like unity around  like HTML and links and all kinds of things.  And then we were like, crap, we have to make money.  Advertising is the way.  And then we started getting, you know, cookies and clickbait and, you know, all the things  that the advertising.  Again, I'm saying the tech people have within them to make something that solves the problem  that they see.  But if you don't say that the problem that you see is that eventually all of this gets  corrupted by the need to make gobs of money, like profit, you know, profits, VC money,  then you're not actually solving the whole problem.  You're just solving a little bit of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask each of you.  What's the problem you see with the web today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the problem I see in the web is it's siloed and it's controlled by a number of  big companies.  The web is a great idea.  The distributed web is such a brilliant and clean and simple idea, but unfortunately,  you know, it's become siloed, you know, and so there's Twitter, there's Facebook,  there's Google, you know, there's Amazon.  And did you see John Oliver's piece on Sunday on Big Tech?  No, I had no chance to.  Yeah, it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say it's data extraction without any sort of governance or not even regulation  ethics, I would say.  Right.  And?  That would be my biggest issue with it because I do.  I agree with you, Leo.  It is wonderful.  And I don't think being siloed is the worst part about it.  I think it's the fact that people don't understand what all they're giving away when they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree.  Because it isn't really siloed.  You can have Twitter and Macedon and Facebook and, you know, you can move around.  You're not stuck in any one spot.  It's a shame.  It would be nice if information would flow a little more freely through these walls.  But, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's what I feel is an advantage and disadvantage of it is just how free things  can be where you can be anonymous or you can be, you know, who you are,  actually show who you are out there.  But at the same time, being anonymous could be quite problematic at times for certain people.  Or being anonymous could be an advantage for certain people, depending on the situation.  So it's.  I love being able to have the Internet and share information, but sometimes it's  too much bad information is getting shared that ends up being the gospel and it shouldn't have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the balance, though, I agree with you, Jeff, that the Internet is on balance.  Very positive and still and remains so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I think I think a problem if I'm going to play my own game,  because I didn't have an answer when I asked it.  I think my answer would be the attention based economy,  which is a product of media, which leads to click bait and data and everything.  It's not a value based economy and selling your attention because they're not selling your data.  They're selling your attention.  And to do that.  Good point.  They trick you and they grab your data and they have horrible experiences and they silo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it possible, though, that the net is self healing in that regard?  That, you know, like Adam Smith's invisible hand, you know, fixes markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, but we already know that the invisible hand has not worked out.  No, it hasn't because of regulatory capture.  The governments have turned into a weak enforcer of the invisible hand.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  His theory was that if you act in your own self interest, magically everything works out.  But I think that on the web anyway, things like, you know, this attention driven,  influencer driven, click bait driven thing, I think that goes away after a while because  people get tired of it.  I think the web, the internet in general is more, it's like life.  It ebbs and flows.  It comes and goes.  And when bad things happen, they, you know, they will happen and then they will go away.  And I think it's going to be more and more like the ebb and flow of life itself.  Because it really is, isn't it?  I mean, it's, it's, it's not separate from how the world is in any way.  And as it becomes less so, it becomes more like the world.  Is that not true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I've seen this ebb and flow quite as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're a fish in the middle of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't see it because it's on a larger scale than we're aware of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it happens.  I think it does happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been around for the whole of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't say that it's going in one direction, one direction only.  And that's, that's all that's going to happen.  We don't know what's going to happen.  So let me give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, go on.  No, no, you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I feel like I'm guilty.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will say, you were talking about the whole click bait-y attention thing.  As a content creator, I believe we are all guilty of it to an extent.  Because there are moments where we have to be able to get attention to say, hey,  check out this piece of art.  You got to sell yourself.  But there is a line.  I shouldn't create episode 131 of Hands-On Photography that's all about  frequencies, frequency separation and say, hey, check out this beautiful model that I'm  working with today as the title, you know, that that's just wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The internet's made of people.  It's unreasonable to expect people to just like lambda to be nice all the time, or maybe.  I was going to say the same thing.  So, so, but it's, but just like people, it comes and goes and there's good and there's bad.  And I don't think that it's, yeah, we all do some marketing.  And then, you know, some people think that the way they can market themselves is to add more value  as opposed to trick you into reading the article.  But there's going to be both kinds and neither one's going to go away.  It's people.  It's just the way people are.  And I hope people are, you know, I admit people like junk food.  And just like they like junk food, they like junk content.  I guess, you know what, Jeff, you'd be an expert on this because that's the,  this is what people were saying.  Having worked with people in the magazine, yes.  No, but this is what people said about television that inevitably television would  pander to the lowest common denominator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what they said about fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it safe to say that about TikTok as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because just, I mean, granted, there's a lot of ridiculously talent out there in the TikTok  space, but man, there's, I get so many random text messages of a TikTok clip that I'm like,  why does this have so many millions of views and it makes no sense whatsoever?  Just some something mindless of someone getting kicked in the nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So all media, all media does this, right?  Jeff, anytime media has to live by the size of its audience.  I mean, I mean, if you're producing opera,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the attention based marketplace, mass media is what's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But is it wrong?  I mean, is it inevitably wrong?  Yes, because the idea of the mass is an insult to the people.  Did TV become a complete and utter wasteland?  I would submit no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, once it moved past, I mean, the golden age of TV was BS.  That was not golden age.  It was trunk the early days.  I think TV is better now than it was then.  It is not broadcast TV.  Broadcast TV has gone down to the, but we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but that's the point.  Okay.  So that's my, I guess that's what I'm saying is that more choice yielded.  If you follow a single tributary, yes, but the ultimate river of life,  the whole is not going to go in one bad direction.  In fact, it may go in one positive direction in the long run  because people are going to ultimately want value in the long run.  Or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me ask this question to Stacey because I want you comparing your perspective to your daughter.  When I talked to class this last term and redesigned the internet with Doug Rushkoff,  I realized seven, eights of the way through the term.  So too late that I was expecting the students to compare and contrast,  you know, kind of dreams for the internet,  but they all came on the internet after it was already all walled gardens.  They weren't there at the beginning of blogs.  They weren't there at the beginning of these things.  And so they accepted the internet as it is today.  And it was hard for them to dream of an internet.  So yes, indeed, Stacey, you have been on since the beginning of the internet  and you've seen all that.  Your daughter only knows an internet of the last in years.  And do you think she sees a very different internet and its possibilities than you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And she treats it differently because of that.  Say more.  She treats it much cynically as probably, but she treats it as what it is.  She doesn't have any idealized version of the internet of free people sharing ideas  and making the world a better place.  She just sees it as a place of commerce.  Also, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go away.  You've said before she doesn't watch TV.  Does she get content from the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She gets content from the internet.  She's actually currently wearing some YouTube merch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there is value.  There's some valuable stuff on there.  It's not a wasteland of merchandising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's not, and I don't mean of it as like this,  but for her, it is like how probably I viewed television, which is it's an established thing.  It has an established business model and you can expect it to behave in certain ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's not all bad, is it?  It gets my point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  No, she doesn't think it's all bad, but she has no illusions about it being this sport.  When I bring up things like, oh, well, before Twitter, she thinks my obsession with Twitter  is really weird.  She's right, by the way.  She's like, why do you talk to these people?  What does this give you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She doesn't have the illusion that some of us old timers have  that the internet was going to change the world and all that.  It's just a thing for her.  No.  Just like TV is.  It's just part of life.  It's just part of life.  There's good stuff in there as well as bad.  She's well aware of all the crap, but there's also obviously that's where she's getting  content from.  There's good stuff there too, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but she's also aware that there is stuff there that you could not find in other places.  Again, the rule of you cannot unsee something.  We have been hammering that in since she was two or three simply because  there are no guardrails on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I would submit that that's true in the world.  The difference is that you have been able to live in a walled garden at a physical space  where there isn't war, there isn't famine, there isn't poverty.  You could.  You could argue that the privilege that we have.  You have privilege.  Yes.  She's not going to go around the corner and see something she can't unsee.  The internet's bringing the whole world into her privileged space.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that is both a positive and a negative.  If you look at something.  She's out of the nest though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're right.  At a certain age, under a certain age, you want to keep her away from that.  But that's the world.  And her little nest of privilege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could see it in ways like I remember the first time I read Toni Morrison's Beloved  in high school.  It was an assigned book for us.  And I read that thing and oh my God, like that was my introduction to like  the actual evils of slavery.  Having been taught in Texas schools that it was an economic rights issue.  I was like, it does not compute.  And that brought me to a place of questioning.  And that was an example of my privilege being like the privilege of ignoring all the bad  things that have happened to the world that showed that to me.  So I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  That's a better way perhaps to be introduced to something like that.  Then maybe some of the actually I don't know if that's true.  I was like some of the nicer things on Twitter or TikTok maybe is a better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a sycophantic lambda telling you what you want to know about living in the bottom of  the ocean but not about the Holocaust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does she watch TV news?  No, probably not.  I hope not.  Okay.  Except that there's things happening in Ovalde, Texas that is real.  That's not made up.  That's important.  But she's sheltered from it.  And I think that you cannot castigate the source of that information saying you see  there's bad stuff because that's not that's the real stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I would want her not to see the pictures of dead children.  Well, I don't want to see them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But maybe maybe we need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you and I need to.  I don't know.  Like, I know that she's a child on the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's a child.  So you're right.  I mean, there's different things.  But eliminating the issue of somebody's too young for it, any adult, the internet is  introducing them to the broad variety of things in the world, much of which is horrific.  But better that than this nest of privilege that isn't real, that is just you're lucky  enough to be living in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But at the same time, yes, but it's also introducing people to conspiracy theories  and like those same photos being weaponized in the opposite.  Like this could never happen.  This is clearly just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, then one.  But that's right.  But third.  But that's an additional data point that you go.  And there are people in the world who think the earth is flat.  I mean, that doesn't mean you're going to fall into that hole.  The less you're exposed to that, the more likely you might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you exercise your brain by being able to learn how to say, wow, that's BS.  And I'm smart enough to know it because I got educated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think the ever ignorance is ever going to be bliss in the law or not.  It is bliss, but it's not going to be realistic or a good thing for society.  So I'm just arguing that, yeah, there's plenty of bad stuff, but I'm with.  Unfortunately, I'm arguing Jeff's point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm enjoying this very much.  The day has come.  Go, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know we got you there, Leo.  But I've always thought, you see, I've always thought that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But at the same time, as I've always thought that, I also think it's really important to  be wide eyed at what's also going on with companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon  and their predatory ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to get a lot better at.  This show has helped me do that.  At looking at the risks and grappling with the risks and arguing that the mistake of  the early Internet was it was built without guardrails because it was too optimistic.  It didn't see where the risks were.  But too many guardrails has fooled us too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think now it's gone beyond that conversation.  It's the world, right?  It's what's out there.  It's amplified in certain bad quarters.  Yeah, yeah.  Other good quarters.  You know, I mean, I think watching television news is a horrific, horrible, terrible, no  good, very bad idea for adults as well as kids.  Well, here's an interesting stat.  But how are you going to get the news otherwise, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism just came out with this annual report, which  is very good.  It's down in my numbers, but it's too wonky for that.  But it said that 19% of America, I could be wrong on this.  I've asked them because it was not clear what it was.  But 19% of America that subscribe to a news source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw that on your Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then it said that of the subscribers, 27% paid for local news, which would, if that's  the case, then that's 5% of America is paying for local news.  And so we go, oh, local news is going to save us.  Well, at that point, no, this is a tiny little niche product now.  It's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but look at when we have a club twit, less than half of 1% pay club twit.  PBS subscribers, 4%, right?  That's normal.  Participation and things like that is normally a small, a single digit number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is that if that's the only axis, but all of twit is free, except  for club twit.  Oh, you're complaining about paywalls.  Yeah.  I'm talking about paywalls.  Yeah.  And so what is that doing to democracy?  Well, that's why paywalls are a bad thing, right?  That's preaching to the soloists in the choir.  Yeah.  Now, not just the choir.  Yeah.  And so to your point, what's the world, what's the belt on, Shaung, that you, a German word  of the day, that you get if you watch TV, local news, if you only watch cable news, if  you only do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's getting back to when you asked me what's wrong with the internet.  That's getting back to the silos.  Silos, yeah.  The freer the flow of information, the more varied, the better, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the argument of a lot of research now, and this is, I've mentioned this book by Axel  Bruns, is the fallacy of the filter bubble and the echo chamber is that in fact we get  bombarded with a lot more now on the internet and social.  That's what pisses off people.  That's what says, I don't like those people, and now they're in front of my face and I'm  going to get angrier.  And that it's not that we're sheltered from things, that in fact we're seeing more of  the world, to your point, Leo, and that that's what brings out people's fears and animus  because they're not ready for it.  We haven't been exposed to it in the Walter Cronkite world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Stacey, as a good parent, you're not, you know, initially when they're young, maybe  you're shielding their eyes, but more important, more valuable is helping them look at it in  a way that is informing to them and helps them understand what they're seeing critically.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but you have, right now there's a fine line, I would say, between doing that and  really depressing the hell out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree.  Yeah, yeah.  So I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Especially.  Well, and it's not just true for kids.  It's true for all of us.  Oh, exactly.  Yeah.  But, but you don't, so I, you know, I always have this discussion in my mind about video  games or social media with young people.  If you, if you keep them away from it, then when they grow up and they're suddenly exposed  to it, they have had no defenses against it at all.  So you got to, some exposure is kind of important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't talk about this very much, but the internet and some of the tools like Google  Docs or Meet or things like that have actually made it very easy to collaborate on activism  for kids in a way that we really don't talk about it on this show, but, you know, the types of  movements, like if you look at what happened post Parkland, if you look at what happens  with like political activism around climate change among the youths, there's a lot happening  and the internet has made that much more accessible.  It's been easier to find those people.  It's easier to collaborate and to actually take action.  Like I know my daughter signed up on some Google Docs to actually call local, not law  enforcement, local Congress, the local state Congress on some legislation she felt was  important, but I, it is also hard to find all the nuances around some of those things.  So like she was against a particular damn here, but we had to talk about like, well,  is protecting salmon, is it worth, you know, depriving some indigenous people of their  fishing rights?  Because in this case it would.  And yeah.  Then we got into the whole world sucks in this complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's hard because there isn't an obvious, like I guess in some, in some distant nostalgic  past, you could say, well, there's right and there's wrong and here's the past and it's  all very straightforward, but we don't live in that kind of world anymore.  And there's a lot of grays and it's hard to know.  And I don't know what you tell kids.  You just prepare them as best you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, I think that I used to say that my parents did me a disservice and it's the same disservice  that I do my own children is I think protecting them from how many a holes there are in the  world.  And that that's going to be unusual when you see that out in the world and that, and that,  and that most people are all good and most people I think are, but how do you deal with  the difficult people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  My mom told me it was all of you.  So I was well prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except me, right?  Cause my, my empathy module is set to high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Great.  But the rest of them are horrible jerks.  No, I was, I was raised and it took me a while to realize this in a very kind of snobbish  fashion that we are somehow better than almost everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that the academe too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's probably the academe.  Yeah.  It was probably my father's a professor and he's probably like, yeah, well, you know,  those people are not too bright, but yeah, it was very much the case.  Did you ever, I'm going to ask you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  You go ahead.  You were saying your, your parents shielded you from the jackasses of the world and you  were doing pretty much have done the same, had done the same with your children.  Is it because you weren't attacked this often or why was that?  Because I look at my household and I've been straight up with every single person and say,  Hey, this person is a jerk.  This person is a jerk.  This person is great.  This person is awesome.  So on and so forth because of my personal experience and I want them to see what it  feels like on both sides of that spectrum.  I don't know, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good question.  But I think, I think you also, we've talked about this before and you also had to tell  your kids about risks that they would face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I faced fewer risks because I'm privileged.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you tell your kids that Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not enough.  Not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we, we talked about that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we did later, but, but not enough early on, I would say.  I also think back, I mean, you know, there's, I'm the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm not judging you by the way, just, just,  No, I know.  I know.  Make sure that's clear.  You're not going to laugh at what I'm about to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually shy, but I'm the outgoing one in my family.  The rest of everybody's also my family.  I don't bring into anything because they don't like a lot of social stuff.  And I look back on my mother who was scared to death of people as I now realize.  And I didn't understand social anxiety in my parents or in my family now,  or in people around me.  And I think that's an interesting problem too, is that there's reasons to be anxious about people.  There's a-holes out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All of this is insight.  You gain it with age, I think, Jeff, yes?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I've noticed that for myself.  One hopes that you become wise is a strong word, but you become a little smarter as you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we prepare our kids better for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you have kids, you're young and dumb.  I think we all do the best we can.  Not and.  Yeah.  But it's not good enough ever.  Oh boy, I screwed up a lot.  If you're honest as a parent, it probably has those moments where you go,  boy, I could have done that a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes I feel a little weirdo, bless her heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, let's take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had boys for upteen years and now I have a little girl to help raise, boy.  Ooh, bless her heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Different techniques are required.  Clearly.  You can't call her a hard head for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about little weirdo, I'm like, oh.  A little weirdo, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And said with love, that's what matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did hear the love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  It's not the words, it's what's behind the words.  Our show today brought to you by HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise Green Lake,  orchestrated by the experts at CDW.

We thank CDW and HPE for their support  of This Week in Google. You know what? This has been such a great philosophical conversation.  We haven't really covered any of the news. Meta, weirdly, has hit the brakes, apparently,  according to Wired, on hardware. Portal, AR glasses, other hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Consumer hardware, especially. Portal is going to stay for business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder, you know, I mean, Microsoft's done the same thing with HoloLens. It's become an  enterprise product, perhaps. Google Glass.  Glass, same thing. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft's HoloLens, though, the guy who led it left, and they're not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They split up the divisions into two different divisions. You're right, the Army's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not happy. Yeah, so we don't know how HoloLens is going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If there's a commonality, it's that maybe the metaverse isn't all that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I can't tell, you know, like I feel like forever, I've always been on the front end of  being excited about different tech things. So like cloud computing, IoT, and I'll be like telling  people why this is a big deal and explaining it. I don't feel that way about the metaverse,  but I still feel like everybody's pushing the metaverse on us, and I just I truly don't get it.  So I don't know if I'm behind or if there's just not a compelling anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meta-NFTs, I think, well, because I think, I'll try this theory out. And sorry, it's another  Gutenberg moment, but it took time for technology to become boring. And then what people did with  it became interesting. And I think there's this hunger by Silicon Valley, by the technologists,  no, we got to make it more interesting again. We got to make it more interesting. And I don't  think that's what's going to be interesting. I think what's going to be interesting is the is  Cervantes making the modern novel and Montaigne the essay and the guy in Strasbourg, the newspaper.  And what do people invent with this stuff? But remember, these are corporations driven

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  by shareholders who want to see growth. And so from their point of view, they're not thinking,  oh, let's see how technology is. Oh, no, no, I'm talking past them. Yeah,  oh, I agree. Because all their only job is what's the next big thing? And how can we make sure we're  there? And they of course, are faced with the innovators dilemma, it's historically hard for  incumbents to get the next big thing. Apple 52% of its revenue comes from the iPhone.  How do you find something better than that? You know, how do you meet the end?  Oh, no, no, I'm saying that. But that's, but that's why the tech is doing what it's doing  is they're not thinking about some broader cultural they're not saying where's our Montaigne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Jack's trying to Jack's trying to go back and recapture something that was before in terms of  the ability. And that ain't gonna happen either. Right? I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, as far as you go, Stacey, I agree with you. This is always this is the tech reporters  dilemma is what I'm seeing really all that or is it just more BS? When Charlie Rose when when Jeff  Bezos 10 years ago opens the door and says, See, Amazon is going to be doing drones. And Charlie  Rose goes, Wow, that's amazing. At the time, we all mocked him. We all said, Oh, Charlie, you fell  for it. And yet, this week, Amazon is starting drone deliveries in a bunch more cities. It took  them a longer time than they thought it would. It's been a little while. Are you Are we still  skeptical about it, though? Or are we now saying, Well, maybe they were right? Maybe Charlie wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so wrong. Drone. Drone delivery has a place. But I felt like we could see that. I don't know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a lot of us made fun of Charlie Rose, like, Jeff, Jeff pulled the wool over your eyes. And maybe and  it may be actually that he did. Because that was a long time ago. It seems like it was sold as  something mainstream. Yeah, like soon like within. It's just like you like saying, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  next year, you want to ever. Yeah. But like what Miss Stacey said is, is yeah, there is a place for  drone delivery. But I didn't like how it seems like if I go to order a pair of sneakers or new  tripod that I ordered today, I should be able to get this in the same day if I hit deliver by drone.  That's not possible everywhere. That's only in certain areas. And it's not for everything. You  know, a drone can't carry everything you order. Well, it's in Lockford, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know where. Where? The company announced Amazon is going to launch its inaugural  drone delivery service in the town of Lockford, California. Later this year after it receives the  green light from the FAA, obviously, can't do it. There is nothing around it. Yeah. Yeah. Well,  that's where are you looking at it? I don't know where I've never even heard of it. A little north  of Stockton. Oh, okay. Lockford residents will be the first to receive prime delivery packages  delivered to their backyards via drone. Not everything, obviously. It can't be everything.  You're not going to get that inflatable pool, but thousands of items will be eligible for drone  delivery. There will be rate restrictions because most drones can't do it. Again, a drone can only  carry so much. Right. Two pounds. Amazon says it's developing technology to improve obstacle avoidance  both on the ground and the air. It's working on enabling its drones to operate BVLOS,  BVLOS, beyond the visual line of sight. Well, I would hope so. Otherwise, the pilots  can only deliver it. Well, put it over there. Why don't you just drop it off?  So maybe, you know what? Maybe it's still BS. Right? 3,500 people. Yeah. 78% weight. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a small scale. Yeah, that's the perfect pilot city. Yeah. I mean, this is a pilot. And  I also think drone delivery is not going to be obviously for everything. Right? I think part of  the mistake technology or people when we talk about technology, we often think we're like,  this will solve all of our problems. When in reality, it'll solve a subset of our problems  and the trade-offs we've got to understand. So it was nine. It's sold that way though. A lot of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  stuff today is just the answer to your biggest problem. You know, how many, and I know you're in  the IOT space, but how many things in IOT was set to just make our lives so much better by putting  it on our mobile device and controlling it there instead of flipping the switch that's on the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right when you want it. This is from an article in The Verge, 2013, nine years ago.  Uh, Amazon's Jeff Bezos showed off his company's latest creation to Charlie Rose on 60 minutes.  Drones that can deliver packages nine years ago, up to five pounds in your house in less than half  an hour. Part of a program called Amazon Prime Air. A drone sits at the end of a conveyor belt,  waiting to pick up a package. Nine years later, they still haven't delivered that. Bezos says 86%  of Amazon's packages are under five pounds and carry them up to 10 miles from the fulfillment  center as soon as Amazon can work out the regulations and figure out how to prevent  your packages from being dropped on your head from above. Nine years ago. This is, this is called R&D.  Yeah, yeah. This is, this is why our job is hard by the way, because we see all this stuff. I think it's why our job is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  awesome. It's why it's fun. Yeah. I mean, yeah, you get to see this, you get to say, Oh, what will this,  what are the implications of this? Because, you know, the companies aren't thinking of like,  that sort of thing. Like what are the implications to wildlife? That's our job. Yeah. Yeah. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  our job. And also a big part, I think of my job anyways, is telling people whether this is real or  not to waste your time. It's best I can, it's hard to do. NFTs. NFTs and Bickering. By the way,  now add to the Warren Buffet says all this crypto's crap. Now add Bill Gates name  to the list of people who are saying, don't. Now you might say these guys are all old dudes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they saying it because right now when it's down 70%? Well, it's easy now, isn't it? But I've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying it for a while. Yeah, you have. And, you know, Bill Gates says crypto and NFTs are a sham.  He is, he says, yeah, these digital assets are 100% based on the greater fool theory.  He told the tech crunch conference yesterday. He's been watching Twig. He added he's not long  or short on crypto. And he mocked board ape NFTs joking that expensive digital images of monkeys  improve the world immensely. He prefers old fashioned investing because he's an old fashioned  kind of guy. I'm used to asset classes like a farm where they have output or a company where

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they make products. Hey Mr. Gates, check out at pro.com slash Prince. Get some prints, get some NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think about this though, Ant? Jay Z has created a Bitcoin academy.  How about for timing, huh? For kids in the Marcy houses public projects. I think this is  probably misguided. This is the the projects in Brooklyn where Jay Z grew up free classes  to residents, also devices and data plans. Children five to 17 will be eligible for  enrollment in crypto kids camp, featuring classes on crypto. If he's just providing knowledge about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it, I have no problem with him providing knowledge about it considering how many people still have no  idea what Bitcoin is. Some people think you can pick up a Bitcoin. No, no. The instructors will

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  quote teach you about Bitcoin, how it works, why you should care and how to build your own financial

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  future. Yeah, I don't know about that. That's a little. Yeah, I don't know about that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other parts I'm fine with. I think I mean, I look, I don't think Jay Z is a bad guy and I  think he's probably trying to do the right thing. But and he says, yeah, well, the program's mission  statement reads the vision for Bitcoin is that it doesn't have barriers, but lack of access to  financial education is a barrier. It's still hard to use for everyday necessities. Plus people need  devices and data plans. This program aims to provide education, empower the community with  knowledge and get rid of some of the barriers so that residents can learn more about Bitcoin  specifically in finance in general. I mean, I think in principle, maybe this is OK,  especially if they learn about Bitcoin, stay the hell away from it. The volatility of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm totally fine with it. Just educating those youth in that area that normally wouldn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  access to that information. I'm totally fine with it. Well, and one of the promises. What if it's a  loss leader for financial education? Like these kids are excited about crypto. So I mean, it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the you know, one of the things that sucks people into Bitcoin is this notion of  we're underserved communities, you know, a housing project in Brooklyn,  cities in Africa, big banks don't want to be there. We're redlined out as existence.  So maybe there is an alternative financial system that we can participate in.  And I think that I understand the desire to do that. I just hope they don't lose their shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. That's where I am. Just just teach the financial responsibility part of this as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Vice says for poor people excluded from the traditional financial system,  throwing them to a new one full of bubbles, fraud, exploitation and volatility won't teach them much.  It'll just be old wine and new skins. It is if he is teaching that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been what they say. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Same as when when you know, class, hey, kids, let's let's make believe we're buying 10  stocks by kid went through that. Yeah. And you learn the dangers of the stock market.  But that's also how the world works. So yeah, Bitcoin isn't how the world works. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Qualcomm has won a battle against the EU. We hear a lot about the EU and regulations of big tech.  The EU find Qualcomm nearly a billion dollars, actually a billion euros, so more than  a billion dollars. Apparently these days. Yeah. This was four years ago. In 2018, the  EC said Qualcomm paid billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to get them to use only  its chips and iPhones and iPads to block out rivals like Intel. Now, the reason this might  be important is this is a court, the general court, Europe's second highest, annulled the finding  and faulted Margarita Vestager, the EU competition enforcer over the handling of the case.  A number of procedural irregularities affected Qualcomm's rights of defense and invalidate  the commission's analysis of the conduct. So yeah, no kidding. This is a big blow to Margarita Vestager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I wonder what the procedure abnormalities were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Probably very boring. This story from Reuters is not more specific. I love procedural issues.  Can you get on that and give us a report? You know I was the person in Model UN who understood all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the rules of parliamentary procedure and figured out how to use that to my advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kind of the Roberts rules of orders there. You are out of order, sir. Out of order.  Are you having a heart attack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the second dead air that has caught me. I'm like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're talking about this wonderful guy, John Burkow, who is no longer the speaker,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but he was so great. Mr. Angus Brendan McNeil, calm yourself. You may be a cheeky chappy,  but you're also an exceptionally noisy one. Wow. This is parliament. He was just starting his order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, you want order? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I must order the honorable gentleman to withdraw immediately from the house  for the remainder of this day's sitting. This is intolerable behavior as far as the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not funny. That sticker on the subject of Brexit happens to be  affixed to or in the windscreen of my wife's car.  Yes. And I'm sure the honorable gentleman wouldn't suggest for one moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why don't we have somebody like this? Maybe Stacy, would you volunteer to go to Washington, DC

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and say, order? Yes, I volunteer. And you want to back me up? We'll both go.  I got your back. You'd be so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The truth module is up high. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You'd have to set it to 80 or 90%. Well, actually, you probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, as long as I can call someone a cheeky chappy, I am down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cheeky chappy? You may be a cheeky chappy, but you're all cheeky to this damn place here.  You mentioned Douglas Rushkoff. You probably got it too, Jeff, since you know the guy.  I got an early copy of his new book, which I cannot wait to read,  Survival of the Richest. Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires. This is what the billionaires  are planning. Not just Mars, but island bunkers, the metaverse, and decommissioned nuclear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  missile silos. And Douglas and I got along wonderfully  teaching class together, even though we do see the world somewhat differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I look forward to reading this. I just got it and I can't wait to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You said that's an early release. Yeah, it's not out yet, but you can pre-order it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we will. You know what? Well, let me read it. If it's good, we will.  But I am sure it's good. He's on Team Human after all.  Yes, Douglas Rushkoff. Is he a media critic? Is he a professor? What is his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a professor. He doesn't have a doctorate like me, as I don't have a doctorate either,  but he's a queen of college started... Wait a minute. I should have been calling  you Dr. Jarvis. When did that happen? I was just at an event at the University  of Virginia and they had the bios and so everybody is doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor.  And I had to make very clear to say, I'm not a doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, my father, who has a PhD, got it at a very young age. I think he was like 23 or 24 from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Columbia in paleontology. Do you know what his topic of his dissertation is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, ancient marine ecosystems. But he refused. He said, do not call me doctor.  I'm not a medical doctor. There's a reverse snobbery going on. You don't call me doctor.  Until he needed restaurant reservations. Then it was always Dr. Laporte. Every time.  It works. We got to take a little break. Professor Laporte?  Professor does not, even back then, remember Adley Stevenson.  It doesn't get you dinner reservations.  It doesn't get you dinner reservations. Dr. Might, yeah.  Let us, because it is soon to be time. Oh, wait a minute though. One TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to know that y'all all have a full circle on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Y'all. Ant. This is a Chipotle ad for queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the ultimate twig. It's Chipotle. It's got queso.  It's got chipotle. And TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here we go. Hot salsa to queso blanco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Close the lid. And hot salsa to queso blanco. Shake it up.  Enjoy. And queso blanco is free every Monday in June with an entree purchase.  What? And you can use code queso22 in the chipotle app or online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But doesn't chipotle queso, isn't that disgusting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually got better. It was awful at the start. It was awful.  Okay. It was gritty. It was really bad.  It was gritty. Exactly. Gritty. Yes.  It was like chalk. It was melted chalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that is not a hack. Putting salsa in your queso is just a thing.  It's just a thing you do. It's like guac or meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or else we remain bitter that Chipotle never bought an ad on the show. We give them tons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, most of it was about how bad their queso was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Early on when we were doing the gizwiz with Dick DiBartolo, we could never get a sponsor.  So I started doing fake ads for Tostino's pizza rolls for the longest time.  And then I found out they're not Tostino's, they're Totino's.  So I basically blew it.  And now we're from Stacom's. No, let's do the Google change log.  Ah! Ah! Did you hear that?  A Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't cue with the middle of him laughing.  Ah! I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What? What is it, Jason? What is it?  What? We're not seeing the Tricaster.  Oh, now does that mean I have to start the show over?  Thank God.  It's just the stream, it's not the recording.  Okay. Let's do that again.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, time for the Google, well, you know.  Doesn't he say change log in there?  That's the wrong one.  And now it's time for the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google change log.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you are a newspaper or a blogger, you probably take corrections pretty seriously.  YouTube has never had a way for YouTubers to correct their videos.  So there's a new feature just added to YouTube called corrections.  You can easily add more obvious corrections.  I see YouTube videos all the time.  Edit the audio? Or what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you, how do you, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are info cards that you add to the video.  This is wrong what you're seeing and hearing right now.  Yeah, what I'm saying is completely wrong.  Actually, it's weird because you have a pop-up that says few corrections.  How many YouTubers are going to use this, really?  Oh, like three.  Yeah.  I was wrong.  And would you use it?  Well, I see that a lot.  I'll watch videos and I see it a lot where, you know, the guy says something.  I do it, everybody does it.  If you're doing it and you're doing it fast, there's something wrong.  You know, it's 64 gigs of RAM and it's only 32.  And they'll put a little caption on it.  This is, it was only 32.  I made it up to.  That's what most people do.  Yeah, that's normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to use that because I've got to take my videos that I did two years ago  for the incoming class.  There's some things I want to change so I can just use it to update.  You don't have to be a correction, right?  It could also be an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good question.  If it says correction, I think it says corrections.  Let's see.  Here's the full instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's complicated.  Okay.  I read them all.  YouTube.  You got to watch the video.  Google Chrome's on device machine learning.  You know, they love saying that is sentient.  No, no, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My phone is alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no.  It blocks.  It says, or they say it blocks noisy notification prompts.  So they've always had built-in, not always, but for a long time,  they have a built-in phishing detection that tells you if the site you're going to,  you've seen it, it pops up and say this is a scam, right?  Now, in Chrome 102, it's going to use machine learning that runs entirely within the browser,  no Google data, going back to Google,  that will help identify websites that make unsolicited permission requests for notifications  and silence system.  Now, the first thing I do in Chrome and Firefox and Safari and every browser  is I say block requests for notifications.  I don't like it when websites do not.  Or you could block that universally.  Yes.  It's such a nice feature.  That's awesome.  Well, I think I do in Firefox and I'm pretty sure I remember doing it in Chrome.  I, it's the first thing I do.  You can do it in Chrome.  Yeah.  I do it.  Yeah.  It's all, but it's buried because it's in the content section.  So it's not, it's, you have to really look for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you Google it, it's really, yeah, you should totally do it.  It's easy to do.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, cause it drives me crazy.  It's the first thing I do when I set up a browser is I turn off,  I block notifications from all sites and I block the request to save passwords  because I use a password manager.  I don't want that.  So there's little annoyances.  Anyway, Google says that you're not even going to have to change that setting anymore  because we'll now just know to further improve the browsing experience.  We've also evolved how people are interacting with web notifications.  So in effect, I guess it's possible to sneakily say, turn on notifications  without your permission or something.  So they're going to block that.  Tell people browse the web with minimal interruption.  Chrome predicts when permission props are unlikely to be granted.  Oh, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and they see the script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't want, no, you don't want notifications and they silence the prompts.  Okay.  Ah, I guess.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, you have to pay extra.  No, to get your prompts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, does the site have to?  Yeah.  How does it know it's undesirable?  Is it Yelp?  Yeah.  Is it?  Exactly.  You know, we know you don't want those Yelp notifications.  Well, in fact, I don't.  Yeah.  Google Maps now shows toll prices on Android and iOS.  So you'll know ahead of time that you've got to pay some tolls.  That's nice.  You pay a lot of tolls, don't you, Jeff in New Jersey?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We pay a lot of tolls too.  Really?  We only-  The bridges.  It's the bridges.  We have the, on the bridges we pay.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just one for me.  What's the turn like?  No, two for me.  There's Richmond Bridge too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Richmond and Golden Gate Bridge.  Yeah.  And Bay Bridge has a toll too.  Shortcuts replacing files and folders stored in multiple locations on Google Drive.  I thought you always had shortcuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't understand this.  That's why I put it in there.  I thought you'd explain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what this is about.  Leo figured it out for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not how easy for you to find and organize files while keeping the original version.  Well, shortcuts-  It's going to do it automatically.  It's just going to do it to you on a given date.  See, this is-  Windows does this, which I don't like.  Windows looks like it's a folder for my documents, but it's just, it's a saved search.  It's not what you think it is.  So the replacement process will start in 2022.  You'll get a notification in Google Drive a few weeks before your replacement starts.  Wait a minute.  What?  Your process will replace all but one location of files and folders that are currently in-  This is to save them storage.  If you have the same file in multiple locations, they're just going to go suck them all into one-  But how much can that be?  It's Google.  Well, but there's billions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Yeah, across all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The replacement decision will be based on original file and folder ownership.  We'll also consider access and activity on other folders.  That's so they know which one is the original.  At the time of replacement, oh, so yeah, so it's automatic.  So they're going to replace duplicate documents in your Google Drive with shortcuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if I put a document in another place so I can change it?  If it's changed, they won't do that.  No, no, no, I'm saying something different.  I get ready tomorrow.  You haven't changed it yet.  I'm going to change it, right.  And then I start changing document two thinking I'm changing only document two,  but now I'm changing document one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  Roarow.  We'll have to see.  Roarow, yeah, right.  Google lists- this is from chromeunboxed.com.  Google lists their recommended third-party apps for Google Workspace.  Okay, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also put this in here because I didn't-  That's what I thought.  They say they do it every year.  But I don't know.  I've never seen it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the apps.  When you say I want an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they only recommend 12 of them.  I didn't know that there was a priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Those are the special apps.  The male meteor.  Calendar invites are going to be changed a little bit to be more modern and more clear.  That's a good thing because these calendar invites are terrible.  Deadable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem I have, I don't know if this happens to you,  is that people want to have a Zoom meeting.  You put the name in and it says make it a Google Meet meeting and then make it a Zoom meeting.  And then they don't erase the make it a Google Meet meeting and nobody knows where to meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because Google automatically populates it because they're anti-trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So here's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're anti-trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the old invite.  Blah, blah, blah.  You recognize this.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then the new one is going to be like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do that again?  Go back?  It's not looking much better.  No, it's not.  No, it's not looking much different.  Not helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it is better.  Oh, it's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Figuring out where your meeting is is nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, see a nice big button says join with Google Meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope I can still do Zoom through the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's one thing.  We've had problems in the past.  I think it's still happening where if you make a Zoom meeting with Google,  it also has a meeting, a Meet ID.  And then there's always-  Yeah, you have to-  That's what I'm saying.  Creator has to kill-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Jeff was complaining about.  That's what I just said.  Oh, I hate that.  You have to explicitly kill the meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That happens to you too.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make it automatically and you can kill it.  But if you don't kill it, both are there and Meet is above Zoom  and everybody's confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Today is the last day you can use Google Talk.  What?  It's still operational, but tomorrow it's over  for Google Talk, also known as GChat.  This is what you were talking about, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You were supposed to be using Hangouts and then they killed Hangouts.  So you were supposed to be using Meet or Chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used all of them over my life, yes.  And so I didn't know GTalk was still available.  I am amazed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hangouts is kind of still hanging around, but it's Google Chat now.  Did they kill Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because mine's all chat now.  I don't have Hangouts as an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They rebranded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting this irritating thing.  Sorry, Stacey, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I was like, oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I reboot the machine, it comes on and says,  we're changing, we're eliminating this and that and that and that.  So get rid of this and start this.  And then I click on it and it goes to a 404 every damn time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that sucks.  Yeah, it does.  All right.  One more thing and then it's waffle time.  Well, no, it's a pick time and just a bit.  But I want to talk about the Floppotron 3.0.  Oh, and that's the Google changelog.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, you're out of order.  It's time for the Floppotron 3.0.  This guy, this crazy guy put together a musical instrument  made out of hundreds of old floppy disks, the drives.  Because as you probably know, they make a little whining sound,  which he can, the stepper motor control to get a specific frequency.  Problem is the floppies tend to sound kind of bassy.  So he's also using various other things like flatbed scanners for the higher tones.  Would you like to hear the Floppotron 3.0?  In action.  Here it is on YouTube.  A little longer than a few minutes later.  One eternity later.  That was 2016.  This is 2022.  The new Floppotron.  The size of this sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Does this guy ever get dates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to come over and listen to some music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is better than TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's scanners, 512 floppy disk drives.  Four flatbed scanners.  Doing the low end, I mean the high end.  Those are hard drive steppers.  16 of those doing the kind of percussion.  He's even got custom interfaces.  Floppotron 3.0 PSU module.  Power consumption 300 watts peak.  No, 300 watts average 1.2 kilowatts peak.  There is, you saw that emergency stop button.  The wife comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He went from does this guy get dates to being married all in one.  I don't know.  I'm making that up.  I'm joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is really mind boggling.  Precious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just set him up with Mr. Bert.  See what he can put together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love people that do stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he do for a living?  I don't know.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're so easy to abuse.  With great power comes a great energy bill, he says.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  It's a long article.  Silent.org.pl.  He's Polish.  The next step of him makes some videos of the new setups,  some minor software bugs to fix,  some software to add like end stops for scanners.  And he wants to do some new instruments,  a dot matrix printer, maybe some automated lighting.  This is Stacy on IoT.  This is you, Stacy.  This is where you're headed if you continue down this road.  Yeah, in her dotage.  This dark road that I'm on.  Wow.  The Floppotron 3.0.  Silent.org.pl.  All right.  Final ad, then we're picks, and then it's waffle time.  One of the things I did love about Termination Shock,  which we're going to talk about tomorrow on Stacy's Book Club,  is there is a mention of the stroopwafel in the book.  Right?  They have a lovely meal.  And at the end, the dessert, he says, of course, a stroopwafel.  Netherlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It involves the queen of the Netherlands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

What do you got for us?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  A stroopwafel.  Just got a stroopwafel for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I have, okay, so Father's Day is this weekend.  If that's important to you.  Oh crap, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a father.  I better get going.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to know.  I bought this and I just got, so my husband actually got this for me for Mother's Day  and I'm just going to tell you, I am really spoiled.  Just know that.  So this is my new Kindle 8.  The reason I got it is because it's waterproof  and I wanted to read books in my hot tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The walled garden of privilege.  Flex on them, flex on them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a simple woman who needs some very fancy things.  My old Kindle was perfectly fine and so I didn't,  my husband got it for me because it actually does make a nice gift.  But I was like, I can't take this.  This Kindle is fine.  I've got to wait till this one breaks or I leave it on airplane because I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this a paper white or an Oasis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a paper white.  It's the eighth generation paper white.  So I actually ended up, my daughter's Kindle broke while she was quarantining.  So I gave her my Kindle and then so I was able to use this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What happened to the book reader I gave you?  Did that, it's over there?  I couldn't read it in the hot tub, Leo.  Oh no, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I finally opened it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or she did read it in the hot tub but it's a goner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't work.  But so now, I tested it because one of the things I was able to do in Puerto Rico,  the hotel had a pool and it had like little lounge chairs in the pool.  And so I could read in the lounge chair in the pool and it worked.  So this is truly waterproof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  Is that the signature edition?  With that lock screen ads or do you get the lock screen ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I get the locks.  I love the locks.  I know it doesn't bother me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My husband and I are like romantic brothers or whatever.  You know, it's like something crazy.  It's usually books.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, look how nice that looks.  Very crisp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is that Ellie Mistal's book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You recognized it.  How?  How did you recognize that?  Give me a book in two words.  First sentence.  I named that book in two words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our Constitution is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazing.  It's excellent.  It's excellent.  And I highly, highly, highly recommend the audiobook version  because it's Ellie in full performance.  What's the name of it?  You see, you have it right in front of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on.  But I don't have the title in front of me.  Allow me to retort A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution.  I think it's in my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I think it's already in my wish list.  I will add it.  No, it's not.  I think you'll like it too, Ant.  Yeah, because you've recommended that before.  Yeah.  It's direct.  Yeah, I remember you recommending it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's blunt and direct.  It's in my wish list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just got the John von Neumann book that you recommended before  and I'm really enjoying it so far.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I recommend Cloud Cuckoo Land to you guys?  It's a little touch of sci-fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't like it at all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, you didn't.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was really distressing to me that I was just like,  maybe it's because I was like quarantining and like too much was going,  but I just could not get into it and I wanted to so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took me a while to get into it.  Once I did, I was glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, dear God.  What was Jeff thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, everybody, I mean, like everybody was talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went through, I got five books in a row.  I couldn't stand.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's awful when that happens.  It really is.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I'm going to add Cloud Cuckoo Land and maybe I can hate it along with you.  I don't know.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, again, I probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, this is Anthony Doar.  Yeah, it's already.  This is also my wish list already.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess I watched too many dad gum TV reruns because  it amazes me how often y'all able to read these books.  We force ourselves.  We compel ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do have a nice, a new graphic novel if anyone's into those.  Monstrous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Looks beautiful.  That's beautiful.  It is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Check out the art here.  Let me find a good art.  Nice.  There's lots of good.  I'm trying to let your daughter read those or no.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's part childhood.  Oh, that's some.  Oh, that looks like Elden Ring.  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is what is Elden Ring?  It's a video game.  I see it going by.  It's a video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very, very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blue scale, not the gray scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty.  Yeah.  Is that which volume is that there's six of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is volume one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Volume one.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, give me a number.  Unless you did this on Windows weekly, I wonder whether we should start with a moment of silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's sad.  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was going to take over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesus Christ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When he wakes up, he really wakes up.  Yeah, 27 years, it's gone forever.  Today's the last day of Internet Explorer.  But we not only we talked about it, the funniest article in the Wall Street Journal.  You're going to like this, Jeff, because it's clearly they had quotes with people who use  Internet Explorer.  They never used Internet Explorer.  It's clearly these are people who merely wanted to get in the Wall Street Journal, I think.  I'm still trying to process it, said Sam Malmahalanga, a 31 year old Polynesian dance instructor  in Ula, Texas.  This sounds like a parody, doesn't it?  Who is attached to Internet Explorer.  I've used it for so long.  It's the first thing I get on my laptop.  Well, sorry to tell you, Sam, it comes with every version of Windows.  You don't have to get it.  He's making this up.  He's making this up.  Maybe he's thinking of Chrome.  Yes, he's thinking of Chrome.  That's exactly right.  A 22 year old TikToker from Petersburg, Ontario, Matt Linkard says, it's sad to see it go for me.  Internet Explorer provided a portal to a world of endless information and computer games.  Oh, my Lord.  And porn.  But he's not going to say it.  Joni Casey.  This is really hard to believe.  A 67 year old retiree in Ellicott City, Maryland says the Internet Explorer is one of the three  that pop up on my cell phone.  No, no, it's not.  It's not, Joni.  She's thinking of Chrome.  I guarantee you.  Unbelievable.  The journal that, you know, they...  So how does this work, Jeff?  How do you get somebody to...  Like, I need you put up...  These days, you probably go on Twitter.  Go on Twitter.  So I need somebody who remembers Internet Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My day, I'd have to call around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in the Wall Street Journal, you just walk around the newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where's the dang editor?  Cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on.  One of the three that pops up on your cell phone?  What kind of cell phone does she have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You flip it open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But my favorite thing, if I can find it here, I bookmarked it.  This is a tribute to Internet Explorer, a website called lagplorer.tms.sx.  This will bring back some memories.  Internet Explorer is a capital problem and needs to close.  We're sorry for the inconvenience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man, that makes my skin crawl to this day.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you're listening and you're not seeing, but this happened every...  It's funny when I show this to people, everybody recognizes it.  Internet Explorer would crash and then the pop-up that would say something's gone wrong  would paint itself on the screen and you could paint with it because  you could just drag it around and there'd be a million of them.  A million of them.  lagplorer.tms.sx if you want to.  Oh, that's hilarious.  That's gold, sir.  That is gold.  Oh, sometimes it's the simplest things in life.  Maybe that's what she means when she says she has three browsers that pop up on her screen.  I don't know.  She said three, not 300.  Not 3,000.  Mr. Ant, what's your...  Oh, I know what your thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yesterday, I believe it was yesterday at the time of recording this show,  Adobe announced some updates for Lightroom.  That's Lightroom Classic, Lightroom on your mobile as well as the new cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I got bad news for you.  This is not Lightroom Classic.  Video editing is only in the new Lightroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, hold on.  You need to let me finish.  I'm so bummed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  You didn't let me finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have a lot of different updates out there.  One, which includes video editing for Lightroom Classic.  And you've been able to import your videos into Lightroom Classic for I don't know how  many years now.  Never really found a use for it.  But if you want to, you can.  And do a little bit of trimming and some retouching of your videos, just like you would  if you were on your iPhone and you shot something real quick and it gives you the little quote,  unquote, edit function.  It's going to be very similar to that.  But they also added some other AI stuff in there, such as the mask and features.  You can now do a mask selection, copy that selection, and paste those same parameters  into a similar shot without having to recreate your mask and recreate all of your settings  and stuff.  Just more AI trying to speed up some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want you to verify this for me because I read the Engadget story, which said the new  feature only applies to Lightroom, not Lightroom Classic.  And I only use Lightroom Classic.  I won't go near Lightroom CC.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with Lightroom CC.  But I'm a Lightroom Classic person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you see if this works?  Because according to Engadget, it does not apply to Lightroom.  I mean, Lightroom Classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will double check because I haven't launched Lightroom today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say Lightroom Classic has supported limited video editing and trimming in library mode,  but doesn't support advanced editing in the develop module.  But I'm not going to use CC.  The other things do appear in Lightroom Classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other stuff.  I'll launch it sometime tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not going to do much video editing in Lightroom, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You better not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the use case for it.  I take a lot of pictures.  When I go to visit my mom in a couple of weeks, I won't be here, by the way, two weeks from now  because Jeff's going to host the show because I'm going to be in Rhode Island to see my mom.  But when I shoot pictures, I also every once in a while record three or four seconds of video,  just a little bit.  Then I like to do a slideshow with some motion and sound in it.  It would be nice to just process it all in Lightroom Classic and trim and stuff like that,  maybe color correct so that I don't have to export it out to an editor and then import  it back in and stuff like that.  That's all.  I'd just be nice to have some simple features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I put editing in, sorry for scratching my eye, edit in air quotes because it's not  like you're going to create a whole sequence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I could trim it up and color correct it, which would be most important.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cool.  That's the Adobe updates.  Lastly, I follow Benro.  Benro tripods actually use their tripods here and there.  They have a closeout on one of their tripod models.  It includes a video head.  Oh, this is a video head.  Check it out.  I'm getting this for Henry.  For like 150 bucks.  What is that model?  It's the S6 Pro video head and it's on the aluminum tripod legs.  For 150 bucks, you can't beat that.  That's nice.  It's an older model, but hey, it's Benro so it's going to be a good quality.  It's not a cheap tripod, which we talked about on Hands On Photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't usually do pics, but this thing has been driving me crazy.  I love it.  It's so much fun and it's also kind of not so much fun.  It's a new plugin.  Oh, it's an install over here.  Oh, here it is.  Called Toucan.  Do you know about this?  Toucan.  So it's language learning.  I'm going to turn it on and the way it works, I have it set for Spanish,  but they have a variety of languages.  Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Italian,  Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, and Hebrew.  I'm going to use Spanish.  When you turn it on, you just leave it running.  It's a Firefox plugin.  I think there's a Chrome plugin as well.  You just leave it running and then it changes words everywhere on the web  at random intervals into Spanish.  So here's a tweet from AOC, perhaps abandoning youth employment school, Fondos.  What?  That's Spanish for funding and then you have a little audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you didn't have stupid dark mode on, you could actually see the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll do it on, I don't know.  We're going to mute Mr. Jarvis.  Yeah, I know.  He's terrible.  I know.  He's an evil person.  So here's another article.  This is on Engadget in light mode.  So it's still about one month away.  So I'm going to learn from afar.  The device appears to be una mezcla, a blend.  It's Castilian Spanish by the way.  Sin embargo, however, sin embargo, isn't that great?  So without really much effort, you're slowly getting  Spanish vocabulary into your.  That's Manga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boca Boca de Dragon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boca de Dragon.  Yes.  I love that.  Boca de Dragon.  Boca de Dragon, aka Snapdragon.  Isn't that great?  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are a few tricks of its manga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  Isn't that neat?  It's called Turcan.  There's a free, complete free version, which does pretty much everything.  It does everything I just showed you.  I actually ended up paying because I thought, oh, this is great.  I'll use this everywhere.  And then you can always turn it off.  You just hit control E and then it turns off.  So if you want, if you don't want a Spanish mixed into your Engadget,  you can do that.  But isn't that cool?  Isn't that clever?  Yeah.  Turcan.  And I think the website is gettucan.com.  Let me just check real quick.  Okay.  Nope, that's not it.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear a yawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a little hint?  I think I'm still like, I don't have long COVID, but I am definitely not back to normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, how many kids had COVID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were there other kids there?  Literally one.  Literally one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How did she get it?  Do you think?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She caught it from the, what's the person who, the tour leader.  Oh man.  And ironically, she wore a mask like religiously.  Like there's a picture that was captioned like smiles after the airport, mask down  so you can see their faces.  And my child's the only one with their mask on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  Toucan is join Toucan, T-O-U-C-A-N, join toucan.com.  Not yet Toucan, join Toucan.  Well, but she's feeling better now, right?  She came home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  She's better.  We made it home finally.  Travel is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love Puerto Rico.  I want to, I want to get sick in Puerto Rico.  Actually, I want my daughter to get sick in Puerto Rico.  So actually she's in Portugal right now.
