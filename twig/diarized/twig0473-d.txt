Transcript:  Coming up on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo. We've got Stacey Higginbotham  We've got Kevin Toffle joining and a very very brief appearance by Jeff Jarvis at the very beginning  We're gonna be talking all about the pixel event  We have an actual date that Google has given us for the made by Google event coming up next month. Also, there's a new bill  That's making its way through California about IoT security could set the path for other states and snapdragon wear  3100 which I thought was kind of cool and then Stacey compared it to the new news of Apple's watch that they announced today  And maybe it sounded just a little bit less cool all that and a whole lot more coming up next on this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but I like how it froze

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least we got the the death freeze like at the very beginning of the show we weren't quite sure what was gonna happen there  I'm pretty sure it broke up for you, too. Jeff. I'm turning on my phone trying that too. All right  We'll try that Jeff's gonna work on that also joining us Stacey Higginbotham. How you doing Stacey? It's great to see you again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doing well also in Austin  Several no 13 miles 12 miles 10 miles 6 miles. I don't know how far from Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's too bad that you didn't like go to where Jeff is so that you could use his internet there cuz it's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, I'm feeling bad that you know, we were gonna have both of us here  But then I was like, oh no, you can make it at your hotel. You should do that. You'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my fault. It's okay. Don't blame yourself. I blame the internet blame Skype because when things don't work  We just usually blame Skype. That's the easy scapegoat and joining us  I'm super stoked about this because I haven't done a podcast with you in quite a while Kevin Tofel  About Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, it has been way too long Jason, I am so glad to be on a show with you again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, man, it's good to see you and you've been busy with about chromebooks.com and we've got well  We've even got some of your stories in the rundown today  We got a lot of Google to talk about as I was kind of going through beforehand  You know a lot of Google and then unfortunately, there's there's some politics stuff in there and I realized today like I think I'm I think  I'm tired of politics. Like I'm just beat down politics. Just keep happening. Why does it keep happening?  Make it stop make it stop, but we can't because the intersection of politics and technology. It's it's unavoidable  It's undeniable. So we're gonna have to talk about some of this stuff, but we don't need to start there  Let's start with something that I saw a little bit earlier today that I'm sure we all have opinions on and this is  Google's inbox product  Inbox the alternative email product that Google rolled out not very long ago in the grand scheme of Google years  But apparently they have plans to say goodbye and discontinue inbox  This will happen at the end of life will be next March. So are we disappointed? I'm disappointed. I use it every single day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about you guys? I'm okay with it. Yeah, but mostly because I didn't use it very often  So I'm like, oh, all right. Well because I thought they were gonna force us all to use it and I was like, okay  I'll get used to it. That's fine, but I didn't love it when I tried to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so you didn't use it very often because gmail was acceptable or you're using something else  Like I I feel like when I go into gmail after using inbox  I feel like it's way too chaotic and there's just too much too much distraction there. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like I guess  Okay, so I used to be a die-hard many many years ago Outlook user like I was like master outlook  I don't know why but I took a course at some point in time and was really good at it  So the when I started working in gmail, I was like, this is the worst  Program ever I can't do anything  It's such a pain but I kind of just got used to it and now with inbox  I was like, oh they're trying to bring back functionality that I used to have a decade ago  Right, but I didn't love it. I don't know why I just  And maybe it was just change but I don't freak out at my inbox more than usual. I mean I do but  it's just because there's like 13,000 unread messages and that's  That's a thing at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're just accepting the fact that will never be caught up as far as unread messages are concerned that that statistic at this point  It's completely like unnecessary information because it does me no good  It's not like I'm at zero and now I'm at one so that that's useful information. It will always be a crazy number  What a lot? Yeah, what about you Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I should preface this by saying most of Stacy's unread messages are for me. So it's okay. I get it  I'm more upset about that than a box act  No, you know, it's funny because I was not a big inbox fan when it first came out in 2014 and in 2016  I gave it another try and now I kind of feel like I can't live without it  And I'm really I am sad about this and I know a lot of people are gonna be like well  It's a typical Google product, you know, you never know how long something's gonna last  Yes, and no, I mean this is they still have an email service  They're just changing, you know or reducing the options that we have for clients and it kind of stinks  But I hope they don't get bashed too much over this although I am I am disappointed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they've obviously they've taken some of the features of inbox and kind of brought them over to gmail  They did a very big update to gmail within the last couple of months that really seemed to be the biggest example of this  And this was the story back at the time when those changes happened, which was like, okay  Well now inbox is becoming less  Less its own thing and now it's sharing these key features with gmail its days might be numbered  Obviously its days were numbered but inbox also kind of acted as a really great proving ground for a lot of these features  does Google run a risk by then not having that that kind of playground for these ideas and  Having to use gmail with its insane user base  As the testing ground, I guess it's no different than than a be testing, you know  We're beta testing anything any of their products still have Google labs, right? Yeah  I think so do they is there still a Google apps embedded in gmail? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine Lee I have labs things running unless they turn into mainstream stuff. So I'm gonna assume yes now I'm looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And frankly, we're all in Google's playground anyway, I mean they can do whatever they want they always do  Sometimes for the better and sometimes not so I don't think it's an issue  I mean again, I think some people might be upset because they really liked the features but Jason is you're absolutely right  I use a lot of the like the smart replies and other things  They were dog fooded internally at Google where I use them first  Then they went out to every you know, all the inbox users and then eventually made it over to to gmail  So I think it's fine. We're not gonna miss out on any new features. Yeah, I'm just gonna have to get used to gmail again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It I end up logging into it randomly and I'm just my brain is so tuned into how inbox treats everything that it's gonna  Take me some time. I'm just gonna need a little time you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could always use an Android app on your on your Chromebook for that  You could stay so you could use outlook on a Chrome box or a Chromebook. I am aware that I could I have I have gone past

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Outlook I'm okay with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this is an interesting question Kevin because I mean obviously, you know  Chrome Chrome OS is a really big focus of what you're spending a lot of time with right now  Do you on a Chromebook do you opt for an Android app for your email client or do you just go into the browser and  Tear into there. I go into the browser these days just because that's the thing. I've done the longest, you know for 10 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Practically hard to do that. It is hard to undo that  But I mean you do have options and hey if there's a good Linux client that you want to use you can do that on most  Modern Chromebooks as they roll out project because Christina so there's we've got multiple options. Yeah  That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can go ahead and put this in the box next to Google product that you know was introduced not too long ago  But now is going away  Google at this point, it's no surprise that Google does this it's the Google Plus is still  alive and kicking  Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. I mean there are there's a lot of things that Google does that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true  I mean there are there's there's plenty of people  Contributing to the Google Plus community who would argue like they like there's a reason for it to be there  You know that that it's unique and what it offers. I man I my habit is completely fallen off the edge of a cliff  I don't even check it anymore rarely. I should say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, did we get rid of Jeff entirely? Did that happen? Yeah, so  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been very spotty as you can see there's no longer three monitors  Surrounding me there is two although I think we might have connected with him. Let's just say that we won't bank on Jeff's  Ability to contribute on this show, but when he comes in we'll we'll say hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just like how we like just totally faded him away with nothing. I'm like, oh wait a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been there before the the Skype monsters are nothing new here in the studio  But we do have him. Can we hear you right now Jeff?  Or maybe there I think two three four five. Yeah  One two, three one two, three  So far so good, you don't see him on the set, but I guarantee you he's there. Welcome back Jeff  Maybe if we look away things will be okay  Yeah  I'm not sure it's gonna work Jeff as much as I really want to have you on this podcast  It's okay, yeah enjoy yourself you're an Austin live it up a little bit you don't need to do Google today  Are you are you on next week, let's take a look at the schedule looking forward  It looks like you will be in next week so you can redeem yourself if you need to drop off today. We understand  All right, I think  Yeah, I don't think it's gonna work man. So we will talk to you enjoy your queso and enjoy the rest of your time in Austin and  We'll have plenty to talk about with you next week  Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate it  All right, so  No one seems to be too sad about inbox. Maybe me a little bit, but that's okay. I think I'll probably get over it  Why don't we talk pixel because we actually did get some pretty  Solid concrete news as concrete as it gets from Google that there will be a pixel 3 event or we assume  It's a pixel 3 event. Anyways an event of some sort is happening officially on October 9th  So Google has made that the date I love New York is the tagline  They say there will be a live stream begins at 11 a.m  Eastern 8 a.m Pacific if you can't be at the New York event, which most people probably will not be there  There's also an event happening. I guess in France French publications got an invite for an event. I love Paris  That happens at the same time as the New York event. So so hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that weird that they would do that they time them the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happening there. It's gonna be like the unveiling of a Beyonce video, but it's a Google video featuring the love

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knows  well, actually  was the pixel available in  Paris or in France at launch last year. I'd be very curious to know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All I'm gonna say because I'm not allowed to say anything. Oh, okay  So you all sorts of questions you can ask as many questions as you like. I will never stop you from asking  however, however  Keep in mind as you first said this is not necessarily a pixel 3 event. This is really a made by Google event  Yeah, yeah. So yes, we all assume there will be a pixel 3 pixel 3 XL  We've also seen rumors of a new chromecast. We've also talked about or heard about  pixel book replacements  so  It may be  Things that are important in France. That's all I can say. Okay, that makes sense cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google branded cheese and wine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and Google berets  Yes, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Kevin's gonna be at the event, correct Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to France first and I'm leer jetting over to know. Yes. I will be in I'll be in New York City for the event. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was hoping you parachute into one of the events, but I imagine that's Google glass to  Logistically, that's that's difficult to make happen. I understand. Yeah  Okay, so that's an important distinction made by Google is I think the hashtag that they used in, you know  in conjunction with this announcement and obviously Google makes a whole lot more than just pixel phones, but  We have been seeing a lot of leaks a lot of information happening here and there and whether it's trusted  Information or not remains to be proven from the event  Are either of you I think we talked a little bit about this last week Stacey on the show  But Kevin are you at all excited?  Like are you do you think that if there is a new pixel phone and based on what you've seen from the leaks  Is that something that you're probably gonna pick up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, I mean I think the the leaks I can't see why they wouldn't be legit. First of all  I think what's exciting is  what  Software services and things that Google optimizes for the pixel and I I think back to the the camera software last year and even the year  Before that which you're just blowing almost everything else out of the water  So I'm excited to see all that for sure me personally. I'm kind of in a  Budget mode now that I'm getting older. So I'm literally sticking with my Nokia  $324 Nokia 7 plus personally nice  And how are you having loves that phone? Yeah, you know, I do I do love this phone  I know we want to talk about pixel, but I will just say I mean  $324 it is an international model. You cannot get it here. This shipped from Taiwan via Amazon  Doesn't support all of the US LTE bands. I make do it works fine  but you know for for you could buy what three pixels for the price of this essentially and  It's got a fantastic camera. It's got a Snapdragon 660, which yes, it's a mid-range chip  But it still is really  solid performing and  Easily you can go a day and a half if not two days on a charge  It's running the Android 9 pi beta because it's an Android one phone. So it's always gonna get the latest updates the software I  Best three hundred twenty four dollars I spent in years Wow. That's not that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean and getting the updates being an Android one phone  That's you know that ends up being a lot of people's kind of instant  Instant point when you're going off the the pixel  You know direction is so yeah, well, what about updates?  but obviously Google's done a really good job with Android one of bringing this to more devices and  That's I would say one of the key kind of standout features of getting an Android one device would be that the software support  Which is so important. Do you worry about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  security buying the see it's the HTC honor or  Something something do you worry about like I  Guess malicious content on your phone since you had to buy it from Amazon and it was shipped from Taiwan

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, just about every phone these days is made over in that area or that region  So, I mean what you know, the last pixel I'm sure was built in China as well  Would I would I go for an a Huawei as ETE?  Maybe not as much for that reason, but I'm not too concerned about about that  I mean I got to believe that the Google's hardware partners are doing what they're supposed to be doing or Google or they wouldn't  Be Google hardware partners, right?  So the perfect example the Google Titan security key it's made in China  You know, I bought one. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you but you bought one do you have it yet? Have you been using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have it and I'm setting it up either tonight or tomorrow morning  Okay, I'm kind of giving a prelude to my thing at the end of the show. Okay, we won't go there. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No talking pretend that I said nothing. Let's let's just move on  so  one of the things that's been kind of happening over the path of the course of the last week like obviously there were the  There were the leaks that around the pixel devices that we know we heard a lot about and they were like appearing on on YouTube on  all these like Russian  Review sites and everything really highly produced  Reviews of these devices that Google literally has not announced yet  And so what does that kind of led to at this point led to a lot of conspiracy?  Theories as far as like what exactly is going on people are wondering are these actually the devices?  Personally, I think they are and if they are not  Who's behind them? Maybe Google is feeding like the anyways the conspiracy theory says  Maybe Google is feeding these devices out there to steer people into a certain direction and then be able to show on stage  Hey, you know that thing ha ha fool fools  This is the actual device and don't you love it sounds a little far-fetched  But apparently there's a lot of people that believe that this is actually happening and I don't understand how that could possibly be reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think are they upset about the notch and this is their way to deny it for a little longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. Okay, that's a part of it  Because people are like really upset about the notch on this phone like hatefully  So to the point of like I would normally get the largest most specked out phone, but I'm not going to this time  No, I'm gonna get the smaller one because notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To two things. This is like a non-q except it's a non-g, you know, it's it's a Google conspiracy  Listen the notch on the rig on the iPhone 10 that was leaked well in advance and people thought it was hideous die-hard Apple people  Saying I'll never buy this phone. Guess what? It didn't hurt sales  Not at all and and if and I don't know honestly if that is the the size of the notch on the pixel 3xl  I don't think it's gonna hurt that many sales either. Yes, there will be people who say and not getting it  That's fine. But by and large it'll be fine  Secondly about three maybe four weeks ago when all these leaks started  There was a prominent YouTube blogger who does phone reviews  He was contacted allegedly by the somebody in Russia and says I want to sell you this for $2,000  Think of your page views. So what this guy did instead of buying it he went through the whole  Information process to figure out if he was gonna do this with the guy  It was really shady partly on telegram partly on Twitter DMs and all that and he  Recorded it all on his YouTube video and this went on for like a day or two and he condensed it to eight ten minutes  I mean everything he has no reason to lie. I don't think  He was exposing that these phones might have been stolen off the production line or something and somebody was trying to sell them for $2,000  and  Honestly, I think these leaks are the legit thing because of that. I don't think there's any conspiracy here. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just don't yeah. Well some of these YouTube  Channels that have been you know doing their reviews or at least responding  Reacting to the leaks that are out there and saying oh well, you know, this is ugly because it's got the notch or whatever  Apparently they're now being contacted by someone who represents Google  Saying hey, we would like the rights to play some of your content for an upcoming event  And that's I think where the conspiracy theories began where it's like wait a minute  So Google wants like did they feed these out there so that we would respond negatively so that they could pull our content in and  Then you know display how everybody was so wrong because here's the right thing  And I think that's a really long way to go for some sort of marketing blitz  That I think also has the potential to be very negative for your brand if people like immediately at that point decide  Oh, well, you know not knowing that Google may have put the put out this fake phone go  Well, that's not the phone that I'm hoping for I'm gonna buy a note nine right now and you know, they lose a sale  So I just don't see any company like Google actually doing that. It seems like a long way to go for something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not in their DNA. Yeah, it's just not what they do. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could be wrong. But yeah, I think more more likely if Google is reaching out to these people  it's probably to the point of like, you know, I could see them on stage being like and  We making making light of the fact that they weren't able to keep the secret very long, you know  What what we have in store, you know and playing a little montage or something, I don't know  But anyways, I'm excited for the phones. The notch isn't offensive to me necessarily it is to a lot of people though  So we'll see but Kevin we need to talk to you because a big part of this made by Google event is  Is pixel books or something along these lines?  ChromeOS tablets  Detachable tablets all sorts of things. It seems like there's a lot of kind of  Possibilities here and again, there's leaks involved with this as well  So what can you tell me about kind of I don't know the the leaks that we've seen so far  We've seen some ad leaks and that sort of stuff. What what's kind of on the on the line there?  I'm at a loss. I haven't seen or heard anything. Oh, wait a minute. So this is the thing that I can't ask you about  No, I'm kidding. Wait a minute. You wrote about this stuff. Of course, I can ask you  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was like, oh yes, yes, yes  So yeah, there's there's lots of potential things that we will see  I guess I mean and some of these things we've been talking about on about Chromebooks since I think may  Because I scour the chromium commit log every day twice a day, you know, because that's what normal people do right and  I  first heard for example of the code name nocturn as a  Chromebook board back in May and the fact that it would have pogo pins  Leading to the potential for a snap-on keyboard similar to say a surface Pro or an iPad Pro, right?  Don't know if they're going to do that, but I do strongly suspect. Yes, we will see a detachable Chromebook  But what about Pixelbook so  Lately we have seen some ads showing up in Google Ads Facebook ads and then in a YouTube TV  video spot  Showing a pixel book that looks like today's  Except for one key thing. It has much smaller bezels and that does  That makes sense to me because they're going Google has spent an enormous amount of time on  getting tablet  Functionality to Chrome OS this year. I mean every day I see new changes of making change making improvements to add  You know hiding the shelf and tablet mode and all kinds of things  So the pixel book too is what I'm calling and I don't know what it's going to be called  But should be more tablet like and that has smaller bezels  I suspect the screen will actually be bigger because I have a feeling they'll just reuse the same chassis that they have today  Flip out the the screen that flips over to maybe a 13 inch high-res display  and I  Anticipate they'll upgrade the chips inside to the Intel eighth-gen processors. For example, it just seems to make sense  So we could see two things there, you know, and there's others in the works. There's Atlas. That's a 4k  Board that supports Chrome OS. There's  Chezza, which is a Snapdragon 845  Chromebook with LTE and I know that project Hermes is part of their eSIM support in Chrome OS  Geez, I mean for me this is almost like a pixel book of that not a pixel 3 of that, right? Right pixel family

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and this would be I mean if they have multiple  Pixel books coming out. That's a that's a really big deal  And I'm happy said LTE even though Jeff is not here, but that would make him happy  I think that make him feel all warm and fuzzy to hear that  Because he's been waiting so long  But yeah  I'm looking at my my pixel book and I don't know if it's if it's possible to take the over-the-shoulder shot  But based on what you were showing in those in those the the screenshot from the ad  I mean these bezels I just draw ginormous compared to what you see in that ad. So  Yeah, I think it makes perfect sense for it to fit inside of the the design of the current pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But just stretch the screen out. Yeah, I mean, I think that's the biggest complaint that people have about the pixel book  It's not the performance or the internals or the battery life. They're like, oh those bezels and yeah  There's a picture right there and you can see that they are  Allegedly like a third of the size at least on the top and the left and the right now on the bottom  It may still be a little bit bigger. I'm wondering though. Where does the front camera go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, maybe there's a notch right out of the screen. It's very much. It's very possible  We can have a notch in the in the laptop for the pixel book XL. Yeah  Could possibly happen I you know, hey, I would not be surprised  At this point if people want the the bezel list  That's that seems to be a big part of the trade-off that they're getting  I should also point out that I feel like I have specific memories somewhere in the last couple of years of  Google having some sort of promotional  Stuff that either appeared inside of a you know an ad on a mobile device or somewhere that seemed to show a device  It was a handheld if I remember correctly  That we had never seen before and everybody went nuts going because it was close enough to the event went nuts going  Oh isn't Google clever?  They're putting their upcoming device in these in these ads and you know, no one's gonna notice  But of course we do we know they're gonna release something. This is probably it and that turned out to be false  It did not turn out to actually represent anything  So it's very possible that Google's marketing team just takes some of their IP and tweaks it around and make it more appealing in  And maybe that's not the new laptop  But we we know that pretty high likelihood that there's new  Chromebooks coming based on all the different types of leaks is not just that one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, there's there's one other aspect as well  And that is at least if you subscribe to the fact that the Google ad for this new pixel book or showing the new  Pixel book is true. It said affordable  And they may have been talking about Chromebooks in general, however high-end Chromebooks we know are a thousand bucks or so I'm  Wondering I just don't know that Google can come out with a pixel book replacement at the same pricing and I say that because  Their partners Dell Lenovo and Acer have all come out with like core i5 8th gen Intel  Powered Chromebooks of late  starting at like 599  Hmm  Hmm. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say we see at least a $200 reduction in the base pixel book  That's just my gut. I don't know anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right well and I think that's been a that's been a limiting factor for a lot of people yet when it comes down to  Chrome OS at least in my experience  This is the best one out there having the pixel book form factor. It feels right  You know what? I mean like it's so many of the other Chrome OS tablets that I've used  They just they feel wrong in certain ways either the touch the touchpad is is not right or the display is  Not high enough resolution for you know it to be appealing to my eyes or the build quality feels hollow or something along those lines  This feels right, but you also pay a lot for it  And that ends up being the the trick for a lot of people is why would I pay that much for a web-only?  device and  I don't know I think I think Google's done a better job over the over the last couple of years of  Convincing making people understand why chroma OS isn't  Making it a choice for something where you're sacrificing other things where it actually has its own value  And it's worth it a $200 reduction in price that makes it even even better. That would be a that would be a big deal. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or well, I hope I'm right, but yeah also as you just alluded to you know  It's it's a lot of money for you know a browser  But what is Google done and it took a while to get there Android apps have been added  So now you've got a mobile app experience if you'd like  Just about everything comes with a touchscreen these days which makes the mobile app experience much better  You've also got project Cristini on a lot of Chromebooks that have been out or that rolled out in the past year  So now you have full Linux apps. Yes, it's still in beta, but it's it's getting there  And then there's this talk of the or there's code saying we're gonna be able to boot into an alt OS  So there's a third option there that makes a Chromebook more compelling and I I don't know if you guys realize what also s is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so is this the windows on a chronic pixel book or a Chrome OS sort of thing like a dual boot sort of thing  Like boot camp on on days of old on Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Essentially, yes, that's that's what it would be. So so there may be opportunity to install other  Other platforms on there  Maybe you want the full Linux install in a dual boot situation as opposed to using Linux in a container with Cristini  But yeah, so now you think about it  I mean and and I think maybe Mike Elgin was on your show a couple weeks back and was saying hey, you know  the Chromebook is like the  it went from running no software to running more software than any other platform and  Now you add Windows to the mix and and I he's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm  big big change, but that might be the the  That might be the hurdle that people are willing to jump over in order to get into here because then it increases the perceived value of  The actual hardware itself if you can put something that you know, most people would consider a full-fledged  Operating system onto this hardware and have the choice of dual boot that that could be the reason people decide to finally jump

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Stacy could go back to Outlook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have that that was decades ago you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never let you live that down. Do you do you have a pixel book right now Stacy or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is your laptop? My laptop is a MacBook Air. So it's old but  yeah, and I really don't know what to do because I've got to replace the air with something soon and  And it the latest MacBooks that I'm still not I don't love the keyboard  I know they fix the they break all the time, but I really hated to feel the feel of it. So I'm like, oh  Now what do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  those clacky flat keys  Hate those. Yeah, my wife has that laptop and it's just so weird when I type on it  Maybe it's the kind of thing you get used to over time, but I just don't like the feel of it.

We got alphabet  Alphabets loon which is is no longer a project. It's not project loon anymore. It's evolved  Apparently it hit a new milestone actually a very important milestone  Last month and it's all about how much distance they can cover with these with these internet balloons essentially  1000 kilometers of data covering distance between seven of its balloons  That's their new record prior to this the record was a hundred kilometers across two balloons  And even if you kind of stay locked into the two balloon  Aspect of the prior record loon also surpassed that 100 kilometer record up to 600 kilometers  Now that's the longest point to point so far. So they're expanding the capabilities wider coverage with you know  a minimal amount of these  Internet balloons floating around in the year and this is all important because there are plans to charge for the service  Starting next year. I think I just kind of forgot that loon was happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Send them to Puerto Rico. Was that a thing that I imagined or was that Facebook's effort?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Google  Yeah delivers internet to 100,000 people in Puerto Rico November of last year, I mean it's a small country but but still it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's real entry. Yeah, wait, sorry  It's a protectorate territory. What do we call those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I got it wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a US territory US territory territory. Okay. I was like, it's not a state. It's not a country. It's a not a province

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it has internet thanks to thanks to loon. Yeah, I guess I just kind of forgot that that loon was active  I think I've gotten used to Google killing  Killing killing its projects. I just kind of assumed maybe they had done that with project loon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Facebook killed their yes, you know the sky project  Killa a killer a seller a killer something the big planes with a horrible name. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure it has the word sell in it. Yes  Somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, that's good. It's an important kind of milestone. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it every it's a 10x milestone and technologists love their 10x milestones. Oh sure, but they should call me when it's in miles  Wait a minute, let's do the conversion here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's still fine. But you're it's like a 10k. It just times 100  Times 100 so right right  6.1. Does anybody know the speed of the internet speed? I realize it's to blanket lots of coverage. I'm just curious. I mean  You know, they probably don't offer too much, but it'd be curious what they offer in terms of actual speeds  Is it like 2g 3g or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The so there did a search for this. This is from August of last year. It says up to 10 megabits per second  And this was between balloons over 100 kilometers apart  So around 10 megabits per second or up to rather so obviously that fluctuates but  That'll get you YouTube for GLT speeds  Yeah, it'll get you YouTube  might have might have some issues and latency and stuff like that I imagine but  But yeah, that's totally usable  Meanwhile 5g is totally right around the corner. It seems like down here Verizon actually didn't they have an announcement a 5g announcement  They're gonna be offering 5g home brought broadband

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They opened up sales for it. Yes, they had announced it a while back and now they're saying you can buy it  Which if you're into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're into that sort of thing fast internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Kevin and I actually talked about this the challenges with 5g because it is using millimeter wave band is  Weather can cause some issues with it now Verizon and other companies doing these types of things have tested it  But I think Kevin you compared it to like  satellite  when we talked about last

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, you could face similar challenges  I mean, I remember when I had a satellite dish and you know, you had a bad storm that was it  You could the signal could go in and go out and so on  So I don't know how they're gonna mitigate that with line of sight millimeter wave, right?  They could have they could have trees with wind in the way. I it's gonna be a challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean even near-term like I'm not sure that you know what the  What the hardware is gonna be like?  hitting the home broadband  Areas, but when you're talking about like what we're seeing in mobile and what we kind of saw with Motorola's phone that has the  Moto mod with a 5g and it looked all sorts of funky and that's because of these  These issues right it creates a lot of bulk adds all these weird antennas sticking out the side  So it's it's a long way to go for improved speeds, but there's a lot of asterisks involved along the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're gonna put devices on people's roofs roofs roofs roofs  I don't know how people say that word on top of their houses  And then that'll tie into that'll link to a device or a gateway device in the home  So that's that's how that technology is gonna look. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somewhat yeah what we're all used to seeing so then it's just a matter of line of sight from the  Antenna or whatever it is mounted on the the roof. I think I say roof

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  roof roof roof roof roof roof  Don't know it's apparently I say drawers funny too, so  I don't know where I'm getting all this so I'm like, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know it's spelled drawers. So that makes sense  Say drawers  Show I love how going from 5g to how you how you pronounce drawers  Roofs exactly anything's on the table here  Let's see here  Do there was a Carnegie Mellon's Andrew Moore  So basically we've seen that Google's had a lot of challenges in the past year project Maven  The Department of Defense contracts with AI and everybody internally saying hey, this should not be happening  You know our AI should not be developed to potentially be weaponized to be able to do things  Or used in some, you know in those sorts of ways  So obviously Google's kind of AI research team has had a lot of a lot of setbacks and turns out there's gonna be some  A little bit of a change. I don't know if the change is necessarily directly related to these issues  I think it was planned all along but they're bringing back Andrew Moore  To head the division by the end of the year Moore has been the Dean of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University  Although I always want to say melligan, but Carnegie melligan  Mellon University for the past four years  Faye Faye Lee who's the current head of Google Cloud AI is going to return to Stanford to head the AI lab there  After two years with Google, so it's almost like they're they're changing. They're passing  passing a diet yes  To improve the the AI development at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Semi-related and I just noticed this before the show  About a year and a half ago Google consolidated all of its product blogs and put them into what they call the keyword  which is at blog Google I  noticed today that  They're moving the cloud  Pieces back off to a separate area at cloud.google.com slash blog  So I think if you go to blog.google right now, you'll see this announcement because I saw it earlier today  And I find that really odd  That they consolidated everything and now cloud they brought cloud in and now clouds going back out because it's such a big part of what?  They're trying to do to grow their business. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Introducing the Google Cloud blog. There you go our new home for cloud news guides and stories  And they've got a got a lot of content hitting these pages  Yep, that's impressive. I mean this is like ten posts today  It's crazy  Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what to add to them they I think but yes  Think that might be all we have on that one  I think you know, honestly, I think I've just been kind of avoiding the next one to be completely honest  There was a there was a story that broke right before right before the show  about Breitbart  Essentially has posted a link to a video  Leaked video  Says the verge article of Google's first all-hands meeting after the 2016 election  There's been a big kind of movement right now  big conservative  Leaning movement saying that oh well Google is obviously so  So liberal in as a company culture that this is, you know possibly or probably in some people's views  Influencing how they operate their business Google's pushing back pretty hard on that  Accusation but Breitbart posted this this leaked video and it's the all-hands meeting that happened immediately after the 2016 election  And in it, you know co-founder Sergey Brin  Says things like you know finding finding the election very offensive  He says quote and I know many of you do too  It conflicts with many of our values  I think it's a good time to reflect on that so many people apparently don't share the values that we have and  so, you know this this really seems to kind of tie into  The narrative that that is being kind of hashed out publicly right now in conservative circles  What do you guys think? I mean, I personally I feel like a lot of companies probably had similar  Conversations but a lot but a lot of the of other companies aren't Google and don't have the power that Google has potentially over  So many people because of its search engine and all of its products, but what do you guys think? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll go first. Go for it. You don't want to talk about this either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was also answering a question in the chat room about Verizon line of sight and doing some research on a blocking of  spectrum capacity stuff, but  I get it. I'm like, hey, let's talk about spectral propagation  Quick change of topic  Okay, right part I'm ready  Yeah, but Kevin you go first

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll go first and I'll disclose I'm not affiliated with any party never have been and probably never will be am I dismayed by the election?  Yes, I'm not thrilled with it, but it is what it is. It's over them and whatever. I agree Jason  I think there are a lot of companies that probably had meetings like this  They're probably companies that had meetings like this when Barack Obama was elected and and that's within their right to do so  I don't have a problem with that  you know my thing is if if bright part has this beef and this video and  It's gonna push to have this looked into I'm all for everybody following the rules when it comes to you know financial  Election donations and so on and so forth. I wasn't at this meeting so I can't speak to it  But you know bring your evidence and let the chips fall away where they may I say and then that goes for either way  Like I said, I'm sure there are companies in 2008 that felt this way as well. Are they Google?  No, so point taken that they're big company. It's a big company with a lot of power. Yes  So prove that there was something wrong and when I see proof up certainly believe it and say that's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no secret that this was a very polarizing election and based on the stories  It talks about like Sundar Pichai telling people that you know, they were upset and he was saying hey if you're afraid of the consequences  Of a Trump administration. I get that talk to people if he really said, you know  Reach out to political opponents and embrace the democratic process. That's not exactly a call to arms against Trump  That's saying get off your lazy butts and start participating in the political process if you don't like what what just happened  I don't think that's a terrible thing to do and  I mean  I'm I struggled with this election  And I was at I actually know I wasn't was I still there? I don't I was like I don't even remember where I was  It was so traumatizing. But the point is  after every election  people  tend that like  People have feelings about it and it's fine to acknowledge that and after this last election, I think people had  really deep feelings that maybe they didn't have beforehand and I  Think that's more of a response to where our politics are today than it is of a particular candidate  But that's just me and I I mean or a company or a company and I think it's despicable that  There are publications and partisanship trying to make  What are human reactions to these things?  Using that as this to just increasingly inflame this war  between two sides, it's  I do I think it's despicable. That is all I think we could do better and  would be smarter without inflaming so much aggregatevation and  whatnot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, yeah, that's that's such the  It's so indicative of this moment in time from a political perspective  There's so much of this going on. It's so hard to  So hard to try and ignore that, you know  That certainly doesn't make me feel it makes me feel icky the more the more I kind of dwell in  the state of all this stuff right now and  Yeah, but I will say if it bothers you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do go out and do something about it. Talk to your neighbors  You know go vote sure actually do things to improve it and  Do things to improve it and  Again, I don't think that's a partisan message. I think you know, like I  There was an advice column a couple days back. I think it was someone saying  Oh, I volunteered to take my neighbor to the polls for election day and I know she's gonna work  Vote conservatively or for someone I don't like can I just tell her I can't take her?  And rightly so the person giving advice was like no, that's a jerk move and  You know you you should engage with them and talk to them about you know  Talk about your point of view here and see what happens. But  so  Yeah, we're all just hosed. Okay, i'm done  We're all just hosed  Title that's my considered opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, well i'll see if I can maybe uh, maybe steer us in in  More, I don't know enjoyable topics here. In fact, let's let's take a break  We'll thank a sponsor and then we'll come back and we'll talk about some maybe less politically charged more enjoyable topics  This episode of this week in google is brought to you  Uh by the reason that I show up to work all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and that is casper because I have casper mattress  Let me tell you it's super comfortable casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost  Uh, if you haven't checked it out for yourself, they're revolutionizing the mattress industry  They're cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms and passing that savings directly on to you  The customer casper's mattress is an obsessively engineered mattress and even more, you know more awesome  It's at a fair price the original casper mattress  Combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface  Uh with just the right sink just the right bounce plus it's a breathable design helps you sleep cool and regulate your temperature  Through the night i've had other kinds of mattresses like this and they did not do that  You'd wake up all sweaty and warm and it's just not that you know, enjoyable  Uh casper mattress provides long-lasting comfort and support you can buy it easily online  And completely risk-free they send you a big box  They send you a big box  But you're still kind of amazed that there's a mattress inside the box until you open it up  you slice open the the plastic and it's like it grows and it becomes a full-size mattress and  Uh, then you yeah, it's just kind of amazing that they can ship it the way they do but they do  And that's what makes it so easy to get online  uh  We've we've had a couple actually we have two casper mattresses in our home right now. We got our first one  Uh quite quite a few years ago at this point. I think I think three years ago  Super soft super comfortable. I couldn't even imagine like replacing it with another kind of mattress like going into a show  Showroom floor and getting a traditional one. In fact, my my older daughter still has like a traditional mattress and  Uh, you know for like story time or whatever  When i'm on that bed, it's just not nearly as comfortable like we we have to upgrade her at this point  It's it's obviously we've gone too long without doing that  So we will casper understands the importance of truly trying out a mattress and this is a big key here  Uh, they know that in reality you're going to spend a third of your life on this mattress  Are on a mattress so casper offers free delivery and painless returns within a 100 day period  So you don't have to lie down in a showroom and make a snap decision  You can check it out for a while, which is how we use our mattresses and see how it how it does over time  Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards that are made in the usa free shipping and returns to the u.s  Canada so get a casper mattress today  And you can actually save 50 towards select mattresses when you go to casper.com  Make sure and enter promo code twig.

That's casper.com slash twig and we thank casper for their support  So I know somewhere down here there was a good iot story that I wanted to get your opinions on because I know you guys  Have opinions on this stuff. You share them each and every week on your podcast  Uh, so maybe you already talked about this, but uh, there's a new iot security bill  That is expected to go into effect january 1st of 2020 here in california  It was approved late last month and apparently it's the first of its kind the bill dictates that a manufacturer of a connected device  It says quote shall equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features  Which is  So incredibly vague like i'm happy they did something but i'm not really quite sure exactly what they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh in that you don't want them to be too specific  Because technology changes all the time  So like that gives the ftc and this is how this is usually done is they're like make it reasonable and then like the agencies get  To decide so the ftc will look at this and say well, what's reasonable today?  Are you encrypting your traffic back and forth? Yeah, that's reasonable  And then they're gonna make a fine against a company who doesn't and then the  Company is going to litigate the fine and then the courts will decide if that is or isn't reasonable, right? So  Six years from now, we will actually know what this law will mean for companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just a starting point. It seems like but it but it is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we we do need some kind of stick to hold up to  Companies and say hey  You should follow this law. I mean, it's basically like telling your kid, you know  You've got you're putting up the chore chart, right?  Right the kid can negotiate things and we'll forget sometimes but  You'll give them a reasonable punishment or you know a consequence and they'll  But you're not I mean that's that's kind of what this is. This is telling them. Hey, this is really important to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So could you take my feelings into consideration, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And kevin and I did we did talk about it so kevin do you want to talk about like  I mean the specifics about default passwords and stuff. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think there were two things in there that are specific about not shipping devices with default passwords, which  Meaning an individual password for each device that goes out the door to a consumer which is kind of crazy talk. That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's unusual devices right now share keys. So that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and then i'm trying to think um, because there's only six hours ago. I should remember uh the updates you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to force a user. No, it was you have to force the user to change the password change the password, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so those are those are key  So is that force force them to change their password or give them the option to change their password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least no, it's it makes them change their password and most devices better way to do that  Yeah, so it doesn't stop them from putting password one two three as their new password, but that's that's my password. How did you know?  I'm sorry kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dang it  We're always spoiling kevin's password on this show and he keeps using one two three. I don't know why he does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try try four five six

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'll throw  Oh, no  Oh, we gotta have we gotta have a talking to you, uh, yeah, so baby steps I guess this is this is a good  Perhaps a good starting point a good example for other states. Uh, possibly federal  Uh, you know something on more of a federal level that would that would be passed out. I don't I don't know  I don't know what this leads to but it's good. There is a federal law that was written and introduced last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it did not it's just sitting there  Um, it was pretty lame though that law was like  And everyone was like, oh we're gonna get a cyber security law. It's gonna be amazing  But basically it was like if you're gonna sell a connected device to the government  It has to I think it was like be over there updatable, which is good. Um,  and then  Oh, I can't remember all the specifics. It wasn't very powerful. It was pretty  Lame and it only applied to like a limited subset of devices that were sold to the government  so  Again  We don't have anything that's like I mean and I see why it's hard  And there are groups that are working with government agencies  Like the FDA actually has been working with very respected hacking groups  to come up with  Rules basically for medical device security  And that may be a smarter way to do it because the FDA can actually create rules  And update them and notify people at a much faster place or pace than congress can vote things into law  so  You know the the challenge though is these agencies spend a lot of time with the companies they regulate and there's you know  Will they be strong enough? I don't know but they there are several legitimate efforts to create things like  Audit trails for devices. So when something's hacked  You know know what happened to it?  Updates so making sure everything's over the air updatable  And rules around that there's rules around encryption. So so those are happening. They're just not happening through like legislation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, those are so important  Uh as we continue to see time and time again  Many examples why it's so important  Unfortunately, unfortunately it has to do with our data. So  We'll learn our lesson at some point  I thought this was good really good news on  monday qualcomm had an event to show off something that has been  A couple of years in the making the new snapdragon wear 3100  processor  The the previous one the 20 I think it was the 2100 or the 2200 has been used  More than two years now and you know people have long complained about like android  Wear os devices being slow and kind of not super responsive and just kind of lagging in development  Especially when you compare it to the watches that are doing very well samsung has its um  I think it's the gear s3 line that people seem to really like obviously, you know, there's the the stripped down fitbit  style watches that aren't like full  Encompassing smart watches or whatever but do a lot of similar stuff and then obviously  Apple which has a new series of apple watches that they announced today at an event which will not be named  At least that was my plan and I just did i'm very sorry about that  Anyways snapdragon wear 3100 was announced and I think this is this is a very big deal for wear os devices  I'm curious to know what you guys think as far as these wearables are concerned  Um, is it is it a little late to the game to fix android wear devices at this point like has  Has the ship sailed to a certain degree or do you think there's still a lot of life left in this category?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about this on this show  not quite in that but I my thought was  I mean kevin was kind of like man in the first place  But my thought was after watching what apple did today and I know this is not an apple focus show, but I was like  dang qualcomm  You look so  lame  And I feel bad. I mean, I love qualcomm, but  But man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so, okay, i'm i'm really curious to hear what you what you have to say about this because like like  explaining that that thinking because  basically the research that I did around the snapdragon wear 3100 was  Initially was for last night's show all about android and we talked about it then and it was like, okay great  Today I have been  So completely blissfully unaware of anything apple. I know that there was an apple watch. I know no details  So what did you see in the kind of new new kind of development of apple watch?  That makes you then look at what the wear 3100 offers and go meh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They kind of I mean they crammed like a 64 bit  Processor a little I mean, it's still probably sucks batteries way faster than an android wear watch  I don't have one so I don't know  And then they also developed a because apple controls its silicon  You know itself and can say hey designers. We're looking at doing this  Can you optimize the heck out of this for these, you know six use cases?  The fall detection and the I guess advanced the next-gen accelerometer and gyroscope  That is better at detecting various gestures  I don't know how much of that is like apple marketing glaze  but the end result and the features that they have with some of that was  really astonishing like the ability to like accurately detect a fall in  You know start various processes for that is something that  And the fact that this is FDA approved for a variety of the the FDA approval is mostly on the afib. I don't think it's on fall detection  but  Cheapest that's it's awesome and super compelling

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's something it's something that I think google could do with wear os but hasn't in my opinion  um, I mean ultimately we're talking about  Yeah, okay  Maybe apple has got some secret sauce in their chips and no i'm not trying to discount what they do  They do a great job in their chip design, but the fact that they  You know, they're using very similar if not the same sensors  It's all in that integration that they can do because they control the hardware the software and so on  I I  It's in the presentation  I guess it's the way and the implementation is probably the best way to say it and that's not something i've seen from  Android wear now wear os and that's why I don't have one of those watches. I actually do own an apple watch  It's the apple watch 3 with lte  It's because it just works better for what I needed to do, you know, and the four looked impressive i'm not upgrading but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looked impressive now you are an android phone  User though, right? You showed it off earlier  How how do you pull that off with the apple watch because it's not necessarily a super interoperable device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not really very interoperable  Interoperable at all. That's why kevin has two sim cards

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay. All right  Important enough to put a sim card in it. Yeah. Well, let's put it this way. I've done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my entire  Writing career i've always had multiple sim cards at one point  I had sim cards from all four carriers for review phones and my own phone  So that's not unusual for me. I didn't do that just to get the apple watch  But for a wearable that works best for me  So I just leave the iphone on the wireless charger at the house and when I leave the house  I get my calls anyway on my wrist and i'm fine or have my other phone with the android sim in it. So right  I know i'm weird. I know  And I mean, you know what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big qualcomm wear news there was like the double the dual radius. I mean, I don't know  Do you want an do you want an android wear watch? I mean, I I don't have an iphone  So i'm not going to buy an apple watch. I use a fitbit but  I I just look at this and i'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And  It's not it's not the chip that has held things back. I know people were on that bandwagon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, ron amato whom I totally respected a whole thing where he's I was like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not it's not really the chip because what is this chip and we talked about earlier on our other show  I mean, it's um  I forget it's it's a reworked architecture of an of a different chip. It's a customized version of that of that chip stacy  What was that the um?  Darn, I forget now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, hold on. I'm sorry. Well, is it a rework of the 2100 though the one beforehand or no something completely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not completely different. Basically what they've done is they've added a low powered co-processor  So that way they can so they can offload what they say is  95 of what people typically do with their watches most of the time which is very very  Light in terms of processing power needed  So if you can offload those to the lower power chips just like we do with our phones today  When you need processing power that other high powered one is there and therefore you save battery life  That's kind of it to me and that's like that's not solving where os is problem. The problem is the interface its apps  It's it's a couple of things what's great about it is is what's that?  It's boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  Yeah, it has been now google has been showing off  the new where os  Revision, so they're going through and they're doing yet another where os upgrade  So they're they've given it a facelift and I think we're starting to see that on the new phones  Especially the phones that come out with this new processor of which I think we know of one right now the montblanc  summit two  Which is not it not going to be an inexpensive wearable device. Um the the the first one was an  890 to start  Watch, you know and going up. But anyways, they've they've retooled the where os to from from a usability standpoint and  Ui and all that they've upgraded it to kind of the current  Kind of philosophy design philosophy that google's been touting with a with material  Theming and and all that so it definitely looks different. I don't know if it looks different enough though  I haven't been able to play around with it. I like what i've seen in the screenshots  But I would definitely agree stacy the previous where os and android wear before it  It was pretty boring. Like I I appreciated what google was doing which was saying  Let's not let manufacturers like skin it all to craziness and and you know  Go down the the rabbit hole that we went years ago with with android os being skinned to  You know to tiers and then it's not updatable and all these kind of other problems. Let's let's solidify it into a singular kind of design  But it just wasn't that exciting it was maybe utilitarian but not exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And on the utilitarian side they talk about this being you can swap it out of like smartwatch mode into like normal watch mode  I don't even know what we would call that  And it'll last for like a week on without like without  Having to recharge it. So traditional watch mode is what they call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so like that that kind of falls into what you're talking about which is  Look some people  They just want to watch with the slightly extra features. I don't know who those people are  I mean like I feel like you  If you want a smartwatch you're looking at like the apple, right?  And if you want like a fitness tracker, then you might do the apple or you might do fitbit if you're not in the apple ecosystem  So it's not clear  That the android wears for people who only want a smartwatch on sometimes or days

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think android wear is just for those people who are on android who feel like yeah  They need the smartwatch capabilities, but they can't do an apple watch apple doesn't  Doesn't have that interoperability and not everybody is going to be willing to get an extra sim and put it in their apple watch  Even though they have an android phone  Uh, you know, i'm sure there are other people that that do that like you do kevin but I don't know if there's an insane amount  of people doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You still need a iphone to talk it like  Yes, so you yeah, you need a spare iphone laying around

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right  I mean it's not it's not inexpensive because you have to have an iphone you have to have service for the iphone  And you're going to pay another ten dollars a month if you add lte to the watch because of the e sim in there  So yes, you're paying for convenience, but you know out of all I don't disagree with anything you guys said about the  Blondness of wear os and what it has not accomplished  I've actually owned three four, maybe even five android wear watches the issue for me and maybe again i'm an oddball  I I run every day. I exercise I use the watch to track everything  and no watch yet  Except for maybe the motorola moto active from 2012  Is is rock solid for that than the apple watch for me. I I get app crashes all kinds of problems on  On the android wear apps the same apps that I use on the apple watch that work fine. I just don't understand it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a big bummer. Yeah  I agree. I should I should point out you don't just run every day  you've run daily since

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh june 10th 2016. How do you know the date? Do you have a tattooed or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't have a tattooed on my wrist. No, it's on your it's on your twitter profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh  Yes, okay, you're correct. That was that was the day my son graduated high school  I've run since he graduated high school and he just turned 21 yesterday  So it's kind of weird that i've still kept that running streak going. Yeah, that's that's a big accomplishment. My goodness every single day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  weird is the fact that i've been with kevin like  Like at conferences and things like that and i'm like, you know, it's 11 o'clock  We're we're coming back from a bar or something, you know, not not trash or anything  But we've had like a drink or two and kevin's like, all right guys, I gotta go to my run-in and we're all like  I gotta go to bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gotta get it in before midnight, you know the clocks are ticking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I freak you out for a second you thought I just had that like jiggling around in my brain somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had no idea where you got that  I forgot it was on my profile. I saw it on your profile earlier today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the only reason that I even remembered. I was like, wow  He's a he's a like a runner very dedicated runner

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when he brought it up, I had to you got me back for the beginning of the show then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my brain does not work like that believe me I try and memorize things like that and it just doesn't work  um  What else are we missing here?  What are some fun things because there's there's some other kind of land mines in here that maybe we don't need to talk about  but uh, is there anything in here that you guys wanted to touch on before I get into the  Change log not not quite yet though karson

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh  um  Let's see  I was looking at the dongle for the stupid headphones because this is my my hill. I will die on all right. Um  I have the phone. I got the dongle. Yeah, the dongle didn't work  So I had to call google because it failed and they sent me another dongle dongle also failed  So I had to buy my own dongle  Which also failed so the fact that they're  Now offering a more expensive dongle  Yeah, I just hate this so that is all i'm just like this is  Just just please  If you can't do something like awesome airpods because the airpods are very nice  very nice  Don't take away the headphone jack, man  I mean, come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I wish I had known that you had dongle  challenges because I still have one from my essential phone that i'm not using because  I am does it work?  Yeah, as far as I know it works, uh, but I I actually went the airpods are out and I  use it with android phones and my  Watch and I run with them every day and they're pretty good. I hate to say it. I can't do the oh I went in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought  The jabra 65t headphones for like 170. Yes, and those things are awesome. Yeah, they're very solid  They do kind of  They're a little big in my ears like if I wear them for more than like two or three hours my my little  Whatever that curve in your ear bone is it it hurts  But that's about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, wait a second. So you spend 170 on wireless headphones and we're talking about a 12 dollar dongle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was trying to only spend 12 dollars actually  I have 40 pairs of normal headphones that I would just like to use  So a nine dollar dongle made a lot of sense up until it became like a 36 dollar dongle

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got vinyl albums, too. But I mean, you know, i'm still streaming music

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Special occasion you pull out the vinyl but yes your daily convenience listen is streaming  um, I mean I would I I have resisted anyone who watches or listens to all about android  For any length of time will know that I have very vehemently resisted switching to bluetooth for audio for a number of years  Up until recently when I challenged myself and I said, all right  I'm going to review a bunch of bluetooth headphones and do a shootout on screensavers because  That's the only way i'm going to get over this this thing that I have with bluetooth  And I want to find a pair that really works and yeah  The jabras were pretty much top of the heap and I use them every day now now like dongle isn't even part of my  Vocabulary dongle is if I happen to accidentally forget to charge up the case that the job is go into  Which doesn't happen because it lasts for days and days and days and at least once over that period of time  I plug it in for a couple of hours. So  um  Yeah, I don't know. I think I got over it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  I had just bought headphones like noise canceling headphones for the airplane, you know that  required a  Jack and like I was dang it  No, I gotta spend because like I feel like I have a separate set of headphones for my airplane trips with noise cancellation  And the jabras the jabras are pretty good for it. So  Yeah, they're good at isolating. They're good isolation  But I I do resent having to buy  I mean i've spent what I feel is like

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  200 on headphone gear that I feel very resentful about because I shouldn't have had to spend it because I had perfectly acceptable ones  So that's it. Yeah, that's fair  Absolutely. I'm done. I'm done complaining about dongles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and and there's it's still kind of a question mark out there, right?  Because there are some companies like it really seemed like the trend the wave was going to be  All in on you know, removing the headphone jack and sending this audio through the usbc port  um, but not everybody jumped jumped ships so we're still kind of in this  Confusing area of well some of them, you know have the the old standard but some of them are very you know  Dead set on this dongle vision of the future and uh, it's kind of hard to know  It's definitely something you still have to check for when you're buying a new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, and if I found a phone with the features and as part of the google is it  Whatever that updates automatically instead of waiting for my carrier to do it. Yeah, I would probably choose the headphone one over  One with that. I mean like it that's still actually a really even though I do have bluetooth headphones now  I still have my old ones  so  It this is I mean like I know people complain about the notch. The dongle is my notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There now we're putting it in terms people can understand there you go  All right, what do you say karson let's jump into the google change log  Oh, he wasn't ready for that  All right, i'll stretch out my uh my throw next time  Uh, this is where we check in on a few things real quick to see what google's been up to because they make a lot  Of announcements that blog that that we went to earlier is home for a lot of these announcements  Uh, but we'll just run through these real quick google home is apparently getting some new games if you're a fan of disney  If you're a fan of disney and you know, I would imagine families this is going to come in really handy  You just say hey g  Play and then there's a bunch of new disney games. Maui's music game toy story freeze dance  My kids have played the freeze dance game. They love it. I'm playing a lot, but  It's pretty awesome disney princess. Apparently i'm not really quite sure what that's about  But i'm sure my kids would love that too  I think overall the big challenge here is actually remembering that those games exist like remembering the right thing to say  And everything because that's that's my big challenge with google home  It's capable of so many things but I can never remember how to get the thing that I want because there's so many of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're playing freeze dance tonight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh  Yeah, uh good make sure and uh put it up on youtube because everyone will want to see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google assistant language support is widening now. They've added support for both danish and norwegian languages  Uh and google is of course working to  Um, it made a promise to bring google home to some of these regions by the end of 2018  This language support obviously is a very critical step in making that happen  So one step closer to widening the market for uh google home and google assistant  I'm holding out for latin. Yeah that still not  Not yet. No, no latin yet. I mean actually when you look at the the language support, it's a pretty small list  So i'm not surprised  Google news, which I would argue is one of my favorite of of the latest  Kind of wave of google apps. I use it  I use it more than I want to use it because it's such a good app  I've actually set it up with digital well-being to use it only an hour a day because if I don't have that on there  Like i'll continue to read the news and sometimes that doesn't make me feel good to read the news  But it's such a great app. They did such a good job with it. Anyways  Uh, four new core features are set to arrive in the next couple of weeks. It's all about saving data  So if you're using google news  And you want to save your data on the go?  That's kind of what these features are. There's a youtube go functionality  That will use by default so that'll kind of have lighter connection requirements newscast  Which is the story previews function is going to be more text focused  When you're on mobile so it saves on data doesn't load all those heavy images  Speaking of images and video images are going to be compressed by default videos and gifs won't auto play when you're on mobile  So but if you want them to you can tap on them and they'll load  Upon a tap and then you can save articles to read later and those would download when you're on wi-fi, which  I'm kind of surprised that wasn't there. I guess I assumed it was there, but I just wasn't using it  But apparently it wasn't there  the the read it later functionality  So that's good and then finally I this was just kind of neat. Um, I don't know how many times you guys have played the chrome dino

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jumping game when you have every kid in my kid my child's class plays that game and loves it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Heck yeah, because it's right there. You you know, it's I think you can turn it off  I think there's some way to disable it, but no one ever does  No, why would you it's fun? Well, I know but but that's  It's pretty awesome there's a there's an interview with uh, I think the guy that that created the the  The dino or the dino game four years ago, and I just thought that a couple of facts were interesting  270 million games are played every month  Most of those happen to happen in uh markets with go figure unreliable internet  So, you know it appears when you don't have that connectivity and then the game is programmed  I don't know if this was a joke or not  But i'm i'm set to believe him when he said that the game is programmed to max out at 17 million years  Which is the amount of time that t-rex was alive on earth  Wow, so when you say max out, what does that mean if you were to play for 17 million years you would reach the end?  okay, so  Somebody get started

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we get 17 million or 17 million people each playing for a year?  So it'd be like 17 million man years. I I don't think it works like that though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We wouldn't reach the end and if you do reach the end do you get like a message like you made it?  What's the future like?  The dinosaur walks into a grave  All right, that was the google change log  All right, uh, let's take a moment to thank the sponsor and then we'll get back and do some tips and tricks and  I guess we won't have a number today because jeff still  Is is still away enjoying his time in austin and not fighting the internet  This episode of this week in google is brought to you by last pass  What is your company doing to ensure passwords are being shared responsible?  Responsibly appropriately. I know we're using we're using last pass. I've been using last pass for years personally last pass enterprise makes password sharing  convenient for employees while keeping access to corporate data  Secure it even allows for full customization of access including the ability to set a master password requirement  Enable password resets restrict access when that happens to be needed  You can configure over 100 policies access security reports and you can create shared folders  So everyone's on the same page with the same passwords across the enterprise organized database logins ssh keys  Software licenses and business information  And I actually just set this up today on my business account. I've had it on my personal account for a while  You can further protect your business with multi-factor authentication with the last pass authenticator app a verification button  Pops up on an employee's phone to guarantee they are the only ones with access to their accounts. It's actually very easy  If credentials are compromised the app ensures outsiders will not have access  Super important stuff, especially when you consider all your passwords are there. You might as well protect it as much as you can  Multi-factor is awesome for that  The last pass password generator again. I use this daily because it makes it so easy  It's super easy to to use to create unique random passwords  So that you know employees don't have to remember or write one down if they have to like write their own chances are  They're probably going to choose one that they've already written before because it's easy to remember or that is just out of habit  And in this case employees can log into last pass with their microsoft active directory credentials  So they truly only have one password to remember and uh, you know in in doing so that password generator  You can set it to be super secure with all sorts of extra characters and all that stuff data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level  It's also stored in the vault and kept secret even from last pass  There's easy onboarding to password auto fill last pass makes it easy for businesses to take control passwords and reduce the threat of breach  And the ios 12 and android oreo auto fill functionality makes it easier for employees  To seamlessly use last pass across multiple mobile devices  I use it on many devices and it's awesome to have that auto fill functionality to just kick in when you need it  When you open an app or you visit a mobile site the keyboard itself will offer your username or password as an auto fill option  Similar to what autocorrect looks like now  So that way you don't have to copy and paste from your last pass app. It just kind of brings it in naturally  Last pass also offers last pass premium for personal use last pass families for your entire family and last pass teams  For teams of 50 or fewer and it's awesome. I actually just moved us  Our family over to last pass family, so we're using that now and uh, it's it's awesome  It's a game changer more than 13 million people trust last pass the number one most preferred password manager  You can learn more by going to lastpass.com  Today check it out and make sure that your password  Your passwords are more secure. That's lastpass.com  Slash twit and see which product is right for you and we thank last pass for their support of this week in google  All right, let's see here down to the bottom of the dock and we'll start with you kevin  You have a tip and we we had a little tease forward to the tip. So tell us all about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do have a tip. Um, and actually jeff does have a number. How many times did he call into this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question  I don't know. I'm guessing like five six

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's your number  There we go. Yeah, all right that works. So so so I may be a little overzealous when it comes to security  However, I I did splurge and spend the 50 on the titan security key bundle which recently arrived  That's the box. It's actually a little magnetic box just like the pixel book box, which is kind of a nice touch  but you don't buy it for the box you buy it for the uh, the usb  and the bluetooth and nfc both of these are nfc actually, um, so one is usb one is bluetooth  And you can set these up for two-factor authentication just like you can with a ub key or any other comparable key  um  A lot of people don't realize even though two-factor authentication is really to prevent phishing for your online passwords  If you think about it a chromebook is being signed in with your online password being your google password  So what I started doing about six months ago and again not this is not for everybody  I set up two-factor authentication using the  Google support page, which is easy to find  And  There's a way to say do not trust this computer  Or do not remember don't ask again on this computer by not checking that every time I log into my chromebook  I do have to insert my  usb key or use the new titan with with bluetooth, but what that does is that that actually  Eliminates the possibility of anybody ever logging into your chromebook. I even have it set up  There's options in chrome to not show your email address  Which typically it would when you boot up and also to completely disable guest mode  I've done all that so literally if you were to open on my chromebook, you don't even know my  Email address so all those things together really maximize the security of a chromebook  Because once somebody gets in there then they can go to passwords.google.com if you don't have two factors set up  Get all your passwords. It's right there. So  I I would say consider it if you're going to buy one of these keys actually use it keep it separate from your chromebook  but don't  Allow it to remember your chromebook use it every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good tip one thing I should point out on on using that with the pixel book is that the pixel book has a usb c port  And those keys are not usb c right? So you're going to need a dongle  Here we are again dongle world

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a lot of people are unhappy about this. You are absolutely correct and included in the box  You do get a type a to type c adapter  I actually understand why google did this  Because we're in a transition right now. And yes, all the newer chromebooks have usb c but think of the  Probably tens of millions that do not  Yeah, that's true the quickest way to secure the entire quote-unquote fleet of chromebooks out there is to do it this way usb a with an adapter  So I think it was a smart move on their part. I understand the gripes, but it was a smart move

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I just saw a picture last week of uh, you know  Just an awesome pixel book and then the stacked dongles coming out of the port and they're just like, oh I just  It doesn't look nearly as polished as it will someday it will someday at some point  No, it won't because i'll keep changing interfaces I hate everybody  Man  fine  Uh, what's uh, what you got on on in store for us stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of things that change all the time and are unreliable. I have a smart home device for you  This is the brilliant  Controller, um, I had hoped to have a review finished for you guys so I could just point to that  Look for it tomorrow at stacy on iot  But  Here's i've got it installed downstairs, but I have one here in front of me so you guys can see it  This is actually just the faceplate  For the device these grooves here. Nope these grooves here  Our capacitive touch this is to fit on a two gang light switch. So that means there's two switches in it  Um, and this is going to turn whatever light is on and off from there  You can actually program these for other lights should you not care about the light that is  in the switch  Um this here integrates. It's a five inch touch screen  That offers you control for a lot of smart devices such as the ring doorbell the ecobee thermostat  Um, since this is twig  They will have a nest integration, but they don't have it just yet  Sonos wemo  smart things hub all of these  And it also has a microphone and a speaker in it so you can use it as a way to talk to madam a  I  Think it's doing a little too much. This is the this one in my hand is  349 um the one gang switch which is basically just a touch screen  Is 300 or 299  It's a lot for I think anyone the user interface needs a little bit of work  But it does have a very clear picture  So if you're like really wanting a beautiful light switch, it also doubles as an intercom  so if you have multiples of these in your house, you can be like  Hey  Brilliant wake up the kids they show this in a video and then the the other brilliance at other rooms because they've set up a scene  They turn on the lights in the kids room and it starts to glow and it's very compelling and cool  getting from  Unboxing to that particular video coolness  Is going to be very counterintuitive and take a lot of work, but you could do it and it would be fun  um  So that's that's kind of the thought I think in about six months  I would re re take another look at this and be like, oh I totally could have this now  But right now it's probably for like the diehard smart home people  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called the brilliant switch. So is the idea that you'd have one of these in every room basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know  You don't need it in every room. That's actually what's kind of cool  Like when I installed it, it actually detected the wemo light switch. I still have in my master bedroom  um, and it was like if I hit  The lighting button on this thing when I was walking up to the light that's installed down downstairs at my stairs  It would actually show me like a little  Dimmer switch for my master bedroom and my stair light because it knew what was there so you could actually  Use one or two of them and control all the lights in your house  I don't think that's really an awesome way to go about it because you still probably want to control the lights in your room  but  It's kind of neat. Yeah, I mean you'd probably want  One for places like in your kitchen area maybe in your kids bedrooms  I don't love that. It has a camera in it.
