Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig.  This Week in Google.  Episode 35 for March 28, 2010.  Dancing naked money.  This is Twig.  This Week in Google to show the covers of everything in the Googleverse and the cloud  as well.  Joining us right now, we're really glad to have the usual cast of characters, including  Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com and the author of What Would Google Do?  The author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com, Gina Trapani,  founder of Lifehacker and blogger at Smarterware.org.  Hi Gina.  Hi.  And our special guest this week, always welcome, love having him, from British Telecom, former  Googler and appler, Mr. Kevin Marks.  And every time I introduce you, Kevin, I've got to also say the father of podcasting,  because he was the first to demonstrate using an RSS feed with enclosures to distribute  audio files.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Onto an iPod.  Onto an iPod.  That was the key.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was the piece I added.  You beat Adam and Dave and everybody else.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, I was working with them.  They were making the feeds at the time.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess if there weren't something to do to show.  So you're one of a triumvirate of podfathers.  Well, this was the week that Google finally pulled the plug.  I didn't credit all the bloggers who said 99.9% certainty that Google will pull the  plug on China.  But it's true.  A couple of weeks later, on Monday this week, Google finally said, all right, we're going  to take all of the filtered results at Google.cn and forward people to Google.hk, which is  unfiltered.  China's response immediately was, we wish people would adhere to our law.  Have they blocked Google yet, though?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you go to the FriendFeed Leo, there is a page that Google put up showing current  status and mainland service, mainland China service availability.  It's Google.com slash PRC.  So it says that web search is up.  YouTube is still down.  It has been down.  Sites is down.  As is bloggers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, by web search being up, does that mean that it's redirecting to Hong Kong?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would guess so, since that's what they're doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it means that China could, and I'm sure will at some point, just say, hey, if it's  Google.hk, you're not getting in.  I mean, they're already blocking Google.com.  So if it's Google.hk, you can't get in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do we know whether or not they're doing that yet?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  No, I was just asking you, do we know whether or not they're blocking hk yet?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it says they're not, according to Google.  But Kevin, you said you thought they were.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They were blocking stuff that goes to it.  So what they're doing is they're blocking certain searches.  So they do keyword-based blocking as well.  So depending on what you search for, it may not get through.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you search for Falun Gong, even though you're on Google.hk, you're not going to see any results.  Yeah.  It's what they do with CNN.  They don't block CNN in China.  It's just if something they don't like is on CNN, it just goes black.  Yeah.  You're sitting in the hotel room.  You're watching CNN International.  All of a sudden it goes black for two minutes and it comes back.  And you know, well, Sunny must have been talking about something the Chinese government didn't like.  It's not even subtle yet.  No, it's not.  It's obvious.  And everybody in China knows that that's what's happening.  It's just the...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, how many people do they have doing this?  It seems like this giant game of like losing game of whack-a-mole.  I mean, they've got to have hundreds and hundreds of people figuring out what's OK and what's not and blocking it.  I mean, am I being totally naive?  I mean, I'm sure that a lot of it is automated, but...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, they got a lot of people in China.  China is full of...  In fact, if there's one resource China has, it's people.  It's people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's made of people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's that page, Mainland China Service Availability.  And you know, those still green check marks is all the way across for web search.  But I guess that would mean merely that the service is getting there, not whether it's being somewhat...

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Rebecca McKinnon's...  Congressional testimony on this.  I just put the link in.  Yeah, I see your link here.  That was very good because she discusses what it's actually like inside China.  That's definitely worth reading.  So she talks about a bunch of things that they do, which is like even more subtle, even more insidious.  I'm trying to remember the exact phrase.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's a Princeton professor.  Is she in China right now?  She goes back and forth.  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  She teaches there and of course former CNN journalist and producer.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I follow her on Twitter.  Rebecca is great and knows her stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  She was one of the founders with Ethan Zuckerman of Global Voices at the Harvard-Burkman Center.  Of course.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So she talks about the Chinese refer to it as self-discipline.  So they don't actually give you a blacklist.  They just say you should know what to block.  So part of the point of this is that it's a chilling effect.  It's not a, you know, they have they have some automated blacklist stuff.  But the other thing is if something gets through and they will hold you responsible for it as an ISP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when you say you, it means the ISP.  Yes.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So are there independent ISPs in China?  I'm not sure.  You know, how independent anything is in China is subject to question.  But the point is, if you can, if you run a business there that connects stuff to the Internet,  you're expected to have self-discipline about what is shown.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Self-censorship due to surveillance.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  And backed up by surveillance and backed up, as you say, by people actually looking at it and complaining to the government and passing stuff back and forth as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They expect you to rat on your customers.  And of course, they also have recently implemented a requirement that if you want to have a Wi-Fi access point in China,  you've got to submit a picture, photo ID.  I mean, you know, you've got to basically register with the police.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the only company that's followed Google, it's had the guts to follow Google, of course, is oddly enough, GoDaddy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, now, wait a minute.  If you ask me, this was the most cynical thing.  Bob Parsons is known for this crap.  Cynical like, oh, no, wait a minute.  It's point one.  It's point zero one percent of their business.  Nobody registers domain.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it does say this better principle that if you register domains in China, they have to hand over full ID and photos and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they say, well, we're not going to play.  But really, it's a press release.  It's not. It costs them nothing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  By the way, that was just their way of saying, we're the first company to follow suit with Google.  They were just trying to ride the coattails.  That's my opinion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to give them any credit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think their commercials were getting blocked and they had to leave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Danica Patrick is not allowed.  No, I think this is this.  I mean, GoDaddy is the most one of the most cynical, repulsive marketing companies ever.  And I completely.  I think you're being cynical now.  Gina knows what I'm talking about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am right there with you.  Right there with you.  I'm loving this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I give them no credit whatsoever.  Google, on the other hand, you know, and there was some debate.  We were talking on Windows Weekly and Paul Thurotte saying to a little too late.  I give Google a lot of credit, regardless of the fact that they didn't do it early on.  And there was a great article in The Wall Street Journal that says it's Sergey Brin that is that is the was the force behind getting out of China.  That even though they didn't do it and there was some internal dissent, this is a publicly held company turning its back on the world's largest Internet market.  There are more Internet users in China than there are people in the US.  And I, you know, it's it's not an easy thing to do as a publicly held company.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's I think it is that Leo and more.  I wrote a column for The Guardian that will be on Monday.  Arguing that that Google is acting as the ambassador.  I've said this show before from the Internet to the world and is in fact defending the Internet and defending Internet principles.  And as I thought that through, you know, in essence, what Google has done is defended the Internet principles that Google itself has set.  And I don't mean to make a bad analogy here, but I think it's a good analogy for other reasons.  If you compare companies divesting in South Africa during apartheid.  And again, I don't mean to say that cyber repression is the same as physical and economic and racial repression in South Africa.  Nonetheless, it came to a point where companies said that we cannot do this.  As a congressman said this week in the US, it's one matter to go along with the laws, another matter to to help them do what they're doing.  And so in South Africa, we had the Sullivan principles.  The Sullivan principles were set forth saying that company, if you want to do business in South Africa, you must do the following.  Or you have to leave or we're going to divest your stock here in the rest of the world.  You had to be able to employ people of all races and under good conditions and so on.  And so what happened there was that there ended up being a popular movement in campuses and other places to get companies to divest South Africa.  So it occurred to me that we really need our own set of principles, our own kind of Bill of Rights, which I put on my blog this afternoon.  My humble first crack at it.  But our our idea principles and until we see a popular movement to support freedom on the Internet all around, not just China, then I think we're going to see Google standing alone.  And I think it's I'm rather ashamed of our government are and companies, but mainly of us as Internet users that we have not stood up with Google on these matters of high principle.  And they are that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You agree, Gina, you think that Google is not not being cynical and that they're actually this is a bold, brave thing to do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do agree, but you know what? I'm going to play devil advocate, right?  So the opposite the opposite argument, the opposite way to look at it is that by pulling out of China, they're going against their corporate mission, right?  Which is to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful to everyone.  I could see and I don't necessarily think that, but I can see somebody saying if Google can make some of the world's information accessible in China on their terms, shouldn't they be?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think that their terms. That was the problem, Gina.  They couldn't. And so what they said was these are our terms and our principles.  We will serve you in China, but only under our principles, not yours, China.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, right now, Google's got the best of both worlds.  They're still doing business in China. They're still usable.  And a few things are filtered and they can say, hey, we did it.  And we haven't lost the way they should have done it originally.  Yeah. Kevin, what do you think?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, I think that's I think this is a personal thing for Sergey.  I think that that is true. I think he was he was always the one pulling back on that and they've talked about that before.  And so that makes sense for him to be leading the discussion of it in public.  The other I think Jeff's bill of I just read Jeff's bill of rights thing through and I think that that's a that's a very good thing.  I mean, something I want to link that up to was something I wrote this week,  which was comparing the Rebecca's stuff about China with the proposed digital economy bill in the UK,  where they are proposing to let people arbitrarily disconnect.  Now, it's not government censorship. In this case, it's it's music industry censorship.  Copyright holders can take you off the net and it's like sort of DMCA worse.  But they are also dashing it through parliament without any debate because the parliament is about to be shut down for the election.  And so they're going to try and get this bill through on the nod without anyone debating it in the House of Commons.  So what is the bill? What does the bill say?  The bill let me give you my personal look at. Hang on.  It's it's I mean, it's it's not well written. I wouldn't I wouldn't quite it at least.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kevin, Kevin, you're slumming it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's written in a British it's written in a British accent.  So it's going to be you know, it's going to sound good even if it's not.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So we're going to pay us a branching junction against a service provider requiring it to prevent access to online locations  specified in the order of the court for the prevention of online copyright infringement.  The court shall order the service provider to pay the copyright owners costs of the application unless there are exceptional circumstances  justifying the service providers failure to prevent access despite notifications by the copyright owner.  So they're basically asking for the ability to get an injunction that the copyright holders costs can be paid if they get that injunction  and that the copyright holders expect to be able to demand that the ISP takes down take not just takes down but blocks access to a site on allegation before they go to court.  That's this is clause 18 of the bill. So that's that's sort of big and pretty scary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This isn't exactly actor but it but it's it's along the lines of actor.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I mean if you want to look at passing the enabling legislation for actor it's definitely along the same lines.  The actor stuff that was released includes a whole bunch of steps that match these fairly well.  So the post that I that I did is I was basically comparing Rebecca's China stuff to the to the clauses here and the parallels as kind of scary.  Yeah. You got it. OK. Yeah. So right here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  BPI is China like clauses. This is the the the BPI is the is the digital the British phone the graphic industry.  That's what they're called. It's the the phone a graphic industry is right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  She's Louise. So you know if you actually this bill is is is is a fairly nasty bit of legislation anyway.  I read about it before. It also had like sort of backstop clauses in it that let the minister make up any any law he wanted subsequently.  Some of those have been removed. The second thing they have is that they have this sort of idea of self discipline as well.  They're basically trying to eat away at what you call common carrier here what we call mere conduit in Europe which is if I'm an ISP I'm not liable for what people post online.  And you know there's the DMC notes and takedown model which is there isn't there are not actually copying that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well they say you have to take reasonable steps to prevent copyright infringement.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Exactly. So they're trying to sort of bring in this intermediary liability thing.  And then the other thing that they've got is is they've got clauses that enable them to take over the dot UK registrar if they feel like it.  Oh based on the Secretary of State deciding it's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So UK registrar is currently not run by the.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's not it's not it's not run directly by the government. It's run by a nominate.  And you know it's like it's a it's it's kind of like I can.  I don't know the details really well but it is it's semi independent. It's not as it's not a government owned piece.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they give they give some criteria for why that may happen.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Right. But it's you know it's arbitrary. The Secretary of State can make it up and they they say practices that are unfair involve the misuse of domains.  If it's likely to adversely affect the reputation of available electronic communication networks in the United Kingdom.  So basically the Secretary of State gets to decide what is misused and what is reputation and can then take over the registrar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it really is like the Chinese. It's very much like the Chinese government.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There's sort of very much a lack of due process stuff here. It's like OK we're going to put a law that says we can take over your business if we feel like it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But this isn't a long tradition of British. I mean the government. I just saw pirate radio.  I love pirate radio. What a wonderful movie. At which one point one of the British ministers say well we just make a law.  We don't like it. OK we just make it up. Yeah that's the point. Exactly.  Says that's the point of being the government. We just make a law. Well the parallel is very exact.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I mean it's interesting that the record industry is on the opposite side of it this time around. Isn't it funny.  So Radio Carolina in the 60s was the reason we call it piracy is because they were broadcasting out for international waters.  So they were called pirate radio because they were outside legal jurisdiction and they were playing rock and roll.  So it's you know at that time this was this was how the record industry got their music out.  Right. So for them you know and suddenly like 40 years later we're they're on the opposite side of this battle.  No more piracy. No. So somebody said this week we should stop calling them pirates.  It's like well you started calling them pirates in the first place but it came from pirate radio.  It wasn't you know we didn't suddenly become cool afterwards.  This is something that used to be called what happened to you. Is there sort of reaction there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had we have had a fun time on Twitter trying to come up with a salute a substitute for the word piracy.  And I can't remember what we came up with but it was suitably kind of euphemistic.  You know I can't remember.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think it is a question begging thing you know but piracy piracy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Data molesters. We call them data molesters.  You got your child molesters. You got your data molesters. You're equally bad.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You want to be careful that someone were using that in parliament in the week I'm sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh absolutely. In fact it's always been you know child pornography is always a stalking horse for all of this.  Or in the case of China just pornography in general. Well we're not blocking anything but pornography.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Right. That was the Chinese government's response. Every government blocks pornography and sedition and then a list of things that nobody else blocks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look you can't see Nazi memorabilia in Germany. So why should you be able to see Tiananmen Square in China.  I like so let's go through your Bill of Rights Jeff. Maybe you want to clarify.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The only point was that we need some set of principles and I'm not saying it comes from governance at all.  Rebecca had talked about after you have John Perry Barlow's Declaration of Independence for Cyprus base.  Rebecca had talked about a constitution but I think that goes against the tenets of what Barlow says which is that we don't have governance we have freedom.  But it did occur to me that we do need some level of principles to at least contrast government action to and company action to at various times.  So I guess down at a fairly simple level I can cut it to its quick is that we need to claim and secure our freedom to connect speak assemble and act online.  I need to control our own identities and data. We need to be able to speak our languages.  We need to protect both of what is public and private and we need to assure openness.  Yeah. That's the that's the Reader's Digest version of what all those 10 things say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know I've I've I did it tongue in cheek but it becomes more and more real.  I've suggested that the Second Amendment which is the right to bear arms should really be modified the right to bear data and that ultimately in the long run you know the whole point of the Second Amendment was to fight tyranny and make sure that the populace was armed.  I think the best way to fight tyranny these days is with a free and open Internet.  Yes. Love that. Love that. Maybe that's the new Second Amendment.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. Right there with you on that.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You know that was the whole encryption thing from the 90s wasn't it.  It was they decided that encryption was ammunition and therefore could not be exported from the US.  And that was eventually fought back.  But then if you're going to if you're going to treat this stuff like a like arms then you then we should make sure that we have the same protections there.  That's a very US centric view though in the UK.  The right to bear arms.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This whole idea of bills and declarations and things against your countrymen is so US centric.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  1688 Bill of Rights in the UK is what it's all based on.  It does track back through.  I think it goes back to the Magna Carta.  Well that was my other blog post.  I did the Digital Economy Bill compared to the Magna Carta as well.  Oh I like that.  That was a lot of fun because the Magna Carta is actually very liberal.  This law does not.  Who's the nobles this time around though?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Us?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well you know the irony is that the that this was proposed by Baron Mandelson.  This was the Labour government brought back Peter Mandelson from the European Commission.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're kidding the Magna Carta was suggested by a Baron named Mandelson?  No no no.  Oh OK.  Now that would be good.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  The Digital Economy Bill was suggested by Baron Mandelson after the Labour government gave him a peerage to get him back into the politics because he couldn't be elected anymore.  Right.  And Magna Carta has these really nice clauses about trivial offences and we should not seek to procure from anyone either by our own efforts or by those of a third party anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished.  Should such a thing be procured it should be null and void and we will no time make use of it.  So it has you know they have an escape clause that's the opposite.  He has an escape clause that says I can make up new law if I feel like it and they have an escape clause that says if we do something that infringes your liberties then it's expressly illegal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So it's you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Freedom is an old idea I guess is what we can say and that the means of freedom change over time.  But the concept is the same and I think free and open Internet I think we anybody who listens to this show can agree is a vital has become a vital freedom.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So when we face the lack not only the lack of freedom that the Chinese have but the implications of hacking and all that on the Internet and what's happening in the UK now.  Who has who was fighting for this.  Where's where's where's the popular outcry on behalf of our Internet it's ours to lose.  And so right now we have I think just Google again operating because as usual they kind of fill in the void that no one else is filling and so so they're standing up they're acting as as ambassador or army.  But to what principles their own.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I still salute them I think God bless someone is we have someone has to do it someone has to fight for the Internet.  But I'm rather ashamed of our community that we're not out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well there is there is a site I'm trying to find it there was a Mandelson Annie Mandelson site.  You probably know what it was.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There was there was there was if the Open Rights Group is open rights that was the one yeah.  Open rights open rights open rights.org I think.  Open rights group.org I think it is essentially yes you're right.  Open rights group.org is it or so we can get it or because that would be weird.  But it's the open the open rights group.  Yeah that's it.  So there's they've been helping coordinate the opposition there's lots of other opposition groups but I'm I'm involved with them.  I'm on the technical advisory board and have been involved since its founding.  And this is this is a big campaign issue for them.  But the challenge is that all the three front benches of the main parties in the UK are sewn up with this.  So it's actually very yeah.  It's a it's the property.  It's right.  A lobby the lobby the individual MPs in the UK to get them to actually say no hang on a minute.  We're not going to rush this through in 45 minutes on the last day of Parliament before the election.  Can we actually stop this and go back for a debate because there's a whole bunch of controversial stuff in it.  So the Open Rights Group is kind of the EFF of the yeah that was that was the original sort of thinking the EFF is a bit more loyally.  The EFF employs a lot of lawyers and actually a lot of legal challenges.  The the Open Rights Group is is more like policy and debate.  OK. That's actually so they're more like Epic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe more like Epic than EFF.  Yeah maybe.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well it was founded with the intention of being a British EFF.  That was that was Danny O'Brien who works for the EFF over here or didn't until recently.  Right.  Was one of the original person who proposed it in the UK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We interviewed him on Floss and talked a lot about this.  Yeah.  On Floss Weekly our open source.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Father of life hacks.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't know that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Danny coined the term life hacks.  Oh that's neat.  Yeah. He's the whole reason why life hacker exists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah it all comes around.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah it sure does.  It sure does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the things that's always wonderful about that and maybe it's a bad sign Jeff to your point is that it's such a small group of people doing everything right.  We all know each other.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've been kind of fascinated by the reaction of the people like did you see there's a Guardian piece called How China's Internet Generation Broke the Silence and there are these photos of Chinese people leaving flowers on the  Google logo outside the Google China office.  Wow.  Which struck me as I was like that was so brave.  Would I have shown up there and done that with people taking pictures and media.  I don't know that I would have.  But I love this piece is a graph kind of halfway down the story that talked about the ways that people post about this online with and go around the sensors.  Right.  So this is the thing that I want to know is like how many how are the Internet savvy people getting around this this problem.  And I kind of love this.  It said users are increasingly creative in the ways that they elude restraints perhaps using analogies to discuss topics and increasingly open in their mockery of them.  Deleted sites have been quote unquote been harmonized in reference to calls for a harmonious society.  Sensors are referred to as river crabs because in Chinese those two words together form a homophone for harmony.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Chinese is by the way wonderfully suited to this kind of stuff.  It's a language that's made for misdirection and I mean it's because it's a great history of it.  So I'm not surprised that they've chosen that.  I can't suppress this stuff.  It's like water.  You cannot suppress it in the long run.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina do you go back to what you said before.  I'll put it bluntly.  How cynical are you about about about Google's motives in this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not very.  I probably should be a little more skeptical skeptical.  I should too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it was more devil's advocate.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah I think I think they're doing the right thing.  I think they're doing it for the right reasons.  I buy it.  But but I think that it's important to to to think about you know what the what what the implications are for people who you know depend on Google for their business in China.  And you know if you think about their corporate model if you think about it I mean there is an argument for people to say they should have just stayed under China's terms and and and kept going in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was somehow by being present there.  This might by the way it's Microsoft's argument for staying in it's you know let's not forget that Google did the right thing but Microsoft Yahoo and 100 other companies have not.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it's like trying to change from the inside right.  So this is always the debate.  Do you go in and compromise and try to change from the inside or just you walk out and say I'm not I don't want anything to do with you.  But if there's never pressure against the regime.  Sorry Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If there's never pressure against the regime there will be no change.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you do both.  You do both.  If Microsoft wants to change from within.  OK.  What are they going to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where I get sitting.  Yeah.  Microsoft is in there just lobbying for free speech.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know the real reason Microsoft's in there because Microsoft software is the most pirated software in China.  They lose billions of dollars a year in China.  And so their position is well the only way we can try to change this is by keeping a good relationship with the regime and trying to get them to make better copyright laws in China which is never going to happen.  Microsoft.  Right.  But that's you know I'm sure that's the main rep.  So not to change the subject too much but Google's Eric Schmidt and Apple's Steve Jobs.  We're seeing today according to Gizmodo look at these paparazzi shots sold to Gizmodo for a mere million dollars.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is today at a Palo Alto coffee shop.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There's no doubt that that is that is that black thing on the table and I've had a well that was the question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It turns out it was not decided.  It's a menu.  It was yes.  This was yesterday yesterday and it was a menu.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then there was all this body language analysis.  That's what I loved.  That's what I love.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gizmodo brought in a body language expert to analyze it.  She looked at hundreds of shots of Schmidt and Jobs in different situations.  Her name is Janine Driver former officer for alcohol tobacco and firearms.  Here's the best conclusion that she says in this in this whole thing.  Schmidt is obviously scared of Steve Jobs.  She says because of their shoulders there's no way to hide it.  Schmidt is scared of Jobs.  He's rolling his shoulders forward to make himself a smaller target.  Something Janine Driver has seen in law enforcement when criminals are around the police.  Gizmodo said well is the table affecting how they're crossing their legs.  No I've been analyzing this for years.  There's no question in her mind.  There's no question in her mind that that that there is only 33 percent openness.  She said that's only because when you're conversing with somebody you can't protect your neck.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know I like the idea of Steve terrorizing Eric.  I don't think that's what's going on.  It's hysterical.  I mean that is kind of a delightful idea but that seems a little far-fetched.  I mean the point that they brought up was that these two met at a coffee shop outside like sitting outside.  It did seem like an interesting choice of places to meet.  It was a neutral ground but also I mean did they not expect that folks were going to snap photos of them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You always want to say okay now that someone's taking their picture okay we can leave now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well apparently they were gathering a crowd.  At one point Schmidt says or maybe Jobs says let's take this somewhere more private so they go in.  But apparently I mean maybe they were just getting coffee.  Maybe it was just a coincidence.  I can't believe that.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah coffee is a bit of a pain you have to make it yourself but the Apple campus has great coffee.  And Mountain View is not that close.  It's pretty serious stuff.  Some things were overheard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It sounded like Steve.  Well here's one of the overheard quotes from Steve Jobs enthusiastically.  They're going to see it all eventually so who cares how they get it.  I don't know naked pictures.  I don't know what he's talking about.  And then let's go discuss this somewhere more private.  I should know who traveled.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This was closer to whose headquarters.  This is Steve hangs out in Palo Alto.  He lives there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He has a house there.  This was Eric traveling.  It was Eric getting to his neighborhood maybe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where does Eric live?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does he live on Woodside?  It's closer to Google than it is to Apple but it's close to Steve.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah it's like right by his house.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He walks down this street all the time.  Well it's not like he's going to be able to get to the house.  He walks down this street all the time.  Actually no it was in the Town and Country Shopping Center.  He has no reason to be there.  You think Steve Jobs goes to a shopping center?  Or Eric Schmidt for that reason?  Where's the limousines parking?  This was a meeting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean this is what we have right?  These are our celebrities.  This is the spades.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The man's got to buy the turtleneck somewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No no I think he has people to do that.  I swear to God this is an intentional meeting.  There's no way Eric Schmidt and Steve Jobs show up at a coffee bar in a shopping mall without planning.  You don't buy that huh?  Alright enough celebrity analysis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if it was planned was it their effort to say to the world we're not really enemies?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah it could be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right so it's...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a response to the New York Times article of last week.  Exactly.  And apparently Steve...  I mean in fact the pictures are he's like gesticulating which is Steve.  Obviously Eric's like sitting there with his hands in his lap quietly.  Yes yes go ahead Steve iPad.  Yes I know I know I know.  Talk more about the iPad.  I would have loved it if Steve had an iPhone on the table and Eric had had a Nexus One on the table.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh that would have been awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact in February the numbers are out.  I don't want to steal your number Jif.  Is this one of your numbers?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I come up with a whole bunch of them Leo and I hide them under rocks.  That's fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead.  That the iPhone was outsold by the Nexus One in February.  I mean that's not a huge surprise.  The Nexus One is newer and you know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As the story said everybody who wants an iPhone has an iPhone so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nevertheless I think that's still a big story.  It's starting to take off.  And the Nexus One is going to be on Sprint now and Verizon and it is now available for AT&T.  Unlike the iPhone.  When does Sprint and Verizon happen?  No one knows.  My sources said that it would be available on Verizon today and I don't think that's happening.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I have been told end of March as well.  I think that they said that in Davos or something like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Sprint is very soon too.  I think Sprint is an interesting play.  Sprint is not a 4G phone though.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right?  That would be cool.  I don't think it is.  That would be a leap ahead for Sprint.  Sprint does have 4G.  Sprint has 4G.  That's the question.  Or the iPhone is 4G or not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  If they would make a 4G.  I suspect it's not because I think they are going to make the same phone for Verizon and Sprint.  They are both on CDMA.  And of course Verizon is going to use LTE.  Sprint is going to use WiMAX for their 4G networks.  So it seems like you would have to put different chips in them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So speaking of Apple while we are on that.  I just saw I think Mashable said that the ship date for the iPad is now moved to April 12th.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not exactly right.  Ship dates until April 3rd.  But if you order today you won't get it until April 12th.  In other words they have sold out the first shipment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  They have sold out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there were rumors varying anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 for the first manufacturing run.  And that's fairly close to the numbers that these bloggers who are counting serial numbers are coming up with.  That's pretty good for initial sell through.  Pre-order.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you ordered how many of them Leo?  Four.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Four.  You only get two.  I had a shill order two more for me.  For this show next week I will either have one or it will arrive during the show.  Live unboxing.  This is my favorite meta moment.  Live unboxing.  Live unboxing of the iPad right here.  My favorite meta moment is the Wall Street Journal reporting that sources close to the Wall Street Journal say.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What now?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He couldn't just say our sources?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Either they got a great firewall or this is just a joke.  Sources in the know tell us that, like the guy sitting next to me, that the Wall Street Journal iPad application will be selling access to the journal for $17.99 a month, which is about the same as web-based access to the journal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's more than the web-based access.  Is it?  Yeah, which is what's absurd.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought the web was $175 a year.  What are they going to have?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Dancing naked money?  How do you make it worth more than the web?  That's a good point.  Especially in finance.  Sports Illustrated, pardon me, swimsuit edition.  Okay, I can understand the higher price in the marketplace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You haven't seen the Wall Street Journal swimsuit edition.  But jeez, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  How does that compare to the Wall Street Journal subscription on the Kindle?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kindle was, I think...  This is probably another note.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this another one of your numbers?  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just had a really boring number you'll never get to.  Good, thanks.  The Kindle, Wall Street Journal Kindle, hold on.  $14.99, it looks like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I canceled it when the price went up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a paper subscriber and then I got a deal on the...  So what is it for the iPad?  That's crazy.  Interesting.  To get the web version...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, Andy Anotko told me that there are a few companies that have iPads now.  You know, one of the problems if you're making iPad applications is you're developing in

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  an emulator.  Yeah, which is totally bogus.  But you'd like to ship day of, right?  Because the store will be the smallest it'll ever be.  And you have the best shot at getting the attention of your potential customers.  On the other hand, we don't know.  I mean, if it's a big company, it's a big company.  It's a big company.  It's a big company.  It's a big company.  It's a big company.  It's a big company.  On the other hand, we don't know.  I mean, if there's a showstopper bug that you didn't notice until it actually ran on  hardware, how long for the update?  It's an interesting...  Right.  It's a way for Apple to reapprove it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you really risk a bad user experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  However, Apple has, according to Andy Anotko, seeded several companies, including The Journal,  The New York Times, and Electronic Arts with iPads.  So those companies...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know that's the case from my sources and one of the publishing companies.  And they do have to be in a windowless room bolted to a table.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Serious.  You're joking.  Windowless room guarded, locked, bolted to a table so that you could not even pick them  up when you work with them in that space.  That's what Steve was...  Are you serious?  Steve was explaining...

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's right.  I mean, this is like replicating Apple conditions.  Yeah, they're famous for this.  When they're building new hardware...  I've had this when I was...  You know, you worked at Apple, yeah.  Yeah, it was like, okay, we've got a bug on the P47 and then you have to go and you say,  what's that?  And you say, I'm not telling you.  And then you go into this, like go into a testing lab that's inside the other testing  lab with a separate card key door.  And then you have a monitor and a screen and there's something under a cloth and you sit  there and wait till it crashes.  And then you look at the debugger and you go, oh, this is in my code or you go, that isn't  in my code.  Off you go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I know that they're insane in house, but how can they enforce that insanity at  the New York Times?  They do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because that's the whole thing now.  Since Scott Rosenberg wrote a wonderful piece about how this all reminds him, it's all giving  flashbacks to the days of CD-ROMs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tell me that.  I saw that headline and I don't know why does this remind him of CD-ROMs?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because it is about this belief that this is going to change everything that works.  Super cool now, we're going to regain control.  My view of the whole iPad thing is that publishers, editors and now advertisers, advertisers are  buying ads on these things with no audience proven.  Why?  Because they want to regain control.  And everybody thinks there's some gold rush to be had.  I found the number here.  Wall Street Journal Web, the entirety of the Wall Street Journal, $8.62 a month.  More than double that to buy the dancing quarters on the iPad version.  What could it possibly be?  Advertisers coming on.  Well, we're going to now focus your attention on our ad and nothing else as if we're not  going to click off.  And that's what they see in this iPad and that's what they're just fooling themselves.  So all these publishers think that this is their salvation, so they'll do whatever Steve  says because finally, thank you, Steve.  You've given us back our control.  We will force people to go from page one to 100.  And that's the way media should be.  Well, sorry.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I'm watching that wide demo of their iPad thing.  I was completely having CD-ROM flashbacks.  I was building CD-ROMs in the early 90s and creating these damn mockups and doing all  this stuff.  And it's like, this is the kind of stuff that we ended up having to make for the publishers  to try and persuade them to do this thing.  The successful CD-ROMs, the ones that treated it as a platform for software, like, you know,  my 3D Atlas, one that I built then that ended up shipping two million copies or so, did  well because it was a way to deliver a software program that looked at the world and gave  you interactivity.  It was kind of like not quite a Google Earth in that flavor.  Whereas most of these things were, here's a bad way of presenting the stuff we've already  got.  And of course, the web devoured them rapidly.  The other half of that, looking at that demo, was like, why is this special and new?  You can have video and audio and graphics and everything on web pages now.  We've had this for the last 15, 20 years.  We've been able to do this stuff.  We're now standardizing it so you can actually do it in HTML really easily.  Why is this something you need to do a magic application for this?  And the difference is, oh, we think we can put a price tag on this and people will buy

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the application instead.  So it's very retro.  It's a very bad idea, it sounds like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's also part of...

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, it's necessarily a bad idea.  You know, there are some things you can do, but there's a whole bunch of production costs  that come with that.  If you're going to shoot video of every news story, if you're going to create infographics  for everything, it's going to cost you a lot of work to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And is that truly worth the extra money to the customer?  There's a reason CD-ROMs and books and magazines and such didn't work is because it wasn't  worth that money.  Well, I don't know if that's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It didn't work because it got replaced by the web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, precisely, the web is open and the web is still open and sort of go back to a closed  world here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it wasn't that the medium was bad.  It was just...  The web is better.  It didn't change.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was static.  It was static.  It was static and it was closed.  And so closed is the key word.  Murdoch also announced yesterday that he's going to put up a charge for the Times and  Times, the Times of London and the Sunday Times of London, one pound a day or two pounds  a week and down goes the wall.  And I wrote an incredibly snarky piece for The Guardian saying that this just shows that  he's been defeated by the future.  It's his surrender.  He has no new ideas for advertising, none for new rich relationships with readers, none  even he doesn't have new ideas for efficiency.  So he's going to milk this cow a quid at a time and leave his children with the desiccated  leftover beast of his once proud, if not great newspaper empire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, did you just write that in your head or did you write that?  I love that.  That was a great, great post.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is a good line.  I also said that I used to work for Murdoch at TV Guide and I did admire his balls.  Pity they're gone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Another good one.  Oh yeah, I was...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What the hell?  I even appeared on Sky News, which is of course controlled by Murdoch.  And when I got off the air, the producer said, oh, I got to make sure I still have

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  a job.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what this is all about, right?  It's publishers are looking for the means to bring back one last attempt, their control,  and they've shrunk away from the world.  They're not looking for new opportunities.  They're not looking for new models.  They just want to try to regain control and they won't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So is this Apple just trying to create, add their sort of interface UI magic to the web?  Is this Apple just saying, hey, the web needs a better UI and we're going to make it?  No, because...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or is it a measure of control?  That's the question, Gina.  It's exactly the question.  What do you think?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's...  You know, they've done that with Safari and with the iPhone browser.  That's their better UI for the web.  And they've actually moved the state of the art forward a lot by shipping CSS and web  HTML5 video and Canvas and all the other cool stuff you can do in there.  So they have done that and that is great work.  But it's more that they're providing a platform for you to do software development on that  they have a bigger stake in.  I think that's the other half of it.  They get to decide whether it's a good experience or not.  That's very much in Steve's head.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So doesn't this go back to, though, then, an app-based world closed at Apple, open at  Google Chrome, Chrome OS, etc., Android, and however that we start to move from a page-based  web in this vision to an app-based web?  I'm not sure that works, but I think that's what we start to see attempts at here, no?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I think it's still going to be a great web browser.  This is, you know, it comes back to the way that the standards of an app company are.  You don't lose the openness.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but you do if you're in the New York Times app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  But that was the question you asked last week, Jeff, was what's the difference between New  York Times on the web, which works on the iPad, New York Times in the app, which works  on the iPad.  Except that I guess the different app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The blue Lego is the difference.  The blue Lego.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Flash.  That's the difference.  But if I'm the New York Times, I make sure that I have a fallback position.  You know, we're in the same boat as a content creator.  We're creating an iPad app, but that doesn't mean we won't put absolutely everything still  on the web and you can take your choice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  But all I'm saying is the architecture changes in an important way.  On my iPhone, the best way to read the New York Times is not the web, it is the app.  Within the app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's the New York Times choice.  They could make it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's fine.  But it's also, it takes advantage of the functionality.  But it does not give me then the power of the web.  It links me to other New York Times stuff.  It doesn't make it easy for me to search and link out to the web.  Which is true not just in the New York Times, but all the news apps that I know of.  The Guardian too.  When you make an app, you're making a closed world again.  Even if you're not trying to close it, it just kind of becomes more closed because it's  your app.  And you're not trying to build a whole browser.  And if you take the iPad, which will only do one thing at a time, and you're in the  app to go out to the browser, becomes a bigger investment.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm waiting for instance.  Or you end up embedding a browser within the app.  That's the other thing you do.  That's kind of what we're doing.  iPhone, iPad.  You say, okay, here's a little bit that is a browser and you can nab in there.  But you can only nab to the sites that I say you can nab.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is some limitations.  For instance, that's how we want to put streaming video in the iPhone app.  But Apple won't let us do it via 3G, even though it works fine in Safari on 3G.  So they do have some control.  They can say, well, okay, you can put a web browser in there, but you can't, for instance,  stream video over 3G in that web browser, even though you, you know, there's very little  technical difference between doing that and having the app go to launch Safari, then launch  the link, then launch the QuickTime.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which it can do still, Leo, yes?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does.  That's how we do it.  But Apple can say, you're not allowed to do that.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So does the iPad actually let you embed video in the browser?  Because the iPhone doesn't.  If you try and embed it, it pops it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  So in effect, what it does is it launches.  So for instance, and we wanted to do that because if I were playing the video back within  the app, I can't multitask.  But if I'm playing it back within Safari, here's another example of a completely artificial  arbitrary limitation.  Safari will continue to stream the audio, QuickTime rather will.  So what happens is it goes from the app to Safari to QuickTime, QuickTime launches, continues  to stream the audio in the background, multitasking, because it's Apple's.  Because Apple is allowed to, yeah.  Right.  So that's how we kind of allow you to listen to, you can be listening to this audio and  still be doing other stuff on your iPhone.  But Apple gets to choose whether that's going to be a behavior allowed in the app store.  And they.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are you writing the same app in Android?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think, I don't know.  I don't think Houdini, Houdini7 who does it from ShiftKey software is what just, he's just  a wonderful developer, listener fan.  And I think he's only doing it for the iPad, but we're certainly looking, we'd love to  have an Android version.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are you?  Stuff already works for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have an Android app?  Well, you know what's interesting?  The streaming video.  So if you go to live.twit.tv and Safari on the iPhone, we can, we can give you a click  link playthrough that will give you streaming video live on the iPhone.  It doesn't work on any other platform.  Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Because it's using that proprietary Apple thing.  Yeah.  Well, it's a proprietary.  Okay.  That's not quite fair.  That only Apple can do.  But it's not only Apple can do.  No, you can do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody else has done it.  For instance, I mean, absolutely Google could make it possible in Android, but we need them  to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Right.  Now if I do live on Twitter, TV, and it doesn't do anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It gives you an error.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It throws an error because we're.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says you need flash.  No, does it?  No, I don't think it does that.  It throws out a playlist and it just says, I don't know what to do with this playlist.  Whereas Safari does, it will launch QuickTime and run it.  It says you need flash.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, I know what that is.  That's the user agent detection on the web page.  We don't bother.  We don't bother doing Android detection because there's no point.  If when it does the, you know, but we can, we can, we can keep you from seeing that flash  error message.  What you'll get instead.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You can give me the MB3, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the audio works.  I think it's just.  Twitter.am or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you should have no trouble with that.  That's a, that's an ice cast stream.  Yeah, that works.  So we, so what happens, I think we did, I think obviously our designers changed the  user agent detection because we didn't want to throw an error when you click that play  live video link in Android.  So we just say, no, no, no, you can't do that.  We don't, we don't give you the mobile page, but we give you the mobile page on the iPhone.  Anyway, boy, that was inside baseball.  I'm just talking to the inventor of QuickTime.  So I thought I'd have a chance to ask a question.  I can get him on.  Implementer.  What was your relationship to QuickTime?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I did implement live broadcasting on in QuickTime and video capture for OS X.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I believe I'm talking to the right man.  No question about it.  Hey, congratulations, Gina.  You are your think tank app, the app that you're doing for a Neil's company.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Expert labs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Expert labs is now a Google summer of code project.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, it is a Google summer code project, which is very, very exciting.  So if you're a student, you can, we applied to be a mentoring organization and we got  accepted, which means that students who want to spend the summer contributing to an open  source project and making even a little money doing it can apply.  I'm going to mentor.  I think we definitely get one student.  I'm not sure if we get more than one, but I'm going to be doing kind of mentoring the  student one on one.  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the requirement for the students?  Ask the dad of a developer student.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's all on the site.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  SoC, which is summer of code, ghop.appspot.com.  And you'll see all the different accepted projects there.  And then you can apply for the summer of code.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And all the requirements for students are there.  I think they have to be 18.  I think they have to be enrolled in a high school or university, I want to say.  But definitely check the site.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so you get Google subsidized help in the coding in an open source project.  Oh, you get a ton of stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get to be, you know, get to put Google on your resume.  You know, I mean, it's a really great, I think you get paid.  You get a stipend, don't you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I get I get help.  So it's a fifty five hundred dollars stipend.  The student gets five thousand dollars and the organization gets five hundred.  OK, so and so there's a mentor.  You decide on what people in the organization are mentors that mentor the students.  And then there are like there's a midterm evaluation or a final evaluation.  And it goes through certain particular dates and students write code for the  organization on the project and mentors, you know, help them along getting  experience contributing to the project and getting those things done.  So it's a win for everyone.  And I'm really, really excited to get this kind of help.  And actually, we're in the part.  Applications haven't opened yet officially, but we're in the kind of the  yeah, Monday, we're in the point of the process where students are kind of  checking out all the different projects, which ones they want to work on.  And and we've had an onslaught of students on our mailing list  making proposals of what they'd like to work on.  We have a list of items that we'd like students to work on.  But we're also taking proposals from students who install Think Tank  and have to have ideas and certainly open to new ideas.  And some great conversations come out of it already.  So I'm really, really excited about that.  So if you want to spend the summer coding and and work with us at Think Tank,  definitely check it out.  Check out the the SOC, G hop that apps, apps, bot dot com site.  Or just, you know, just Google Google Summer of Code.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's probably why they have such a ridiculous URL,  because they want you to Google it.  Maybe it's maybe it's some sort of qualification.  Yeah, exactly.  I think I think Jake can do this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so what's your obligation to mentor?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We so I'm going to do basically my obligation is to help the student along.  So we really mentors get decide how to do that.  I'm going to do a weekly one on one meeting and just kind of,  you know, offering feedback and sort of guidance.  And but but I'm going to be but the point of the mentor is to help students  learn how open source projects work.  So I'm going to encourage a student.  I'm not going to handhold.  I'm going to say to the student, you have a question posted to the mailing list.  That's how it works.  You know, or in the chat and kind of discuss it with the community and,  you know, get good at sort of, you know, the open source way,  which is like everybody, everybody kind of puts their two cents in.  And it's sort of a very public process.  But I'm going to be helping.  I'm going to be doing sort of, you know, one on one meetings with a student  every every week or two weeks just to check in and see how they're doing  and and offer guidance.  So I'm really excited about that.  Good to get get experience at open source early on.  And I'm sure I'm going to learn a whole lot, too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's such a good program.  I'm really glad Google does it.  Congratulations on being part of it.  Thanks. Yeah, that's really neat.  Now's the time when we do our Google  tip tool and number, let's start with a tip from Gina Tripani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sure. So this tip is kind of a feature that's been around for a while,  but there's some news this week about it.  So I wanted to point it out again.  It's in Gmail. This is a really cool feature of Gmail.  I love this at the bottom of your Gmail inbox when you're logged in.  It will tell you when your last account activity was and on that particular computer.  And if you click the details link, it will show you any other  Gmail sessions that you've opened on any other computers or devices.  So, you know, so on my on my Gmail list right now, I've got a couple of browsers.  I've got offline access.  I've got my Nexus one is logged into Gmail.  So it tells you what be careful, Leo, because it shows IP addresses.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are they going to do with that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it so it tells you what IP addresses you're logged into from  and what kind of device, which is pretty, pretty neat.  And you can remotely sign out from a session.  So if you see a session, if you stay logged in a Gmail at work at the office  and you get home and you realize, hey, I didn't want to stay signed in.  I don't want, you know, my coworker looking at my Gmail.  You can remotely sign out other sessions, which is neat.  And the reason why and this, like I said, this has been around for a while.  But the reason why I bring it up is because starting this week,  Google started to detect unusual patterns on the IP addresses  that normally access your Gmail account.  If there's one that's that's that's unusual, like if you're logged in  in three places in the United States and then someone in Poland logs in  and they detect that this sort of suspicious activity, quote unquote,  when you next time you look at your Gmail account, you'll get a red alert  that says someone logged into your account from Poland.  Now, a couple of a couple of life hacker readers said that they were remote  using remote access to get into their computer in New York, from Florida  and got this message like you've got someone's accessing your account  from somewhere else. And they were like, what the heck?  And it was their own. It was fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd rather get the message. I'd rather get the message.  I get the message.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's pretty it's pretty awesome that they're offering.  I mean, on one side, you're on one hand, you're like, wow, Google's really  tracking my activity.  But, you know, it's automated and it's kind of analogous to when your credit  card company sees a transaction that's a very large amount or a place  that you normally shop and they give you a call.  This is kind of like Gmail's way of doing that, telling you if someone's  if there's account access from somewhere.  I never quite answer the credit card things.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  It's like, OK, your credit card was just used in France.  You rang me at home. If I was in France, would this phone ring?  So I need to think, OK, so I need to fix that in my phone layer  so that my phone can ring in France when I'm there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, a very important side tip to this is to associate  your cell phone with your Google account, because it's one of the best ways  to recover the account if somebody steals your password.  Absolutely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And make sure that your secondary email address is valid, one that you use.  You know, that's not a Hotmail account that you haven't accessed in two years.  Make sure you have a valid secondary email address and also  asserting your phone number.  I mean, some people are balk at the idea of giving Google their phone number.  But if you use a Google voice number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They already know it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They already know it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I did that. And it's really great.  There's somebody in France because I'm laporte at Gmail dot com.  And there's somebody in France who's sure that they're laporte at Gmail dot com.  And periodically we'll get a flurry of, you know, in French,  we've been asked to reset your password.  No, you may not.  Do not reset my password.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Speaking of Google watching, you will get to the number by number in a second.  But this I just saw this today.  Maybe it's happened for a long time and I didn't know it.  I'm going to the Norwegian Media Festival soon and I was looking at hotels.  Using Chrome browser.  And then I went to Gmail and I got a whole bunch.  And there's no mention of Norwegian hotels there,  but I got Norwegian hotel ads there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that wow, that's sophisticated.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They announced that this week.  They said that they've got this thing called.  We know where you we know where you are.  You know where you live.  No, they're selling ads that follow the user around.  That was that was the point.  Oh, that's what that is. Oh, OK.  There was a release about that this week.  And it's part of the interest tracking stuff.  So the interest tracking stuff that was there for a while,  where you can go and say, I'm interested in ads about X, Y and Z.  I'm not interested in that.  This is kind of an extension of that.  So they when you go to another Google property and you're logged in  or go to another site that serves ads from Google,  they may reshow you ads from earlier if they think that's something  you're interested in or if they think it's high value.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I actually didn't find it creepy or anything because I was seeing the ads.  I just saw it said, what are they doing here? OK. Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So but they actually announced they called it they called it  funnel or something, was that it? Funnel funnel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, they should go along with the pastry metaphor and call it funnel cake.  And then everybody be happy because because what could be wrong with funnel cake?  Funnel cake. Yeah. Search funnel. That was it.  Search funnel. That sounds like you're going to be.  Yeah, it sounds painful. Yeah.  I don't know.  So time for our number of the week with Mr.  Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, I'll take it. All right, Leo. You're screwed.  Metal Loomis screwed. Oh, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do we lose? No, no, no, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, just with the deadline passed, eleven hundred community responses.  TechCrunch had reported more than six hundred.  And then as of five twenty six p.m. on the 26th,  eleven hundred community responses, not one hundred ninety four  thousand responses from individuals.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the Google Community Fiber Initiative.  The idea to wire five communities from five to five from fifty thousand  to five hundred thousand in the US with fiber gigabit fiber.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is worse than college applications.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is. It is. You have less chance.  It strikes me. I work for a company that can run fiber.  You want fiber to run some talk to us.  I want fiber in Petaluma.  Can we get gigabit fiber from from BT in Petaluma?  We know how to do it.  Yeah, but you're British.  That's a long across the pond.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, there's a bit of BT that lays the fiber for the UK.  And that's what we do.  OK, they did to the challenges.  And the reason Google is doing this is to make the point that at the moment  this is stitched up by lots of local monopolies. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And much more and much more so that in the US anyway,  the copper companies, the copper companies have monopolies  and have a vested interest in amortizing the cost of installing the copper.  They don't want to put fiber in.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, the other half of this is that generally,  you know, there isn't open access in the US like there is in the UK.  In the UK, BT runs the fiber, sells it to themselves at the same price  as everyone else.  And everyone can run services over the top of it.  Whereas here you have these vertically integrated monopolies.  And, you know, you get the right to do cable television in one city.  And that means you can lock other people out as well.  So the interesting thing for me, you know, with my professional hat on  is saying, well, hang on, if these communities want this,  can they work out a way of changing the bylaws  and so that we can actually do this?  Because, you know, us and a bunch of other telcos would love to run fiber  around the communities and do this stuff.  But at the moment, you tend to be locked out in the US.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  At the same time, Verizon Files, which I have and works wonderfully  and far better than my cable company did, just said this week  that they're going to basically run down their installation of it  in towns where they are, they'll finish.  They're not going to go into new major markets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. So that's it for us.  Very depressing.  Why and why was that? Because it's very I know it's very expensive.  It's like five thousand a sub or something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's usually expensive.  And I watched them installing here.  It was wildly expensive.  There were four guys going nuts all day.  They said that they had a goal of a certain number of subs  and they're going to reach that goal.  And that's kind of it.  But I find that very depressing because I loved the competition.  And you can see that if you go to the Google official Google blog  and see the response on the Google fiber,  they did little dots for governments.  They did big dots for any area where more than a thousand individuals  reached them.  And it's interesting to see the popular appeals that came up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wonder I wonder if I'm a big dot or a little dot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's fascinating is I don't see much.  I can't even tell.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, you know, the Petaluma doesn't have a big dot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the East Coast and around Chicago, Michigan, huge clumps of activity.  Eleven hundred competitors.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. And we're not a big dot.  Well, you know, you know, you know, many people.  Yeah, we couldn't be a big dot.  There's only 50,000 people. It's a small community.  But but so really what these dots should reflect is per capita participation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Of course, we're not going to be able to build in every interested community.  And we put you on our wait list for the for a college admission.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it's like being waitlisted.  Oh, man. Jeff and I are both going well.  Our kids are both going through that right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, Kevin, yeah.  Rock University of Rochester, NYU, George Washington University,  Rensselaer, Boston University, those are Jake's choices. Any advice? OK.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I don't I don't know the U.S.  universities that were not I know people at Rochester because  there's lollies there.  Yeah, I was going to say Liz is there. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there's lollies.  It was lolly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She had her. She was a guest on.  She was talking to us about the game that she did with the with the  newspaper there. Yeah. Right. Right.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So so being heard about Rochester and their programs there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's a good tip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rochester is supposed to be fantastic.  I'm not going to ask you about the schools that Abby's going to.  None of them have a tech

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  kind of angle at all. Yeah.  I'm here. I need to learn this stuff.  Oh, you will be.  You will. I'm sitting here.  I'm sitting in my kids' room in my head, but I'm going to work out  if that's actually possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You you you know, you kind of you learn by default.  There's no choice.  Thank you. Well, let's so when does Google announce when who's going to get it?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  They didn't say end of the year or something.  I'm in like that, wasn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, we you weren't here, Kevin, but we I brought in a member  of the Petaluma City Council.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I heard that I saw the last week show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Strong armed Google.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Somebody was flying a plane around Google campus on Friday. Oh, wow.  So we were trying a plane saying, will Google play in Peoria?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really that's tough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know. But see, I'm thinking you're not going down there, Leo.  What's a little kid?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you know, Google's not going to be influenced by that.  I'm thinking not going to be influenced by those kind of gimmicks.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, they're going to come up with some mathematical formula for this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. What's the algorithm?  We're going to do city rank. It's a new thing.  Yes. City rank.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So I got I got a number for you. Oh, great.  Oh, good.  This is the Nexus one is only two thirds as many pixels as it says it has.  Did you see this article?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And I thought it's bogus.  And also it doesn't have as many  color depth as much color.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  So the thing is, it has a different kind of pixel.  This is this is total geek out. Yeah.  So it's an AMOLED screen.  But it has these it has little thin green pixels  that it has as many as it says.  But then each of them either has a big red or blue pixel next to it.  So it has as many green pixels as it says,  but it has far fewer red and blue ones, which means that you lose  overall color resolution, which isn't that bad.  But it also means that the stuff gets fuzzy and you get weird fringing effects.  And this guy asked him to do this gorgeous thing where he  what reverse engineered the fringing effects  and will give you grayscale images that show color on the Nexus one  and grayscale everywhere else.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.  You know, I and you know, I saw that.  And of course, everybody who was mad at me  for switching off the iPhone and the Nexus one, all the iPhone bigots  sent me this article. I got eight thousand more pixels in the iPhone.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You know, I got a ton of links like I got third as many pixels.  I know. But the article was said it makes me happy for having the droid now.  So my droid actually has got that many pixels.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the sex display on this is beautiful.  Oh, it's very crisp. I really like it.  Although I haven't noticed, you know, this is the thing is you can  you can give me all the numbers you want.  Just put an excess one next to an iPhone and tell me which has a better screen.  I mean, it's just not it's just not even close.  And I agree. I think the droid has a gorgeous screen, too.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But I found that I actually read text on this now because, you know, I read stuff here  and I don't feel I need to go to the computer to read it properly,  which is which is a big change. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're seeing a lot more AMOLED screens coming out at CTIA.  I think that's going to be the screen of the future.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple do one in the next generation iPhone.  If they ever release a next generation iPhone, they're kind of busy right now.  So my my tool is an Android application that Google released this week called MyTrax.  And I thought you would really like this, Gina, because I know you're a cyclist,  or at least you have cycles hanging on the wall.  Yes. I don't know if you actually ever ride them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I go in cycles. If I have a good app, then yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this app, you will as motivator, you will like this app.  It's a wonderful app. It's called MyTrax.  And I just used it today for the first time.  It just came out on the Android phone and it uses the GPS  built into the phone to track you.  And, you know, one of the advantages, I see you have it, Kevin.  You've been tracking yourself.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  This was this was me playing hockey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was going to say, what are you doing?  Good Lord. That's a random walk.  So that's how accurate it is, which is really cool.  It's quite focused, but you can see what's going on.  Was that the default settings or did you have to turn the accuracy?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I turned it down to one meter to get that, but it falls to five meters every five meter.  But it's pretty impressive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's really great.  And it takes advantage of the fact that you can multitask on the Android.  So you have you can be doing other things.  You can even turn off the phone and continues to track you,  which is one of the things the iPhone cannot do.  And another thing that's really great is there's social.  There's a social side to this as well.  So, you know, I just did my my walk to work, which is not that fancy.  But you see this nice track here.  And then you can tweet it or Twitter it or  you can upload it to Google Maps.  It becomes part of your I maps.  So that's really handy.  So if I if I go to my maps on Google.  Oh, it's not here yet.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Maybe there's a bit of a lag after you upload it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, actually, you know what?  It's on a different account.  This is this is the yeah.  This again. Yeah.  I have many, many Google accounts in the phone is using a different account.  Let me let me log into that other account.  But it's really cool. So it uploads it.  You can share a link to other people.  You can have it.  I mean, it's just it's a really nice little app and it worked beautifully.  And I've tried to there are a number of other apps,  sport tracking apps available on on Google.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  There's one of mine. Yeah.  I just stuck it in the chat.  Oh, good. OK.  So, yeah, no, this is I like this is very nice.  Is it is part of the is part of this sort of,  you know, that the self monitoring thing, the idea of I'm keeping track  of stuff I'm doing myself and it's it's you're able to to to follow  what you're doing yourself.  This was walking around the park over by Anderson Lake.  It's just fun to know that, you know, I don't know what you can do with it.  But it's also actually really handy, you know, if you're out wandering  in the woods, you can then go back and look at it and go, where am I?  Where did I go? Right.  And, you know, the mapping stuff is less good in the woods.  You don't have the trails and things, but you can actually see,  oh, that's where I left the car. Excellent. Right.  So it's and it doesn't need a net connection.  That's the other half of it.  Unlike Google Maps and Nav and all that stuff, it doesn't need a net connection.  You won't see the map tiles, but you will still get your path  because your GPS is always working.  The GPS is working.  It's throwing locally and they will up at the end.  So it's a nice thing.  It's a nice self self monitoring thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It also gives you your speed.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  You're and you know, it tells you how fast you're walking.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's something really compelling about the self monitoring apps.  I really love that.  And I just love software that makes you want to go outside. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's the software that gets you outside.  Although I presume if you set the if you set the resolution high enough,  you could watch yourself inside as well.  Wandering, I think you could also tie this against the every block API,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  which is a separate company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the every block API?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's that's a company that gathers all kinds of local data.  So I think you can see which what crimes occurred near your own path.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the mashups on this will be fantastic. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And is this connected to latitude at all?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's it's just a separate app, but it it does.  It does. It makes KML files so you can put it into my maps  and you can put it into anything else.  Or Google Earth or Google Earth or, you know, write your own parser.  You know, cameras are not that hard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other tracking apps I've used are not do not nearly have this resolution.  I mean, you know, the fact that I can see that I crossed the street, I jaywalked,  you know, you know, you can see where my neighbors stopped me on my walk in.  And I had to I had to deviate to go talk to them.  I mean, that's really great stuff.  I just remember the family circus cartoon where the kid would go around  and around and around and around.  Yeah. Yeah. So it is using the compass.  So it knows my orientation. Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  That's really neat. It's clever.  Yeah, that's me. The other half of that is this is exactly new.  Google knows exactly where you are.  If you're running latitude, this is where they know you are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Latitude is a problem, because if you forget, you've got it on.  People know, you know, inch by inch.  It's the ultimate in stalking applications.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I can see which bars you were in Austin. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Whereas this at least is not public unless you explicitly make it public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's it's a walk by that McDonald's.  I didn't go in. I didn't order anything. I want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. We know it all.  Well, anyway, another nice Android app, it just makes this phone  more and more desirable, I have to say.  Really enjoyed it.  Now, there's a it's interesting because HTC has released the HTC Desire.  No carriers in the US yet, but you can buy.  I think you can.  You'll be able to buy an unlocked version soon.  That is the Nexus one updated.  It's got an optical tracker and so the physical trackball there  and it has HT sense on top of it and is running two point one.  So that's that's, you know, essentially the same phone.  But some improvements, maybe maybe the Nexus two.  We know Gina Tripani is working hard to make our government more open  and you can help her in the Google Summer of Code.  Make sure you check that out.  And of course, go visit her blog at Smarterware.org and buy her book.  Now out in paper, an actual tree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're killing trees and helping charity.  Complete that out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is the charity? I didn't know that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we're the print version.  We're a partner with a charity here in San Diego who printed it for us  and is who's doing fulfillment.  They're a charity that provide jobs for developmentally disabled adults.  So when you buy a book, half the cost goes to this charity  and you're helping employ somebody in my community.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right. I forgot it's the that's three waves or whatever their name was.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Three ones. Three bones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Three bones. Bones were the ones in the complete waveguide.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And we're not lots of people buying the e-book.  And I really appreciate that.  But please kill some more trees by some more.  It's it's in color. It's in color.  It's a family tree. I'm sure.  It's a color paperback.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't the PDF color?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, sure. But I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't mean to ruin your marketing pitch, but  you should have made the PDF black and white.  Yeah, I should have.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I should have. In retrospect, I should have said that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It got completely reversed. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can hold it in your hand. It's a thing.  It's like that.  Better than the iPad.  More socially responsible than the iPad.  Yeah. Of course, a single app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't mention that.  And I know you bookmarked that the the wave file format, it was released today.  Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Literally as we started talking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what does that change, Gina, for your book?  I mean, you have to rewrite the whole thing now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, well, you know, the book is really for users.  Much less for developers than users.  But but yeah, I know this is exciting.  You know, they're ramping up for Google I.O., which is in May.  I think there's going to be some some wave action at Google I.O.  So so this makes sense.  But this is great that the wave document model has been released.  That's great, because that means we're going to be we're going to have more  printing options. We're going to have a little more options for what you can do  with waves, which right now are kind of limited.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So third parties can come along and do some stuff.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, I still think that's the weakest part of wave.  They should throw out their document model and use a use HTML subset because  I completely agree.  I think the XM format we've got to learn.  Yeah. Who needs that?  Yeah. But but I've argued with them before and they haven't listened.  They won't listen to you, Kevin.  And they wrote that great post when they published it right about Google  should be using open standards for this.  And he was sort of half right in that the dynamic update stuff  is not something that anyone else had done in an open way before.  So that needs to be there.  But the actual document format and the transform from the document format  to the screen is this entire chain that was basically built on  what GWT does. And now they're sort of reverse engineering that and documenting it  as opposed to saying, oh, we should just use HTML for this,  which which would have gotten a lot more traction, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Still.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  But I recommend HTML everywhere.  So we discount that tends to work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just it just works.  Kevin Marks, of course, is it ribbit ribbit dot com?  If you want to know more part of the British telecom family,  it's a VoIP plugin that is available on the wave, as a matter of fact.  It is. And everywhere else.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, it's a general API for doing telephony on the web.  So if you're thinking about building web apps  that involve any kind of telephony, then have a look at ribbit because it can do it.  One of the things we just done with it recently is we've got an app  called Idle Fanatic, which if you if you follow American Idol,  this dials the phone for you so you can vote.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you just say, who do you want to vote for?

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  And you press the button, you just fill in the votes.  And then when the lines open, it just it does all the voting for you to say  you're doing it yourself.  Kevin, we check that it's actually your phone number first.  We validate the phone.  So it's within the rules of the American Idol voting process.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's actually a fascinating approach to VoIP.  It's like a really interesting addition to the idea of VoIP.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's the point is it's not just voice over IP, it's telephony over IP.  Right. So. Right.  That means you can do lots of stuff with this.  So suddenly this stuff becomes programmable  and you can you can you can find fun things to do with it.  And that's it. We're so used to telephony being annoying.  You know, Lady Gaga just just did this great song about how annoying telephony is.  This is obviously enormously popular.  But actually, if you start saying, well, how can we make this less annoying  and make it part of the web?  And that's that's that's the point of of ribbit.  The point is to say, OK, we have an API.  You want to do something that involves an annoying phone system.  We'll make the annoying part go away.  And you can just make a call or send a text or whatever it is you want to do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I could have been your number two, Jeff.  The Lady Gaga became the first YouTube poster to reach more than a billion views.  And it was just the first three videos.  It didn't even include telephone. Yeah. Yeah.  It's amazing. Yeah.  Media. Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis is at SmarterWear.org.  That's his blog. And of course, I mean, buzzerware.org.  I mean, underwear.  What is it? Underwear? No. Buzz Machine.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I speaking of underwear, I saw an ad on my Tweet client this week  for a man packs.  And the idea is that if you hate men, hate shopping for underwear,  so you can subscribe to underwear. Oh, I need that.  My tweet, my tweet was that I wonder if more people will subscribe to underwear  than the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal in the future.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it's like it's like fresh underwear shipments every few months.  Is that the idea?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stay fresh, stay clean, get a subscription service for your socks,  T-shirts and underwear delivered to your door every three months.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I tweeted it.  They wanted to trade a man pack, which I want one for my book.  And the problem is they're only Hanes.  And I said, I'm the one by you's boss brand myself. Oh, oh, Hugo. Oh,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I'm wearing Hanes right now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There you go, Leo. So man packs for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see. You got your you got your macho pack, which is thirty three dollars,  three underwear, three shirts and three free pairs of socks every three months.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And for this, these guys have to sponsor us.  You're going to have to read a commercial next week.

Speaker: Kevin Marks
Transcript:  I could do with this to stop my son's pinching mine.  This was  their laundry runs out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really a bad thing when your kids get to your size,  because then they just start taking your stuff.  So I get, oh, look, I can have white Hanes classic briefs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Try to be married to someone of the same gender who also wears your size.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Forget about it.  But see, you only shop once, wear twice. Exactly.  As long as you got the same taste that works. Yeah.  I'm liking this. I'm liking this. I'm signing up right now.  I think that's the most the most useful tip in the entire show.  Man packs.  Jeff Jarvis is also the author of What Would Google Do?
