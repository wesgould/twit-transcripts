Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google.  Oh, I'm excited about this show.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's at MIT's Media Lab.  Kevin Marx is visiting us from somewhere in North England  and all the way from the United States Digital Service  acting administrator, Matt Cutts.  We're gonna discuss the latest news from Google, Facebook  and the US government.  It's all next on Twig.  Netcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From people you trust.

It's time for Twig This Week in Google,  the show where we cover the latest news from Google  and the Googleverse.  And boy do we have a panel today.  Stacey Higginbotham still has the week off.  I think maybe Jeff Jarvis, we chased her away.  Jeff Jarvis is here but he's not as normal.  Hey, hey, hey.  Okay, you, I mean me, not you, it was me.  Jeff is at MIT's Media Lab, what are you doing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm seeing Deb Roy of MIT on Twitter tomorrow  for a news integrity initiative business  and so I came in early so I could do the show.  So I scheduled the flight, you're gonna hear the story now,  I scheduled the flight so I could land at one o'clock,  nice and easy, right?  Get over here, check in the hotel,  get over here, do the show.  So I didn't take the train, I did everything.  Thunderstorms in Newark and we finally get up in the air.  Thunderstorms over Boston.  I buy the WiFi for once it works  so I can email Karsten and say,  I don't know if I'm gonna make it or not,  I don't know if I'm gonna make it or not.  Then I get a cabbie who had no idea where he was going  so I'm dashing down the street but I'm here.  We started 45 minutes late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bravo, Jeff Jarvis.  Half of which is my fault.  I'm glad you're here because you're gonna help me welcome.  Well first let me introduce Kevin Marks  before I welcome our special guest.  Kevin Marks is here.  No offense Kevin, you're not the special guest.  He's pretty special.  I'm the less special guest.  He's the less special.  But I think he'd agree too from indyweb.org.  It's great to see you Kevin as always.  It's great to see you guys too.  Half the time we do this show,  Stacey in particular would say,  well I wonder what Kevin Marks would say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I miss Stacey as well.  I'm sure she's not here.  But I'm sure we can,  we have something to talk about anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will find a few things to talk about  because joining us for the first time in more than a year,  hip, hip hooray, Mr. Matt Cutts of the US Digital Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, good to see everybody.  How are you?  Matt has been a long time friend of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm proud to say originally as the spam fighter at Google,  one of the early employees at Google.  And he went on leave last,  was it last year he went on leave?  Seems like about a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feels like about five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  To go to work for the government.  The US Digital Service,  which is a really neat part of the government.  And for a while you were at the Pentagon doing secret stuff.  Well it's all about improving the technology in government,  including web design.  So you may remember when healthcare.gov had its troubles  that Silicon Valley jumped in to help revamp  and make it work and the USDS was born.  Well, let me ask you, Matt,  are you still the interim administrator there, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right, yes.  I am the acting administrator of the US Digital Service.  And I just want to let people know  that the US Digital Service is still here.  We're still hiring and we're working on important problems  that make things better for the American people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, bravo.  Yeah, your predecessor had to leave  because she was a political appointee.  That's right.  But you're not a political appointee, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the acting and the acting administrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we'll see if the administration gets around  to appointing somebody to run the place.  But I think it is, and I'm very gratified to hear,  because you kind of wonder, is it getting funded?  Is anything happening?  But it sounds like you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are, and it's really great  because the people who needed help before the election  still need help.  And so the mission of the US Digital Service  is really important and I'm glad that  there's a fantastic group of geeks and designers  and software engineers, a whole bunch of people  who are willing to make sure that the US Digital Service  is trying to help build important services  and fix things that break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are some examples these days, Matt,  what you guys are working on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one of my favorite ones is vets.gov,  which is a place where people can discover, apply for,  manage, and track their benefits.  So if you are a veteran or know someone who is a veteran,  if you've ever dealt with the GI Bill comparison tools  or trying to sign up for health benefits,  this is basically a one-stop shop  that's intended to make it really easy for people to find  and apply for different benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just want to point out,  did you see how fast that site loaded?  Let me do it again, watch this.  This is no healthcare.gov.  This thing loads faster than any website I've ever been on.  I imagine that is with a little help from the USDS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We power a lot of that site, yes.  It's a fantastic service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really, really good job.  I'm just thrilled to have you back on.  Now, are there limits?  Tell me ahead of time of things we can ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if something gets too close to something legal  or something too crazy, I might recuse myself.  You're always allowed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But really, what's that Larry Page like really?  No, I'm kidding.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a great guy.  Now you can tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, we could talk a little bit about Alphabet  because their quarterly results came out.  The stock went down, but I have no idea why  because Alphabet's numbers were excellent.  Well, I guess what people are saying  is it's more about the guidance Alphabet gave  about the future and the fact that net revenue growth  has gone down a little bit.  But it's not like they're not doing really, really well.  Net revenue for the ad business was up 16%  during the second quarter.  So it was up 20% last year.  So the growth is still there, it's just slowing.  But some analysts call that a meaningful deceleration.  Net income profit, in other words, was so big  that even after subtracting $2.7 billion for the EU fine,  Google still made, Alphabet still made $3.5 billion.  So that's down, but that's because of the fine.  If you add the two together, they made $6.2 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They aren't necessarily paying the fine,  that's just holding it in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  They have 94, almost $95 billion in cash.  Head count went up, almost 10,000 people,  that's significant.  This is maybe one issue, which is cost per click down 26%.  Paid clicks, though, made up for it,  because they sold more ads,  even though the value of each ad was down 26%,  they sold 61% more ads.  Paid clicks were up 61%.  Revenues for other bets, that's Waymo, that's Nest,  that's the Life Sciences Verily and so forth,  248 million, but they lost $3.25 billion on other bets,  but that's what you kind of expect, other bets means that.  Stuff we're gonna R&D, basically.  The future.  And Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google,  has been added to the board, it's 13th member.  Oh.  Well, that makes a little sense.  Sure does.  Sundar's rise has been somewhat meteoric, though,  I have to say.  I met him when he was head of Chrome OS,  and that wasn't so very long ago.  I'd argued with him.  Now, let's not bring that up.  I was wrong, and I admit it.  Because I thought, who's gonna,  this was back when it was that black Chromebook,  remember, that everybody got the,  was the C-48?  CR-48, the preliminary,  and I said, why would anybody want this?  It's just a browser.  Boy, was I wrong.  Right at the time.  At the time, it was early.  Yeah, Matt, do you get a government-issued PC?  Oh, I can only imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, it's a lot like the CR-48, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet it is.  Yeah, but you get to have your own system, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was interesting,  because I think it was at a holiday party.  I think I got to see you.  I was there, you're exactly right.  We were, yes.  Give Sundar a hard time, and you were right at the time.  Chrome OS couldn't do that much,  and there were a lot of apps that people were using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he saw the long-term vision,  and really, I mean, there's no doubt  that this is a huge success, Chrome OS,  as it's matured, but also has been embraced by education.  I use it.  I've purchased since then five or six Chromebooks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I love it.  I just got my daughter a new Samsung Pro.  I mean.  Plus.  I gave my daughter a plus two for school, for college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She loves it.  She loves it.  Yeah, I had given her my old Pixel,  and I said, you know, maybe you'll like the plus better,  because it's a lot lighter, and she does.  So there you go.  It's also a lot less expensive.  Now, this is a good time, perhaps, to bring up Project Eve.  What do you know about Project Eve, Matt?  I know nothing.  Nothing.  What?  Nothing.  So this is the rumored Chrome,  but we talked a little bit about this last week, I think.  Didn't we, Jeff?  Yeah, we did a bit, yeah.  So there's nothing more to say about that.  It's just that I feel like we're getting closer and closer.  There's gotta be an announcement.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Because we want to, we're a successor  to the Chromebook Pixel, which we loved.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I guess I don't need to bring up Project Eve.  I already done brung it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there is the weird thing  that the Chromebook Pixel is still actually  a quite usable machine, which is.  Absolutely.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was overdesigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Three and a half years ago.  That's, well, there's two things going on there.  One is that it was overdesigned.  The other is we've gone into the flat part of Moore's law  and things haven't been growing exponentially.  That's really true, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, your five-year-old computer  is probably just as fast as it was.  The biggest change I think in the last five years.  But does Moore's law doesn't affect us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moore's law doesn't affect us  at the PC levels much anymore,  or doesn't it affect other areas, AI and such?  IOT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, AI has gone massively parallel,  so they're sort of working around it  by throwing more CPUs at it,  and because their projects are massively parallelizable,  and GPUs are doing the same thing.  IOT cares more about power consumption  than it does about CPU processing normally.  So they're at the other end of Moore's law.  There's another law that I forgot the name of,  which is the amount of power you use  to do the same amount of computation does keep going down.  And that's basically what the chipsets have been doing  for the last few years as well,  because they've been focusing on mobile.  So they haven't been saying,  oh, we need to keep growing execution speed.  They've been saying,  we need to reduce power consumption further.  Can we handle the voltage again?  So that's been a big focus in chipsets  over the last five years or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, PCs have sped up for other reasons.  More RAM, cheaper RAM, faster RAM, faster hard drives.  SSDs have made a massive difference in the speeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's mostly sort of replacing  spinning metal with silicon.  Yeah, absolutely.  Again, very parallel to silicon.  The point is we've gone from everything being a CPU bottleneck  to having much more things in parallel,  and that has made a difference.  But it has made a difference  to how we have to think about coding as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ad blocker is in.  I frankly didn't believe this,  but Google's ad blocker is now live in Canary  and Dev builds of Google Chrome,  a native ad blocker in the browser.  I haven't played with it yet.  Have any of you?  No, I'm not using Canary or even Dev.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not even on Dev either.  I should have a look.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, is Dev, Canary is gamma, and then there's beta.  Is Dev even more early stage than Canary,  or is it in the middle?  I can't remember.  It's in the middle.  It's the beta version.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's like a train.  The Canary is the earliest warning train,  and then Dev is, okay, we've got the bugs out  that will probably destroy you.  You should test this if you're building bleeding edge stuff.  And then there's one more,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and then there's release, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's four.  There's four total, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Four?  Canary, Dev, beta, and release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, yeah.  So if it's in Dev, it means it's fairly close.  I don't know if they've said what version of Chrome  it will be, and I think we're in, are we in 60 now?  Or we're in 59?  No, it's not a complete ad blocker, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it an ad blocker for certain kinds of ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say intrusive ads.  Yeah, no, it's a...  I'm willing to bet none of the Google ads are intrusive.  I'm just thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, Matt has done this before  where he's blocked Google ads,  so I would believe that they would...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I know why you're working for the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have blocked when people would buy links  that pass PageRank, but that's different.  That's a violation of Google's guidelines.  But it does make sense to me  that there are certain classes of ads  that are really beyond the pale.  And so if somebody's a good citizen,  absolutely, I don't block those ads myself.  But if somebody's doing something really intrusive  or really deceptive, then I can see,  in the same way that Google uses safe browsing  to protect its users, it might do something similar  to protect them against nasty ads in those ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, I just got 60, so we are now at 60.  Yeah, that makes...  I think it's...  You know what?  It's just like, I mean, the phrase that comes to mind  is, hell is freezing over.  You just don't expect a company that makes its money  from advertising to put an ad blocker in.  But I think a lot of what Google's done  in the last couple of years, AMP is another example,  is to shore up the business against people  who are just blocking all ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quality, yeah, and it's also a quality question.  It got so bad.  I wrote a piece probably two years ago.  I wrote a post about two years ago  suggesting the publishers should create  their own ad blocker, and really,  what all you're doing is you're setting a standard.  You're saying, this is the standard,  and we will help you get rid of all the junk below,  and we'll warrant that we're above that line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So have the publishers joined this coalition  for better ads that Google has sort of delegated this to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some did, yes, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is, it's betterads.org,  and maybe it'll say who...  Yeah, members, let's see.  Let's see who's members.  Oh, a lot of them.  A lot of ad blockers, Procter and Gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  News Corp, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  News Corp, Procter and Gamble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, P&G made a fair bit of noise  about getting rid of lots of useless ads last month,  didn't they?  They said they dumped a hundred million dollars  worth of ads of digital ads.  Were they mostly Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or it was just digital across the board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were a little opaque about exactly what it was,  but they said,  they cut which hundred million dollars,  it's a reasonable fraction of their budget,  but it's not that much their budget, because they're P&G.  But their point was,  these are the ones that weren't doing anything for us.  We wanted to get rid of them.  And I think it was the more  supposedly better targeted ones.  They're big brand advertisers.  It's very hard to sort of do social targeting  on bleach and things,  but it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  Oh, is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just thinking who would be a targeted ad for bleach.  Serial killers here and there.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody running an email server, those kinds of people.  No bad.  Interactive Advertising Bureau is a member.  Unilever is a member.  Thomson Reuters, Washington Post.  I don't see the New York Times on here.  I do see Facebook on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's Google and Facebook,  who are obviously,  they are all the growth in the ads industry,  and they want to maintain that.  And so part of this is them saying,  there's a lot of ad tech out there that's shady.  You should stick with us, well-known sort of big brands,  and we'll make a coalition with the rest of you.  And there's some reason to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see Albrein or Tabula in here either.  I'd be interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you about that.  Let me tell you about that.  So as I've mentioned before on the show,  at the News Integrity Initiative,  we're doing it at CUNY,  we partnered with Storeful and Moat,  and we're now collecting kind of the worst  of the lowest hanging rotten fruit of web stuff.  And boy, if you look at these URLs,  you just bring props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the worst ads?  Tell me one that's really-  These aren't ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are sites.  These are sites.  I'm about to get there in a second.  So these are sites that have the real,  made up, fake news junk.  Oh, okay.  And I wish I had the-  Find me now to give you examples.  Oh, I can find one.  But what we're seeing,  we're also checking those pages  and how they work with the recirculation engine.  So it's not just Tabula and Albrein.  Don't forget that Newsmax has one.  And Revcontent is another one.  And so they are throwing,  those organizations are throwing both traffic and revenue  at the fake news sites.  So part of what we're gonna try to do there  is clean that up.  This is a conversation I wanna buy Matt lunch,  well, I guess I'm probably not allowed to.  I wanna share a coffee with Matt  and get some of his insight about this,  about how you attack this moving beast.  But what we're seeing in the fake news stuff  is that there's a lot more money going to them  than I ever would have imagined  from ad networks and such.  And so what you're seeing is  it's not just about a junkie ad on a page.  It's also about fake news content being promoted.  And it's also about legitimate ads showing up  on junkie content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's an example.  This is kind of one of the most famous,  abcnews.com.co,  which is actually does double duty  because ABC could be the Australian broadcasting company  or the American broadcasting company.  I've got an ad blocker on.  Let me just refresh this minus the ad blocker,  get the ads to pop up here.  And here's five must see places to see in Amsterdam  and Prague and make a difference, donate  and help the homeless.  Interesting facts you must know about beard growth.  Feel free to ride your motorcycle  in the middle of the road from now on.  Actually, this isn't as fake as it used to be.  This is pretty legit.  Well, that's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They put in 80% okay looking and then to get the 20%.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they actually don't have as many ads as I expected,  but maybe that's because Google and others  are making it harder for them to buy ads.  I don't see any Google ads on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's progress.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's part of it, isn't it?  Is it under, wow, read the, if you wanna have some fun,  go to the bottom of this page.  I'm not gonna show it on the air  and read this fine print disclaimer at the bottom  because it starts normal and it gets weird.  Yes, it just gets weird.  Wow, I highly encourage it for a little extra credit.  So that's one thing, Matt, right?  I mean, I know you're no longer at Google,  but I think that's one thing.  Or are you?  Are you technically not at Google or are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am no longer with Google.  So I resigned December 31st, 2016.  But Google has a very clear pattern  over years and years and years of saying,  hey, try to make sure that you can allow  lots of great innovation on the web,  free speech, fantastic stuff.  But then when people start to abuse,  whether it's spam or whether it's malicious content  or intrusive ads or whatever,  okay, what is a reasonable guideline or path  to sort of push people towards better behavior?  And some people might resent that,  but for example, with Chrome,  they're moving more towards making the web encrypted.  And so over time, over the course of a year or two,  they're making it so that HTTP stuff  will show more warnings.  And so I think the most recent was  if you are entering a form and it's an HTTP,  not an HTTPS form, then they'll show you a warning.  So they're just gradually trying to push the web  towards being a good, well-lit place  where high quality information happens.  And that includes the whole ecosystem,  the quality of the information,  which you see in the search results  and the algorithms they have there,  but also how that gets monetized  because you wanna be able to support publishers,  but you don't wanna support bad behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it strikes me, I realize we have not talked to you  since this whole fake news thing surfaced.  And I'm sure you've been watching this with interest  because on the one hand, well, you stated it perfectly,  which is you wanna encourage innovation  and free speech on the internet,  but you also wanna make sure that, I don't know,  how do you define fake news,  not how do you define fake news personally,  but how do you algorithmically define fake news?  How can you determine what's fake  and how do you then weed it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of ways  where you could try to think about the algorithms  and you could try to check the quality of the content,  the quality of the channel or the publisher.  Are these facts corroborated in different places  that are also reputable or believable?  But I think what's more interesting  has been the trend towards saying, okay,  what can we do to make sure that things are vouched  and that the user interface supports things?  So I remember when the very first thing happened,  it was because some egregiously misleading or false news  got into sort of one box,  which was originally news sources only  and things have to be vetted  to get into the Google News Corpus.  And so my initial take,  and I was still had access to Google email,  so I was throwing my opinion around was,  look, this should only be the new Google News Corpus,  not just things that look kind of interesting  or hot topics.  And I think, I don't know, maybe some stronger action  a little earlier there could have nipped  some of that in the bud.  I will say, in the same way that the ABC news example  seems a little better, I just noticed last week,  you haven't really heard about fake or malicious  or egregiously bad news in Google search results for a while.  And normally you only notice when things bad happen  and I noticed nothing bad had happened for a little while.  And so, which is,  normally you only notice when people complain.  And so I know that the people at Google  are taking it very seriously  and are trying to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Matt, did you see the Ben Gomes post  that he put up about two months ago  about changes in structure?  I saw that as a, I think they were trying to soft pedal it,  but I think that the fact that Ben said  that they were gonna account for the reliability,  quality and authority of sources was a sea change  in how Google had to operate.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't consider it a sea change so much as a doubling down.  The fact that it was Ben Gomes saying it,  carries a lot of weight because,  you know Ben-  He's speaking of engineering.  Exactly. For search.  If you're talking about search ranking,  you really will have a hard time  finding someone more reputable than that.  And it also fit the timeline of like November, December,  when people start talking about it.  Normally it takes Google at least three or four months  if they're gonna do a systemic change  or an algorithmic change.  Like if something launches  and then something launches the next day,  that's usually coincidence.  So the fact that you saw that happen a few months later,  in my mind from the outside is like,  okay, Google knew it was a problem.  They did a full review.  They said, okay, what are the issues  and what can we solve algorithmically or reasonably  to take care of the most egregious, most misleading,  most false kind of things?  And I'm sure they'll keep iterating,  but I think to me that was Google taking a strong stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a big deal.  I had a conversation with Ben and others about this.  An example in conversation was climate change.  And I've said this on the show before,  but if your search was climate change,  you got good results.  But if your search was, is climate change real,  you got crappy results.  Because Google wasn't,  relevance required that people who asked this question  click on this.  If you're stupid enough to ask this question,  you're stupid enough to click on that  and those things rose.  And there was a manipulation that occurred,  a thumb on the scale that Google had to compensate for.  And so, in the end, Matt, I think that Google,  so now if you ask, is climate change real?  Last I asked, it was good results.  I haven't asked in a while.  Google was kind of siding with the institution of science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google is a huge believer in,  I think Google is a huge believer in the scientific method  and that that's a good way to get to truth in general.  But what's, I don't know,  what's kind of interesting to me is  there's always been this tension  between trying to make sure that things are  well represented and reflect the web.  So, if somebody does a question,  you wanna reflect what the wisdom of the web sort of says.  And so in that sense, you're like a mirror.  But then there's also been this,  I call it the evil unicorn problem.  Everybody knows unicorns are awesome.  They're fantastic, they're good, they're light.  Nobody ever thinks of an evil unicorn,  but you can still go to Google and type in evil unicorn  and people expect something to show up.  And so the wording that people use,  like is this product fake or is this a scam?  Sometimes the people who might believe in  something really strongly,  think about vaccines or something like that.  Sometimes some people are really working hard  to try to make sure they produce a lot of content  in that area and somebody else is like,  well, we think there's a consensus  that we're not gonna work that much  to get our side of the story out.  And so sometimes you do see those sorts of,  the landscape is not always,  what is on the web is not always  what some people would consider reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see how hard this is.  Right, right, the web is cracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's also certain phrases as well.  There are certain phrases that are sort of defined  by some groups and then they get redefined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just searched for do vaccines cause autism  and the number one result is  how do vaccines cause autism.com?  So that's an example kind of what you talked about, Jeff.  I bet you if I searched for vaccines,  I'd get lots of good science.  This is a relevant problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's also the problem of,  there's one scientific paper over here  nobody's talking about and there's a thousand  stupid blog posts a million people  are talking about over here.  Yeah, how do you determine that?  The signals are wrong.  However, Matt, you're right.  If you do search for evil unicorns,  it took me to Amazon and you can buy  an inflatable evil unicorn horn for cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually do have an evil unicorn action figure  because I was gonna do a blog post, but I'm off duty.  I don't need to talk about evil unicorns anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, if you search for do dog vaccines cause autism,  Google's very good about debunking that  despite the beliefs of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  First link is a search grabbing site,  but don't click through cause it swears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  This one is timed around a news story,  which sounds like fake news to me  that some Brooklyn denizens are not vaccinating their dogs  against rabies and other serious diseases  because they believe it causes autism in their dogs,  which I believe that I don't believe there is such a thing.  So I think that sounds like a fake news story,  but you say it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also there is actually an issue with vaccines and dogs  because the problem is that they're not as thoroughly tested  as they are on humans.  And also vets use them as a way  to make you make an annual visit.  So I have had a dog that's happened to  where we were very conscientious and did what we were told  and went to the vet every year  and was given this cocktail of vaccines.  And literally the vet gave the dog the annual checkup set,  oh, this dog's fine, everything's great.  Let me give this giant cocktail of vaccines.  And then within a week it had an autoimmune disease.  So the problem is they haven't,  you know, literally her lymph nodes grew up.  She was really sick and she died within a month.  It was really shocking for us.  And since then we've been much more careful about that.  But there is this vaccines are good,  more vaccines are better thing  that is slightly sketchy because the interactions  between the have and actually been tested.  And so they rely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I just, I really don't wanna come down on like  vaccines are good or bad or dog vaccines are good or bad.  I just wanna point out like the people who feel strongly  about a given topic will talk about something  and then you can type anything into Google  and we gotta return 10 results  or Google has to return 10 results.  And so that leads to interesting situations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why it's so difficult.  In fact, I think my attitude during this whole fake news  thing was I don't wanna see companies like Facebook  and Google trying to determine what's true or not.  Cause that's, I mean, I admittedly there's facts  in the world, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, nobody wants to be the truth police,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but there are truth police either exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there are some things that are egregious.  But the thing is that, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the two things we've mentioned,  well, I know we all agree that vaccines don't cause autism  and that climate change is manmade.  I know we all agree on that, but that is still debated.  Is it Google or Facebook's place to weigh in on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would argue no.  I would argue that egregious, the bar should be even higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how I would argue as well.  And then we can all agree that there's not a colony  of Martians or a colony of Moon denizens living on the Moon.  We can all agree on that.  That's egregious.  Right.  But nobody's publishing stories like that  cause there's no money to be made on stories like that.  That's the real problem, isn't it?  I guess maybe the weekly world news did for years  with the alien babies and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'm looking through the sites that we have  on our project.  And this is the, you could debate this one,  but I just put it aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, do you know, we should mention when you say  our project, so everybody knows and Matt knows that Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got you full disclosure, full disclosure  is I got $14 million from a combination  of Craig Newmark, Facebook, the Ford Foundation  and other supporters.  And we have independence in our governments,  but you should know that by all means  that I received those funds to give them back out  in the cause of truth and justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Jeff is one of the people who's doing this,  which is I think fantastic.  That's the news integrity project he's been mentioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I wanna have coffee with Matt too,  cause I wanna get his perspective  about how this world operates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have a dog in this hunt.  I mean, this is something you spent a lot of time  thinking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But is it a vaccinated dog?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a serious topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't mean to be polite.  It is a serious topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually I think your point's well taken too.  Kevin loves his poodles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna take care of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other three upstairs.  It's clear of course that dogs need to be vaccinated  against rabies and they're heartworm  and there are lots of things.  And I think you make a good point.  You can over vaccinate out of greed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point is more that puppies  need to be vaccinated against it.  And dogs need a refresher at some interval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every three years for distemper or something like that.  I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the interval is not annually.  And actually most vets will send you an annual thing  because that's their way of getting you in the door.  And that's the-  I think we need to do a story on bad vets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I've run into bad vets as well.  And I think-  Oh God, I can tell you about ours.  Our dog was also, I think, ultimately killed  by bad veterinary treatment.  So our dog ended up having,  Ozzy ended up having a $10,000 back surgery  that I think he didn't need and I think killed him.  But that's another story for another day.  So bad vets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Leo, if you go to truthuncensored.net, I think,  with your ad blocker off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Your ad blocker off.  Okay.  Do you want to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you go down,  if you go down the second row of stories, for example,  one story they have there is breaking.  Government admits plan to microchip the population.  Yes, of course they do.  Right?  So I could argue about the credibility of this site.  But for me, I have ads galore on this thing.  Loft, Zodiac, Strappy Thong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scary dollar prediction, scary Bitcoin prediction.  Yeah.  No, I see them all.  Do you see, so here's Tabula.  I see Tabula ads.  Do you see any Google ads on there though?  No.  I don't see, well, I do get my ad choices link.  I always love that.  You do have a choice when it comes to ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not necessarily Google.  Oh, it's Google.  That's AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that correct?  I think it is.  Yeah.  So this here, the cameras saw it all.  She wore very little  and you won't believe what she showed is a Google ad  because I get the ad choices link on it.  Unless somebody's spoofing that.  Which wouldn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone at the Googleplex right now is like,  shut it down, shut it all down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From the web sponsored links, that's Tabula, right?  Yeah, that's a Tabula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or one of them.  Yeah, the scary Bitcoin predictions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  also has ad choices on it.  Does that mean it's Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it does.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, yes.  The link is to Google.  Not always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's GoogleAdsServices.com.  That's the link.  Google Ads Services.  One of them is, but another one.  Is that a real one?  Yeah, see if, when I hover over the link,  it's www.GoogleAdsServices.com  and then of course the long extra stuff.  So these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Leo, some of the, you have that same arrow.  That same arrow can appear on non-Google ads.  No, no, I know.  It's a standard of sorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a Google ad.  Yeah, there's Tabula here as well.  Yep.  Just because I'm telling,  the link is through Google Ads Services.  So Google is absolutely has not pulled their ads  from Truth Uncensored, the truth about political news.  But this may be a political,  see I think this doesn't rise to the level  that was talking about of egregiousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it does.  Sometimes in the past we've seen somebody  admit that they defrauded somebody  or admit that a story was fake.  There was a story about an 11 or a 13 year old  who got money and called in prostitutes  to play Xbox with him.  And it was all just this viral story  that somebody concocted.  And then the person admitted that they had  deliberately done this as a fake story.  That's me on the pale.  This I would say is more slanted than fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Liberal news outlets working overtime  to cover huge democratic scandals.  That kind of thing.  So this is why it's so difficult though, right?  I mean this is the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just because you from your political vantage point  may hate this doesn't necessarily mean it's fake news  by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fake news would have to be.  So I do doubt that the government  has been planning to micrarchip us all.  Well that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake news would have to be demonstratively false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a note.  Well, but here's the issue.  So I've had people ask me, well if it's like 90% okay,  is that okay?  No, because they throw the 90% on of seemingly okay stuff  to sneak the 10% by.  Let me give you another one.  I'm gonna give up.  This is real or whatever right now.  If you go to my numbers section,  you will see a fascinating link I think  to the, hold on here,  Russian Twitter propaganda dashboard.  Oh I saw this.  This is amazing.  Curieddemocracy.org.  This is phenomenal.  And it's a very legitimate organization  that is going through and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now it calls Sputnik and RT Russian propaganda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  And also the way this works is they identify  Twitter accounts that were tied to Russian propaganda  and then they see what they are presenting.  And what domains and what stories.  And you see a big tie to this  to things like Breitbart and stuff.  Trending domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Idraintheswamp.com, bigleaguepolitics.com,  weaselzippers.us.  I don't know what that's all about.  Might have more to do with veterinarian vaccines.  I don't know.  But that's, I mean the first two are clearly  a Trump focus.  Top topics, Trump, US, Russia, Russian, Syria.  But you know you could say that about  if you were Washington Post,  you know covering Washington Post tweets  it would probably be the same ranking of those subjects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robin I looked at this earlier today.  There were other topics.  Stephen Miller is big right now.  Ben Rhodes, that story.  That story is, Ben Rhodes.  That's a part of the story.  That's a part of the story that you're seeing  that on the right, you do not see that all on the left.  I don't know why Howard Dean is on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well he's become once again relevant.  I don't know.  This is really interesting.  Do they assert that how many bots do they think are Russian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're tracking 300 of them.  So I remember, I went through their fact before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can't find it now.  Dashboard tracking Russian propaganda on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well we, you know.  Matt, on the show before I've gone on  at paranoid tin hat length.  I read the NATO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NATO.  They just talked to him.  Netflix is it right Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said the magic words  that caused this internet connection to drop out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I have this with me.  If I do a Google search my browser,  Skype drops out in the background.  I've no idea what's going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Skype says,  oh you want some bandwidth for that browser?  Let's do that.  Let's do that instead.  FTC is, Epic has gone to the FTC  to submit a complaint  about this Google technology that we were talking about.  Remember we said that.  And it was, the way it was written in the papers  it did sound pretty skeezy.  Google would be able to tie your online ad viewing  with your offline purchases  using something called store sales measurement.  A consumer profiling technique  to track consumers who make offline purchases.  The idea is to tell advertisers  how effective their ads are.  And of course, you know,  the way we do it on our shows generally  is with what they call direct response.  We give you a promo code that's got our name in it  or we give you a URL, slash twit.  And the advertisers say,  well we got this many responses  so that's the tracking we do.  But it's hard to do that in every case,  certainly a lot of Google ads don't.  So this was designed I think by Google sales  to help advertisers understand  how their ads were doing.  You know, did you sell that car?  When Ford is on twit, they can't say,  well we know we sold this many cars because of twit  without doing a lot of research  and Google hopes to help them with that.  According to Google, it could track about 70%  of all credit card and debit card transactions in the US  and tie them back to you, to the people who made them,  to seeing those ads.  Epic has filed with the FTC asking  that they investigate this.  Request for investigation, injunction and other relief.  Against this technology.  We got them back, Jeff Jarvis is back.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's one of these things,  it's like they've been trying to do this for a long time  and there were lots of sketchy organizations  in the US that do this already.  Experian Equifax and those guys are trawling all that data  and trying to get stuff about you.  For Google to tie up with that is,  yeah it's a little disappointing.  They also have been doing Google Wallet stroke,  Android Pay stroke, whatever it's called this week  and Apple has been doing a similar thing  and there's a set of like,  if we can track all the payments,  we can keep track of all this stuff.  But a lot of it is based on sort of guessing correlations  and in fact, most of the Equifax stuff is sort of bad,  big data correlation stuff.  Now Google is better at that than those companies are  and so could do a better job of correlating that stuff.  There may be a case for being a little more nervous  about it but in practice, we already gave up this thing  when we accepted credit ratings 20 years ago, 30 years ago.  This is Gero Nania's point is that the Turing test  was passed at the point where we started doing stupid things  with our credit to try and locate an algorithm somewhere  at Equifax.  I did this when I moved to America.  I moved to America from the UK with a large amount of money  because I'd just sold a house  but did I have a credit rating?  Did I? Hell.  And I had to go and see a guy and say,  oh yeah, borrow this, pay it back, do this, pay it back.  Do these six things, now you have a credit rating.  Now you get more rich.  We tell college kids to do this, we do.  Yeah.  And it's basically somebody's reverse engineered  the heuristic that these 1980s mainframe algorithms  are trying to do.  So there is a problem here but the problem is not  Google's giant AI or any of this stuff.  It is that we have sort of delegated our judgment  to the machines and even a really bad algorithm  will let us do that.  And that's the bigger problem than the AI  taking over the world problem.  It's the, do we actually understand what we're doing here  or are we just guessing?  And that's the piece that makes me more nervous.  So specifically going after Google is,  yeah, let's keep an eye on them  and make sure they're behaving well.  They will probably try really hard to behave well  because they're smart and they realize it's a problem.  Whereas a lot of the other companies  will be doing less of that.  But the real answer is legislation about this  and holding them to account in public.  And the thing that's happening in this realm is,  I don't know how much we've talked about,  but the real answer is,  I don't know how much we've talked about the GDPR stuff  a little bit on this show,  but that's the sort of ticking time bomb  that's happening in Europe,  which is actually writing new regulations  about what you can do about profiling  and tracking user data  and making sure people have actually consented  to their data being tracked.  And that's a big change that's going through at the moment.  And in the UK, everyone I'm talking to  is thinking about this and saying,  how do we make our stuff compliant with this?  I mean, in the US, they're still going,  but it's actually,  there is legislation that is gonna come into effect  next year that has actual teeth in it  about tracking user data in the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the government admits a plan  to microchip the population.  Oh no, sorry.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  This is good story.  So yeah, that's an interesting conundrum.  I guess.  I'm a bad guy to ask about this stuff  because I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, of course, you're comfortable enough  you can get away with it.  And also you gave up on your privacy years ago.  Right.  Coasting on the other end of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I can't use my own feelings about this  as a way to judge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, exactly.  But part of the problem,  that is the structural problem too  in that a lot of the people  who are making the decisions about this  are people who are well off  and live in Silicon Valley  and have a fairly comfortable life  and haven't actually hit the issues.  That's exactly right.  Yep.  And that's the structural thing  that they don't actually have the ability  to imagine the problems that you have if you're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not getting denied credit.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You don't have access to credit.  You don't have access to banking.  If you're trying to get everything in cash  and work with this, that's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I'm just saying I don't mind  if an advertiser knows that I bought something  based on an ad I saw in a Google ad.  And if that helps, not Google,  but if it helps the website that's running the Google ad,  I don't think that's a bad thing.  But again, I'm in the,  I'm kind of quasi in the advertising business.  We sell advertising, that's what keeps us afloat.  But I can understand why an advertiser  would want to know that.  And I don't feel like,  okay, so here's the nub of it.  And I'll let Jeff argue this too maybe,  but what is the harm in Google  connecting these data points?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the harm is-  Goes after privacy all the time,  but I think the real question here  is that this is an advertiser benefit, a media benefit.  At the same time, up a couple spots in the rundown  is Ray Kurzweil is writing your emails for you  because Google is still reading your emails.  I didn't realize that this is-  Not reading your emails for ads anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no idea that Ray Kurzweil,  the great artificial intelligence scientist,  is on the smart reply team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're reading your emails or write replies,  and we're cool with that  because that's a great service to us.  Right, I don't hear any complaints about that,  people love it.  The thing about the ad value,  which is gonna maybe save media.  Yeah, yeah, and Google stopped doing ads  out of reading email,  but now they're writing replies for you, and I'm using it.  Hell yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and it is useful, sure.  So the thing I would look, mathbabe.org,  you know Cathy O'Neill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love Cathy O'Neill, we've interviewed her-  Weapons of Mathematics, Russia, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's really good on this stuff  because she's actually thought about it at depth  and written it well in ways people can understand,  and written about the idea,  basically it's model failure.  It's people who are building very naive models  and then somehow getting them baked into  the way we experience the world.  And that's the piece that's wrong with this.  And the answer is not give up modeling,  the answer is give up better models  and have more transparent models.  So the GDPR stuff for me is that,  I think that's an encouraging step  because it's basically saying,  okay, you can do this stuff,  but you've gotta get people to agree to it,  and you've gotta explain it  in a way they can actually understand.  So you've gotta get consent from people  to what kind of data manipulations  you're gonna do on their data.  And that is different from the classic  Google worldview was,  we'll grab all the data  and try and make sense of it later  because that works for the web,  and that model was extended to personal data as well  with the obvious like the drive by WiFi scraping  and things like that that we've talked about before.  And that having some kind of stop and think about that a bit  is like don't be evil.  It's saying, think about the consequences  of what you're doing  and make sure that you can explain this  to the person whose data you're tracking.  And that's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is very different.  What Cathy O'Neill is saying is,  not that it's bad to gather the data,  nor is it bad to analyze it,  it's just bad to use bad models.  But I don't think Epic is saying that.  Epic's saying, no, no,  you shouldn't be collecting this data at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that is also part of this as well.  Part of it is, what should you default to?  Right.  Yeah, there's, if you listen to Maciej and Rory Doctorow,  there is the, personal data is like,  toxic waste, you've got to be careful about how you handle it.  You've got to make sure you don't spill it anywhere.  There's a lot of overhead to that.  And do you really want to be dealing with this  if you don't actually understand it?  There was an example in the UK that-  Right, well, so is that okay, Kevin?  My example is weather spoons,  which is a big pub chain in the UK,  recently deleted their entire email database  because they were worried there might be a breach,  they're worried about the GDPR stuff coming,  and actually most of their business people  walking through the door with cash  and having an email list  was not giving them much benefit from that.  So from their point of view,  it's like this isn't worth the pain of this,  and which is very different from a business like Google.  But it is worth another raise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I want to say is,  I think of the examples you just gave,  it's the data void rule.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is MIT's bandwidth not working?  Of all the places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take over for Jeff.  I'll be substitute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  Be substitute Jeff, Matt, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, if I were a substitute Jeff,  I understand probably from Google's perspective,  they think their advertising is very effective,  and so showing that this drives offline sales  is something that they would really want to do  so that people don't waste their $100 million  of brand advertising on stuff that doesn't work.  But to me it depends on how much of this is in aggregate,  because I'm very mindful of like this.  Google says it's all in aggregate by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says it's not.  There's no individual information being exposed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good, because I'm just mindful,  like if I'm channeling Stacey,  here we have a group of four white guys,  and yet if you think about an ad like Bail Bonds DC,  if you can track who clicks on that,  and then see what the offline usage of that,  then you start to learn something about people  that are vulnerable, and that's where it edges  into something that I would worry about.  So if they're only doing aggregate data,  then that makes me feel a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so I'll raise the issue there,  which is the generally agreed wisdom  that there's no such thing as anonymization,  and that as soon as you're aggregating the data,  you can't really anonymize the data.  Do you reject that, Matt?  Well, that was Jeff Kahn's story this week, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody set themselves up, I don't want to talk about  the story, somebody set themselves up as a data broker,  and got a lot of consumer data, I think in Germany,  which Jeff would enjoy, and then identified politicians  by looking for their names in their data,  because they basically had search URLs, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, New York Magazine had an article quoting  the Guardian story, three billion URLs  from three million German users in a database.  These researchers acquired it by pretending  to be a marketing company.  Yeah, and they demonstrated that it was not so difficult  to de-anonymize it, and we've seen this before many times.  So then, okay, Matt, so I agree with you,  if it's an aggregate, what's the harm?  I mean, we look at statistics all the time,  and it's funny because there was a great post on Medium,  I'll see if I can find it, about privacy,  that pointed out the first US census was posted publicly.  Everything that was known in the US census,  but that was more so people could check  to make sure it was accurate.  It's open sourced, yeah.  It was open sourced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they had, they still had  House things voting then as well, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, our conception of privacy, human conception  of privacy has changed considerably over the years.  This was actually a really good post  about the history of privacy.  See if I can find it.  From Yonatan, yeah.  Yeah, you saw it?  Yeah. No, from, yeah.  The Birth and Death of Privacy, 3,000 years of history  told through 46 images by Greg Ferenstein.  Greg's, yeah.  Yeah, and it's on Medium.  And it was a great, it was great,  and it really showed that what we think of  as kind of a human right and a human need  was really not acknowledged as either a need  or a right until fairly recently.  For instance, people didn't even read silently  until 1215 when the church mandated confessions  for the masses.  People shared beds until around 1700  because they were so expensive, you know?  In fact, it was a problem in hospitals  because they were having all the patients like 12 to a bed.  Vint Cerf says privacy may,  and I remember him talking about this,  may actually be an anomaly.  This might be something we only now  have started thinking about.  But we assume that this forever has been how it is.  So really well worth reading this article,  at least to jog your thinking on this, yeah.  And it's easy to read because there's lots of pictures.  I like that.  And video, this is video from a movie called Beowulf.  Oh, it's not available, they pulled it down.  Of all the people sleeping together in the hut.  There's some adult images in here by the way.  This is 3D Beowulf?  Yeah, the ugly, horrible 3D Beowulf.  You know what, I think Greg is just trying to make this  exciting, I think he's just trying to make this exciting.  But anyway, so, but let's get back to this issue.  Do you feel, Matt, as a data scientist,  I'm sure that that's some of your training  that you can aggregate data, anonymize it, and use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think probably what Google is after,  my guess is the top line, which is 70% of offline purchases  are influenced in some way.  And I suspect that is the most effective thing  for what they're trying to do.  And I would trust that they would be trying to  combine this data in an ethical way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody doubts that that's what Google's after.  The issue is, do they inadvertently leak information  like bail bonds, people who go to bail bondsmen,  inadvertently, is that information potentially  inadvertently leaked in this process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd have to look into that more  to have a strong opinion.  But it is the case that a lot of the times  you think you can anonymize data, and it turns out  people come up with a really creative way  to slice it in a different way,  and then they de-anonymize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's also the issue is that-  We also look at the cost of not allowing this.  That at some point media is gonna have to prove  its value to advertisers, and this is a way to do that.  It's a holy grail.  And to have advertiser support for so much  that we love in media, this may be necessary at some level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, well, and it's funny, it's a holy grail  for digital advertising companies like ours.  It is exactly what television and radio don't want you to do  because they don't really want you to know  how few of your ads are actually doing anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other part of this is in order to do this well,  you have to have enough data points to do realistic stats.  You can't do A-B testing without enough data  to know if this is significant or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we have to acknowledge big data is gonna happen.  It's happening, it's done.  There's no turning the clock back on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but the thing is, the problem is that  all this media stuff is parallel distributed.  So unless you are actually at very large scale,  you're not gonna be able to extract good enough data  to get anonymization out of it.  That is the challenge.  If you only get a few hundred referrals,  you can't really do much with that  because that's not enough to do any breakdown on it.  All right, we're gonna leave these giant questions.  If you get a few hundred people buying Ford cars  from the show, then we're doing well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, hey, Ford was very happy.  They were very happy.  But you know, actually, I always end up talking  about our business on this show, I don't know why.  But just a little peek behind the scenes,  the way you do that if you're Ford  or some other Procter & Gamble brand advertiser  is you with research, you call people.  Say, do you remember, did you ever listen to a show called,  and they'll give you five shows?  Do you remember any of the advertisers on there?  They call that unaided recall.  And if you get a high score, then it worked.  They can't measure sales.  It's too big a company to measure sales.  Google has, actually, this is a good one for Matt too,  is experimenting with a search console.  What is search console, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's what I'm thinking of, there's the webmaster tools,  which became the webmaster console,  and then webmaster, like who calls them webmasters anymore,  so now you can have a search console.  It's nice to have a channel where Google  can give information back to you  and get information from people  so that if you are trying to give  some structured information,  here's a place where you can do it,  you can make sure there's no syntax errors,  that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the original tools.  This is funny on a search console.  Wow, going back in time a little bit here.  But these kind of-  Two to six.  Yeah.  This is probably, this is right about your time, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, Vanessa Fox was a person who,  and there was a great team up in Washington State  that worked on this, the initial version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember this stuff.  So they now have more than two dozen reports,  they've got lots of useful tools,  and they've added two new ones,  or an extensive redesign to show you  more actionable insights, better support of workflow,  faster feedback loops between you and Google,  and the new beta features are,  I don't know what this any of this means,  but since Matt's here, I'm gonna bring it up,  index coverage report and amp fixing flow.  Somebody's buzzing like crazy, who's that?  Is that Matt?  Not it's me.  Unplug and replug, Matt.  Is it me?  I'm gonna give you the signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we hit the hour spot?  Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could be, it's 59 minutes into the show,  59 minutes and 48 seconds, and now we can't hear him.  You say it happens.  Uh oh, you can't hear me?  Now you're back, yeah, yeah, you're back.  That was us, I guess we muted you  so that you wouldn't buzz us.  So index coverage report shows  count of index pages information,  oh, so this is, I remember this from Webmaster Tools,  this is like what Google knows about you basically.  Yeah, how many pages have been crawled

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and are in Google's index?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that's cool.  And then what is amp fixing flow?  Oh, this is about issues with your site.  Ah, okay, fix the amp issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like they've got a nice title thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I hate Skype, we're just gonna shoot Skype right now  and put it out of its misery.  Thank you, Microsoft, job well done, goodbye.  Actually, Jeff's not using Skype,  he's using another technology called IPDTL  and it's just as bad, so we, you know what?  IPDTL.  Why did I think I could do a network,  a broadcast network with people over IP, voiceover IP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why did I think that?  Do you go through this at the other shows  or is it just us, is it me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lately, it's been happening more with Skype,  it's been happening a lot with Skype.  Really?  Actually, you know, I mean, in the early days  with Twitter, it was the worst, it was horrible.  I spent hours trying to fix the audio after every show.  Ah, Facebook is tweaking its mobile newsfeed  to prioritize fast loading pages.  Oh, Google's done that, of course, with its search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are they gonna support AMP pages  or are they just gonna support the ones that...  That's interesting, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, fair random mockup.  Even Facebook's instant articles is adopting AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can now write once published twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook says, we've heard from people  that it's frustrating to click on a link  that leads to a slow loading web page.  No kidding.  Yeah, I think.  Yeah, I think.  In fact, even more broadly on the internet,  we found that when people have to wait for a site  to load for too long, they abandon  what they were clicking on altogether.  Yep.  As many as 40% of website visitors  abandon a site after three seconds.  God, I bet you that I would love to see that number over time.  Was it five seconds 10 years ago?  Is it four seconds?  Yeah.  Is it gonna be one second next year?  And I bet that number's going down.  We are so impatient.  So the social network will soon take into account  the estimated load time of a web page  that someone clicks to from a newsfeed  and prefer pages that load faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure it's a second order effect,  but it's still probably pretty useful  in the sense that this is something like  everybody would prefer a faster website  over a slower website.  And it pushes all the sites of the web  in order to behave better.  It's not like that has a particular ideological bent  or anything like that.  It's like, no, everybody wants the web to be faster.  So it seems like a healthy thing to push those,  or to have encryption so that everybody knows  their connection is secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just good behavior.  But it is a little bit in this age of net neutrality,  a little bit of a disadvantage to sites  that don't have the resources or on shared servers.  They may be saying something very important  that deserves to show up in search results  or deserves to show up in the newsfeed,  but they can't be as fast as the news corp  because they don't have the resources, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can, no, what junks up the pages so much  is ads and trackers and other things.  So you could create a simple webpage.  Oh, two big images.  That's the easy part, no?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you could, you mentioned the webmaster,  Google has a tool called Lighthouse  that's quite good at this.  You throw it at your website and it says,  no, that's a bit slow.  Have you tried changing this to this?  And so it's like the webmaster  with a more speed-focused version of that  rather than are you checking the boxes  on our indexing thing?  And it will tell you to make a progressive web app  because that's part of what its job is,  but it will actually give you a prioritized list  of these images are loading really slowly  or these images are really big,  you should make them smaller,  or this CSS is loading really slowly.  Do you wanna check where you're serving that from?  It will actually do that kind of profiling for you,  which is quite neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just try Lighthouse on our page.  It's a Chrome plugin.  Yeah, I got it.  I'm just worried that it's gonna be really bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does load it three times  because it loads it with different windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the mobile version  because that's a small window.  Oh God, I'm depressed.  Oh dear.  I'm really depressed.  You need to do some image variants there.  Those are loading slowly.  Lord above, lord above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now check Matt's Vets site.  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the vets.gov is doing great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and there's probably some adoption curve  where you can say in the early days,  you don't wanna speed to be that strong of a factor.  It's definitely a second or even third order effect,  but even including it as a factor makes people say,  you know what, I should start paying attention to this.  So even if it doesn't get that much weight  in Facebook's algorithm,  to have people see that and hear that  means that now it's on their mind, it's on their radar,  and they're like, well, I can't just wait 30 seconds  for my pages to load.  I have to at least think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I got a 97% for accessibility.  That's good, but performance only 69,  and in fact, everything else sucks.  I didn't register a service worker.  Oh, you don't even wanna know.  Does not respond with a 200 when offline.  I don't know what that.  User will not be prompted to install the web app.  What?  Is not configured for a custom splash screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the AMP stuff, just scroll beyond that.  Oh, that's AMP, I don't care about that.  No, no, progressive web app stuff, which is good,  but it isn't the performance tab is the next one.  This is the one I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you look at first, yeah.  First meaningful paint, 4.7 milliseconds.  First interactive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, best.gov, I got a five seconds there,  so maybe it doesn't work for UK as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, best practices, five failed audits.  Oh, Lord, I don't care anymore.  Goodbye, goodbye, Lighthouse.  I guess I'm not gonna rank up there on Facebook.  I mean, do you worry about that at all?  I mean, I understand that you can do things  to speed up a site, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's useful to look at these things  because it will often say,  oh, you've got this one image there and you're like.  No, that I understand.  And certainly if you have something important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to say on your blog,  you should probably use Lighthouse and so forth.  I just worry that algorithms will prioritize pages  that load in less than two seconds  and that will leave out a lot of the  most interesting valuable stuff.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not as worried about that  because we would get questions about that  at search conferences at Google  and somebody would say,  well, my website takes five seconds to load.  And a lot of what people don't realize  is some web pages take 60 seconds to load.  Like we have seen. That's bad.  Yeah, I think one of the reasons healthcare.gov  looked like or some sites looked like they were broken  is we recently ran into a website  where it took five minutes for the page to load.  So of course everybody was like,  well, it's not working, so I'll just reload,  which then just made things worse.  So people don't realize just how bad some websites can be.  So maybe there's something that would say,  if you're more than 30 seconds to load  or 25 seconds to load, then okay,  we ding you by some small amount  so that we look for better alternatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should ask Joey Ito about this,  Jeff, while you're there at the MIT's Media Lab,  Google and MIT's new machine learning algorithms.  Retouch your photos before you take them.  This is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The algorithm is now so tight,  it can adjust the photo before you take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, wow.  So, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so it can do it in the viewfinder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's doing it the whole time you're looking at  whatever you're looking, in case you take a picture.  Yeah. Wow.  Computational photography is amazing.  I don't agree, however, with Vic Gundotra.  This is fascinating.  Who says, I should ditch my DSLR,  my thousands of dollars of cameras,  because frankly, the iPhone is all you need.  Now this is-  And never buy an Android.  Never buy, this is so, now remember,  okay, the story of Vic Gundotra as he worked at Microsoft,  worked then at Google, working with Apple  on the Google apps for the iPhone,  was apparently a great advocate for Google and social  and prodded Larry Page till he set up Google Plus.  Then left, he's currently at Cardia, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he was also kind of Mr. Mobile at Google too.  Mr. Mobile in between, then I left out of stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then he left and he's founded Cardia,  which we've talked about, we really like.  It's one of the few devices,  medical devices with FDA approval.  He posted, okay, so I'm thinking he's throwing shade  at his old employer, because first of all,  he posted this not on Google Plus, but on Facebook, right?  And then he says, I love my iPhone so much,  I'm getting rid of my DSLR  and one should never use an Android phone again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He added that in the comments, he was goaded into it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but yeah, Scoble was goading him on.  Scoble was the one who said,  oh, I gave my expensive Canon systems  to some filmmakers just because of this, I love the shot.  Of course, and he's showing off two pictures  of his daughters, Vic's daughters,  using the portrait feature in the iPhone.  But as many have pointed out, portrait does a terrible job.  You know, it only is impressive if you're not a pro  or pixel peeping or really paying attention.  The dot in her hair is strangely out of focus  in this picture is just one example.  There was, he created quite a storm,  and I loved reading the, yeah,  there's one response from Android Central,  but I loved reading the comments back and forth.  I mean, as you said, Scoble completely agreed,  there were a number of people who said,  are you kidding, the Pixel phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were some other prominent people in that argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pixel has a far better camera than the iPhone,  and I think many agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Pixel itself takes good pictures.  I've been taking some very pleasant pictures  with this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seems like Vic's biggest interest here  was in iPhone's portrait mode.  But I think the point was made that with two lenses,  the iPhone 7 Plus can do things that a single lens camera  like the Pixel XL can't do.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's gonna, you know,  I've been writing about that for years.  Yeah, sure, more lenses helps  because then you can do synthetic aperture stuff.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real takeaway here  is how powerful computational photography is, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's only gonna get more true.  And as we throw more sensors, you know,  we're gonna be having more sensors on our phones over time  for lots of reasons.  And they get cheaper and cheaper,  and being able to do this will make more sense.  And it's like the MIT thing is part of that.  But even just the way HDR works now is like that too.  The stuff that this phone does with HDR,  because it can do it quick enough  that there's no motion blur,  is actually impressive, is very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a picture posted by a photographer,  Matthias Appel, from his Nikon D7000 DSLR.  He says to Vic, well, then it should be no problem  to recreate this with your iPhone.  Is that a lemur?  I don't know what it is, but it is an amazing shot.  And you probably couldn't do that with a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lemur with a very long zoom as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, long zoom.  So Matt, do you miss dog fooding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I miss dog fooding so much,  but you know, I still have my Pixel XL.  I just, I'll throw out one computational photography idea,  which I have not had time to do,  which is if you can control the focus plane  in software from your camera,  you could imagine marching your focus plane forward  and basically doing a 3D reconstruction of a scene  using only the regular camera.  So if something had enough stuff,  you could actually do that.  So if somebody wants to write a fun app,  just cycle through the focal planes,  see what is at most focus at each range,  and you could probably reconstruct  a poor man's 3D version of a scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or do what the Lytro does,  which is a very expensive camera  that effectively does that and allows you to choose  what part is in focus after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what Facebook was showing at F8 too,  was recreating a 3D scene from the image, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that does, as you, that's really interesting, Matt.  You're absolutely right.  You don't need two lenses for that  or special depth sensing or anything like that.  Just, you just need to take a lot of pictures fast,  which we already are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Android has had that as lens blur  for about four years now,  but now it's actually practical.  It used to be you had to be really careful  and go, ooh, move it up.  Whereas now I can, you know,  I can grab a photo of my microphone and go,  oh, I want the microphone focus,  I want the glass in focus,  and it just switches between them.  And that's the one lens.  If you had two or three lenses on here,  which obviously you will have soon,  then you can do that in real time  and you could actually do the MIT thing of  do it in the viewfinder and pick your focal plane there.  Because actually these things have depth of field.  You know, they're basically little tiny mineral cameras.  They've got huge depth of field,  but often what you want is to pull the stuff out  from the foreground and the background.  And if you've got more lenses, you can do that.  So yeah, this is obviously coming in next year's  or this year's phones as they come out this year,  you know, at the end of the year.  We're gonna have many more little cameras in there  because it's the obvious thing to do next.  And that will mean, you know, firstly, it's,  you know, the obvious thing to do first  is to put two in so you can do actually  stereoscopic photography and you can shoot video  where you've got a 3D thing.  And everyone's been shipping 3D headsets for two years.  You know, Apple's talking about AR.  Google has been talking about it for a year.  So that's obviously gonna happen too.  But the other part of that is if you,  just by putting more lenses on there,  you can do this kind of image process  and do some very powerful things with it.  So yeah, that's clearly gonna be shipping this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, it's not just in phones, by the way.  My wife shoots, I shoot a big full frame camera  as I just got the Sony A9,  which is a really interesting complicated sensor  that's stacked, there's all sorts of things.  But my wife shoots a micro four thirds.  She's using an Olympus OM-D.  And it is getting amazingly high quality images.  And I'm convinced this is computational photography.  From a much smaller sensor, the clarity,  the detail is as good as any full sensor.  So this kinds of computational photography  is also migrating into cameras.  And cameras with small sensors bigger than a phone,  camera phone sensor, but with small sensors  relative to the big DSLRs are doing remarkable jobs.  This Olympus blows me away every single time.  I can't believe the images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you will still get better results  with a good lens on the front of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glass is glass.  Physics is always gonna be there.  But you can create with computational.  You can do amazing.  Correct for bad glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I just put a link in the chat.  The stuff that the HDR does now is just like,  okay, I'm gonna take a photograph of my dogs  in a cornfield in front of the sunset.  And all of it is exposed.  That's gorgeous.  What a great show.  And I could not do that with film  without sitting there for a long time thinking about it  or actually bracketing and then mixing it afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would just say, if you say all of this is happening  on the camera phone, it's also happening to the same degree  on bigger cameras, more expensive cameras,  maybe even to a greater degree.  You're seeing amazing stuff being done.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also you're starting to see it done  at 4K video resolution as well,  which is the other sort of freaky thing about this.  The stuff that you can do with that now is quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, people I think think, well,  but the phone is a computer, but absolutely these days,  if you're buying a DSLR, you're buying a computer  that happens to have a sensor and pieces of glass  in front of it, but it's just as much of a computer.  That's a beautiful shot.  Was that a single shot done in camera HDR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me see what it says.  Hang on.  It was, I'm pretty sure it was HDR.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's gotta be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gotta be HDR.  I can see in the info here.  Yeah.  Pixel XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says F2, 1 2,000th, ISO 51.  Yeah.  It doesn't actually say what it's HDR.  Yeah.  I mean, the thing is it has,  by default it's HDR auto now,  so we'll actually just guess whether it needs it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's clearly HDR.  I mean, if you look at the lower right corner  and compare it to the upper left, the brightness.  There's a brightness range there.  Much larger than the human eye, I'm sure.  Hey, let's take a little break.  We've got lots more.  Kevin Marks is visiting us from Middlesbrough, UK.  Say that right?  Middlesbrough, yeah.  Middlesbrough, UK.  Middlesbrough.  Middlesbrough, where he and his poodles have,  to where he and his poodles have migrated  to be closer to his sons.  It's always a pleasure.  Thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.  Cause I know it's late at night here.  There.  It's almost midnight, right?  We'll get done by midnight.  I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, 11.35, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Also with us all the way from MIT, Jeff Jarvis.  You look like with the lights behind you, frankly.  It looks, that headphone could be a halo.  You could be Jesus.  Of course it is.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the Jesus of the journalists,  Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com, and a professor of journalism.  You gotta send this picture to your students  at the City University of New York,  where he teaches journalism.  And also joining us.  I think I'll draw a light board during the break.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're thrilled to have him, Matt Cutts  of the US Digital Service, usds.gov,  where he is doing great work as the acting administrator,  helping websites and technology  in the government get better and faster.  And gosh, it's great to see you again after,  it seems like a year.  You having fun enjoying yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't say it's fun, but it's very meaningful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's almost better, right?  Fun is overrated.  Fun is like Elon Musk say, I couldn't live on that.  I couldn't hang out on the beach.  I'd go crazy.  I need stimulus.  Satisfaction is fun in the long run.  Right, it's important work.  Yeah, you must feel good about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great.  How's living in DC, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DC is a pretty great city.  I haven't been on the Eastern seaboard in a while,  and so there's a lot to do.  There's good food these days.  And I will say the US Digital Service  has a lot of transient people  coming from across the country.  And so we do some fun things from escape rooms  to karaoke to game nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good group.  How many people are there at the USDS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little less than 200.  Oh, that's big.  Yeah, we're split halfway between different agencies  versus headquarters.  We've got groups at Veterans Affairs,  Health and Human Services,  just a bunch of, Department of Homeland Security,  the Pentagon, a bunch of different places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when you start working with one of these agencies,  you send a SWAT team and they get headquartered  over at the agency to do the work.  And are you getting new assignments?  Have things slowed down?  I mean, who's running you?  Are you part of the Department of Commerce?  Who's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we technically sit in the Office of Management  and the Budget, which is in the Executive Office  of the President, yeah.  But what tends to happen is something blows up  or something is on fire.  So for example, if military families want to move  across the country and that system is not performing,  then we'll come in and say,  okay, what can we do to figure out how to improve that?  And then we also have some engagements  that we've been doing for quite a while  that are continuing that are really important  and impactful stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  USDS just set off its report to Congress a few days ago,  so you can read more about this on the website, USDS.gov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we are looking for tech folks.  So if you're interested.  Nice. Absolutely, yeah.  If I had a good product manager, designer, engineer,  like $100 million plus projects  we could make a difference on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's information about how much you've saved  our government at itdashboard.gov  and it looks like you're saving us some money,  some significant money.  I like that.  I like that a lot.  We're a pretty good value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not just about saving money,  it's about improving services, right?  No, but if you're gonna get budget,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're gonna get Congress to fund you,  you gotta show them this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technology is one of those areas  where the services can get better and they can get cheaper.  Usually you don't get both of those.  Yeah, isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has the Donald ever dropped by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been in a room with the president  two or three times.  Wow.  Does he know what you do?  So we work with an office called  the Office for American Innovation.  So Jared Kushner and Chris Liddell,  who's the former CFO of Microsoft.  And that group of folks absolutely realizes  the importance of making sure  that technology works well in the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how politicized is it?  You feel like you're above the fray,  you don't have to really worry about the politics going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're a nonpartisan group.  So the one thing that everybody can agree on  is government technology should work better  and we spend way too much  and we don't get services that are what you would expect  on a Google or an iPhone or a Facebook website.  And so if you can use your phone  and see how good it is  and then try to use a government piece of technology  and see how bad it is,  that's something that everybody agrees needs to work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to usds.gov, there's a join us button.  And if you are maybe looking at a sabbatical  at your cushy job at Google or something like that,  you maybe wanna spend some of that time in DC  helping things run better for the people.  I like that.  Thank you for your service, Matt.  Appreciate it.  Indeed.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by,  we'll have more, we have lots more to talk about.  We gotta get it going here.  Our show today brought to you by CloudFlare.  Talk about service.  This is, CloudFlare is on a mission  to build a better internet.  I've talked to the folks at CloudFlare.  It's so great because they say,  because I try to tell you everything CloudFlare does  and they say, you don't have to say everything  because it goes on and on and on.  CloudFlare is an amazing company.  Of course, we're good friends with John Graham coming.  We've talked to many of the folks  including Mark Rogers at CloudFlare.  He's their security guy.  Some of the smartest people in the world work at CloudFlare.  The initial benefit to you is they can make your site  or your app faster.  They can make it safer because in effect,  they have a web application firewall.  I'll tell you how that works.  It's amazing.  They can make it more reliable.  So you're protected against DDoS.  You're protected against inadvertent DDoS,  the slash dot effect,  where a lot of people go to your site all at once.  You can stop worrying if you use CloudFlare  about slow loading page times, downtime,  about getting hacked.  It's easy to use.  You can sign up in five minutes.  And can I tell you something?  There is a free tier that is really, really good.  One of the reasons CloudFlare offers this protection  to you for free, see, $0 a month over on the left,  is because by being a part of the CloudFlare network,  you help them provide a more useful web application firewall  with a massive IP reputation database  that updates for everybody,  the free people and the paid people.  So it's really valuable.  Of course, CloudFlare security team,  starting with Mark, is constantly watching 24 seven  for vulnerabilities, deploying real time protection.  I know a lot of you know about their DDoS protection,  but they also give you IPv6,  which can make a huge difference in your performance  and on a mobile app.  I mean, just boom, like that.  They have a CDN, 115 plus data centers worldwide,  which caches your content,  moves it closer to your customers.  That'll speed you up.  I mean, I can go on and on.  We've got something actually really great.  If you're interested in CloudFlare,  if you go to cloudflare.com slash twit,  they are offering a webinar with their absolute,  one of their best support engineers.  He's really great at talking about this,  Jameson Sundell and explaining it.  And you can be part of it, ask questions,  find out what CloudFlare can do for you.  All you have to do is go to cloudflare.com slash twit,  give them your name and email  and you'll register for a session with Jameson.  It's fantastic.  I can, you know, if you're using cloud solutions  like AWS or Google Cloud or Azure,  CloudFlare can help you work with all of them  and eliminate lock-in.  So you can use more than one provider.  And then if you decide to move on, you're not locked in.  I mean, it goes on and on.  This is a great company doing amazing technical work  and helping websites everywhere.  Cloudflare.com slash twit.  Find out more by talking to Jameson Sundell.  Prices range from free to $20 a month to $200 a month.  Of course, as you get bigger,  you're gonna want an enterprise plan  and they can work with you on that too.  Don't get hit by DDoS.  Don't get hit with security flaws.  Work better for your customers.  It's a win all around at cloudflare.com slash twit.  And we thank them so much for their support  of this week in Google.  Let's see, what else should we talk about here?  There's so, there was a lot of, here's a surprise.  The YouTube TV, I actually have been paying for this  and I love it, it's $35 a month.  I get my locals in San Francisco.  Two million downloads for this cord gutter app.  That means, I don't know, they don't say  how many subscriptions, but that's pretty amazing.  That's at least two million people trying it.  According to Sensor Tower, 700,000 new installs  since the announcement last week  that was entering new markets.  So I think people are kind of waiting,  can we get the local stations from YouTube TV?  And when you can, it really is a good deal.  I really like it.  This ties into an article I had,  I thought I'm reading the onion, but it wasn't the onion.  It was the Wall Street Journal.  Did you see this article?  Millennials Unearthed, an Amazing Hack to Get Free TV.  The antenna.  They quote, I gotta sign in because it's behind that paywall,  they quote some millennials who say,  I had no idea that all this free programming was out there  and all I had to do was get us some rabbit ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why did this last year, the year before  when I was in San Jose, it was like, okay,  I don't actually need to pay cable for TV  because I have Netflix and Amazon  and if I just stick a thing on the wall,  I can get the live stuff that the cable providers  can give me and that's done.  And in the UK, it's even better  with the digital over the air stuff here  is actually really good.  And all the channels have, there's IPlayer for the BBC,  there's an ITV app, there's a channel four app,  there's a channel five app.  So all the channels are competing  to give you digital versions of their stuff too.  So I buy a TV here, it says,  give me an internet connection,  give me an over the air connection  and I'll give you what you can find out of both.  So it's already happened here and the US lags a bit  because there are these monopoly cable providers  who are trying to persuade you  that you need to pay them 200 dollars a month  to do this for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of the joke of it is,  look, I didn't have to go to the cable company  to get all these free sites, it's amazing.  It's incredible.  I can't understand why the Wall Street Journal  wrote this article, to be honest with you.  I really did think I must be reading the onion here.  Shows a millennial family watching television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of this is like, oh, let's mock millennials.  There was some guy today saying,  millennials tell me they don't ask the doorbell  unless someone texts them first.  And it's like, and it's like, yes.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  You're a journalist in London,  but there's in your office a living like six to a flat,  they're not gonna answer the door  because half the things won't be for them.  They're not in a house in suburbs like you are.  And they don't have a family member at home  who would answer the door for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just kind of surprised that this technology exists,  says Mr. Cisco, 28 years old.  It's been awesome.  It doesn't log out and it doesn't skip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you have to stand up and hold the antenna  and put your left leg up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We gotta teach them that.  Apparently, antenna sales are up 7%,  eight million units,  according to the Consumer Technology Association.  So maybe there is a boom in antenna TV.  Cisco says-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember back 15 years ago,  we were down to 12% of America  got their TV from over the air.  It's gotta be next to nothing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Almost a third of Americans, 29%,  are unaware that local TV is available free,  according to a survey  by the National Association of Broadcasters.  What?  Has that things changed this much?  Oh, you can watch, wait a minute, what?  It's flying through the air.  And somebody says, is that legal?  24 year old Hunter Wills, living in Chicago,  mostly watches Netflix.  I had no idea.  I'm still not even familiar with the concept.  She thought it was some modern satellite service  or something.  He's one of the guys says of his daughter in her early 20s.  Okay, I just, okay, wow, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we all doomed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're doomed, we're doomed.  I just wanna give them a dial telephone  and see what they do with it.  Okay, let's see.  Two billion users, Facebook's profits, revenues soar.  Nothing more to say on that.  Jeez Louise, man, oh man, oh man.  Twitter stock plunges as it shows,  it shows literally zero growth in monthly active users.  But Twitter said, but daily active users were up 50%.  50% of what?  They wouldn't say.  So the SEC says, well, why don't you disclose  daily user numbers?  What are you hiding?  328 million monthly active users.  But actually this letter from the SEC  goes back to May.  Twitter's response, it said, well,  showing growth is more important than showing the number.  The reason they said is, well,  we're afraid you'll compare it to Facebook.  And quote, investors would not be able to compare  for performance between the company  and this other company, too late.  Whereas Facebook has two billion monthly active users.  I don't know, I'm not worried about Twitter.  They've got the Trump effect, my God.  This is, Donald Trump is now issuing  executive orders on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neglecting to mention it to anybody else,  just putting it on Twitter.  And then, oh, I loved the tweet.  I don't wanna knock him.  He's the President of the United States,  I acknowledge that, that's boss.  So I don't wanna knock him,  but I have to read this tweet to you  because I just was like, my jaw dropped.  Wasn't the first time.  He's talking about, he says,  only the fake news media, oh, let me get rid of this.  Only the fake news media and my enemies  want me to stop using social media.  And then I'm not sure what 110 million people, I guess,  is referring to his followers.  Only way for me to get the truth out.  Donald, you're the President of the United States.  You have a button you can press  that would send a text message  to every smartphone in the country.  You can go on ABC, CBS and NBC,  anytime you want and tell people anything you want,  you don't need the Twitter.  But please continue to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, I get mad when journalists say,  well, he really should get off Twitter.  That is not the journalist's job to do.  I say, let him be him.  And he's the President, he can use Twitter.  It's not our job to tell him what to do and what not to do.  No, no, he should tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I maybe think you could argue,  and I'm sure a few people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff have,  that it might be better not to set military policy  on Twitter, but that's just a procedural issue.  I'm sorry, Matt, I shouldn't do that to you.  I'm not gonna, no, don't just shut up.  You didn't hear it, you didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is just like Matt on Google topics in the old days.  Yeah, we just do it once a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a step up.  You used to not be able to talk about Google,  now you can't talk about the federal government.  That's, you know, you're broadening your reach here.  What else?  Anything else we need to talk about here?  I just, Amazon.  I wanted to mention,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I wanted to mention,  somebody just threw it in the chat as well,  but the UK Home Secretary, Amber Raad,  is in Silicon Valley.  She's hanging, she's hanging.  She's trying to persuade them  to not use encryption quite so much,  or at least give her metadata or something.  So there's this sort of long running thing in the UK  where Theresa May, who is now the Prime Minister  and the previous Home Secretary,  and Amber Raad, who is the new Home Secretary,  have been saying,  oh, this encryption stuff's very bad, you know,  we want to stop that.  And everyone's been saying,  you can't actually stop that, that's how things work.  And so the position has moved a bit now,  and they're no longer saying they want to ban encryption.  They want to come to an understanding  with the Silicon Valley companies  to give them more metadata behind closed doors and so on.  And there's a little dance going on here.  So, Sheryl Sandberg was on Desert Island Discs two days ago.  Desert Island Discs is-  Wonderful BBC program.  Absolutely amazing.  It's basically, they get people to come on and they say,  if we start here on Desert Island,  what would be the eight records you would bring with you?  And play them for us.  And play them for them.  And it's an excuse to talk about their lives and so on.  But the Sandberg one was weird  because there's five minutes of her talking about encryption  at the beginning of it,  which I extracted and put on my website.  But then she talks about her book and her husband dying,  and it's actually a very good,  it's a very moving show and it's worth listening to.  But it was just suddenly weird,  oh yes, I met Amber Rudd and we're working together  and all this stuff going on as well.  So there's a certain amount of weird stuff going there.  I think part of this is  Rachel Wetstone just moved to that group at Facebook.  And so she's trying to smooth over the dispute  between the UK government and Facebook about encryption.  And she's got form there  because her husband used to be advised  the UK government to the Tory party, the UK government.  So there's a bit of that going on as well.  But there is also this thing of  the position has shifted from  no, we're gonna hang on to encryption at all counts  to I'm sure we can work something out with you.  Let's go behind closed doors and talk about metadata.  And then the thing that that connected to for me  is that there was a, somebody pointed out,  and I've gotta try and find the link now,  that if you type a URL in WhatsApp,  it fetches it character by character  as you type it from the server.  Oh, that's interesting.  Which is a bit weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead of holding it all, letting you type it,  buffering it and sending the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I think it's basically trying to decide  if there's a preview for it or something like that.  But if you sit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still encrypted going to the server, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the chat is encrypted between you,  between the two people you're talking to,  but it is fetching the URL you are typing  from the server that you are typing it from.  So if I say, there's something suspicious about this URL,  let me WhatsApp it to you,  because I think that's secure,  actually that URL will get a ping from WhatsApp.  And it will get every character I type as well,  which is kind of, you know.  So that's the kind of sort of weird metadata breach  that they may be talking about.  Because that stuff is being fetched outside.  So if you're sending links to people through WhatsApp,  they could be leaking that  because that stuff is already going out over the net.  And they can track that on their exit node, presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, we'll watch with interest  the Snoopers charter.  And of course it's happening in Australia.  I'm sure it'll happen here at some point  where the governments say, you must not encrypt,  or we must have a back door into the encryption.  Or if we ask you, you've got to provide us with clear text  of whatever those messages were.  It's interesting that maybe they're willing to settle  for metadata, that doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the conversation they're having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've got metadata mostly anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  And but you know, Samberg was explicitly saying it  on the clip.  We can't tell what you're saying to each other,  but we can tell who you were talking to.  Right.  And we could give that to the government.  She said that.  Good to know.  That's good.  In between choosing a song from Beyonce  and a song from YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know what you thought about this, Jeff Jarvis.  This is from FAIR.  FAIR is the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting website.  Challenging media bias since 1986.  And I like FAIR, but they say Jeff Bezos  is getting a free pass, not just from his own paper,  the Washington Post, but a kind of collegial free pass  from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal  as well.  They reviewed 190 articles over the past year.  None of the articles were expose.  6% leaned negative, 54% were straight or neutral,  40% were positive, mostly with a fawning  or even press release-like tone.  I do remember though, two years ago,  the New York Times frankly hit peace on Amazon's labor.  Yeah, they did.  You know, people are crying at their desks.  But there hasn't been anything,  I guess since then there hasn't been anything.  What do you think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's proving a negative.  It's a conservative media watchdog.  And now since he owns the Washington Post,  that ties that together.  It's reasonable to worry about it, I think.  Gee, the man built a company single-handedly  to make him the richest man in the world.  Let's go after him.  Let's not say anything nice about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will be watching though to see what kind of coverage.  What stories are they want?  Well, I want to see more coverage of the antitrust issues,  Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, for instance,  represents, and the larger issue,  Amazon basically taking over all e-commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the impact on labor is huge.  Here's what's gonna happen.  Eric Schmidt said years ago,  the internet is a terribly disruptive force.  Google's the biggest thing on the internet,  so they're gonna come after us first.  Who are they going after next?  Facebook, because it's the next biggest thing  in the ad duopoly.  Who are they gonna go after next?  They're gonna go after Amazon.  And Amazon, for example, is just going into Australia.  It's going into other countries,  and it's gonna have a disruptive impact there.  And so, yeah, it's gonna be the target of attacks,  but that's also, to me, the generic tech is bad,  American tech companies are bad, let's go after them.  Bang.  Tell me what Jeff Bezos is doing wrong  they should be covering,  and maybe I'll listen to your story,  but just saying that they're not finding  horrible things about them,  right. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even wanna get into the Bitcoin fork  unless one of you can explain it to me.  Oh, fuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha ha.  I can recommend some reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of places you go to find out more  about blockchain.  The fork happened on August 1st, which is yesterday,  and some of the Bitcoin miners, apparently,  were very slow to take it up, the new Bitcoin cash.  You know, you have to have miners creating the Bitcoins.  Miners were the ones who didn't really want Bitcoin  to change, I think.  At least that was my understanding of the politics involved.  There's a lot of politics involved.  Nevertheless, Bitcoin was getting very unwieldy.  The blockchain was huge.  It was really slowing down transactions.  There was a strong movement to change the technology,  which was rejected by the Bitcoin foundation.  So there was a split.  The new Bitcoin cash is apparently somehow compatible,  but there wasn't, apparently, an issue with mining  because the first Bitcoin wasn't mined for a while,  not until 2.20 yesterday afternoon.  There might be some technical issues slowing it down,  said somebody, but I think it's more the miners  not jumping on this new Bitcoin cash.  So we'll watch with interest.  One of these things is just so complicated.  Not the technology, but just the politics of it.  But that's the thing.  It doesn't help the uptake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was designed without really having governance rules  on the assumption you could replace that with code.  And of course, then it's like, well, who decides  who's running the code, who decides what code is written,  who decides what code is run.  And so we have this sort of tension  between the different groups who are writing code  and then the mining syndicates  who are deciding what code they run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the people writing the code want the code,  the blocks to be smaller and more secure.  The miners would like the blocks to be much bigger.  They say that makes Bitcoin faster and more scalable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's also other factors within the miners  because part of it is they don't want to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're just talking about the miners are in revolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't they mostly Chinese now?  Is it almost...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, they are.  They're almost all Chinese  because basically you need access to free power  to compete with mining.  And so they are set up in bits of China  where they're plugged into hydroelectric power stations.  So that blue roof building is the mining thing  next to the hydroelectric dam there.  And so they're basically siphoning off electricity  and turning it into pseudo money.  And the amount of power they're using  is quite remarkably high at the moment.  So that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the Chinese government then involved in Bitcoin mining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not officially, but yes.  Obviously, if you are able to set up a thing like this  and plug it into the power station,  then some bits of the Chinese government  are nodding somewhere.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sort of feels like Bitcoin  is like fantasy football for geeks though.  But there's real money involved.  Well, there isn't.  There isn't.  Yeah.  But it feels like it aligns all the friendliness  of an open source community  with all the fiscal responsibility  of players on Wall Street.  And then you put those two together.  And I don't know.  It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll watch.  I like that map.  We'll watch with interest.  Amazon, speaking of China,  Amazon has halted sales of a phone made in China,  a very affordable Android device by Blue.  Actually, it's a number of phones.  Blue also made Windows phones.  But Amazon has suspended sales of Blue phones on its site  amid concerns that the device data  may be being forwarded to China.  A potential security issue in November,  a security firm mentioned these firmware over the year  update software from a Chinese vendor,  which was being applied to Blue phones,  and was then transmitting text messages  and other private data to an unknown server in China.  Blue announced it had requested the company  to disable that functionality.  The company that had made the firmware update  said that they had fixed the issue,  but at Black Hat, Cryptowire,  the security company that discovered it was back saying,  yep, they're still transmitting users' private data.  And there's a command and control server  capable of installing apps,  taking screenshots, recording the screen,  making calls, and wiping devices  without the owner's permission.  Oh!  So maybe if you have one of them there, Blue phones,  you might want to consider getting a new one.  They're very affordable, $60.  They, the particular one that Cryptowire found  with the software on it was Blue R1 HD.  It's Android, it's old Android,  it's not very recent Android.  Apparently some Blue models are still available on Amazon.  It's unclear whether Blue is culpable here  or maybe one of their suppliers.  And Blue phones, by the way,  were on that list of phones you could get  with Amazon ads in the front  that reduced the cost even further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blue said,  it's gonna start using Google's  over-the-air update service going forward,  but it argued that using the old software  was not an issue, it was merely collecting information  standard for over-the-air update functionality  and consistent with other smartphone brands.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's true.  I don't know, maybe Blue is culpable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a little, I'm a little skeptical.  Color me skeptical, Blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  Yes.  Color me Blue.  All right, I think we can, I mean,  there's so much more I could talk about,  you know, Net Neutrality, Katie Couric leaving oath.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tom Wheeler, I actually, let me point you to this article.  I mentioned it on another show,  but Tom Wheeler in an interview with Fast Company,  the former chairman of the FCC,  really knocking the current chairman, Ajit Pai,  saying ultimately he's doing the bidding  of the four big ISPs, the money quotes  pretty much at the very end.  Tom Wheeler says, it looks like the FCC  is standing up for four companies  when you really get right down to it.  There are four companies who are really the major  beneficiaries of rolling back Title II regulation,  Net Neutrality regulations, Comcast, AT&T, Verizon,  and Charter.  They provide the vast majority of high speed internet  in the country, four companies.  There are a thousand companies  who are the early stage innovators,  the kind of folks who bring opportunity and create new jobs,  who have written letters to the FCC saying,  and I, by the way, wrote a letter to the FCC  saying exactly this, my business will be threatened  by the elimination of Title II  in order to increase the power of the big four.  That is just an absolutely startling comparison.  Four companies are gonna get bigger and more powerful  at the expense of a thousand startups  and tens of millions of consumers that is so out of whack  as to be shameful, the former commissioner of the FCC  on Net Neutrality.  I thought that was a good statement.  And, you know, we thought Tom Wheeler was a dingo,  but he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he was with the angels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was with the angels and still is, you know,  he could shut up, but he's still weighing in on this one.  Yeah.  And actually, it'll be very interesting to watch.  The information points out that with the AT&T  Time Warner acquisition moving forward,  Time Warner owns HBO.  And it might be interesting to see if AT&T,  which has a significant amount of debt,  might start to cut back the amount of money  HBO gets for original programming.  That could be a little inside fight.  Did you see, oh, I think, Jeff, you posted this.  This is the funniest thing ever.  This is funny.  From the ACLU, they filed an amicus brief.  John Oliver, on his show, said something bad about,  about, what is the guy, owned coal mines?  He's a coal magnate.  Coal mines, I think, yeah.  It's a coal magnet, as they say.  Robert E. Bob Murray.  Murray didn't like it that John Oliver  said bad things about him, so he sued HBO and John Oliver.  And the ACLU has filed, I think,  probably the best legal document I've ever read  on behalf of the defendant, John Oliver and HBO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just the table of contents is hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because, well, I can't,  basically, one of the lines in the show was,  eat poop, Bob, only a little more strongly.  And the ACLU points out,  anyone can legally say, eat poop, Bob.  And the comment on the rundown is my favorite excerpt.  Okay, let me find that here.  Hold on a second.  The comment on the rundown,  all I have is a scribed article.  Where does the comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I added a hover over the comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hover, I don't understand hover.  Okay, here it is.  This case is beyond meritless.  This is the ACLU writing,  it is offensive to the very ideals of free speech  embodied in the First Amendment.  The fact that the plaintiffs filed this case,  by the way, Bob is apparently known to be fairly litigious.  The fact the plaintiffs filed this case is ridiculous enough  but to pour gasoline on the fire,  plaintiffs' counsel has also filed a motion  asking the court to make John Oliver  not say mean things about him anymore.  It is frankly shocking the plaintiffs were able  to find attorneys willing to file a lawsuit  that is so obviously unconstitutional.  It is apt that one of the plaintiffs' objections  to the show is about a human-sized squirrel  named Mr. Nutterbutter because this case is nuts.  Which also begs the question,  is Mr. Nutterbutter one of the 50 Doe defendants  included in this action?  I love it.  Somebody at the ACLU had a lot of fun writing that brief.  Had a ball.  Isn't that awesome?  I don't think Bob's point was to win in this case  but just to harass John Oliver.  And he got attention for it.  All right, let's wrap this thing up.  Matt, you've been so great.  It's been so nice to have you.  I'm gonna guess that your thing,  your pick of the week might have something to do  with the US digital service.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just tell you about one industry practice  we brought in which is called a bug bounty.  If you listen to this week in Google or any of Leo's shows  you're familiar with the idea of paying for a security hole  so that other bad people don't exploit that security hole.  But the federal government had never done  a bug bounty before.  So they ran one last year.  It was called Hack the Pentagon.  It turns out they were able to find  a lot of great security holes.  They lowered the cost of finding those security holes  and better protected federal websites and technology.  It cost 150,000 dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would have cost more than a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, chicken feed by government terms basically.  That's one screwdriver.  They've done Hack the Army.  Nothing.  Yeah.  They're better at this.  I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  They just finished running Hack the Air Force  so they've done several of these including a classified one.  So if you are the sort of person  who has heard of a bug bounty  or has deployed things to the cloud  and you think you might be able to do a few months tour  in DC, I encourage you to check out USDS.gov.  We have that slash join page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suspect.  How do you do a classified bug bounty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you get researchers who have been pre-qualified  and you make sure that they're in a cyber range.  That's what they call it.  They do it on a cyber range.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and they found good security holes in that one too.  Bug bounties are a great way to find security holes.  Now they have a vulnerability disclosure policy.  There's gonna be civilian bug bounty programs  in the next few months.  So this is like you're coming from the future  if you're coming from the tech industry  and you can bring these time-tested,  battle-tested techniques that everybody knows works  that aren't really that risky  and make government work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As ever our friend, you're doing God's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I imagine there are quite a few hackers now,  white hat hackers now who make a living on bug bounties.  There's a significant amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for Hack the Air Force,  I think there was like a 17-year-old  that made something like $39,000.  It's still a good deal for everybody  by finding the security holes.  Really nice work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some of these bug bounties are,  I know Microsoft just announced bug bounties  in over $100,000 for one edge flaw or whatever it was.  No, it was a Hyper-V flaw.  So there's some big money in this.  Well good, that's pretty cool.  It's probably not in your realm,  but I someday would like to pick your brain  on the vulnerabilities equity process  and where that stands now in the government.  This was the idea that there should be a process  once an intelligence agency like the NSA or the CIA  discovers a flaw, an exploit,  there should be a process in which  it justifies holding onto it  or the decision is made whether to reveal it to the company  so they can fix the flaw.  This was created in the Obama administration  a few years ago.  Do they do it still or is it just  kind of fallen by the wayside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of nuance to that.  So that could be a long topic of discussion.  But I will say everybody agrees that government IT systems  should be secure and bug bounties are a really cool tool  that industry found years and years ago.  So it's a good idea across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  Nice dodge.  Well done.  Bravo.  At least I don't have to talk about the algorithm.  We love you, Matt.  I'll tell you, you're great.  Hey, how about a number of the week, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was a little appalled when the story came by  and I thought it was a good one for today.  There's a restaurant in Silicon Valley,  $600 a head Silicon Valley restaurant  with gold flecked steaks.  You see these kinds of ridiculous stories.  You can find them.  It doesn't even, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it does not look like a good steak.  That is a, that looks like a minute steak  with gold leaf on it.  And you know, if I were,  I'll make you come to my house, give me $500,  I'll make you a nice ribeye, two and a half inches thick.  It'll be delicious and no gold fleck.  I'll eat it at Elgin's first.  Elgin's is even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I were a PR at any of the technology companies,  I would want to send out a quiet classified memo  that says don't go there.  You're gonna make Silicon Valley just look awful.  I think there's a backlash against technology  and technologists.  I think they're the new 1%.  I'm worried about the reaction  to Silicon Valley as a whole.  And this kind of place does not help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, they only have three to five dinners a week.  It's a Japanese chef, Hiroshi Kimura,  who moved to Silicon Valley  and launched this deep pockets concept restaurant.  Dinners, $3.95 a head, $500 to $600 with beverages and taxes.  I gotta point out that there are,  if you go to French Laundry in Yardville,  up our way, it's gonna cost you that much as well.  That much?  Oh yeah.  That much?  Oh yeah.  With wine.  Oh yeah.  Well without the wine, is it $300 a head?  I could take you to several restaurants in Napa  that would cost you that much, yeah.  Jesus.  See, I'm just a Chipotle guy.  Yeah, you spend too much time in Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you never do, Leo, I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.  Resident, so, but strange is it's in a shopping plaza  in Los Altos, so it's not really,  I mean look, there's a shoe rack outside.  It's not really,  but there you go, you know?  There you go.  Hiroshi's.  Hiroshi's, open by appointment only.  It's, so it's kind of, you know what, go to Morimoto.  Okay, obviously this is A5 Wagyu,  that's why it's so expensive, but go to Morimoto,  you can get a nice Wagyu for less than that.  Well that looks good, I'll take that.  That looks like, that's the Tonkatsu sandwich,  breaded deep fried pork cutlet in demi-glace.  You get 10 courses, come on Jeff, what's the problem?  Image.  Oh there you go, that is beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, you're in New York, you have this nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, please Jeff.  I think you're-  I'm just worried about Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're an impecunious professor,  you just don't understand.  I've had food in Paris with gold leaf on it,  we went to Loic Lemur took us to Guy Savoie,  and some of the food had gold leaf on it.  I don't know why, cause it doesn't add anything to the flavor.  It doesn't.  It's probably not very good for you.  Mr. Marks, I bet you-  Perfect your bowel.  Yeah, it's, yeah, there's no real,  it's like some good roughage I guess,  but what do you got for us Jeff?  I mean, I'm sorry, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got three things, my usual thing is  indyweb.org, homebrew website club.  There wasn't good, there was gonna be one this week  in Portland, but it was so hot,  they moved to next week as well.  So they're all happening next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is hot in Portland, like 82 degrees?  Oh, Portland can't take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're not ready for it.  Those snowflakes are gonna melt, that's terrible.  Wow.  But I've been, and also it gets muggy there,  and you know, 112 where you are is like,  you can live with it,  whereas when Portland, when it's that hot,  it's also sweaty and it's bad.  I was there when it was hitting like 95  and it was much less comfortable than Silicon Valley.  So yeah, homebrew website club is happening,  London, Brighton, Portland, San Francisco,  and a few other places in Germany that I've forgotten.  So good to that.  The Liberty Foundation I wanted to mention,  this is another Portland connection here.  This is a great idea by Andy McMillan,  who's one of the organizers of XOXO.  He's trying to set up a way to support artists  to maintain momentum and work through that.  So this is well worth paying attention to  and helping him fund this.  It's a great idea.  And then the third one I've got is completely crazy,  but I think you'll like it, Jeff.  So have a look at this thing.  Is there a video on the trillie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have one extra thumb,  just think of what you could do.  Of all you could do.  Yeah, it's on the other side from your regular thumb.  So you have two opposable thumbs.  This New Zealand designer, Danny Claude,  it developed his 3D printed, it's a prosthetic.  I don't know how you, how do you control it, Kevin?  How do you control it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It shows you, it shows you,  it's attached to your legs.  So you have to be sitting down,  but then you flex your legs and that controls the thumb.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.  Huh.  This is a new way to play gin rummy, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold those extra big hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or to hit these extra katanas.  Couldn't it otherwise?  This is almost a parody video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  I feel like the whole show came from the onion today.  I swear to God.  The senses in your shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  It's a Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wild.  It's wild.  I just thought, I thought you'd like that Leo.  Sure.  Sure.  I need it.  I'm ordering it now.  You could've bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could've bought it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I would've already bought it.  That's exactly right.  I'm still waiting for,  Stacy told me about those LED light up eyelashes  and I ordered those.  So that should be fun.  Cool.  Matt, so nice to see you.  Congratulations on your good works  and thank you for sacrificing on all of our behalf.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so good to be back on this week in Google  and it's hilarious because I was,  I was reading the chat and somebody was like,  where's the application page?  So that warms my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  USDS.gov slash join.  USDS.gov slash join.  And yeah, absolutely.  What a contribution.  What a contribution.  Thank you, Kevin Marks.  It's midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just started raining here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pouring in the UK.  Well, of course.  Well, once it never rained,  you left a sundown.  So Kevin is at IndieWeb.org and doing a great job  and love to your poodles  and we will see you again very soon.  I hope you'll come back.  Yeah, I look forward to it.  Does that rain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm in the conservatory,  so it's raining on the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, of course.  Are you in the conservatory with Professor Plum  and the lead pipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Kevin.  Well, they're considered with the poodles,  so that's where they hang out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
