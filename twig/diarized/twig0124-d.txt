I'm Tom Merritt filling in for Leo.  He's out in France this week, but happy to be here filling in for him and joining us  as always.  We're glad to have Ms. Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great to be alongside with you and Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.  Hello, Jeff.  Don't bother me.  I'm playing words with friends.  You'll have to leave the show, sir.  You call this plane right back around.  Are we going to start with Alec Baldwin on the show today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's top story, folks.  Alec Baldwin kicked off of an American Airlines plane for playing words with friends while  they sat at the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, you may ask what this has to do with clouds.  We see planes go into the clouds and that's why this is relevant on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, the story broke because my boss, Anil Dash's partner at his other firm,  Michael Wolf, had tweeted, I'm on this flight and Alec Baldwin just got kicked off and they  pulled us back to the gate.  So Michael had said that we had to go back to the gate for him to get off the plane,  whereas Alec later said we were sitting at the gate doing nothing and I got yelled at  for playing words with friends.  So it was such an interesting thing because I think when you're in first class New York  to LA flight, there's kind of this unspoken no filming, no photographing, no tweeting  rule because there are celebrities take that flight.  But the story kind of broke because Michael had tweeted this and then people said, hey,  Alec, what are you doing?  And then he started with the tweets about how American Airlines is clearly, you know,  the airline from hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he said, flight attendant on American reamed me out for playing words with friends  while we sat at the gate not moving.  No wonder America is bankrupt.  Ironic hashtag.  Later he said United should have app on board where you can play words with friends with  other passengers.  American should have an app where you read the New Testament with flight attendants.  Now if they were moving, if they were taxiing, of course, they're like, sir, you have to  turn off your electronics.  But he's claiming they were just sitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They say that when you as soon as they as they close the door, you're supposed to turn  all off.  Yeah, we've seen that stretch.  And then and then then it got even weirder because last night he wanted a mass unfollowing  his account wasn't somehow spammed and at 10 o'clock and then the account disappeared  was deactivated.  Then today all those tweets reappeared at deactivated 001.  And now that account's gone.  I can't figure out what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got mad.  He posted a bunch of stuff on Twitter.  Then he then he changed his mind.  I mean, he's he's probably just going back and forth about what he should and or should  not have done.  You know, that's just a little bit celebrity gossip here.  We're talking about Alec Baldwin.  He's been in the news for all kinds of crazy stuff over the years.  But what's interesting is it's playing out in the cloud.  It's playing out on Twitter, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's also the question of like, should you really have to, you know, couldn't you  just put your device in airplane mode?  I mean, it's kind of a moot question, right?  Because to play Words of Friends, you have to be connected.  So yeah.  But, you know, there was a Times article earlier this week about how, you know, there's there's  really no good reason why you shouldn't be able to just put your device in airplane mode  and read or play or whatever.  But you know, this this policy was just enforced before there were devices with airplane mode.  So I kind of wanted I was hoping that Alec would jump on the bandwagon and, you know,  sign the White House petition to get the FDA to change the policy.  But it doesn't sound like this is going to turn into anything actually productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The FAA claims that we're just being extra careful about electronics.  We don't know what they do.  We haven't had time to really study what they do.  So we want them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So why don't you ask the president or any of his staff to turn their devices off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I have heard and I don't know if this is true.  I've heard that's because of numbers.  They say, yeah, we don't think one electronics device or two even is going to bring the plane  down.  And it's obviously true that it won't because there's plenty of people who leave their electronics  on that aren't caught.  But they say if we have everybody on the plane running them, that could cumulatively cause  enough interference.  We don't know what it would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I guess that's reasonable.  I guess that's reasonable.  Let's do the studies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  Let's do the studies.  Let's let's let's figure this out because I don't want the plane to crash either.  Right.  I don't think anybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is clearly a problem of the privileged.  I mean, I understand that there's probably things that we could spend more time on and  maybe that would be more productive, but it would be it would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First a little bit of a first world problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let's let's talk about the web since we're all not there or at least I'm not there.  That's why I'm here.  Filling in for Leo.  So I don't know.  I frankly I think I get the better end of the stick.  He has to work and I get to hang out and talk with you guys.  But Eric Schmidt was on stage at the Web.  And when Eric Schmidt is on stage and opens his mouth, he makes news.  Which one should we pick first?  How about this one?  By the summer of 2012, the majority of the televisions you see in stores will have Google  TV embedded in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody who believes that starts singing starts making better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I guess nobody believes it.  Either that or I hate America.  It's one of the top.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google TV has been so successful and all the manufacturers who have put out Google TV set  top boxes are so thrilled with how the launch went.  Clearly this is going to happen by the summer.  This is a really bold statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does he know?  Does he realize that 2012 is the coming year that it's a we're less than a month away now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  We're less than a month away from 2012.  This is bold.  Really bold.  I had to kind of laugh about it.  I actually really like Google TV.  And in fact, right before the show was, you know, refreshing my Logitech reviews system  settings trying to get the new update.  Did you get it?  No, I have not.  I haven't got it either.  It lies to me and says that my system is up to date.  And I shake my fist and say it is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You show them the story on the web.  You're like, no, look, it's not a date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will go to Chrome right now and show you the story.  You don't even have to show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could pull it up on the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pull it up on the Google TV.  So I think I'm a little more bullish about the Google TV than most people.  I still think that this was a too bold a statement for him to make.  So, OK, we can all laugh about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you use Google TV for?  Why do you like Google TV, Jada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it because, you know, the sell was that it's a browser.  It's a browser on your TV.  And I really like that.  I mean, I look stuff up, you know, in the browser on the TV a lot.  I stream things in the browser.  Now, not I like to watch kind of obscure streams of live sport events and that kind of thing.  So I really like being able to go to a page with get flash and be able to watch a stream.  I think the YouTube interface is really nice.  I like doing picture in picture.  So I like being able to watch Glee and also have a search for, you know, the Glee hashtag  and Twitter going and watch what people are saying kind of as I'm watching the show.  So I don't think the interface is great.  I think it really needs to improve.  I think there need to be a lot more apps.  And that's why I'm really hot to get this update.  But I just really like being able to look up stuff.  My friends come over and I'm like, hey, you have to see this YouTube video.  And I bring it up on my TV and we start watching.  And I know people do that generally with their iPad or on their computer or with, you know,  there are lots of interfaces to YouTube.  I just really like that it's Chrome and it's just a full full browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Next question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Does your wife ever use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She not as much as she doesn't like the keyboard in the living room.  She grabs the remote like she grabs the TV remote and I grab the keyboard remote.  So no, she doesn't use it as much as I do.  Although I will sit her down and say, look at all the kind of cool videos I saw today.  Here's a video video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a, you know, I've got you on the head and says, that's nice to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she's like, oh, that's funny.  OK, so like, let's, you know, watch Survivor now.  So so yeah, baby, it's just me, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use it as in the spare room in the bedroom as our Netflix device in there.  We have the Roku in the main room.  And I have to say, I like using the Netflix on Google TV better because of the full keyboard.  I was watching Downton Abbey on Netflix this week in there and just, you know, the ability  to just kind of pop in and say, well, what else do you got?  Once I finished the season and I could just be like, oh, you know what?  I just want to see some more British stuff and I could use that keyboard.  It's it's it's much handier that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It really is typing searches, typing URLs and searching Netflix and Netflix.  And app interface is really nice.  And just, you know, just being able to type without having to use the thumb pad and choose  the letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will it make a big difference when voice comes to TV?  Well, you know, two way voice, you know, TV, find me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Xbox. Yeah, you can already do that.  You ordered Xbox.  Did you use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have the Kinect and I don't use the voice commands as much.  But I mean, I really like waving at it.  So I don't know. What do you think, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think somebody is going to have to crack it.  I think the Kinect has got a nice way of doing it.  The new dashboard update. I haven't tried it yet.  I haven't got it. But it doesn't have everything.  And I guess that's the problem with Google TV.  Also, it doesn't have everything.  Nobody's cracked this access.  What people want is to easily tell the thing what they want to  watch and have it show up.  And so part of that is the voice activation or the keyboard or  whatever the input device is.  We're pretty close to cracking that with things like Siri and  Kinect voice recognition.  But the other side of it is having your television  programming there. And we're far away from that because the  industry is digging its heels in and saying, no, you know,  HBO just said we will not provide an option for people to  watch HBO unless they have cable television and subscribe to us  that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. Like HBO Go.  You can't get that unless you're a subscriber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I want to get rid of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. We should have just had Eric Schmidt do the rundown  today because that's just one of the things he said at LeWeb.  Another thing he said, Android is ahead of the iPhone now by  unit volume with ice cream sandwich features.  Prices are lower with more vendors, more price points.  Do I need to continue the list?  It's free.  Does he need to continue the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just I feel like this whole iPhone versus Android, which is  which is better and which is having bigger growth and which is,  you know, do developers prefer to develop for this  conversation just always uses different numbers and different  metrics. Is it activations as a devices?  You know, and everyone can make an argument for one over the other.  I mean, Android's doing really well, which I think is, you know,  which is a fair statement, not doing as well as the iPhone yet,  but getting closer. Right.  And growing maybe maybe growing faster.  I don't know. So these are Google's internal numbers.  Yes. 200 million iPhone Android phones and five hundred fifty  thousand new ones being activated daily.  And then the Android market just celebrated a milestone.  I think it was 10 billion apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some ridiculous number. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was like 10 billion apps downloaded.  Right. They had that big sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A 10 cent sale. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A 10 cent sale, which is a really interesting sale.  The 10 cent sale, because it was not free.  It was 10 cents. So I think that and you know, at first,  I kind of had a little rant on Twitter.  I was like, you know, why?  Why are you thanking developers and then selling their apps at such  a discounted price that they're going to be losing money?  And then I thought, you know, that 10 cents deal was actually really brilliant  because that makes people who haven't set up a Google Wallet account  and who haven't linked their credit card yet do it.  And that's what they need to do.  In fact, my wife, she's never bought an app on her Android phone,  not even my app. Wow.  OK, so just because she doesn't she just was like, you know,  she keeps putting off the inconvenience of setting up her account  and entering her credit card and all that stuff.  So I think that that 10 cent sale was actually really brilliant.  And they're trying to get people who have Android, who haven't bought apps,  you know, just want the web browser in their email, which comes stock  to take that extra step and get into the buying app sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Amazon ebook strategy, right?  It's the leader that gets you into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More things from Eric Schmidt in response to a question about Android's app lineup.  I guess the questioner said it pales in comparison to iOS,  despite Android's shipment win and despite apps catching up by volume.  Schmidt said six months from now, you'll say the opposite.  Ultimately, application vendors are driven by volume.  The volume is favored by the open approach.  Google is taking whether you like ice cream sandwich or not.  You will want to develop for that platform, perhaps even first.  This seems like one of the more measured and reasonable things, he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I wish that he hadn't said whether you like it or not.  Like, is it like the ice cream sandwich jail?  Like, I'm a developer and I really didn't want to,  but I have to develop ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you like it or not, Mr. You're developing for ICS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Marco Arment, who builds one of my favorite iOS apps  and the Instapaper app, which I absolutely love,  wrote a piece about this and basically saying, you know,  developing for Android is much less profitable for developers  and it's very expensive and it's a pain in the butt.  And this, you know, what Eric, which Schmidt said about this is just is just crazy.  It doesn't make sense for developers to develop for Android first now,  and it won't in the next six months.  And I, you know, I disagree with him.  I don't think that I think that developing for both iOS and Android,  if you're a mobile app developer, a native mobile app developer,  you have to develop for Android and iOS at the minimum,  just because, you know, Android gives you that that distribution  the way that Schmidt says.  And, you know, all the iOS developers say, yeah,  but Android developers don't actually make money.  But, you know, sometimes, you know,  Apple has had this emphasis on revenue over distribution,  whereas Google has always been distribution over revenue.  And that's in the DNA of both of these companies. Right.  Like Apple makes its money by like selling shiny objects, hardware objects,  and now shiny software objects. Right.  And Google's in the DNA of their company is like,  we build this platform for the Web that's totally free and offers this awesome service.  And then we advertise to you, you know, to you on it  because it has such a wide distribution.  So we see this in both kind of in both iOS and Android.  So I think, you know, for developers who want both,  you know, who want distribution over overrevenue and distribution  can lead to revenue, I think it makes total sense to develop for both platforms.  I think that Schmidt is obviously being very bullish by saying  that you're going to develop for for Android first in six months.  I don't know if that's necessarily true, but I think right now in the present,  if you're a mobile app developer and you want you want to get your  get your stuff out there, you've got to do it for both platforms.  And even all the new kind of apps and web services  generally launch with both iOS and Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Google this is an ignorant question, but that's why specialty here.  Is Google offering ad sales for apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can. Yes, you can.  So I don't do this on my app, but you can have ads in your app.  So like Angry Birds, for example, you buy it on iOS, but it's free on Android,  but with ads. So, yeah.  So so so they definitely do offer that.  And you can also do an in-app purchase and that kind of thing on Android as well.  But I think the ad model is more popular on in Android apps and goes to the volume.  Right. Which goes to the volume.  If they have a huge volume and they have data about the ad sales,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then that's going to make the ad marketplace within apps more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeremiah O. Yang at the Web asked Eric Schmidt, if Google were a country,  which country would it be?  But instead of answering that sort of weird interview like question,  job interview like question, he said, we're not a country.  OK, fair enough.  I think I think he was responding to a different question, which is,  you know, that question of like, is Google too powerful?  They have the economy of a small country.  Schmidt said that they don't have nuclear weapons.  That's good to know.  They don't have a police force.  They're subject to the laws of most actual countries, a fact made most obvious in China.  But Google does have values and Schmidt emphasized those values.  Freedom of speech, transparency and  oddly used the Chinese government wanting to censor Google search  as an example of when they let their values stand and resisted that.  Now, I have heard that Schmidt was not the leader in that movement,  but, you know, he's taking the company line now.  He said, if we were to take our values to a country,  we'd value personal privacy and personal expression.  But a lot of public debate and discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was kind of a reflex answer.  It's the same one that he gave two years ago in Davos, pardon me,  around China, when China was was a hot issue right then.  And people were looking to Google to kind of be the ambassador  of the Internet to the world.  And Schmidt demurred and said, no, we're not a country.  We don't have a police force.  We don't have the diplomats other than Dave Drummond.  We don't have the police or any of these things.  And we're not a country. Don't put us in that position.  So I think he's been so used to giving that answer for so long  that when that Google country came out, it just went, dang.  Yeah. In goes the cart hit plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then in response to another question, he he mentioned that Google  buys around one company a day or a week.  I think he said a week. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He went back and corrected that a week, which is still amazing.  Yeah. Yes. And quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Alexia Sotis from from TechCurrent said,  why do you never announce them?  They said, we don't have to.  We're Google. We're Google.  We are. You're like a whole other country, but you're not  because you don't have a nuclear weapon.  And I hope you never get them.  All right. Anything else on the Web before we move on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want that T-shirt.  You know, I feel better now because Google doesn't have nukes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't index the Web with nuclear arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, because you know, if Google gets a nuke,  then Facebook has to have a right. Right.  Yeah. Mutual.  And Twitter has ICBM.  It gets very complicated.  Let's let's keep it out.  Keep it. You really want Zuckerberg to have his finger on the button.  No, absolutely not.  I'm this guy who kills chickens.  So we don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even want his finger on the like button.  What's that button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just looking at the Wikipedia page of Google Acquisitions,  and it does look like there's one per week.  There. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, the last one, the most recent one was November 14th.  So I guess that's not exactly a week ago.  But there are a few that happened kind of around the same time.  Katanga, I mean, a bunch of these I've never heard of Katanga after.  Well, Zagat, we knew Daily Deal, Social Grapple.  I'm sure there are a bunch that haven't just haven't been reported.  But this is an impressive list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, TechCrunch went and dug up an October report from Google  that that indicated 57 acquisitions over the past year to that date.  So that, you know, 52 weeks in a year.  How the average is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What proportion of those do you think were motivated as much by recruiting  as by the technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Acquires rather than acquires.  Yeah. Yeah.  I don't know if I had to guess, I'd say 30 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I might even go higher.  A little higher.  Yeah, maybe 40 or 50 even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, close to half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's not to jump around, but in a related link,  we have Facebook and Koala and act higher with a with a twist, right?  With a twist, right?  Where they didn't actually acquire the company and the company dies.  But they got all the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the investors don't get their money from Google then or from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, no, it wouldn't appear so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's that's going to cause some.  And it is apparently causing some consternation about how they're going  to get their money back from their investment, when they're going to get it,  all of that.  And it doesn't sound like everybody from Koala is making the move out  to Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto.  Only the founders and some of the team are going.  And we lose Koala, which I, you know, I used Koala for a while  and I've used it for a long time, so I'm not going to miss it that much.  But I know there's some pretty enthusiastic folks out there  that are pretty disappointed about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a really interesting thing.  It's that was a case where they wanted, you know, they were they killed  the company to get the to get the best talent.  And the company, obviously, I don't know if there was any money  to get back to the investors.  Yeah, maybe not.  But it becomes a new strategy to get hired by these companies.  You know, Sam Lesson, who worked a lot on the timeline and that kind of stuff,  started that file transfer company and he's really good.  And, you know, he got bought and they didn't want the technology.  They wanted Sam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do the venture capitalists now start have to worry about this  and say, look, you're not you're not going to go just get hired, are you?  We want because we want you to sell the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So is there is there a contractual way you can deal with this?  Yeah, I don't know.  That's a really interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because most of the time.  Yeah, go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was to say, wouldn't the investors have some sort of say about whether or not  to wind down the company and let you know, it doesn't seem like they well,  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what their their deal was.  But what if they make the decisions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, right. So the staff doesn't only own the assets.  So the assets do go probably back to the to the investors.  But all your talent just walked out.  Yeah. Yeah. That's your asset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And usually with an act higher, the company buys  the other company so that they can get the talent.  This is kind of an unusual case.  And maybe it won't come up that often.  Usually you want the intellectual property that the company developed.  But Facebook looked at it and said, now you don't have anything  that we can't cover with places already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what becomes interesting, too, is, you know, let's just imagine  and I have no knowledge of this whatsoever.  But I would imagine there were probably sweet signing bonuses for those people.  Right. So, you know, normally if you got acquired,  you'd hope that you'd get some level of cash upfront  in terms of cashing in your equity.  But if the equity is worth nothing, if you're in the hold of the investors,  this is a way you can go around that and still get some cash in your pocket  because you're the asset. Yeah. Right.  That's a really good point. Really fascinating.  I thought it's a really good question.  I haven't seen the VCs talk about that because I'm probably scared to.  But I'll bet Fred Wilson will probably weigh in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably once it's known what exactly went down and who got what.  We may get a clearer picture of that.  Right. Let's take a quick break and thank our sponsor, Ford,  featuring available sync.  Syncs Entertainment features, light access, music and podcasts for most devices.  iPods, mobile phones, tablets, flash drives and with sync, my Ford Touch.  You can play videos or display photos, not while you're driving.  But while you're, you know, you're sitting to wait and pick up the kids  at the park or at the school or you're you're waiting outside,  you know, a shopping mall while somebody's running in to get something.  You can watch some videos, look at some photos right there  on your sync with my Ford Touch.  And it's all made possible through a versatile media hub,  which supports a convenient variety of devices for your music and entertainment.  Wired connections work through USB, through SD, through RCA jacks.  Wireless works through Bluetooth.  Pretty much anything, any way you can connect, you can connect it into sync  and then use your voice to tell it what to do.  Play me some ska and it'll just play all the ska tunes  that are tagged in your library or or or play me some Ella Fitzgerald.  And it gives you all the best Ella Fitzgerald tunes you got.  You just tell it what to do. It does it also available  as sync with my Ford Touch HD radio.  So if you're listening to HD radio, it features iTunes tagging.  Tag a song you like on the radio and transfer the info to your iPhone  or your iPod.  And then you can purchase the song directly from iTunes  because it saves all that information from you.  Syncs versatile entertainment features are available in the 2012 Ford Focus.  And you can learn more about this and other technologies Ford is bringing  to vehicles at Ford dot com slash technology.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  We sort of moved into the Facebook section of things,  but they've got some other news going on.  Timeline apparently rolling out today in New Zealand  and then a smattering of other places.  But Facebook says they were launching in New Zealand  because they want to have a small audience use it in an intensive way.  So they picked a smaller country and New Zealand.  You know, they're very close to the timeline.  So you can theoretically just keep rolling it out all day long  if it goes well, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't wait for this to get rolled out.  I just can't wait to hear what my like family, friends and family  who aren't in the tech world think of it.  I think that they're I think it's going to be really jarring.  So I think it's it's it's smart for for Facebook to start  with a very small group of users and see what happens.  I think there's going to be some backlash and confusion about about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Son, Jake is worried that his friends will react badly  and he'll lose his friends from Facebook.  And and I know and have you heard any rumors of why it's taken so long?  That since F8, it was supposed to come out pretty quickly and it's been delayed.  Some some guess not really a rumor,  but a guess that Facebook got nervous about timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder, Gina, do you have a good guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I haven't. I haven't heard anything.  And, you know, I enabled it through, I don't know,  there's some sort of developer backdoor.  So I enable it.  I've had it for a while and a few of my friends are the same.  But most of my friends haven't.  And I've wondered what the slowdown has been, actually.  But I haven't heard anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I enabled it, too.  And it seemed to work as advertised. Yeah. Yeah.  I didn't I didn't have any issues with it.  I mean, there's things I like and don't like about it, obviously.  But but it worked the way they said it would work.  So, yeah, Jeff, I think that's probably the best guess is with all of this FTC  stuff that they're having to go through,  you know, maybe they're being very careful and running over it  with a fine tooth comb to make sure that since they're changing  the way stuff is displayed, that they're not changing anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  from their privacy policy, because that's one of the conditions.  Right. Well, the other the other thing is that the one of the conditions  is that you can't retroactively change the public of stuff.  So I'll bet they had to do a lot of going back and encoding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right. Wait, wait, wait.  You can't retro.  So if you publish something publicly, you can't go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the opposite. It's the opposite.  Then if you publish this is the this is the changing default problem.  So if you publish something to a group of X  and Facebook comes along later and says, well, actually, it's why it's bigger.  The FTC settlement says, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do that  unless you get notice and permission and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, OK. So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Timeline was going to put stuff up that was not meant to be fully public  when it was published, you know, first four years ago.  It was going to become public.  And now in the FTC settlement, they can't do that.  So, you know, I don't know, Tom, but I'm guessing you're right.  That may have had an impact just on a practical level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you have to opt in to anything that Facebook wants to turn public.  So there has to be a system for them to ask you, is it OK  if we start making this previously private stuff public? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any app that has to ask you that question, that's not good.  Is there any situation where an app should have to ask you, like,  hey, you made this thing private, but you like to make it public?  Is that OK with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when you put it that way, it does sound kind of stupid,  but I'm glad they're asking, at least, which is, you know, it's a step

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of the right direction. Just doing it. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, speaking of that, there was a bug, I guess, this past week  that that inadvertently revealed private photos, the photos marked as private,  including Zuckerberg's private photos, which is how Jeff saw that picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of him with a chicken because it's the chicken who has the biggest complaint here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That chicken did not opt into that photo being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, neither in chicken form or wing form.  There are two photos of him holding the dead chicken  and then the wings that he made with the chicken.  So, I mean, you know, I really I absolutely agree with Zuckerberg's approach,  which is just like move fast, break things, you know, ask for forgiveness  over permission, you know, we're just going to push the envelope,  see what works and roll back when things don't.  So I actually think that that's a smart way to to develop products.  But when you're on the sort of privacy thin ice and when you've built up  so much distrust about the way that you, you know, change defaults and handle privacy,  I think that, you know, Facebook's really on thin ice.  So I think that that guess that timeline hasn't rolled out right away  probably has to do with that.  Just making sure that they've dotted all their eyes and crossed their T's  and in regards to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've joined Google and Twitter in the 20 year audit club now.  Right. Exactly.  Exactly.  You see, he's going to audit them every two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, part of the problem here is that, Gina, you're you're you're  way right about this.  And the problem is that regulators don't understand the beta.  They think that they should be released, you know, perfect  like industrial age view.  And this idea that you're going to put something out that is not perfect,  that does have mistakes in it, just throws them.  So Jennifer Stoddard, the head of privacy in Canada, led the  the letter that attacked Google for buzz  and basically said you shouldn't have made this, which is just so don't get it.  Yeah. She came up with a new a new ruling this this  this week about the Canadian version of Do Not Track, saying that sites  must give you an easy way to opt out of tracking.  Well, the New York Times, which is editorialized in favor of Do Not Track,  requires you to use cookies to use the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because they make you log in.  Boom. Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so what happens now that that that, you know, these regulators  are telling these sites how to operate in a in a key business way  and that violates the way they're operating their businesses today.  It's it's it's kind of an issue here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I think the Do Not Track thing is what it should be achieving.  And I think you're right.  It's not always clear that this is what they're trying to achieve.  It should be achieving that you aren't tracked without your knowledge.  With New York Times, you know, I'm logging in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's different.  That's that's about transparency and a good system of transparency and openness,  which I long agree that the ad industry and media industry screwed up with,  that you didn't know what they were doing, why they were doing away,  what you got out of it.  And they they made that bed for themselves.  But however, having said that, to demonize tracking  and to demonize a lot of this stuff and say you can't do business that way,  you know, that makes me uncomfortable.  And so and so what you see with this 20 year agreement  with Facebook and Google, how can you possibly today  guess what technology and its capabilities are going to be like in 20 years?  And they've set this this wall now that says it defines the world  and as we know it now and whether it comes to to those consent degrees  on privacy or whether it comes to do not track and those kinds of things.  I, you know, I keep on coming on, you know, the my side of this fence.  But I think it's it's it's too limiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How come we never get back the old things that are awesome?  Like, you know, a two hour tea break in the afternoon or  multiple mail service delivery four or five times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what I want back.  Very simple. The busy signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I a customizable busy signal where you just turn it on like I'm busy right now.  Or I'm busy for you. Yeah.  Well, yeah, exactly.  It can be a much improved busy signal. You can set preferences.  I could imagine the Dvorak's busy signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, busy tones, maybe a month.  Don't bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, yeah, I want it so that when certain friends visit my Facebook profile,  they just get the bad, bad, busy side.  Always, just a certain friend.  I'm sure that could be done. You. I'm busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, no, not you.  In the bath, washing my hair, taking the dogs out for a walk.  Can't talk.  Oh, you know, we should point out that bug that you mentioned about Facebook  with the chicken and the Zuckerberg.  It wasn't it was a bug.  Yeah, it was a bug. It was it was not, you know, it'll be interesting  how this sort of stuff gets treated by the FTC.  But essentially, you flagged a photo as inappropriate.  Then it would give the user the option to select additional photos as inappropriate,  which allowed you to go and see all of their private photos  to see if any of them were inappropriate.  Facebook says they've addressed the problem and they've disabled  that reporting that part of the reporting system while they fix that bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that Zuckerberg learned a long time ago to never post something on Facebook  that he truly considered private.  And I think that's a lesson that probably all of us, as we become more  more public figures, can learn. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I've been saying in talks now on privacy is is that, listen, folks,  this is the simplest rule.  The Internet is a lousy place to put secrets.  Yep. Period. Right.  And this idea that was the Facebook is a place where secrets is on its face absurd.  But that's what we've kind of assumed lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, that's true of the world, too.  People act as if they can keep secrets by not putting them on the Internet.  But most secrets get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's only one good place for a secret in your head.  Yep. In your head. Exactly.  And there it stays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except the JFK assassination.  I can't think of anything else that stayed secret.  Unless one of you knows, you know, what really happened.  Not talking, huh?  I tell you, but I don't have to kill you.  All right.  Should we should we talk about Facebook losing the Godfather exclusive?  Since we're speaking of assassinations, Google Plus getting  getting the Godfather game as a on the Google Game Network.  It used to be on Facebook, but now Google Plus gets it exclusive.  Kabam makes the game.  Chris Carvalho said it was strictly a business decision,  which is a quote from the Godfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that style points for that one. Yeah. Yeah. Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google, you know, Google Plus small amount of games right now.  What is it? 28 games total and 40 million people on Google  Plus versus 800 million.  But it seems like the rev shares was one of the justifications.  At least that's what I get from Trisha Durye's All Things D article.  Google only keeps five percent of your revenue,  whereas Facebook keeps the more normal 30 percent that people tend to choose.  Is this just an experiment? Do you think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is just Google making the terms really good in comparison to Facebook  because they just need to build up, you know, they need to build up their games area.  They want people, more people playing games in Google.  So, you know, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you say they made them an offer they couldn't refuse? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I would say. More style points.  I'm sad that I didn't think of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I stole that from the chat room. I can't take credit for it.  Somebody said that in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to be spending my attention in the chat room. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  And if if I'm not correct, is not New Egg a new sponsor to Twig?  They may be welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they are.  I have to say, one of the things I love about doing this show is like  that the sponsors are so cool.  I've been a New Egg customer for for years and years.  So that's awesome. I'm really excited there.  And I'm excited there with Gazelle, too, because I've used Gazelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. It's two great tastes all in one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so that's so cool.  That's the final.  I mean, that's I'm not saying it's because they're a sponsor, folks.  The commercials over.  But that's so neat to put the full recycling there to  to buy something there and return it there and get the next new thing there.  You know, a long time ago on the show, I talked about the wish  for having kind of a subscription to new gadgets in some way.  That starts to get close to that, which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, great play. Great play.  Things like RAM, thumb drives, all that stuff.  I'm always shopping new egg for that.  Let's let's talk some Android, the Galaxy Nexus.  It may or may not be coming this week.  Depends on what rumor you believe.  But we do know that it's not going to have Google Wallet.  Google told Computer World it will not have Google Wallet on the Galaxy Nexus.  Nine to five Google reports that that was Verizon's decision.  Of course, Verizon immediately took to the press saying,  well, we're not blocking Google Wallet.  We just need to do some testing with it.  We want to make sure that it's secure and that it works on our network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that do to the Google marketplace, then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to pay through Verizon.  And you can't. Yeah.  And I wonder, I think Google Checkout will probably still work  or will it because Google Checkout isn't Google Checkout  merged into Google Wallet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Checkout is Google Wallet.  Google Wallet now. So maybe it won't.  It's not one thing.  Well, this sounds like this is just the Google Wallet app.  Isn't isn't shipping stock on this?  So the Google Wallet app is the app that lets you pay  by just kind of swiping the phone over the thing.  It's right. It's the NFC thing.  So I don't think it affects the Android marketplace. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So the Android market is connected to your Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it used to be your Google Checkout account.  It's now your Google Wallet account.  Google Wallet is sort of like the umbrella term now for the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Google gets money. When they simplified it, they made it more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did. They kind of did.  So it sounds like this is the NFC app thing that they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  And the big suspicion is Verizon is partnering up with AT&T  and T-Mobile on their own payment system called ISIS,  which is a competitor to Google Wallet.  And so they're they say this is not why, but it sounds like they're looking  for an excuse to delay implementing Google Wallet until they could also launch ISIS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  What a phone company just got an email from Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, what? A phone company would never do something like that.  No, no, no, no.  What did you say, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, someone in the chat room just said they got an email from a Verizon VP  and saying that there's no Galaxy Nexus on Friday because of the the wallet dispute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because of the wallet dispute?  Wait a minute.  Now, I did see any a rumor earlier today that that  that they would not be having the Galaxy Nexus this Friday.  But maybe, you know, we just, Jeff,  but maybe they are actually looking at it and saying, you know what?  Let's get it so that the wallet is on there.  So people don't think we're doing this for nefarious purposes.  Is that even possible?  Could be. Hmm.  All that Verizon is saying to CNET is we haven't officially announced  a launch date for the Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still I'm still curious about this.  So if I buy an app on the Galaxy Nexus and it doesn't have Google Wallet  or any of that, that's Google Checkout.  Then my purchase will go through my phone bill.  Is that what they want so they know what you bought  and get more data on you around Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think I think we I think we figured it out.  The Google Checkout that is now also called Google Wallet  will still work the way it is always still.  OK, fine. All right.  Yeah. Never mind. In the marketplace.  But it's the NFC payment, which is only exist on the Sprint.  Which one? Nexus S?  It's only on one phone right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The the other Nexus S.  The latest Nexus S.  You know, the Nexus Galaxy Turbo 4G.  Yeah. The flux capacitor one.  That one. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only on that the latest Sprint Nexus phone.  And yeah, 4G Nexus S 4G, I think is what may be called.  But it was supposed to be on the Galaxy Nexus S, which does have  I'm sorry, the Galaxy Nexus, which does have an NFC chip.  So that was going to be the big thing is like,  oh, now another Google Wallet phone that I can use.  Yeah. Web 8, 9, 1, 5 says use cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? Everywhere.  Right. Exactly. What is that? Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use you know what?  I think this whole NFC stuff is just is just going to be dead in the water  because I use Card Case at the coffee shop down here.  Acre Coffee and Petaluma.  They take Card Case, which is the app on your phone  that geosenses you through your GPS chip.  And because they're using an iPad in there, they can tell that I'm on the network.  It communicates over the Internet and it says, oh, Tom's nearby.  Open a tab. I just say, oh, yeah, give me a medium latte on Tom.  And I'm like, oh, hey, Tom, click my face on the iPad.  Done. Wow. I don't have to pull the phone out.  I don't have to tap anything.  I don't have to I don't have to do anything. It just works.  Now, there there's issues on what merchants will be able to do that,  because right now this is an iOS system, right?  So not not everybody's going to want to put an iPad in their in their location,  in their retail location.  But if they could make it easy for merchants to implement this somehow.  And that is the way to do it.  I don't want to have to do any tapping at all. Just be wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Well, indeed, on my Starbucks idea, when it started up,  one of my favorite suggestions was that your card or your phone,  when you go to the to the Starbucks and you wave it, it should take the money out.  But it should also put your drink order in. Yeah. Right.  And it's ready for you.  So you're you're within, you know,  a pause distance from the place your phone says you want.  What I think you want. Yep. And boom, it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tom, when you said tab, I thought browser tab.  No, I'm looking at the card case website and I see that you meant your tab.  Yeah, yeah. Put it on my tab. Right. Right. Right.  And it looks like it looks like there's an Android app for this as well.  I had no idea that the future had like landed in Petaluma.  I got I got to move up there. I know. That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's it's you know, honestly, it's one of it is a smart thing.  That place is packed all the time because they make good coffee, in my opinion.  But I also go there more often because I'm just like, hey, I get to use this.  It's so cool. I get to use it. Right.  I get to walk in and go and then now they know me. Right.  They they learn they learn you faster because they're always Tom, you know.  And so now they're like, oh, hey, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, nice.  As you're both touching your touch screen devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Not looking at each other.  No, no, no. Petaluma has a lot of chickens, too, which is good for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. Actually,  you know, one Facebook story that we skipped over, do we care about the subscription push?  Facebook wants famous people, Jeff, to promote its new subscribe feature.  I think famous.  Well, you could be if you use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the story here is interesting.  So they're going to let you subscribe to websites inside of Facebook.  And coincidentally, just recently, Facebook disabled the ability  to auto import RSS feeds as notes into Facebook.  So, yes, this is kind of interesting because it annoyed me  because I used to sort of import auto import my blog into into my Facebook page,  like using this, you know, this notes feature that they had.  And they stopped that. They said, you know, if you want to post a link,  you should do it manually and write a little status update yourself.  And there's some third party apps in Facebook that will do that for you.  But now that they've launched this feature where you can subscribe to websites  in Facebook, I was my initial reaction was just to be sort of immediately indignant.  Like Facebook is just like stretching more of its tentacles into every single part  of the web. And this is so annoying.  And why wouldn't you just use RSS?  But you know, I thought the better of it is like, you know, my sister-in-law  has no idea what RSS is or how to use it.  But if I said to her, hey, you can subscribe to my website in Facebook,  she would totally get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But why couldn't Facebook use RSS to do exactly the same thing?  That's that's my worry is that Facebook does this.  And for the exactly the reason you say it becomes popular with people.  But then it only works in Facebook and you're stuck.  It's not like you can export it.  You can't you can't use it in things that you haven't anticipated  wanting to use it for. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it just brings more people into Facebook.  It's just another way that Facebook is saying Facebook is the web.  It's your web. We want everything that you want on the web inside Facebook.  And that's how we're getting every single thing that you do on the web.  Inside Facebook, everything you like, everything you listen to,  everybody you talk to, everybody you friend.  It's all Facebook is just going to be your main hub.  This makes a lot of sense for Facebook. Right.  But it freaks me out because I really like the web.  You know, it's the AOL thing that's going on at Facebook.  So listen, I think this is going to be great for people.  Hey, if people want to get all their content,  get their website content inside Facebook, then Facebook should make it easier.  I just feel like, oh, my God, here's another Facebook button  that's going to be on every website that we go to,  which just concerns me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I also got off the phone just before the show with Google,  and it's no big deal stuff, but it's under embargo,  which Leo wouldn't do, but I do.  And involving the author stuff there.  And you can see the direction that Google has been taking is that they want  bring together the stuff that you've written in the distributed world  into a public place with Google. Right.  They have that author thing that I'm already part of, where if I write on  Buzz Machine, on  Business Insider, on Huffington Post and on The Guardian,  Google will compile that all under my name.  And they're doing that now on Google.  And so you can subscribe to me, though I don't know why anyone  other than my mother would  and get your distributed writings from all over.  I think beats this notion from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I would like Facebook to do exactly what they're doing.  Just use use a standard that everybody else uses so that it's exportable  and cross platform.  And it could still work so that people who don't know anything about RSS  don't have to. They just press the buttons.  But, you know, I think eighty five thousand eight hundred eighty one people  would disagree that only your mother wants to read what you write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, my mother doesn't want to see when I use dirty words, so you're right.

Transcript:  Well, let's let's talk a little bit about tablets.  A couple of different stories out about how well the Kindle Fire is doing  and whether or not it is actually stealing  the thunder away from the iPad, the iPad being the dominant tablet  in the market right now.  After hitting retailers on November 15th, it is already outselling  the iPad at Best Buy, sort of.  If you sort tablets by top sellers at the Best Buy website,  it shows the fire in first place, followed by the 16 gigabyte  Wi-Fi only iPad, too. Now, these aren't you don't see numbers here.  It's just kind of seeing what Best Buy says is their top sellers.  Question is, if you took all of the different skews of iPads  and totaled them up, would they still be below the Kindle Fire in total sales?  However, it's it's selling very well.  It's it's out there, you know, eating up sales and and people are buying it.  However, there's also another study out there from Evercore  analyst Robert Chira, who says that the Kindle Fire seems to be headed  for half of the Android tablet market by 2012.  And he thinks it will demolish the other Android manufacturers offerings.  He doesn't think that the iPad is going to be hurt by it  because people will see the fire as an introductory tablet.  And it actually could help iPad sales in the long run.  Somebody else sat down with Tim Cook and  and the CFO over at Apple, and they said, look, we love the Kindle Fire.  It's a way to get people into the market for cheap.  And then when they're ready to spend more on a tablet,  they can upgrade to the iPad with entry drug. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the gateway drug. Right.  I mean, I think that that's probably really true.  I mean, the fire just seems like it's going for a different market than the iPad.  It's for people who aren't curious, but aren't five hundred dollar  convinced that they want an iPad.  You know, the Kindle Fire  cannibalizing other Android tablet sales that that may be true, although,  you know, there have yet to be that.  I mean, there aren't that many Android tablets yet out there.  So, you know, at six months from now, I think we'll have a better,  a better sense of this.  You get Apple wants to think that anyone who wants a high end tablet  is definitely to go for the iPad and know and not an Android tablet.  I don't know if that's necessarily true.  And I think it's too early to say yet.  I mean, the the tab, the Galaxy tab that I got at the Google I.O.  You know, has had some problems.  It was a really early release and it certainly hasn't been selling  not nearly as well as the fire or the iPad.  But I think there are going to be other choices later on.  I think it's too early to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And a lot of people make there's people like Captain Kipper  in the chat room saying, look, it's you know, Kindle fire is not a tablet.  It's an e-reader.  That is true, but it's semantics.  And when people go out to buy electronics,  they're probably not thinking, well, I want an e-reader or a tablet.  They're thinking I want the thing that does the thing that I want to do,  whether that's watching video or reading or a combination  of of multiple different things.  And I've got this much money to spend.  That's how they're making the decision.  And in that sense, these tablets and readers are starting to compete  because they do multiple things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to touch the web on a bigger screen.  Yeah, I think that's what people think.  I want a web browser I can touch on a bigger screen than my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you need to move to China so you can get the hundred dollar  ice cream sandwich tablet.  Half the price of the Kindle fire now shipping with Android 4.0  MIPS Technologies and Ingenix Semen Conductor, a China based mobile chip  provider announced with worldwide availability.  So we don't actually have to move to China to get it.  The world's first tablet based on Android 4.0 at 99 bucks.  Just crazy. How bad will this be?  It's obviously not approved by Google or Google would be out there  making a big deal about it.  So it's not going to have Google branding.  They're just using the free stock Android ice cream sandwich.  Thus, means no marketplace, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it means no Android market.  There might be another market.  Sure, they could get jar.  Yeah. Or they can install the Amazon market.  Or the Amazon app store on it, right?  Because you can. Well, actually, I don't know how you'd install it.  It would be interesting.  They could ship.  They have to ship it with some sort of way to get an app, get to get apps on it.  Yes. I might buy one of these just to just to see how awful it is.  Sort of expect that it would be awful at that price.  But I don't know, maybe maybe they'll surprise us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a MIPS based processor.  It's not a bad processor. One gigahertz graphics come from Vivante GC 860.  I don't know anything about that.  But 1080p video decoding front and rear cameras,  seven inch screen, Wi-Fi, USB 2, HDMI, 1.3 micro SD.  I mean, the specs aren't bad for a ninety nine dollar tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I want to, you know, if this is true and I think there's some,  you know, I'll believe it when I see it.  But a ninety nine.  This starts to get the price point that really could explode.  The notion of of connecting this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this seems like the tablet that you would buy at Kmart,  Walmart, someplace like that,  where it doesn't quite really do all of the things that that other tablets do.  But you know, you get it at a bargain.  And if your budget is I can't spend more than one hundred dollars.  Well, now you got a tablet.  It's, you know, maybe seven inches and it may not have the Google  marketplace or Google Maps or any of that stuff built in.  But maybe you don't care. I don't know.  It is interesting to see anything at a tablet at that price point.  I agree. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I think people are much more likely to buy the Kindle  because it's a brand that they trust and commercials and, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then you can just go put ice cream sandwich on it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just went to the I just went to the buy it and your item is sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of the of the OMG technologies one, the ninety nine dollar one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The I know electron.  Yeah, so they made five hundred of them. Yeah.  I'll bet you're exactly right.  Probably got a lot of publicity and G.  Let's see it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had some spare chips. They threw them in some tablets.  Inventory problem solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They bought some of those HP things and just rebranded them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know, look at those things closely.  Seven inches, though, right. It's smaller than the touchpad.  So Kindle fire owners can now put ice cream sandwich  sidling up as as Engadget puts it alongside  say antigen Mod 7 is the ice cream sandwich on the Kindle fire.  XDA Developers Forum member G one oh one one nine nine nine  is offering up shots with the promise of a kernel release in the near future.  So you can't do it yourself yet, but you can ogle it and salivate.  I don't know. I I'd do it.  Would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd do it, but we're the only ones.  I mean, yeah, probably.  People who bought the fire aren't doing this, but it's neat.  It's a neat proof of concept.  And for for nerds, I mean, it sounds like squarely a nerd, nerd project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's no reason Amazon couldn't do this eventually. Right.  I mean, ice cream sandwich is open source already.  So they can they can modify it and test it and put it out there.  This proves it'll run in the hardware.  I don't think anybody doubted that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, unless there's there's, you know, they don't feel like it's  snappy enough or there's some sort of something doesn't work.  You know, there's some sort of deal breaking bug.  Yeah, there's no reason why they they wouldn't do this.  Although, you know, Amazon, I think, made a lot of, you know, wrote a lot of software  kind of on top of Android.  So it'd be a lot of work for them to upgrade.  I mean, I imagine that they will probably just release a kindle fire to  with the upgrade, you know, have people rebuy the device  then then push, push an update over the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they do. Yeah, you're probably right.  You know, I mean, exactly.  And then they can legitimately say, well, we just didn't think the hardware  was good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then we want you to have the best experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And pull this out.  Dell no longer offering the Android powered Streak 7 on its site,  told Engadget it's referring to the Streak 7 in the past tense.  They did point out it'll be available at certain retailers still.  But it looks like the Streak 7 is at least in the United States.  It's gone. Goodbye. Goodbye.  On the street. The street five is dead, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know it actually. Yeah.  Streak five is is already.  So does Dell have tablets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in the US.  They have tablets in China.  Weird. But yeah, they've sort of moved out.  And they didn't have to threaten to sell their their computer group off to do it either.  Yeah. All right.  Let's take a quick break and thank our other sponsor, Carbonite.  Ask yourself this question and answer honestly.  You don't have to tell me, are your computer files backed up right now?  If the answer is no, you are living perilously.  And maybe you're just a person who likes to live with possibly  all of their data disappearing in a split second.  But that's not the way I would like to live.  And if you don't want to live that way anyway, either get a local backup.  So you have three, three copies of your data.  You want the data that's on your computer.  You want the data that's backed up locally to like a network  attached storage or some kind of hard drive.  And then you want something off site, because if your home burns down,  God forbid, or something else happens locally, you want that data  to be safely away from your home and away from where you are.  And that's why I use carbonite.com.  Your files are automatically and continually backed up, stored safely off site.  And after you have a computer disaster, it's easy to restore them.  Plus you can access your backup files.  A good side benefit from any computer on the Internet  or your smartphone or your iPad with a free app.  Unlimited backup for your PC or Mac is only fifty nine dollars a year.  And you can try it for absolutely free.  Go to carbonite.com enter the offer code twig  and you can sign up for a free trial from the home page.  No credit card required. Sign up for that free trial.  Sign up from the home page and you'll get two months free  when you purchase the service, if you decide to purchase it.  So no credit card required.  Go to the home page, sign up for the trial.  You just use that offer code twig at carbonite.com.  And even if you're sitting there like, I don't know if I need this, you'll sleep better.  There's a little part of your brain that's going, you know, my data  could all disappear overnight and it's keeping you awake at night.  So get some better sleep.  Go to carbonite.com, use the offer code twig.  And we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Do either of you get a chance to read this NC State University  research about the Android app bug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, a little bit.  I'm just I'm just looking through the article on ours now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael Grace, Yajin Xu, Ji Wang and Juchen Zhang published a paper  finding Android smartphones from Motorola, HTC and Samsung  did not properly protect privileged permissions from untrusted applications.  The HTC legend, the EVO 4G, the wildfire S, Motorola, Droid, Droid X,  Samsung, Epic 4G and the Google Nexus one, the Nexus X,  where XS were the ones they tested.  Google and Motorola have confirmed the vulnerabilities.  HT and Samsung are having trouble accepting the reporting.  There are two there are two leaks going on.  The explicit capability leak is the one that's troubling.  It allows applications to exploit a public interface or service of another app  without making a permission request.  So you can actually have an app that you have given permission to access,  say, your contact list, and another app can then kind of ride on that apps permissions.  There's also implicit leaks that allow other applications to inherit  permissions from another application with the same signed digital certificate.  Those would have to be apps from the same company.  So you give, let's say you give Google Maps location information,  then Gmail could use this vulnerability to get location information.  That's less troubling, although it shouldn't happen.  An untrusted app on these affected phones can manage to wipe out user data on the phone,  send out SMS messages, record user conversations or obtain user geolocations  all without asking any permission because they use that permission  that's already been given to some other app.  Now, the Google reference phones, the Nexus One and the Nexus S,  were the only ones that did not suffer this vulnerability.  So it's something that's going on in the non-stock implementations on the other phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting. You know, the most interesting, the most relevant,  I think, part of these kinds of things when these vulnerabilities are found,  the question is how quickly, how easily are they reported  and how quickly are they addressed?  So the thing that came out that jumped out to me out of this article  was that which companies, oh, the researchers experienced major difficulties  in trying to report issues to HTC and Samsung.  That makes me sort of really distrustful of HTC and Samsung's ability to, you know,  kind of have to be open to bug reports.  You have to have people ready to test these kinds of vulnerability reports  and address them right away.  And that's just part of the, you know, it's got to be part of the development cycle.  So an interesting that Google's references phones didn't  on the show, I've said a bunch of times on the show that I always sort of  I'm a little bit of a snob.  I always want to buy the pure Google experience phone because I feel like it's  it's the purest kind of manifestation of what Google wants Android to be.  And that's just what I'm most interested in because of the show, for the most part.  You know, I've been thinking about whether or not, I mean, I think it's great  when researchers find these kind of vulnerabilities or students or hackers,  you know, even if there's like a hacker contest for, you know, finding bugs.  But I wonder if there's a place for an organization or a company  to do this kind of security testing and offer some sort of extra  kind of third party stamp of approval, you know, like, hey, this, you know,  this handset passed all of our tests. Yeah.  You know, I wonder about that.  You know, I look for the Google stamp on phones.  OK, if this got Google's approval, then this is good.  But maybe we need a third party  organization that can do this for every mobile OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like trustee for OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For OS is right.  And they can even not only for the handsets themselves,  but they can have this layer on top of the app stores and marketplaces  that, you know, where you say, you know, if I earn the certification  that can show up on my on my app store listing as well,  that this has gone through a rigorous set of tests.  And it does exactly what it says it does. And no more.  I wonder if, you know, if that's if there's a there's a business there.  And I'd like to see it come up.  You know, so it's kind of like I want all the openness of the market  where as a developer, I can submit an app and have it listed right away  and maybe not necessarily go through Apple's approval process.  But I also want to have this higher level where, you know,  I can also submit it to this organization or board  and also get their stamp of approval.  And as a consumer, I can say, hey, you know, I'll only download these apps  or I'll only buy these handsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a fantastic idea. I love that. Yeah, it is.  All right. Wall Street Journal reports that Google is in talks  with major retailers and shippers to create a service  that lets consumers shop for goods on the web and receive orders  within a day or two for a low fee.  Sound familiar? It's a competitor to Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm doubly interested in at this time when the post office is about to get rid  of next day delivery on a regular basis on their first class stuff.  Yeah. And the letters and  sixth day delivery and all that.  And so it really starts to make you see new possibilities  of consolidation and delivery of goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Wall Street Journal speculates that one of the reasons  Google would want to do this is because they're finding that people  search on Amazon for products, right?  That they're losing some search to Amazon.  And I find myself doing this when I'm like, what's the price of something?  I go to Amazon to look up the price because I know that they have  pretty much everything in their catalog, even if they don't sell it.  They have so many third parties.  So the idea is to strike these these deals.  And they've got deals with with big name companies, according to this report.  Again, Google isn't talking about it, but Macy's and Nordstrom's and  you know, big name retailers like that.  Apparently, there's already something called Shoprunner.com,  which does this with major sites like New Egg, Toys R Us,  Drugstore.com, Sports Authority.  So it's not like there aren't alternatives to Amazon Prime  where you can get this free shipping.  But you've got to figure this is going to be a bigger deal  and get more pickup right away if Google does it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think it's I think it's it's one more nail in the coffin  much of retail.  Not retail is not going to go away as a whole, but I think you're going to be  paying a premium to get things immediately and things going to be cheaper  to consolidate at a distance.  And delivery is going to change and it's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the next big move for retail is honestly brick and mortar  for online retailers.  They're going to find that they in some industries anyway, they've run  so many of these other businesses out that they're losing the benefit  of people going and picking it up and looking at it.  Right. We were just saying on Security Now this morning,  if you're if you're shopping for an e-reader, you know, go to Best Buy,  go to Target, pick it up, play with it and figure out which one is best.  I think they're going to have to do find some kind of strategy  that bridges that gap eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I've actually been working with somebody who has a strategy in mind.  We've almost got the huge mall in New Jersey and didn't quite get it,  but there's another chance.  And I think what you see, Tom, is that that's a case of touching this marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I see with my hands, not with my eyes.  In this case, it's a good thing.  Yeah. But but yeah, I think I do think it's fascinating that Google would  would move against Amazon.  And they've been trying to do this since the days of frugal  to get people to use them as a reference for products.  And they've never really cracked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Frugal. Wow. That's that goes back. Yeah, it does.  I was thinking about in this article, they were saying that like three quarters  of product searches happen on Amazon and not on Google.  And I was thinking about when I go shopping,  you know, I go to Amazon and search mostly because when I when I search  for a product on Google, I get a bunch of links to online stores  that are kind of in all different places and have different payment methods.  And I'm not really sure whether or not, you know, they're reliable.  And on Amazon, we're not only doing Amazon Prime, but I just have  I've been shopping at Amazon for so many years  and I've had such a good experience with them over and over again.  That just seems like Amazon's the place you go when you when you want to buy  something. And so I think it's interesting.  They're trying to get they're trying to get those product searches back.  They don't like the idea that people are going straight to Amazon  to to to search for products.  But, you know, of course, it was like the day before Thanksgiving.  And I realized that I needed a new roasting pan.  And I didn't have time.  I knew exactly the kind I wanted, but I didn't have time to order it online  and have it shipped to me.  And I went to Google and I was like, I just want Google to tell me  what is the closest store near me that has this exact roasting pan  that I need because I need it right now.  And I had trouble, you know, I had trouble finding it.  So I think there's a lot of room for improvement here in Google.  I think this is just about Google  wanting to want to get those searches back or get those searches at all.  Where do you guys go when you have to search for product?  Do you do it on Google or do you go to Amazon or somewhere else?  I go to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nine. I'd say maybe two or three times out of ten.  I will use Google product search.  And it's usually because I tried Amazon and I didn't get the answer I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. But you but when you know you're looking for something  that you're ready to buy right now, you go and it's not like something  specialized like electronics.  You might go to New Egg for that or someplace else.  You go straight to Amazon first.  No, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if there's if there's a trusted retailer that I use normally  for something, I will go directly to their site because I know, oh, yeah,  you know, that that's the place that always has the thing I want.  But yeah, when it's something where I'm like, I don't really know where it is.  I just want the best price that I will look on Amazon. Yeah.  Yes. And I think that's it.  I think Amazon is trying to  or I think Google is trying to figure out how to get product search back to Google.  I don't think this is the way either.  But certainly not a not a bad thing if they can pull it off.  YouTube launched a brand new front page December 1st,  and it's more channel and more social oriented.  So you'll be able to see things by type.  You can kind of pick a channel and go into it.  It's more of a TV type interface.  You'll also see what your friends are listening to.  And I guess it's based on your Google Plus circles.  It shows you just, you know, what kind of stuff they're watching.  So you can see more recommendations.  What do you guys think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't played with it yet.  I've looked at it when I saw the stuff on the site.  It looks kind of pretty. I  I think that YouTube has to try more and more and more to become  a way that we find entertainment, because I don't usually use it that way.  You know, I go in when somebody links me to it or when I go into search  something I'm looking for.  But do I do I ever go to YouTube and say, I feel like watching some stuff now?  Is that just because I'm old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know. Well, I'm I don't do it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe. But I'm old, too.  I mean, relatively, I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Old. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're old enough to not share on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true, though.  I generally will watch YouTube videos that I find for my friends on Facebook or Twitter.  So it makes sense that they've integrated social.  This is a nice redesign, although it surprises me  that they're still maintaining YouTube is a very separate product from the rest  of the products like it didn't get the new Google bar,  which which which surprised me.  It does feel like this kind of island still like the YouTube brand  is is very strong on YouTube still.  It doesn't doesn't look like a Google product.  I also I have trouble with sign in on on YouTube sometimes.  I think it has to do with the multi sign in thing.  I have to sign out of everything out of my apps account and everything  and sign in with my regular account.  But otherwise, I like I like that they're injecting social in here.  And I would like to see more like if show me all the YouTube videos  that my Google plus friends have plus one the most or something like that.  That that would make it really cool.  Right now, it's just filled with a lot of Twitter.  And I think it's because I'm subscribed to the channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, oh, yeah, no, I have a lot of toy break.  It's a show that I subscribe to on YouTube.  So, of course, it pops up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, actually, I do see the T-Mobile YouTube video  that Jeff shared on Google Plus.  So they are they do have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually how I saw it, because it's commercial there.  And when I saw the rundown, I went there and that's where I came to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I you can connect Facebook if you want as well.  I mean, somebody a couple of people in the chat room are bringing that up.  It's it's kind of defaults to Google Plus if you're logged in to Google  because it's a YouTube property, but you can you can connect it with Facebook,  connect and see what friends are sharing on there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does any other Google product connect to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I was just wondering that. I'll bet not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's that's pretty that's unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very independent of YouTube. Yeah. Yeah.  Notable. Jeff, you noticed that Google News is adding qualitative metadata to links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm told they've been doing this for a while.  I just hadn't noticed it.  So I did a search on something and it says,  I think in depth blogs, but also highly cited, which is really interesting.  It's an effort for for Google News to try to get some measure of authority in there.  And so an article has been cited a lot.  They're now going to rise up and and specifically label that, which is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I you know, I noticed this the other day, too.  And I think it's probably something that they've started to highlight in a better way,  even if they are doing it for a while, because I use Google News all the time  as sort of a check to see what's buzzy out there.  And I love that.  I love having the ability to say, OK, this is this is the big story.  This is the one that everyone's referring to.  That just it's a shortcut to having to drill down and say,  well, who reported it first and where they get their information.  So I I think that's pretty cool that they're doing that.  All right. Any of these other stories before we move on?  You know, Chrome's getting closer to Firefox or in front of Firefox,  depending on what metric you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, what did you think of Glee last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I enjoyed it. I did.  I'm very happy that the team is coming back together.  Without without spoiling it for anyone, because I know all of our listeners  and viewers are on the edge of their seats about Glee.  Yes, they are.  I mean, the kind of arc of the season, which is that, you know, division,  you know, makes us weaker and being together makes us stronger,  a sort of coming to its end now and they're coming back together.  So I enjoyed it very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're on the edge of their seats because they're falling down drunk  because we mentioned Glee too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So exactly, exactly. Drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were parts to this episode.  They needed to wet their whistle.  Did you want to do you want us to play this T-Mobile commercial  that you say is Glee-esque?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I thought it was actually a nice commercial.  That's all. Yeah.  And the comments from dancing pink singers.  Well, that's OK. And then it ends with Carly, which is nice.  Who's the T-Mobile girl? Yeah.  We talked about it. I'm going to look like a dirty old man saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's move on to Gina's tip.  Then what do you got for us this week, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is a graphical math calculator now.  I mean, for years, you could enter math equations into Google and get an answer.  If you if you enter two plus two, Google will answer four.  But just this week, they launched the ability to graph  really complex mathematical formulas.  So if you type in sine X,  Google will show you this beautiful sine curve right within your results.  Oh, I would have died for this during Trig.  Yeah, no, seriously. Right.  So you don't have to go to Wolfram Alpha for this kind of thing,  which is kind of neat.  The other quick tip of Google Plus supports phone calls as well.  If you go to a Google Plus hangout with extras,  you can have people call into the hangout.  So I actually haven't tried that one myself, but neat to see hangouts  adding little features in their extras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I've started an experiment.  I do a podcast called East Meets West.  That's really just an experimental podcast to try stuff out.  I do it with Roger Chang.  And we've started because we don't want to have to spend time  booking people for the show.  We want it to be a kind of self directing  because we just sort of do it on a whim.  So we don't want to have to schedule it.  And we've started taking to using Google Hangout as our guest booking.  So we just start doing the show on a hangout.  And then anybody who's in it, we have a limited circle right now  to test this idea out.  But anybody who's in the circle who sees that we're recording the show  can then join the show.  We actually had Darren Kitchen  tell us that he was buying a sandwich at the grocery store  during the last episode.  That's cool.  So far, you know, not hard hitting,  hard hitting contributions, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's really cool. I love that.  Love the spontaneity. It's a really good idea.  I mean, I think Hangouts really gives you the opportunity to do that kind of  that kind of thing, where people just sort of happen, you know, stop in on,  you know, with the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you make it public?  Is that easy now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you can you can just hit you can you could make it public  if I want to, by just choosing the public option and then it just goes public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. I mean, I mean, how can people not  in the circle on the outside watch the Hangout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a broadcast option now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that is now distributed. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't used it myself.  I don't know. Are you are you are you recording East East East  meets West Tom and then and then distributing later? Right.  But so you just when you're recording, you make the hangout available  to limited right circle and then people can hop in if they want.  I see. I see what you mean.  But I think you actually can.  I might be wrong, but I think that you can invite certain people  into join the hangout and then broadcast it so people can watch  and the public can watch.  But only certain people. I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just aren't doing that.  But the reason I bring it up is I like this idea of being able to phone  someone in who's not on Google Plus that we decide like, oh, hey,  you know, this person's around.  Let's do the hangout thing so we get the serendipity.  But we can also just phone somebody in because it's an audio only podcast.  So, yeah, that's really cool.  All right, Jeff, your number, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, all right, I'll do this one.  Uh, 255 out of 358.  Uh, the Indian government in Google's transparency report,  uh, for the I think quarter asked for 358, uh, take down requests.  But 255 of them were because of criticism of the government,  which should freak us out.  And then related story, I have one from The Guardian  that was also reported in The New York Times that Google met  with four services, including Facebook.  I mean, sorry, the Indian government met with four services,  including Facebook and Google, saying that they should self-censor  the users and take out offensive things of every user, which of course is freaky.  And when did India become China?  And, uh, these are the things we have to keep our eyes out on folks to protect the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like it is a, is a sign of the growth of the internet that the, uh,  the rich and powerful have started to recognize that people use it, uh, and,  and they don't have control of how people use it.  And so we're going to continue to see this for a long time, different sectors,  governments, corporations, you know, we've, we've been seeing it,  but this sort of idea of like, wait a minute, you could say whatever you want over there.  Oh, that, that can't be allowed.  Uh, it is disappointing to see the world's largest democracy, uh, try this sort of thing.  But, you know, the United States is, is, is not innocent of this sort of thing with  SOPA and protect IP and those, those are exactly, yeah, those are other.  Moves of the same sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just came back from, uh, I was in Paris last week for a promotional event.  I was in Berlin in Paris last week, because you knew I had my horrible  phone connection there in Berlin, but in Paris, I was making fun of Sarkozy  for all the various reasons, but, but we got SOPA too, where she hardly,  uh, are the immune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Swiss are probably the best so far, cause they were the ones that had a  recent study saying, you know what, we don't see any reason to change the law  that it's okay to download copyrighted material for your personal use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said another reason to move to Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They determined that the people who did, uh, download free copyrighted material  for personal use actually ended up spending more on entertainment than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, how refreshing.  Yeah.  Enlightenment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  I know it won't ever happen anywhere else, but we can dream.  All right.  Leo's not here, but I've got sort of a tool since I, uh, since I'm filling in,  I'm going to, I'm going to take the opportunity to give you sort of a useless  tool, the Android phone name generator at Android phone name generator.com.  I just saw this today on tech crunch.  I don't know.  It may have been around for a while, but you just press the button and it gives  you a potential Android phone name, like the Motorola bionic plus, or the LG  defy epic E one Z.  The HTC charge vivid S two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The HTC galaxy epic 4g one plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have a feeling that people may actually be using this to name  their phones out there.  I have the Samsung nitro plus X two 4g plus Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Acer mesmerize.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The HTC atrix slide E three D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I got the HTC wildfire slide E four G plus plus it's a hours of endless fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Folks, Android phone name generator.com.  This is kind of a take on an old internet meme of the generator, but I was, I was,  I was fond of it.  Yeah.  I clearly didn't need to use this during future episodes while we're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ansatz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be like, well, that Acer wildfire, incredible G one two.  Now that looks really good.  You know, when the Samsung wildfire epic prime comes out, I think we'll all realize

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the LG E one G two is going to be the one I get.  Here's a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tom, can you take, take it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a challenge.  Tom, can you take, take any random name and then blog and G plus about it and see if  you can get somebody to pick it up as if it's a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I just saw a screenshot of an inventory with the Sony Ericsson Xperia  incredible two G two listed is coming out in January.  There you go.  Yeah.
