It's time for Twig, this week in Google. We've got a great panel, we're going to have some fun today.  Jeff Jarvis is here, in his office.  It's nice to have you. Is that a newspaper, news delivery bag behind you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's from VidCon.  Oh, Be Critical of the Media You Love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I was hoping it was like a paperboy's bag. That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have one at home somewhere. I have one for the New York Mirror, I think.  Another classic.  Jack Hong on a Day.  A paper that I had no tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And still remembers how a typewriter smells.  Also, Stacey has the week off, but guess who's here in her place?  Her good friend and co-partner in podcasting, Mr. Kevin Toffle.  Hey, hey.  Also, Kevin's new website, which you got a big scoop about, chromebooks.com.  Just today.  Big scoop.  And we're thrilled to have Ant Pruitt back on.  Yay!  He's a contributor to Tech Republic.  He is a great photographer, drone pilot, and a Friday night video guy on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Ant, is that computer next to you, actually, just like Steve Gibson's shelves?  It's just a prop with lights in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, buddy, this is a tool, not a prop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had to make him turn it off the last time he was on because it was so noisy.  It was so...  Oh, really? The fans were so loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All these fans in this thing. But I think I got you squared away now, Mike.  I'm going to get a little closer to my pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all it needs to be. Just get that sound, man.  Ant, you need a liquid-cooled chair next to that thing.  A liquid-cooled chair? I love it.  Always good to have all three of you on.  Talk about the week's news.  And there's a breaking story, which somebody, I think it was Ant, mentioned that just came in.  The Tao night... No, not the Tao night. You're the Tao night.  The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  Sued... This is the weirdest thing I've ever heard of.  Sued President Trump on behalf of eight people who he had blocked on Twitter.  The premise, which...  Well, the premise is that the President of the United States shouldn't be able to block people.  And the judge has just ruled... That's correct.  Judge Naomi Rice-Spookwald of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York  said, President Trump's Twitter account is a public forum,  and blocking people who reply to his tweets with differing opinions constitutes viewpoint discrimination.  That's a violation of the First Amendment.  That is just bizarre that we've come to this point in the world where this is a heavy-duty issue.  What's interesting is... And she wrote a 75-page opinion on this.  He could have ignored the reply tweets.  She says, that's not unconstitutional.  But you can't... In other words, you can mute them, but you can't block them.  She said, muting preserves the muted account's ability to reply to a tweet sent by the muting account.  Blocking says you can't reply.  That is a distinction.  The blocked user can neither see nor reply to blocked users' tweets entirely.  Muting means you can see Trump's tweets and respond to them. It's just that he won't see them.  And she says, that's not unconstitutional.  She did not order Trump or the assistant to the president, Daniel Scavino,  to unblock the individual plaintiffs or prohibit them from blocking others.  She said, a declaratory judgment should be sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a right to speak, there's a right to hear, and there's a right to be heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  But you know what? One of the folks in the chat room says he asked for this,  and I think that's the crux of it right there.  He's chosen to use this as a presidential platform,  and that changes the game in terms of First Amendment, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what differentiates it from us doing it versus the POTUS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he can block people from press conferences, and has.  Is that unconstitutional?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a case where, again, I split this up.  There's a new book out by a professor named Anani, USC,  talking about the right to hear, to not have things you need to know as a citizen blocked out by noise.  Then there's the right to be heard.  I don't think anybody would say that you have a right to be heard.  You have a right to speak, but not be heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the internet is all built for speaking.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.  Okay, well, that's the breaking news.  Just happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is anybody here blocked by him, out of curiosity?  I don't follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have tried and tried and tried everything I can to be blocked by him.  It doesn't work.  I am blocked.  Why am I not surprised?  How can you tell if you're blocked?  I am blocked.  Oh, because when you try to read him, it would say no.  Oh, then I'm not blocked.  I am blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never replied to him either.  Does he ever use Facebook at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know he's pretty heavy with Twitter.  Is there any Facebook traffic from him?  No, isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Facebook is far too complicated for him.  He likes Twitter.  He's in my beautiful Twitter account.  I'm sorry, Jeff, and you said, and you said...  I am blocked by Donald Trump Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  What did you do?  That's proxy blocking.  And by Roger Stone.  Oh, what did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't even want to know.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't know.  I'm very prompt.  I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is weird, though, that we live in this day and age where this is now like a heavy  judicial matter, First Amendment matter.  It's very strange.  Did you see 60 Minutes on Sunday?  I did not, so you're going to have to summarize it.  There are two things that were germane to our conversation here.  One was Theranos, and they're really saying, you know, how did we and everybody else get  this wrong?  Elizabeth Holmes.  And they talked about, you know, the end of the line for Theranos and how she's gone from  being a billionaire to nothing.  And it was fascinating.  Interesting.  I think based on a new book from a Washington Post...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yet the company stays alive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's alive, but it's more abundant.  Well, I thought I just got an investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Who would put money into Theranos?  Somebody who already has money in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of Education.  Lost 100 million dollars on it.  Lost 100 million dollars.  Theranos...  I saw something, I could swear.  It was at one point valued at nine billion dollars.  It was, of course, for those who don't know, Elizabeth Holmes, who founded it, was a Stanford  freshman who dropped out at the age of 19 because she thought she had discovered a way to do  blood tests with a tiny amount, a drop of blood, and founded a company, raised nine  billion dollars or was valued at nine billion dollars at one point.  We're going to try to get John Kerry, who wrote the book, Bad Blood, Secrets and Lies  in Silicon Valley Startup.  I'm sorry, he's not the Washington Post.  He's Wall Street Journal.  He's the guy who wrote that big article that just blew the lid off of it.  Now he's got a novel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It appears I'm wrong.  I could swore I saw that headline a week or two ago, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't.  Big name board members like George Shultz, Carlos Slim, Betsy DeVos, 700 million dollars  in financing.  At no point did this blood test work.  At one point, they were really faking the results.  They were going out and taking blood tests and putting them in other machines and saying  that the Theranos Edison machine had done it.  The SEC sued in March.  Both Holmes and the president, Ramesh Sunny Balwani, Holmes settled.  She had to give up control of the company, paid a half million dollar fine.  In April, the company laid off most of its staff.  I mean, there's something.  There's a husk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I saw.  He didn't put any more money in, but Tim Draper said he's still thrilled with his 500,000  dollar investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, 500,000.  He didn't lose as much as some of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He defended it and her on CNBC.  An extraordinary company.  Was glad to have backed her.  Glad to have known her personally.  Really?  It was a great mission.  She did a great job.  I'm thrilled with what she's done.  This is on May 18, May 12.  She really pulled one over on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know they faked the results and such.  I'd be curious, Jeff in particular.  And you know, I write for the press.  I mean, how much to blame here is on the press in terms of the coverage, the questions?  Really good point, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really good point.  I think absolutely a great deal.  We go for, you know, we follow the lead.  We follow the beast over the cliff in promotion and we don't do our own reporting.  We just copy stuff and we look at the clips and we write it and that's what we do.  I wonder, does anybody know who gets the credit for having blown the whistle on them?  Yeah, Kerry.  Yeah, Kerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, oh, he got a tip.  I don't.  In the 60 Minutes piece, they talked to a number of former employees, one of whom did call  the, I think the SEC or the FTC about it.  So I think a number of employees kind of went, what is going on?  I don't know who gets credit except for Kerry Rue for writing that Wall Street Journal article  we all read.  Right.  That was kind of a shocker.  I had, we'd all had kind of, I don't know.  I had misgivings for a while about it, but this really blew the lid off it.  So, so we all wanted to believe this because she looks like a female Steve Jobs.  Right.  I mean, that, that is a great story that we all wanted to tell.  And she knew it.  That's why she wore black turtlenecks.  She played on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Related to this, I don't know if you guys saw Elon's tweet storm this afternoon.  No.  Going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was going off.  Oh, yeah.  That's on the rundown.  That's on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  Let's read it.  Let's see.  If you're in media and don't want Pravda to exist, Pravda to exist, write an article  telling your readers to vote against.  He wants to create a media credibility rating site.  Oh, let's, let's, let's, I can go to the beginning of the tweet storm.  That's probably what I should do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The link is there on the rundown.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, the holier than thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth,  but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie is why the public no longer respects them.  And he's linking to an electric.co article that says Tesla could rally his media negativities  increasingly immaterial says Baird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, apparently there's a nonprofit that did a longterm study on Tesla safety and things  and published it.  about it and basically saying journalists are just after clicks and they do, you know,  keep the advertisers happy, et cetera, et cetera.  But this was a nonprofit.  They're not even, they don't care about the close.  He talking about the consumer reports story.  I thought he was at first, but no, he singled out and there's a couple of threads in there  from the company at Jeff.  You might know it, not react.  Um, reveal, uh, reveal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is, which is center for investigative reporting, which is in, um, the East Bay.  San Francisco area.  He also, uh, smashed them personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I should mention that my son worked for them, uh, the pack last summer.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  You never told me that.  Yeah.  It's run by the, uh, uh, probably a compadre of yours, former examiner, um, editor in chief,  Phil Bronstein, Bronstein, uh, and reveal is there.  So they've been around for a while and reveal was their new kind of product.  They just launched last year to make it be more, uh, hip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So must say there are a bunch of political science students who paid too much attention  to their professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man.  Oh yeah.  Oh man.  He does not like the bad news.  And he's been getting a lot of it.  Consumer reports said the breaking distance on the model three is among the worst they've  ever seen.  They actually bought a second model three because they couldn't believe how bad it was  and it performed just as badly.  Tesla's response was that doesn't match our test results at all.  Um, yeah, this is, this is, uh, and of course he, uh, a couple of weeks ago, flamed a, an  analyst and refused to answer his questions.  Boring, stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember that you want to get a little cranky.  My, uh, my tweet was that he's finally met his match that he's never had to deal with  the failings of people.  Yeah.  Right.  Even, even PayPal, it was banking laws.  It's just, it's money.  Zip two was yellow pages and stuff.  Uh, current companies, hardware, uh, you get into, into what's true and who believes what  who trusts what good luck.  Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something happens when you get, uh, you know, you get this much power and this much money,  you'd stop living in the real world.  And I think it just takes a little while, but it happens to, I think everybody that  start, um, yeah, you start getting, you get a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it happened after my first billion.  Then that's, yeah, no, Kevin, that's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've, we've said it.  You've never been the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  Don't be like Elon and don't be like Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Elon's response is I'm going to create, this was a couple of hours ago, a site where  the public can rate the core truth of any article and track the credibility score over  time of each journalist, editor and publication, thinking of calling it Pravda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many times, how many times have I seen that exact idea from people like him who get  pissed off that somebody got something wrong in the press, which is a problem and it's  true and we've all experienced that.  But what we'll do with this cause you want to be a rating that'll solve it all.  Why hasn't I done that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it's, have you ever seen the comments on YouTube or anything?  Yeah.  That's what those comments are.  Of course there's slash dot and dig and Reddit, all of which have karma scores.  I don't think any of them are journalistic exemplars.  So yeah.  Yeah.  You know what, I have a Tesla.  I love my Tesla.  I think Elon's done a lot of good to the world, but I think that he also maybe is not reacting  well to, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  Maybe he's just...  You're going to have some bumps in the road.  Just overcome them.  Put your head down and work on it.  You want to prove them wrong, succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Continue to succeed.  And I respect him a lot.  He took the money he made from PayPal and risked it all on SpaceX and Tesla.  I admire him.  And it's a good thing.  It's a very good thing.  Yeah.  I don't think we'd see electric cars.  Every company in the world is trying to make electric cars now.  I mean there's a number of reasons.  There's governmental pressure.  But I think the fact that Tesla's done so well and improved the market has helped a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Mark Harris, a scientific writer for The Economist, said regarding Musk...  He's not kidding, folks.  I noticed that one of Musk's agents had incorporated Pravda Corp in California back in October  last year.  I was wondering what this was all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pravda, for those who don't know, is the famous Soviet mouthpiece newspaper.  Is Pravda still around?  I don't think so, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  But Pravda means truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but of course that was ironic.  Yes.  Yeah, Pravda...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says circulation of 100,000 on Wikipedia.  It's still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pravda.ru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were Musk's earlier efforts ever publicly owned companies before he sold them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Zip2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know whether...  Well, certainly wasn't PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before he sold them is the question.  Did they go public first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just thinking he's under pressure from shareholders.  He's not used to this.  He's never been before.  Exactly.  I'm not saying...  I'm not justifying his reactions by any means, but that's the difference, I think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Pravda's pretty much the same kind of the news of the world publication that it  always was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been part of these efforts to spread lies.  It's a vector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, the second thing on 60 Minutes was actually the bigger story for us.  It was going to distract you, yeah.  Which is Google.  A really kind of, I would say, a kind of classic 60 Minutes hit piece on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the standard...  No, they're right up on it.  The standard attacker.  The one who will always be guaranteed to attack Google and press go right to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's quote Ben Thompson from Stratechary.  The 60 Minutes report was not exactly fair and balanced.  It featured an anti-tech monopoly crusader, an anti-tech monopoly activist, an anti-tech  monopoly regulator, and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman.  And in what seems highly unlikely to have been a coincidence, Yelp this week filed a  new antitrust complaint in the EU against Google.  Yep, there we go.  So, Yelp did a blog post about the 60 Minutes feature in which they included a several-year-old  video that explains how anti-competitive Google is.  Ben points out the answer box that Yelp...  Yelp appears to be...  Yelp's position appears to be that Google's answer box is anti-competitive because it  only includes reviews and ratings from Google.  Presumably the situation could be resolved were Google to use sources like Yelp.  There are three big problems with this argument.  First, the answer box did used to include content from Yelp until they complained.  So Google stopped doing so under pressure from the FTC in 2013.  Second, in a telling testament to the power being on top of search results, Google's ratings  and reviews have improved considerably in the two years since the video was posted.  This isn't a static market.  Third, and this is the point of this article, what Yelp seems to want will only serve to  make Google stronger.  And then Ben delves into his trademarked deep dive on the difference between platforms and  aggregators.  Actually, I think one of the quotes, which is...  He quotes Chamath Palihapitiya in an interview.  Chamath was at Facebook.  When asked, do you see any similarities from your time at Facebook with Facebook platform  and connect and how Uber may supercharge their platform, Chamath said, neither of them are  platforms.  They're both kind of like these comical endeavors to do you as an nth priority.  I was in charge of Facebook platform.  We trumpeted it out like it was some hot stuff big deal.  We raised money from Bill Gates.  When that $15 billion raise happened a few months after Facebook platform and Gates said  something along the lines of, that's a crock of BS.  This isn't a platform.  And this is, I love this line.  This is Bill Gates.  Is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that  creates it, then it's a platform.  Strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good definition.  I love that.  I always say that a platform, you know you have a platform when users put it to a use  you did not anticipate when they take it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  And ultimately that leads to economic value.  So he says, so Windows was a platform.  Yes.  Because Apple captures the vast majority of the ecosystem.  So it's not a platform.  So he makes a distinction between aggregators and platforms in the aggregator business.  This is something Ben hits on a lot.  This idea of the aggregator business model.  The aggregator owns the customers, the suppliers follow.  So Google is not a platform.  Facebook is not a platform.  But as aggregators, Google has the luxury of operating in an environment, the World  Wide Web that was by default completely open.  That let the best technology win and that win was augmented by the data that comes from  serving an ever increasing part of the market.  The end result was the integration of end users and data feedback cycle that made Google  search better and better the more it was used.  So anyway, it was a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can vaguely see Google as a platform because of all of the other things that it has under  its umbrella that not only just regular consumers get to use, but companies are able to use  to get work done under the Google brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that according to Ben's definition, the beneficiary of all that is Google, not  the third parties.  So that's classic aggregator.  So anyway, that's a little off from our initial conversation, which was 60 minutes.  Are they just piling on as regulators, government and regular people start to hate these Facebook  and now Google's?  Is it Google's turn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was Google's turn before and then they kind of let it dry and then went to Facebook  and then when it got a supply of blood back, they're going after Google again.  I'm sorry, it's my business, but it's a media narrative and media are in a position of conflict  of interest because media think that Google stole their advertisers, which they didn't,  but that's where it is.  And so media keep going after them.  And right now it's just a cool thing to do to go after technology and to blame everything  on technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking at Vigor in the chat room and he says, he or she says, how is Google's Android  not a platform?  Can we consider Android a platform?  I would say so, just because of the televisions and phones and everything else that people  build around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Google gives it away.  So it's the third party.  Well, they get back too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They get back because they get the data.  They get the search data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's always that.  And even the advertising is a platform to the extent that it enables you to create a  business that you wouldn't be able to create otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Ben's point is that Yelp has, you know, entire business was predicated on Google  doing their customer acquisition for them.  You know, Yelp succeeded because of Google.  Yeah.  It seems a bit rich, he says, that Yelp should be free to leverage its app to avoid Google  completely.  That demand that Google continue to feature Yelp prominently in its search results, particularly  on mobile, where the answer box has particular utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by the way, Yelp, when I go to Yelp site, I get paid off.  I know.  Very good.  It's not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Google's position.  Google says, well, we we just try to give people the result, the best results.  And here's the irony where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on the one hand, people say you should be open to everything and equal to everything  as if there's such a thing.  And then the other hand, when people start doing bad things on the platform, we tell  the platforms, you should be making judgments and getting rid of bad stuff.  They can't win either way, except for the fact that they're the biggest companies on  Earth and they're very rich.  Then they win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it mean anything that Google removed the don't be evil clause from its code for context?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that an old story?  Didn't they do that like a year ago where they where they updated it?  They updated it then.  I think this is a I don't know that this is a legit story.  I think this was done quite some time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  They went to the way back machine and they're saying Gizmodo.  This is saying that it was there back in April.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alphabet, alphabet changed the model to do the right thing.  That's what you're thinking of.  But Google always he says here's so they compared April 21st of this year, which has this paragraph  don't be evil, you know, on on on the Google code of conduct.  And then the May 4th version doesn't have that phrase.  It was completely rewritten.  I suspect that this rewriting has more to do with GDPR than anything else.  But I don't but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They think again, we can't win both sides.  They get tons of crap for the don't be evil.  People misunderstand it because it's it's it's coming down Moses from the mountaintop  of the tablet. This is we're not evil.  It's not it says employees prevent us from being evil.  Although one because it's bad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I think whether it's true or not, it's kind of a tempest in the teapot.  It is.  All right. How about the scoop?  This guy, Kevin Toffle, I don't know where he gets his stuff from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to say this. God bless.  Kevin Toffle, Kevin Toffle is the one person in all of technology journalism who writes  for those who are smart enough to not have gigantic steam powered atomic powered machines  like Ant there.  The Ant goes for complication and wants the biggest show off thing possible.  That is not a Chromebook.  I'm guessing that's not a Chrome OS device.  That is a Chrome reactor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But to be fair, if you're going to process drone videos or hey, I just got a GoPro fusion.  That thing, even on an iMac Pro takes hours to render the 360 video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to have a 360 video was tough.  You really need some horsepower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really do.  But for the rest of us, there's this.  This is the Chromebook.  And this has been a ridiculously premium, as always with Google.  This was a thousand dollars starting point.  I love it. It's well worth it.  It's the best Chromebook, but it's just a Chromebook.  But Kevin, scoop is that Acer is coming along with something that might give the Pixelbook  a run for its money.  Tell us about it, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so today Acer actually had their Acer Next event in New York City.  I did not go, but I was able to find some information about six hours before the event  and figure out what they were launching.  And they actually launched four Chromebooks, two or more premium.  And they are the Chromebook Spin 13, which has a fold over display, 360 display, and  the regular clamshell Chromebook 13.  These are the first Chromebooks with the eighth gen Intel Core processors, which is pretty  hot, not as hot as.  Yeah, well, it's not a tank like what you have, but still.  Don't be ashamed, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't be ashamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stand up proud, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And 16 gigs of up to 16 gigs of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, which is Pixelbook territory in terms of specs.  Even the display is 2256 by 1504, which is a little odd, but three by two aspect ratio,  again, like the Pixelbook, has a Wacom stylus digitizer rather with an EMR stylus pen.  So this has potential.  Now the one thing, somebody was a Jeff who just asked how much.  That's the one thing they did not say.  Unfortunately, the spin has no price yet.  The regular clamshell starts at $399, but that is more likely the base model with like  a puny Pentium or a Celeron inside.  So you're going to pay.  I don't know if you'll pay a thousand like a Pixelbook, but you're probably talking  $700, $800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not arm on either of these, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to pay for those CPUs at the very minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And all that.  Especially early in the cycle when they're just being produced and they're a hot commodity,  you know, no pun intended.  A lot of laptop makers want these chips.  So it's a question of who's got enough pull.  And Acer said that I kind of thought this number was low, but it is still a big number.  They said that they have sold more than 10 million Chromebooks and they are among the  tops in terms of sales for Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin, which is the one you wrote about about two weeks ago, that's going to have  the separable screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well that's we don't know who's making it yet.  It's a code name Nocturne and it will have a detachable display just like the HP Chromebook  X2, which should be out June 7th.  What's interesting on that one, Jeff, is that it has Pogo pins just like the iPad, the iPad  Pro.  And that's what Google is using to determine if it's connected to the keyboard.  So my suspicion is based on their code that it may be like a flat keyboard, kind of like  a Surface or iPad keyboard.  Basically it's just a big screen and probably a thin keyboard.  But we'll have to see about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting.  So Kevin, given these that are coming out, we have our Chromebook pixels and we love  them.  Add them all together.  They're about as powerful as Anne's machine, but we're proud of that.  Which one are you on the higher end, on the better end?  Which machine should I be waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a toughie.  I get that question all the time, actually, because I keep finding all these Chromebooks  that are in the works.  And when I find them, it's so early in the process.  They're six to eight months out.  So we know the HP is coming and that starts at $599 and it's detachable, which I really,  really want.  I'm not going to go for it though, because everything, all the cool stuff, the cool kids  are playing on Pixelbooks with Linux apps and Crouton and all that.  So I'm going to stay with Pixelbook for now.  There's another one I found, Jeff, that has a 4K display.  Its code name is Atlas.  And again, detachable.  And I'm wondering if that's going to be a Google update in the fall.  And I probably would wait for a Google Chromebook device because, again, that's what they develop  all the fun toys for.  So that's me.  I mean, if you're not going to get into the tinkering and the Linux and all that, the  HP might do it for you.  That's coming next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I were going to recommend a machine to a colleague and make sure that they weren't  going to whine to me about having too many tabs open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's so many good choices out there.  The whole tab thing, just make sure you have at least four, if not eight gig of RAM.  And if you can go with at least a core i3 processor, that should keep them happy for  a long time.  I mean, that wouldn't render 10 seconds of ants videos, but hey, it'll keep them happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the story with Crostini?  This is the technology that's going to allow us to run Linux apps on the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, still in the works.  And Google did announce it at I.O., obviously.  In fact, that was the show I was on last when we talked about it.  They're making changes on a daily basis, trying to make it more stable, more secure.  I've even found out that they are looking to bring it to old Chromebooks because it's  really not about the hardware that much.  It's not performance.  Yeah.  No, it's the Linux kernel.  Yeah.  Because they're working with Linux 4.4 on all the supported devices.  Now what they're doing is they're trying to backport some of the Linux modules to Linux  3.1 devices.  So anything you bought maybe two years ago in terms of Chromebook might be on Linux 3.x.  Maybe you'll be able to get Crostini on that.  They're really trying.  I don't know if they'll succeed, but they're really trying to make it as widespread as  possible.  And we've already seen them try and it took a long time for Android apps.  And there's still a lot of devices that don't support the Google Play Store.  So some are skeptical of all this whole Crostini stuff.  And I get that.  But, you know, we'll see.  They're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin, I don't know if we've discussed this.  If we did stop me.  But there is.  There's nothing we've had so much to say in life.  That's it.  There's various Android apps that just aren't working well for me on the Chromebook.  Start with Skype.  It just feels like it's going through 25 layers and it's not working well.  Whereas Skype on my Android tablet is good.  Same with Netflix.  Same with Showtime to Go.  These apps just are flaky.  Is that your experience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, to be honest, Jeff, the apps that I use for Android on my Pixelbook aren't streaming  or media apps.  I tend to just use the browser for those.  I can only give you a guess on what the issue may or may not be here.  These may have something to do with the fact that Android is running in a container just  like Linux is for Crostini.  And I know with Linux, they don't support hardware acceleration yet.  They don't even support sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they announced they're going to have GPU support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to have it, but they don't yet.  And I wonder, because they're trying to leverage the hardware outside of the Android container,  I'm wondering if they're having issues.  Not they, but the apps are passing through to make what needs to happen happen.  You're not the first person to tell me this with these particular apps.  And I actually have passed that on to some of my former teammates over at Google.  I didn't get a response yet, but you know, at least they took it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I met the head of Chrome at IO, I of course took the opportunity to be self-centered  and tell him this.  He said he was surprised because he said that Netflix is a huge download, one of the leading  downloads for Android on Chrome.  But boy, mine is just like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is, Kevin, my sense, I may be misunderstanding this, is that the Android isn't running.  Is it just running as a container or is it running in emulation?  It's running in a container.  Okay, it's not an emulation.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is leveraging the container technology they use for Android.  It's not the exact same, but I think it's LXC and LXD in Linux.  And I'm not a huge knowledgeable person about Linux, but my understanding that's the container  technology they're using, which has been around in Linux for a while.  I'm also wondering if, and it shouldn't matter, but I'm wondering if because we have Intel  powered devices, maybe some of the ARM Chromebooks aren't having these problems.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would think it would be, yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah, okay.  So because the nice thing about running Linux on a Chromebook is that a Chromebook essentially  is Chrome OS is Linux.  So it's not, it doesn't really have to in any way translate calls or anything.  It's Linux.  Which is in theory Linux, but it's not a Linux kernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you played with Christina yet, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, every day.  I actually was going to use the Pixelbook for Skype on Christina on the Pixelbook today  for this, but I found out I couldn't hear anything on a Skype call.  So I'm like, well, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on Chrome OS developer channel now, right?  Right.  Dev 68, channel 68.  Which means it's probably fairly close to coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be.  I've got a new update for Chrome OS just today, I believe, and I don't think it's in there  yet.  I think Google had said maybe July, August.  I think they're kind of over-promising, I'm sorry, under-promising and over-delivering  here.  I think they want to push it out earlier just based on the schedule, but they're saying  July or August.  And they, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you have to turn off security on a Chromebook to run the dev channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's the beautiful part of all of this with Christina, because with Kruton, you did  have to be in developer mode.  So you're basically opening up some security potential issues there.  This you just use the regular non-developer mode standard Chromebook dev channel.  So there's no security issues.  You can't even really pass easily pass data from the Linux container to the Chrome OS  system.  However, you can mount your files app in Chrome OS to the Linux container folders through  secure shell.  So that's how they're keeping the security of the data passing between the two systems,  so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it in the settings?  I could just turn on, go into the dev channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you go into the dev channel in settings, and then you'll see a new setting in the apps,  I'm sorry, setting for enabling Linux beta.  And you might have a bit of a tough time, but I can send you some instructions.  I can figure it out.  No, no, I can.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't.  It's on my site, Jeff.  You can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You shouldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember trying to get me working, Leo.  You had to talk me through stuff on the show line by line.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in the settings, if you look at about Chrome OS, you can see that you can get in a different  channel stable beta or developer unstable.  So you have to go to developer for this.  Correct.  Yeah.  Warning, warning.  You're switching to developer channel.  Bill Robinson.  Contains features that are in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You won't lose data by going down, but when you go back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to rebuild it or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but when you go back up to beta or stable, it's going to power wash and wipe your data  just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine.  Cool.  So that was that easy.  Under build information, detailed build information, you just change it.  Now it's updating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll see it.  Yeah.  Once it's done updating and you click the top left settings, you'll see you'll have  a new option for Linux enable.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen that on your on your site.  Yep.  Yep.  Wow.  Very exciting.  So new Chromebooks Acer just announced looks like very, at least the mid range ones that  we've been asking for it because there have been, you know, the high end and the low end  have been well represented by Google and everybody else respectively.  It's nice to have something in the mid range.  Acer has done some nice full aluminum body mid range already.  In fact, I think they're making some of the nicest Chromebooks.  So I'm glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always want to support these things, but it's tough because I spend so much time editing,  you know, I have to spend my time editing and being productive.  And yeah, I could run Lightroom on the website, what have you, or in some instances run the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android version.  But yeah, that's not going to do what you need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I need Photoshop to, you know, I got to have Photoshop for certain projects, especially  if I'm out doing, say, a headshot shoot or something like that.  I need that productivity.  And all of these specs from these Chromebooks are just on it.  They're great.  But the back of my mind is like, you'll never have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your kids might have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would it take to make cloud based editing like you do possible?  What's the speed necessary?  What's the processor?  What's the memory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's processing and processing.  And even I want to say there was one app out there that tried to give you cloud video editing  where you sent up your your your edits to the cloud and it came back down and that just  took forever.  And I did whatever I wanted it to do, but it was so slow because of the sinking back  and forth.  You know, a five minute HD video could be, you know, almost a gig in size.  But I thought that the back and forth.  And you try to render that back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just takes too long.  But does it have to go back and forth?  If you upload the entire video to online and all of the processing happens up in the cloud  and all you're doing is seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to interact with it, Jeff.  So you could, you know, what they could do is have a low quality version locally that  you do edit an edit list on something like that.  If you had enough bandwidth, I think it would it's doable, especially if you have the servers  could be very, very powerful.  You could use, you know, Google's cloud stuff to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had the bandwidth that that would be the only thing.  You know, when I was trying to find these files that you're working with.  Again, like I said, a five minute HD video could be a gig at minimum, depending on your  effects and your other audio editing and things like that.  You know, and that's that's just for five minutes.  And my videos are always longer than five minutes.  I'm pretty long winded when it comes to my videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no reason to jump through hoops like this either.  I mean, we you have hardware, local hardware that can do it.  That's a perfectly reasonable thing.  You've got to use the tool that's right for the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I just want for things like students to be able to edit video without  the expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wish there was a better relationship between the folks at Google Alphabet and the  likes of Adobe or even whoever else is out there creating these different nonlinear editors  and photo editors, because the need is there.  But I just can't buy in until I have something proven that's going to allow me to go to a  client and do what I need to do right there without running through proxies and jumping  through all these hoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like Adobe is working on this.  They're moving more and more to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're trying. But even with like I said, even with the Lightroom, Lightroom, mobile  or Lightroom CC, whatever it's called.  Yeah, creative time to time.  But it ain't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you don't like you're still with classic.  Yeah, I still go back to the class.  Yeah, I keep going back to the classic, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could reload into that big old barrel that's sitting next to you there.  And but I mean, it's probably not.  I've done that.  Really?  You could do that with a Chromebook.  But if it's not, as Leo said, I agree 100 percent.  You got to use the best tool for the task.  And if Chromebook is not your thing for your tasks and you shouldn't buy Chromebook without  a doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's nice to have a Chromebook to back there in the corner somewhere.  I have one of the Toshiba Chromebook twos and I love that will not do it for you.  No.  And it was but it was fast.  It was fast for just general regular people use.  You know, if you want to browse the web, you want to watch Netflix or whatever.  If I wanted to write an article, that thing was great.  But if I wanted to edit some raw files, there are a couple of apps out there.  But it still it took a little work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But will we will will the trajectory get us to a point where, you know, again, not you,  but you win three sixty.  Half hour video, but for users and students and families to be able to edit video  effectively on the on the cloud.  Is there is there a point in time we're going to get there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish I knew I would have assumed it was around the corner because there are so many  there's a couple of different apps on mobile devices that allow you to do video  editing and photo editing at a decent scale.  But people do it on iPads all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is one place where Apple has a pretty good advantage in schools.  You can do all of that in iPads.  You can shoot the movie on an iPad.  You can edit it.  You can I mean, you can do it all on an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a handful of apps out there, a handful, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not for you can't do what you're doing.  So professional productions can always I think this is just I mean, you're not going to  make an album. You're not going to edit a video.  You're not going to launch rockets on a Chromebook for those kinds of professional uses.  You're going to have heavy duty computers. Why shouldn't you?  But I think what, Jeff, I think what you're asking is there is a segment, the education  segment, where they would like to be able to do this kind of stuff.  Yes, I think we can.  Right. I think they can.  They can do it on an iPad.  They can't do it on a Chromebook yet.  And that's that's a that's a failing on Google's part.  I think it was part. OK.  Apple's really put a lot of effort into making sure that it has every every iPad comes with  iMovie. Come, you know, it comes with all the I work suite.  It comes, you know, they've got built in camera.  It's it's kind of made to do that.  And that's one of the things Apple shows schools all the time.  And I and I know, in fact, you know, our kid who has an eye had an iPad in sixth grade,  that's what they were doing is making movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does Google just believe in the cloud too much that I don't want it, that it doesn't  want to do things locally. It only wants to do cloud.  That's the that's the gating factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question, because, again, you have people like Acer that are putting these  products out here year after year that are clearly capable.  But there's there's nothing being done about it from the software standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, Apple kind of benefited from the fact that Adobe screwed Steve Jobs  and Steve was furious and said, we're going to develop apps and we're going to put Adobe  out of business. And the chief thing they did is acquire Final Cut and make final very  powerful video editing platform and then make it available or something like it available  on all their hardware.  So it's almost a historic accident, a historical accident that Apple has an advantage there.  But they I mean, they clearly do have an advantage there.  And I think that Google could probably should now that I haven't really ever thought of it.  I haven't really ever thought about this, but probably should put some effort into making  a Chromebook, because I think that's one of the things schools want to do.  Yeah, that is what I don't think.  I don't think you're going to be web apps. I think you need that.  That's it's going to be Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's why Android is my prior discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android is not ready for this.  No, if it can't display Netflix well, it can't.  You can't edit Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I have the Dev channel is on here.  And yes, lo and behold, there is a let's see, let's get the glare off that screen.  I don't know. Can you zoom in on that, Josh, a little bit?  It's right here. There it is.  Linux beta.  And I can tap that.  Here we go.  Do it again.  It should install a terminal.  Turn on, it says, OK, terminal.  Oh, so the first thing it does is turn on.  Now, there is it. There was a terminal.  There's crosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's that's pretty bare bones.  This is an actual terminal.  You'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it? The terminal does SSH.  Does it do Mosh?  I have a very nice Mosh extension.  I told you about Mosh.  You did. Yeah, very nice Mosh extension I use in Chrome OS.  So I can in effect, I I I just Mosh into my server at home,  my Debian server at home and use it that way.  But this will actually make these local.  So I guess they'll work offline and stuff.  So so now starting container inside Termina VM.  So Termina is more than a terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Termina is is the actual container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this would be now there are some video editing tools.  There are tools on Linux, but nothing that polished.  This would be a great opportunity.  Google's got some good resources and programs.  What a great opportunity for them to make an open source  classroom quality.  So it doesn't have to be file cut.  It has to be I'm ready video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now. One more thing, far as the education,  this is just something that reminded me of an experience  a couple of weeks ago here in my home.  Something happened on my computer.  I believe it was I was running a Plex server.  And I'm trying to watch it downstairs and it didn't work.  So I needed to have the system reboot.  So I yell upstairs to one of my my boys and say, hey, I said, hey,  I need you to restart the Plex server for me.  And he walks over to the computer and I said, go to the start menu  and I already have it pinned there in the start menu.  He didn't know what a start menu was. Oh, wow.  And it's because they spend so much time in the Chromebook world.  He was like totally beside himself.  Now, granted, he will come to this desk and sit and fire up  a fortnight or whatever, you know, to do what they need to do  for for school or what have you.  But he had no idea about going in and out of the application menu here  and stuff like that or looking at the services, you know, but  they don't teach that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Termina is now installed.  What's the next thing you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next thing you wanted to hit is you want to open up CROSH.  So it's a control alt t, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. There's the old shell.  And then now I cross the type V.M.C.  Let me see. I don't see anything yet. Hold on.  Where's my command line? Yeah, where is your command line?  There it is. Some somewhere off screen. V.M.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Space start space Termina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the virtual machine and Termina is the terminal that's going to start.  Maybe I maybe I'm not really in CROSH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going on? This has to be the best twig ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. V.M.C. start.  I don't know what's going on. Let me try this again.  I mean, my eyes are like wide open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, what's going to happen next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's close this control alt t.  Oh, you know, I wonder if it's because I have Mosh on there or something.  I don't see the that could be.  Let's make it smaller. That doesn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Check and check and see in your your app list if you have a terminal.  It's been flaky lately, but maybe yours will work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is so much fun.  Aren't you glad you watched the show today?  You can search on what is that art canvas in a folder?  Yeah, T.E.R. just restart terminal.  Should I? Yes. Yeah. Terminal. Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't. It's the same problem.  It doesn't. So what was it? Termina start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's V.M.C. story and start terminal. Right.  I think that's virtual machine console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I don't know what's going on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, there you go.  That's why you want to install Linux on your Chromebook.  I'll just keep rebooting until it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be it could be it could be that you have Mosh on there  because I know they're using the secure shell app as a conduit here  between Chrome OS and the Linux container.  So you may want to get the official secure shell.  I'll just take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That could be some extensions on there that are causing problems.  OK, no big deal. I'll keep banging on it.  You see, that's how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  August of twenty twenty twenty three. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We come back lots more to talk about the hydrogen one,  a new Android phone that is wildly ambitious and wildly expensive.  And I want to somebody's going to have to explain to me  what this new YouTube music is and how it's different from Google Play music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And whether it still includes Google Play and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and what what's going on.  Google is so good at confusing people.  And then Jeff will give us his handwritten notes  on Mark Zuckerberg's meeting with the European Parliament.  No, you didn't watch either.  Probably was in the middle of the night. Yeah.  Yeah, we haven't done much Facebook stuff, so we have.  I guess you don't get nervous for him.  I know he's he's got this always seems to like have a thin sheen of sweat.  On him.  I don't know if that's if he's actually sweating or his face is dipped in plastic.  It doesn't it doesn't add to his human, you know, humanity.  Let's put it that way.  All right. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  The folks at Quicken Loans are watching with great interest tonight.  What is a game five of the NBA playoffs, the Cleveland Cavaliers  and the Boston Celtics?  Of course, the Quicken Loans founder,  Dan Gilbert, is is the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers.  He'll be watching with interest.  He's been really instrumental in revitalizing downtown Detroit.  Quicken Loans is amazing company.  Fascinating company, number one lender in the country now,  number one in customer satisfaction eight years in a row.  And they realized something that I think was a kind of an eye opener.  They realized that the way it worked.  Here you are on top.  Everybody loves your stuff.  This is what you look for in a company.  And they said, no, it's not good enough.  The way it works isn't right.  It's it. We think the mortgage experience  needs a client focused technological revolution.  It needs to keep up with the times.  So they reinvented it.  They came up with Rocket Mortgage, an entirely online mortgage  approval process, and they're justifiably proud of this thing.  And they ought to be.  Last time I bought a house four years ago, Lisa and I had to go to a bank.  The guy had a sheaf of papers with all the latest rates.  And he was very proud of his mortgage calculator.  And he licked his fingers and he turned the pages and finally,  finally, you know, we're going, oh, I said, all right, well,  can we have some money for a house?  He said, all right, well, here's the application kid  gives you a stack of papers, go home, do some research.  You got to find your pay stubs and bank statements, all this old stuff.  You got to fill out this long application, send it to them.  And they ask for more stuff and you fax it to them.  It took us two months.  Now, it wouldn't probably take two months for most people for some reason.  It just went on and on and on.  I, I, I, I am so ready for Rocket Mortgage.  The whole thing, as little as 10 minutes, you don't go to a bank.  All you do is you go to rocket mortgage dot com slash twig  on your computer, your tablet, your phone.  So it answered a couple of questions.  You don't even need to do any research.  You already know the answer.  And then because Rocket Mortgage has trusted partners  with all the financial institutions, they can get the information  they need with your permission like that.  They crunch the numbers based on your income, your assets and your credit.  And within 10 minutes, thereabouts,  it'll, they'll analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify  and find one that's just right for you.  And they put a big green button on the phone that you could show the realtor.  We're approved.  It's really simple.  And it's completely transparent.  You'll know exactly what you're getting.  You choose the rate, the term, the down payment.  Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Apply simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently.  To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig,  rocketmortgage.com slash twig, equal housing, lender licensed  in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 30 30.  Couldn't be easier, couldn't be faster.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You got to admire a company that's on top.  It's number one and says, yep, but we can do better.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Oh, I must be on an old page because it says Google's about to launch a Gmail  web redesign. That's old.  That's old. They did it.  It's already done.  Red One, the new Hydrogen One from Red.  We're trying to get one.  If you want to buy one, twelve hundred bucks, or if you want the titanium  edition, sixteen hundred dollars.  This is an Android phone unlike any other.  Five point seven inch display.  Beautiful. That's all metal case.  Yes, not that big, is it?  That's all he says.  And it will be shipped through Verizon or AT&T.  That's a big deal for Red.  That that shows that they've because that was something that other companies  had a hard time doing.  And what they're promising is they're the modules.  So they have these pins at the bottom and they're promising modules.  Somebody like you, I would imagine, would be very interested in all of this  because Red has such a great reputation for 4K and 5K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was interested until I saw sixteen hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's just for titanium.  Twelve hundred bucks for aluminum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can know. But then what do you what will the extra module?  That's a good question. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the chat room knows because they just linked to the Red Lucid 8K camera.  Oh, which I assume you attach the phone to.  I know this phone has some kind of holographic for the type technology  about that. Yeah, I would agree.  We've seen that before.  My guess is it attaches to this even more expensive 8K camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Let me see if I can find to be used as a monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a controller.  That's what I'm thinking.  Somehow it integrates into the Red's the Red system.  Right. So it would make sense if you were all, you know,  if you're Marcus Brownlee and you're all in on red,  it would make sense. I think it makes sense for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Because if all this phone is going to do is is give me  an additional monitor to to see what what my lens is seeing.  He has a gazillion monitors in his little closet right there.  They're all right.  Vivid quality. Right. You know, he's not going to need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, you're overlooking what he's going to get, though.  He's going to get that proprietary HV4 format that is exclusive to red cameras.  So your video is going to be a new format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the here's the pedipixel.  Yeah, right. It's not going to be compressed to crap.  8K 3D camera for 4V holographic photos.  You know you want this, Ant.  I don't even know what it means, but I know you want it.  See, we have a we have a game here on Twig.  Yeah. What should Ant get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we have a game.  We try to get Leo to actually buy something ridiculous and make him spend money.  So I think our game today is trying to get you to order this before the show is over.  No way. We are trying to get this phone for review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not buying it.  So Lucid makes five hundred dollars, 3D VR 180 camera.  So and they're going to work with Red to make this 8K 3D camera  won't be available to the fourth quarter of 2018.  No pricing available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I like the ambition, but  I just don't know that all of that stuff is necessary right now for consumers.  People people barely give a crap about VR.  You know, because it's just not necessarily convenient for people.  You know, so I know what 3D is. What's 4V?  I thought that was the holographic part.  Oh, that's the holographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  4V. They wouldn't let anybody film that  at the when they showed this off, because they said it doesn't translate  well on camera. So nobody was allowed to film the 4V stuff.  So I have not seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a DL Cade's article in DP Review.  I think he's the guy who actually broke this.  So let's give DL a credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, didn't they also mention the potential of being able to add  a image sensor to the back of that phone to where you can put another lens,  put another lens on the back of it.  And I'd be OK with that.  But again, I looked at the bottom line.  It cost me $1200 for the phone.  It's going to cost me X amount of dollars for the image sensor.  And I already have a lens.  So you basically just buying yourself a new camera.  Then why not just buy a new camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why put it in the phone? Yeah, no, I'm with you. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I like red because it's sexy.  But it's just that just doesn't make sense to me. Sexy as hell. Sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not buying a Chromebook.  He's not buying the red. We're trying.  We're failing. We're trying to buy something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the summertime in the south and it's all rain and clouds.  So I'm just going to keep bringing clouds to this episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So YouTube launched.  Or have they launched it? YouTube Music, they launched it, right?  Or no, is it still started going out to early, early people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yesterday. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube Red is going away.  We hardly knew you.  It's being replaced by YouTube Premium.  But if you're already a Google Play subscriber, you've got it, right?  It's the same thing. Yes, you will have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You won't you won't be upcharged or anything. That's correct.  You'll be grandfathered in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you change brands?  Do you no longer use Google Play instead?  You use YouTube. How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to actually keep Google Play Music around.  But you can now, if you're in the early access program,  you can get the YouTube Music app and look at everything there instead.  So you could probably use either or until they retire.  Google Play Music is a little confusing.  And part of it to me is is a branding thing.  They're still just like we talked about at the beginning of the show.  There's a negative connotation in some areas with the word Google.  But everybody seems to love YouTube. Yeah.  You know, I just think that's that's part of the strategy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a soft launch started yesterday.  $10 a month for YouTube Music.  And that service will eventually replace Google Play Music.  It's all going to be YouTube Music.  But if you want the ad free YouTube.  That's going to cost more.  Another $2 a month for YouTube premium.  So $10 for YouTube Music plus $2 for YouTube premium  for ad free YouTube content.  $12 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus the originals, the new YouTube original stuff from Red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube Music removes ads for music videos only.  But not from the rest of YouTube.  Right. YouTube premium at $12  removes ads from everywhere like YouTube Red does.  Now, if you're if you're your grandfather.  OK, this is the chart they had to make.  Your your grandfather.  Yeah, your grandfathered in.  If you have an existing YouTube Red account,  you're going to continue to pay $10 a month.  So there you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No news on family plans.  And that was something that I would need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a problem. Yeah, I pay for the family plan.  Be nice to our grandfather in on that.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Play tweeted me and said with a nice exclamation point,  nothing is changing with Google Play Music exclamation point.  If you have Google Play Music subscription slash family plan,  you'll continue to get its benefits.  Good.  Which means you can keep your health plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can keep your health plan.  Where have we heard and your doctor?  Well, that means because.  That means we still get we get red, too, right?  Don't we? And we get we get that's how I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So we'll get all the paying for red.  Yeah, we pay 15 bucks a month and we get a family plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We get all the music plus YouTube Red.  And we will continue to have that if the tweet is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how I read it.  Thank you, Obama.  That was it was a funny, funny thread.  People jumped on after Google sent that to me because they continued to ask  questions. And then it got to the point where Google's  the Google Play Music Twitter account said, yeah, we appreciate all of the  feedback. Just go ahead and submit your suggestions and stuff through the  feedback captions. And everybody just went nuts.  And it's like, man, we've been doing that for years.  Your feedback does nothing here, you know.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still confused. Of course, I'm going to complain.  So I have  my Google Play stuff is all under my Gmail account,  because that's all I could get at the time.  But my YouTube Red is under my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, we've got to send a G Suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  G Suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I tell you right now, one time my  my card expired and I needed to switch it over to a new card.  And it just totally slipped my mind.  But I went to watch YouTube on the television one day and these ads kept  popping up. Oh, isn't it awful?  It was it was the most annoying.  And I'm like, I know I have read what the heck happened.  And then I checked my email.  Oh, yeah. Update your card.  So it is totally worth.  Oh, yeah. And extra money for me anyway.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm rebooting this to see if I get Linux to go.  All right. So there you go.  We've confused you even further.  Facebook's Android app got a little  little heat.  We talked about this on Security Now yesterday.  Looking for super user permissions.  Facebook's Android app requesting access privileges, including super user  access to a device, which gives it full control over the handheld.  This is something new.  It's probably a bug.  Now, I wouldn't be able to see this.  I think you'd have to be running the software that gives you that gives you  root access, right?  Because I super this super user request, I'm not you're not going to see that.  Grants full access to your device to deny if you're not sure.  It's forever, forever, forever.  OK, that's a bug, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This may be. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So I don't think here's yeah, here's Facebook's response.  A coding error in one of our anti fraud systems  caused a small number of people running the Facebook app  and certain permission management apps on rooted Android phones.  Yeah, you'd have to have a rooted already rooted phone to see a request  for additional access permissions.  We do not need nor do we want those permissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we so you know, this is a case where they make a big deal.  Oh, my God. Facebook's going after your whole phone.  But yeah, they screwed up a few phones, Jeeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, it doesn't affect most people unless you've already rooted your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Phone is rooted.  That's that's the bottom line there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you already you already you already got it.  All right. Good.  That's cleared up.  You can move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ashley defend Facebook there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So did you read any notes about Mark's meeting with the European Parliament?  I saw some one headline said 40 questions  Marks couldn't answer, but said, we'll get back to you.  So he's up to that again.  If the other one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The four people who went after him, the worst, but it also included, oh,  now I've got a senior.  What's the name of the guy who came over who did all the Brexit stuff  who came over and back Trump? Oh, for us, Nigel.  Farage. Farage is there.  This is the hardest part of it.  Farage is there saying Brexit couldn't happen without you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, great. Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With friends like that.  Yeah. Who needs Congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I heard the format of the whole thing was weird.  They basically asked question after question after question for like most of the time  and then said go and he answered the ones he wanted and then he ran out of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's terrible. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He kind of got to pick what he wanted to answer.  What from what I read, I did not see the live stream in all fairness,  but I kept seeing tweets.  There's only seven minutes and he has 50 questions to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's I would just filibuster like crazy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he did because he said, you know, I want to be aware of our time.  I think we only have a few minutes left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So get ready for a digital ad offensive.  You might have already seen them from demand progress,  demanding that the FTC break up Facebook,  that they that Facebook get rid of Instagram,  WhatsApp and Messenger into their own separate apps.  Which what does that do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So each app can do the things this these people make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know I'm unclear.  Maybe they mean spin it off at a separate company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  So each of those.  So there's things they don't like about Facebook.  So Facebook, there's now four companies that do things you don't like.  How does that fix anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're weaker.  They're not they're not they're not all unified under the same roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so so if you're a smaller company, you can do whatever the heck you want.  It's just when you get big. Is that the problem?  Yeah. Now we've now gotten to the essence of it.  Only size is the sin.  Success is the sin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Size. Well, success is size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the issue is that all of that power under one roof is is risky.  You want competition, don't you want competition, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But what I'm saying, what I'm trying to say here is that if Facebook  were alone as Facebook without all the other things, everything  people are complaining about Facebook doing.  Yeah, others would still do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if Facebook could still do.  And I mean, if you really want to make the argument stronger, you could say.  And this historically has never worked.  Just look at the AT&T breakup and Microsoft.  Yeah. Well, they never did break up Microsoft.  They wanted to. They didn't need to. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't it rumored that the the WhatsApp CEO  decided to just go ahead and bow out because of the privacy practices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That were going on the hell out of there.  You know, yeah, they're both gone now.  One of them was calling for people to stop using Facebook.  And then Yan Kum, who is still there, left recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that says a lot right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you have to admit, Jeff, that there is there.  There was a strategic reason for Facebook to acquire those apps  and to take Messenger and spin it out.  But they're not making the main blue app, because then they they occupy  more of your phone surface and they and all the notifications.  And they get more of your eyeballs, they get more of your attention,  they get more of your data.  So they see there's a benefit in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, right, right.  But then then all they're trying to all this organization is trying to do  is just punish them as opposed to identifying a problem and saying,  here's a solution.  I don't hear the problem and I don't see the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's punished them or maybe make them a little less dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, to solve what problem precisely.  And then how does this solve that problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wouldn't you agree that that having the more information  that a single entity has about you, the more effectively  they can target you and abuse your, you know, your privacy and so forth.  So if you were to split that silo, all of that information up into little chunks,  it wouldn't be as bad.  The problem is it's aggregated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A, the organization doesn't really identify the problem.  OK, you've identified a problem.  Too much data about me.  Facebook on its own, without WhatsApp, Instagram and anything else,  would all will still be there.  The complaint would be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so what you're saying is they should go even farther.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm saying that this is just an effort to get attention.  It's never going to happen in this administration.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  And we're giving them what they want right now.  OK, enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like the vorac.  No, yeah, no, that's OK.  We need somebody like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love watching the horns come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New York Times article.  You get them really excited.  Now, Amazon is selling face recognition to the police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a problem. This is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Amazon has for some time now  a service called Recognition with a K,  which is a kind of a Kafka esque name  that uses Amazon's cloud services to do face recognition.  Orlando Police Department of Florida,  Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon have both used it.  On yesterday, the ACLU asked,  along with two dozen civil rights organizations,  asked Amazon to stop selling recognition to law enforcement  because the police could use it for all sorts of nefarious things.  I think this is also what Jeff, I would submit.  This is similar to what you're talking about.  I mean, face recognition can have lots of value.  And the Amazon video showed a lot of I can find missing children and criminals.  They pointed out Disneyland uses it  to find missing kids and does a very effective job of it.  The New York Times also admitted in the same article,  they've used it because it was hard to figure out who was who during the royal wedding.  So they they used it to get, you know, face.  That's Princess Abby.  She's a third generation, fourth removed from the, you know.  And of course, remember, Google, 300 people quit Google  because Google was working on face recognition for the Defense Department,  for drone drones.  So the problem is face recognition has can have both great benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is that we don't trust any institution these days, corporate or government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think for law enforcement, face recognition can be very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also scary.  And and companies, I think, need to have some kind of moral compass  for these decisions. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We talk about this on tomorrow's IIT podcast, because the there was a question  about what data is actually being analyzed here.  And I think the police departments uploaded like mug shots and other data,  other photos they had.  The reason we talk about it in this way is because, you know, you have the ring  neighbors thing going with the doorbell, you know, talking about where they can sell,  not sell, but send information to the police in your area,  or the police can actually request that information.  If you're part of the neighbors program to help with a crime and has to be an open  case file, it can't just be we want to go look through the data.  But my fear is that people just start thinking, well, gee, all the Amazon cameras  and you know, because they have the they own Blink, which is a camera company and so on.  I don't see this being used, at least to my understanding, on that information.  It's not like Amazon is looking at your camera data and trying to recognize things.  Could that happen in the future? Sure.  This happens to be law enforcement and it seems to be a limited set of data.  There's definitely perils here, but I kind of felt it was a little overblown  in terms of what this whole issue was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, listen. So yes, I agree with you.  And this is I think like the last story, throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  But this is here's a success story.  Washington County Sheriff's Office are just outside of Portland, Oregon.  They set up the system for about 400 bucks.  It cost them a few hundred a few dollars a month to run.  One of the first things they did is they fed the recognition system about  300000 images from the county's mugshot database.  Within a week going live, according to the Times, the system was used  to identify and arrest a suspect who stole more than 5000 dollars from local stores.  There were no leads before the system identified them.  But it could also be used to spot troublemakers.  In fact, apparently, I didn't know this, but arenas do this at concerts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arenas are using it to screen for troublemakers at events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Department of Homeland Security uses it to identify foreign visitors  who overstay their visas.  So Madison Square Garden has used face scanning technology on customers.  That's what that camera is on the metal detector.  And when you arrive, you're going to see you in that database and say,  oh, yeah, we had to throw him out last year.  I don't know if I have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have a problem with that?  I'll bet the casinos use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bet you. Oh, now there are some issues, for instance, in the Times talks about this.  These recognition systems have notorious problems with people of color.  An MIT study showed that the gender of darker skin women  was misidentified 35 percent of the time by face recognition software.  And the issue would be in this case, I think the concern would be false positives.  Yeah. So that's that's something to be very aware of.  But I think really what we should I don't know if this is a bad.  I think this is a potentially good technology that could be absolutely misused.  And so there needs to be a lot of oversight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't regulate technology, you regulate the use.  Law enforcement. Yeah. Always say.  Yeah. You know, I spoke to you last week when I was in Toronto for Rights Con,  which is now my favorite conference, which I found out they had in Canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because nobody could get into the United States. Exactly.  And then Canada blocked a lot of attendees.  Oh, I didn't know that. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, next year is in Tunis.  I don't know where it's going to be.  Maybe Moscow. Literally, literally next year.  It's in Tunis. Oh, so why?  But my grand conclusion out of this was I realized that everything  people are screaming, almost everything, people are screaming for Facebook to do  has nothing to do with technology and has everything to do with human behavior.  And and government.  Where do you regulate human behavior?  You regulate human behavior through government or you regulate our norms  through families and churches and schools. Right.  What have we ever said to companies, fix society, change human behavior?  We don't. Right.  But now the the the the alleged problem is of such a scale  that nobody can figure it out. Government can't figure it out.  Government doesn't know how to do its job.  So government outsources this and tells Facebook, solve it  without defining the problem with this previous discussion. Right.  And so the entire discussion of Rights Con was what's called intermediary liability.  Where the intermediaries, the platforms, the phone companies,  even even the the domain registrars  have government coming after them, saying you get them to stop that.  And it's really an abrogation of government's job.  If government was to regulate human behavior, that's their job, not the companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is what we're starting to go to Facebook.  Could government go to Facebook and say, hey, remove the like button  from everybody's post, just flat out remove it, only leave a comment field.  And so we're going to use that as a way to help  clean up and make our society a little bit better,  because there's so much power in that.  Like, you know, can government do that to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because that would be a violation of free speech.  The government can say to Facebook as well.  In Germany, government says to Facebook,  if someone uses hate speech or mentions Nazis or such,  if you don't get rid of it within 24 hours, we will find you 500 million dollars.  Wow. Oh.  So so you have the New York Times had a feature, I think it's on the rundown  from the content killing factory that's in Germany now.  Yes. Where people are there and they're having a look at horrid stuff  to get rid of it, because the government is telling them,  get rid of that piece of content and that piece of content.  And if you don't, if you don't make this judgment,  we're going to come after you big time.  So basically, they get rid of and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm not sure that's really good either.  I don't think it is. I don't know what the answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff related to what you're just talking about,  the whole regulation of behavior. Look at what's going on in China with technology.  They are regulating behavior with the technology now. And that's,  that's where I get scared with this technology,  it being misused or used in a way that I don't want to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely Kevin. And you, when you,  when you open up a function for one's allegedly good government,  that same function is then available to all governments.  And to your point,  and is if, if, if,  if one government demands the ability to change functions on Facebook,  then every government can use that and you can use that in Turkey and Russia  and China. But I take your larger point.  You think the like button is ruin society?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the like button is totally screwing stuff up,  especially in the younger generation.  Because people, they, they,  I just look at teenagers in particular and they'll post something and within five  minutes they're going back to their posts to see how many likes they have,  you know, let alone the fact that, you know,  they got a house on fire behind them or something like that.  They they're worried about how many likes do I have on this particular post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can't make Facebook fix that. I mean, that's a,  that's a societal problem. It's a societal thing. We were at,  we went to a concert on Friday and we were pretty close to the front and there  was a young woman whose father had brought her was cute.  And they were so proud of the fact that they were in the front row there.  And the entire concert,  she's got her phone up and is videoing the concert.  The entire concert blocking my view, by the way, incidentally. And then,  you know, in the middle of songs, the singers on the stage, she's singing there,  she's right there. They're turning around and doing selfies.  And what I finally realized is, you know, nobody's going to look at that video  later. The point of that video,  the point of the selfies is to post that on social networks,  see how great my life is. Yeah.  And it really made me sad that all of this was being viewed through this young  person's desire to, to,  to show off on social media. And she wasn't enjoying the concert.  She wasn't paying attention to the concert. It was all about,  here I am at the concert, look at me. And that's sad to me.  I just felt bad for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And don't get me wrong.  There is a certain aspect of social life of knowing where  your friends and family are and celebrating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it's just gotten too big for that man.  Aren't I, aren't I, look how great my life is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the real problem with that is the other kids who think, well, mine's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. It's all a race.  It's all a race to, to, to cultivate,  to polish your image so that you look better than everybody else. But I,  I don't think, I mean, admittedly, I mean, I, I often write, you know,  rag on Facebook and Twitter cause they've become tools for a lot of bad things,  but it's not really their fault. They're just the tools that the bad thing.  Can we put this in the history book?  The bad things come from people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so, and so what makes us think that these platforms,  A part of the presumption is, well, they made us do it. No,  the technology didn't make us.  It empowered it.  For some, for a certain relatively small number of, of, of, of, of,  of actors who were doing the worst things, right? The haters, the misogynists,  the racist, the fraudsters, the propagandists, the trolls, right?  Cause that's a relatively small number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's to the, what is it? The, the, the brilliant ones.  Sound like a dystopian Apple ad. Here's to the trolls,  the haters.  The misogynists. I'm going to do that. I'm going to make one of those.  That's good. Think different.  So what do we do about it though? That's what that really,  I fundamentally think that that's what all of these conversations come down to.  Yes, we acknowledge, we see this problem. What do we do? And we're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we have to learn to ignore it. I've really,  really coming to believe that the important thing is to pay attention to  quality again.  You know,  I talked about how 20,000 people on Facebook are there to kill SHIT,  30,000 journalists in American newspapers.  What's wrong with that allocation of resources,  no matter where it comes from. And we've got to  just recognize what we're doing is we're giving the bad guys exactly what they  want. Every time we have Joan Donovan on from data and society, you know,  there's a big report. I think I put it on the, on the rundown,  tell it, trying to educate media about not giving the bad  guys the attention that they crave. They're manipulating us at a return.  The more it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the one lesson.  What's the one lesson of the whole internet age? Don't feed the F in trolls.  Yeah. And we're, and we're feeding them with this attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. But they don't go away because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in a sense they do. I mean, in a sense, I mean,  I don't see them in my Facebook feed. Right. I don't, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't either. Cause I killed face. Well, actually I went back.  I had to go back cause I missed the tech TV reunion.  I almost missed it. Cause the only way they told people about it  was on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, gotcha. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not happy about it because I have to say I could, you know,  as, as always, when you stop using a drug and you go back to it,  you can really see the teleterious effect of it.  But what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think all of that stuff can start with, with, with the individuals.  So it starts with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see ignoring, so ignoring, I turn off comments.  We don't use comments on our pages because we got trolled so much.  So is that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, yeah. Good question. Is that how you're letting people? I, I, well,  it's unfortunate,  but at some point if you're not going to have the,  it would take the resources to, um,  to deal with the comments and dealing with them is not ignoring them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dealing with them is feeding them. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At some point it's not worth it. Yeah. I mean, after all that's negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's negative. Uh, that, that, that's feedback too. That's attention.  That's energy. If you, if you'd like, they won, they killed it. Yeah. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but also I'm, I'm,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's an unsatisfactory answer. I mean, I don't, I know,  I don't have a better one, but it's an unsatisfactory answer because it's like  saying, well, if people are burning your house down, just ignore them. Uh,  but they're still burning the house down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's the problem. So Twitter lets you block people, uh,  unless you mute people and they're still, and I find that unsatisfactory.  I agree. But it's the tools we have at the ready and, and,  and the other opportunity is to answer them.  And that's the thing we have given up.  Yeah, that doesn't work too well either.  Cause it doesn't. And it should be,  should have the right to say being a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter finally, uh,  Twitter is getting a lot of heat for updating their API and screwing third  party apps yet again. As usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's business as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a,  it's a platform that's going to be determined that nobody makes any money,  but Twitter. So there really isn't,  it is clear that their goal is that you use Twitter's website, uh, and,  and apps to access Twitter.  I'm right. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I look at, um, what's that one app that I used to love using?  I think it was called Phoenix Twitter app and ended up having to uninstall it.  And when I went back to try to reinstall it later,  the music's, yeah, yeah. And it's because Twitter was like,  yeah, we're only going to play just nice enough with these guys. Sorry.  You missed the boat. You know, and Twitter has every right to do that,  but it's still, I don't think it's, I don't think it's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the icon factory developers tweeting the public pricing I'm seeing shows  Twitter's account activity API pricing.  Cause you have to pay to get the activity API $2,899 a month for 250 users.  That, you know,  that's $10 a user a month to get push notifications on a platform where people  bulk and spending 99 cents says Craig Hockenberry. So, uh,  this is going to be an issue. Uh,  Favstar has shut down, um, cloud shut down. Maybe cloud,  I thought cloud might've shut down cause of GDPR,  but maybe it's cause of this too,  cause they, they won't be able to get that info from Twitter. Um,  how many emails has you brought it up?  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm Twitter. Um, how many emails has you brought it up?  How many damn emails are you getting right now? Cause it's great.  I thought this was CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's worse than CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand, I think it was, are you dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is very similar. Is it, are you dead against GDPR? Jeff? No, dead against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's a badly done law. Dead against them.  We'll see how they implement it. Right. It could. Well,  that's the problem and it's, and it's very difficult. I put on the rundown. Uh,  one, um, I think TV stations somewhere in the U S, uh,  somebody from Oxford went in to try to just find some story that was going on.  And don't, sorry, you're from the EU. We're blocking you.  Because we don't want to take any chances and it would take me 4% of our revenue  and we're not doing it. So sorry until we can throw this straight out,  you ain't coming here. I think that's a good, uh, strategy.  It's an unintended consequence of that. Yeah, it is. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if everybody did that, that'd be a, that'd kind of be the  death knell for GDPR. It's a, it's in the rundown somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People like WordPress and, and square square space there,  they're probably going to make out okay on this because individuals that are  out there trying to run their own websites and whatnot.  It's a whole lot of. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's a very good point. If you rely on these companies to,  to do the work, you don't have to. That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All these laws that are aimed at making the big platforms less powerful,  make them more powerful, right? To be forgotten makes Google more powerful.  That's right. GDPR is going to make Google and Twitter and Facebook more  powerful. Is that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't think about it that way. That is a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what you said, Ant. He is a small business owner. You just can't do it.  Right. They do have the resources to do it. They'll, they'll manage it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of what Ben Thompson's been saying.  Congress is mulling an extension to the copyright act  to 144 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are getting older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It used to be called the sunny Bono copyright act.  I think now we call it the Mickey Mouse copyright act because it all comes down  to the Mickey Mouse copyright. Mickey Mouse was created at night.  There's a great chart here. Let me see if I can find it.  Mickey Mouse was created in 1923 and  the copyright law began to see the changes as this Disney corporation  faced the deadline and they extended it each time.  So in the original copyright act in 1790,  your copyright was for 28 years,  extended a little bit later in 1831 to 42 years.  Mickey Mouse was created in 1928. At that time,  the copyright was for 55 years. So interestingly enough,  55 years after Mickey Mouse was created,  Mickey Mouse actually was 50 years, 51 years, just in time.  The copyright was extended from 1984.  His copyright was extended from 1984 to 2003.  Then in 1998, it was extended to 2023.  So right now the Mickey Mouse copyright runs out in 2023 already,  just to be proactive, to get on top of it.  The Congress is looking at extending it out to,  it's now currently a 103 years, something 105 years to 140 years.  And it's all because of Disney not wanting to lose the copyright to Mickey  Mouse.  And Lawrence Lessig has tried to.  Oh yeah. Larry hates it. He's, he tried to change it.  He tried to do everything. Yeah. He finally gave, it was interesting.  Lessig, who's a constitutional lawyer, he's at Harvard and a great man,  creative creative commons. He's been on Twitter a number of times.  He was on Twitter a lot in the early days. Larry eventually gave up.  He was trying to fix this and eventually realized I can't fix this as long as  campaign finance laws are as they are,  because ultimately the votes go to the guy with the biggest deepest pockets.  So he's changed his tack. He tried to do this in the last election.  He ran for president to get rid of, to change campaign finance,  to reform this. And his plan was I'll get,  elect me president since no incumbent will change,  will reform campaign finance. Elect me president.  I will reform campaign finance.  I'll pick a really good vice president and then resign and let that person run  it. I don't want the job. He's saying,  I just want to be the guy who fixes campaign finance.  Takes the big money out of politics. Unfortunately,  he didn't even have a chance. I don't think he made it to the debates.  Speaking of politics, you see who's working for Netflix.  Who? Michelle and Barack Obama.  Oh, signed a deal to produce programming for Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's lots and lots of hate and boycott.  Really? Really? Really? They're coming out of the woodwork, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man. And woodwork is where they belong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wonder how much we in media

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  amplified it. Yeah.  It might've just been a hundred tweets and a hundred tweets looks like a lot.  I, you know. Yeah. Yeah. True. True.  So they're going to do, I guess,  I gather documentary programming.  Obama's a scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series,  documentaries and features.  What this release from Netflix tells me is they had,  no one knows what they're going to do, but we got them. We got the name.  We got them. And that's what matters. We got them. That's funny.  That's funny. I think, you know,  this is the new second act going to work for Facebook. I mean, the Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's, I think, uh, well, when, when Trump's out of office,  he'll go to work for Twitter.  Twitter. He oughta. He oughta. He oughta.  Who was one of the earliest, uh, what was his name? Uh, which one,  which one was it? The earliest celebrities on Twitter?  Ashton Kutcher insisted that Twitter owed him a fortune because he made them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I had somewhere, uh,  Kevin Rose was on the new screensavers a couple of weeks ago.  And in the early days of Twitter in 2007, Kevin and I were in a race.  I was number one on Twitter with 30,000 followers and he was slowly coming up.  Number two, I was number one. Barack Obama was a candidate,  but not president yet was number two. Kevin Rose was number three.  Eventually,  Kevin Rose beat me and Barack and I can call him Barack cause we're Twitter  buddies. And, uh,  but then none of it mattered because along comes Ashton Kutcher.  And then that was all over.  He was the first to a million, I think.  Oops.  The city of Lake Worth, Florida sent out a zombie alert  Florida, man, about one 45 in the morning on Sunday,  uh, projected repair time, power outage and zombie alert for residents of Lake  Worth and terminus.  There are now far less than 7,380 customers involved due to extreme zombie activity  restoration time. Uncertain.  Uh, terminus is a city in the walking dead. So  who lost their job after this?  It was intentional. Power was out for 27 minutes, but, uh,  and Ben Kerr who is the city's public information officer said,  I want to reiterate Lake Worth does not have any zombie activity currently.  And I apologize for the system message. We're,  we're looking into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like how you put that qualify in there currently.  Currently as far as we can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to, you got to be on the couch that and you know, you,  you don't want to be right. Allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Allegedly is good. Yeah. According to sources. All right.  Somebody stuck this in. I don't know who did. Um,  this is our video of the week.  It is the queen at the real wedding sitting next to  she wore a green spring. Oh, she wore green. It was a green dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, those of you who could only hear the green dress being used with all these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wonderful graphics behind. It's a light show.  I love that. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The queen is so bad. Why is it though? By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to point this out and I don't think it's anything that I do.  Every time I play a video on YouTube, I get recommendations.  You can show this for bikini rich content. Is it just me?  Well, I just watched a video about the queen of the queen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be honest with you Mr. Laporte when I'm not signed in to my YouTube and I  actually just go there to browse something. It does the same thing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it has nothing to do with anybody. It's just, they just know the algorithm knows.  That's what people really want. That was a nice cover for a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. And thank you. And if I'm trying to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get those recommendations,  but I have noticed a lot of sports illustrated swimsuit issues popping up on my  screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reminds me of the first podcast expo I went to. Somebody came up to me,  said, I got a brilliant idea. You guys really got to get into this. I said,  what he said, three words, bikini rich content.  Plastics. Plastics. All right. Let's, uh,  we get it's time to wrap this up. We've been going for a while.  And I'm at the end of the rundown. Uh, unless some,  somebody has something they want to stick in here.  No, we did Chromebooks. What more do you need?  So I'm going to do is we do this every week.  We give you a chance to pick something or talk about something. Anybody,  Ant, do you want to start it off? You got to pick of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, sure. Normally, you know,  I'll come on here and I'll plug my YouTube channel and, and,  and stuff like that. But I want to plug tech Republic, first of all.  But secondly,  some people may not realize that May is the mental awareness month.  And I just want to reach out to everybody here on the Twitter network,  that's watching it and just say, Hey, take, take some time and, and  be aware of the mental awareness month. And,  and if you know someone that's dealing with it and having issues with it,  try to help them get some help.  This is something very near and dear to my heart. And it's, you know, I'm,  I have no problem going public with it and stating that Mrs. Pruitt,  she suffers from major depression, depressive disorder.  And, um,  and it's a battle at times. And, um, but she's,  but she's strong and she's fighting and she does everything she does.  She can do, and she has your support to herself. Right.  And she's been doing everything that she can this month to try to help raise  awareness for this disease. So just take five seconds  if you can. And just, just, not, don't brush this stuff off. You know,  just the other day there was a, an accident here in my town,  and it ended up being because of a mental disorder. Uh,  gentlemen was having dinner with his family, Sunday dinner with his family,  and the restaurant,  he gets up and leaves from the table because he has anxiety issues.  And he gets in his vehicle and drives into the restaurant  and, and heard a lot of people including killing his family.  And it's, and it's because he has a mental disorder.  So folks please take a moment and,  and just recognize the fact that mental disorders are real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's an illness and it's an illness. And thank you for sharing that.  And cause I think one of the things that happens is so stigmatized, uh,  that people don't talk about it, uh, in their lives.  And the truth is once people talk about it, everybody has an experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody has that exactly. There has some, some, something. And have you,  do you go to VidCon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Haven't been to VidCon yet.  I, I, where do you live?  I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Well it's a little closer than I am in New York. I recommend it.  I think it's, I think it's an amazing conference, but,  but the best thing that I ever do at VidCon every year,  they have usually two mental health panels where YouTubers who have bravely,  just as you did,  bravely talked on YouTube about their own or their loved ones,  depression or anxiety or addiction or eating disorder.  And they've already done that to the world on YouTube, but they,  they're on stage with a therapist on stage. Uh, Katie Martin,  I think, right. I'm forgetting her name suddenly. Um,  and then in the room are 300, 400, mainly young people,  mostly young women who share that.  And the empathy is incredible and the value of  sharing and being open and helping somebody else is just so apparent in that  room. So thank you for bringing this up. You're absolutely right.  We all know someone who needs that support and needs that help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  Curestigma.org if you, I mean,  the stigma is the thing I think that really, really hurts cause it's an illness.  We don't talk about it. We don't talk about it.  We treat it as something other than an illness. Uh, and you know,  if somebody's sick, uh, you get treatment, you get help. Uh, you know,  people understand it. There's sympathy,  but mental illness is often treated as something,  some sort of a moral deficiency and it's not, it's just a physical illness.  It's chemical.  It's chemical and it's a physical illness like cancer or anything else.  And, uh, there should not be a stigma. And I think if we get rid of the stigma,  I think people can, uh, can, can seek help, uh,  and will not live in, um, in darkness. And, uh, yeah,  boy I'm glad you brought that up. Curestigma.org is a good place to start.  Um, Mr. Kevin Toffle, your selection of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I can't follow that up with a lame Chrome OS, uh, web extension.  Oh, sure. You can. I can't, I can't. I'm going to say something.  And I'm not saying it as out of sympathy. I'm thrilled that aunt brought this up.  Um, I folks don't probably know this. I lost my father to, uh,  suicide, uh, through depression in 2009.  And I've actually been on depression medication since 2011 and it is a struggle  every day. And again, I'm not saying this for sympathy. This is my fight.  And I fight it every day. And, uh, you're right, Leo,  the stigma has to go away. This is an illness. And you know,  everybody's mind works differently and everybody has to deal with things in  different ways and, uh, just be there for people, support people.  And thank you so much for bringing this up. I really appreciate it.  It was perfect timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you Kevin. That's, that's, that's generous to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is what it is. It's reality, Jeff. And I don't shy away.  I never have shied away from reality. Not in my writing, not on video. And, uh,  you know, there was just never an opportunity to say, Hey,  let me talk about this. So here it was. I took it.  And I hope people really do take it to heart and not just this month,  but all the time. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, you got a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have five depressed relatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  That's a good night.  Yeah. Let me first plug, uh, since we're on, uh, uh, uh,  disturbing things, uh, data and society, our friend, Joan Donovan, uh, who,  who tweeted me, she loved last week's show. Um, data society,  which watches out for manipulation and media has a new report out, uh,  called the oxygen of amplification by Whitney Phillips, uh,  which is about, um,  how media, uh, spread these things. And, and,  and there's a precedent for media watching what it says, which is,  which is suicide. Um, that the,  norm in journalism is to report the fact,  but not the means because there are copycats,  there are people who get inspired and it doesn't accomplish anything.  It's a lesson we haven't learned when it comes to mass killers.  And it's a lesson we haven't learned when it comes to propaganda manipulation  and trolls. Uh, so this is an important report and I, and I recommend it. Um,  but then I'll give you a real number, which is that Starbucks, surprisingly,  wins the mobile payment Derby. Uh,  more people are using Starbucks mobile payment than Apple pay Google pay or  Samsung pay. Guess why? Because Starbucks comes with caffeine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the greatest legal addictive drug in science and history.  Why didn't I think of that 20 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I need to start up a third wave coffee shop here and put some mobile  payments behind it. And I'm going to be a very rich man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. My recommendation. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was just saying, and go Bitcoin, really Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use that monster machine behind you to mine a lot of them.  Yes, I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bitcoin coffee shop. That's a good idea. Uh,  I want to just put in a plug for something that we installed at Google IO,  a lot of us. Uh, and if you have been afraid, I just want to say,  do it in that's Android P. Uh, it's, uh, now not every phone can do it,  but if you have one of the phones that can,  and it's really a large number including the essential phone, of course,  the pixels, the Nokia seven, the one plus six, the oppo, the Sony, uh,  Vivo and Xiaomi, uh, P is awesome and it's ready. I mean,  I have not had any problems with it. It works really beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A few minor bugs. Yeah. I mean, I had one hard,  show me all my apps and then it did. When I click on some notifications,  it doesn't really go to the notification. These are minor as can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the new UI, this slidey UI is awesome. It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was going to be sticking my tongue out, trying to figure out,  how do I do that? But it's, uh, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, if you've, if you've been putting it off, uh,  I think it's a fair thing to do. If your phone supports it,  I'm using it on a pixel two XL and I, and I wouldn't even, I wouldn't go back.  It's just really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have a switched launchers again. You're sticking with the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sticking with the pixel launcher, which is a statement.  Cause I've been using it for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  progress for Leo. Yeah, that's a good sign. Well, it just means, you know,  quickly, can you quickly access the camera with the whole double click on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question. That's important.  Yeah. You could, you could with the, uh, yes, you can. Okay. All right.  Well I'll give it a run. So that's, you know, that's a,  I don't know if that's a Android feature as much as a pixel feature, but, um,  it's that's a very nice feature. I agree. Yeah.  You want to get right to the camera. Do you use a pixel too?  I have a pixel two XL, sir. Such a nice camera. Oh, love it.  It makes me wonder why I bring other cameras with me. It's such, it's,  you know, I have to, but it's just, I feel like, wow, I could probably do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've done, um,  photos with it and have sold images that were shot with the pixel.  I even did a headshot session with a pixel for a client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's the real problem is the clients clients go, what? You're not,  you're not going to bring it. What did your client think of that? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he loved it. Really? Really? I'm shocked. I come in there,  I had my camera and I had my tripod and lights and all of that.  And I snapped a few with the camera, but then I said, you know what,  I'm going to also use this camera to this phone to do some of your shots as  well. And I got a hunch you're going to like these just as much. And he did.  And sure enough, the one that's been published everywhere is from that pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, uh, when we were in Japan a couple of weeks ago, I,  I used the pixel a lot. This is a photosphere that I created with the pixel.  It's a very famous Japanese garden.  And I have to say, I think the quality and the fact that I could do a photosphere  with it for one thing, uh, and the quality of it made this the camera to use,  you know, for, for this place,  it was very easy to quickly shoot this photosphere with it.  I just don't carry your big heavy hammer. I did. I did.  And I took a lot of pictures with it, but I, you know,  I find that many of the pictures I look at again and again came from the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  too. Kevin, what do you carry these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was funny you ask. I actually was, um,  just thinking back to the last time I carried a DSLR,  which was probably CES a couple of years back. I just carry phones now.  And I do a wheel between iOS and Android.  So I have a, an old pixel XL and an iPhone 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I had to go on an iPhone pictures as well,  but I have to say that just as I'm slightly in favor of the,  of the pixel too, of the, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great camera. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Okay. Don't buy. Now you know, it's the end of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't buy underwear on Instagram in the middle of the night.  So this is one of the hazards of late night surfing.  Instagram ads seem somehow magically. I buy the stupidest things.  So I saw this ad for underwear. It's made out of eucalyptus trees.  No, you didn't. You didn't.  It's very nice and soft and stretchy. Okay. It looks really comfortable.  So I bought five pairs, $20 each. Yeah, I know.  I know it was the middle of the night. I don't know. I was,  you have a very precious junk there. I do. I want to, you know,  only the best for your family jewels must be encased in velvet.  But I opened the box and it says, be sure, like a big thing,  be sure to read the care instructions before you wash your  underwear. I thought, Oh God, what does this mean? You can all,  maybe it's cause it's made out of eucalyptus tree. I don't know,  but you can only wash it on the delicate cycle and cool water and cool  dry. It's like, well, that's no good. That's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll be right back. Let me go get that bag of magic beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just buy an Instagram ad. I'll be there, baby.  I don't even want to tell you what I bought last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you buy a bunch of Capitola Monte on QVC back in the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was never, I would never fell for the shopping TV,  but there's something about those Instagram ads. They're really work.  Don't they? Am I wrong? Am I the only one who does that?  Yes, they are.  You're the only one who does.  Really?  Evan, do you have eucalyptus underwear? Ed,
