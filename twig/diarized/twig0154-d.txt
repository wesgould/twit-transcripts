Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So happy to be here.  To be back after the July 4th holiday.  I can't wait to talk about the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you have right there in your hot little hand?  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll talk about it.  I'm excited.  We didn't get to talk about it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're making Jeff Jarvis jealous.  Very, very jealous.  From BuzzMachine.com.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am so happy to be back, my friends.  Two weeks without Twig is like a half a month without sunshine.  Wow, I feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was an eternity.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look who else is here.  And guess what he brought.  Jeremiah O'Yang is here.  Hey guys.  Nice to be back.  Analyst from WebStrategist.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I brought my Google Glass.  We'll talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm 747.  I got you big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I brought the Google Pokemon ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the Chrome box, the Chromebook.  And it looks like you might have a Nexus 7 somewhere in that stack of tablets over there.  We got a couple of toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will talk a little bit about the hardware from Google I.O.  We kind of did a quick review on Before You Buy.  On this show, we haven't had a chance to talk about it at all.  Quick promo.  Quick promo.  Later today, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.  Nolan Bushnell will be our guest on Triangulation.  The man who created Atari and Chuck E. Cheese pizza time theater.  I guess we should start with the stuff.  The swag pile.  I did a little calculation.  $1,125 worth of stuff at Google I.O.  It included.  Well, it's a net loss, though, if you bought the glasses.  So it included a Google Nexus phone.  That's nice.  Do you have your Nexus?  No, I didn't bring that.  We've seen it.  It came out in November.  A Nexus 7 tablet.  Got that right there.  It included a Q, $300 Q.  And the orb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or a bocce ball, whatever you'd like to do with it.  It's heavy.  It's very heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then we have the Samsung Chrome box, which is, of course,  basically a Mac mini, but it runs Chrome OS.  So that's $1,125 worth of stuff.  But then if you queued up, as apparently you did, to buy the Google glasses,  which will be delivered next year, you get this.  A solid piece of glass.  There's no AR in it.  That's it.  Where's mine?  Where do we put it?  What was Scoble's number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did tweet it was sub 200, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had to get in line, right, Gina, to get it and all that?  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And in fact, I didn't even get one of those.  I didn't even get a number.  I was so late, and it was kind of like the last day,  and I kind of go back on back and forth about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you did put down $1,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  I pre-ordered.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, we don't have to pay until they actually deliver these.  Right.  But I didn't get one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't even know what number it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the new geek status symbol, isn't it, Jeremiah?  What's your number?  What are you trying to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just trying to say that I'm a 200 better than you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Forget clout.  What's your glass number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your glass number?  Forget your clout number.  What's your glass number?  So actually, this really is the fool index, because $1,500,  that's a lot for a product that doesn't even exist.  Right.  Who needs that much money for the product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The case how fast you ran to spend $1,500 on a prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a sucker we are.  The lower the number, the bigger the sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  Surprisingly, I haven't seen any Google Glass on eBay yet.  I keep on watching every week to see who's going to put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you could sell your number, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could probably sell the product.  You bought it, right?  I didn't read the terms of service that way.  I haven't seen the terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is we do want to be able to review it for this week on Google.  I'm sure you want to review it.  Yeah, someone asked how I justified it to my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a part of my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Gina and I are going to conspire about that later.  Yes, we are.  I'm going to live vicariously through Gina and use my foundation money to do it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I love this because Jeremiah is wearing a Google Buzz shirt.  Was Buzz killed?  Who killed the Buzz?  Who killed the Buzz?  If I go to buzz.google.com...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure it has been retired probably over a year before Google Plus was launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, look, I'm getting a answer.py script.  A sure sign that something's dead.  So Buzz has been replaced by Plus.  iGoogle is going away.  That kind of surprised me, but I guess nobody does.  I never liked it much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so Yahoo-y.  Well, it was a portal, right?  It was a portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a poor man's feed reader, right?  No, not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's my iGoogle.  What page?  See, you can put these little widgets on here.  I've got the weather.  I've got my Google Calendar.  A little Wolfram Alpha search.  I've got stock markets.  I've got maps.  And yes, here's the reader part.  But I also loved this, the how-to.  So these are all little modules that you can put in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should have been an Android page on the web.  Well, this is what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This technology is very 2007.  It's my Yahoo.  It's what my Yahoo was.  It was my Yahoo, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Back in 2006, lifehacker readers loved iGoogle.  There was another one, Net Vibes, that was really popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love Net Vibes. Is that still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, people just don't surf the web this way anymore.  You didn't love it that much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because we've changed now.  We don't look at these smorgasbord.  We consume things through feeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's the problem.  You're calling it a smorgasbord.  I call it a dashboard. That's hip.  Dashboard is hip.  Dashboard is like Perry's smorgie.  $9.99, all you can eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know we'll get to this later,  but I was really, really struck by the iPad version of Google Plus  and how different it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so gorgeous.  Actually, I'm having people get me things today.  Could you get me my iPad?  Because I do want to show people this.  This is quite gorgeous.  So Google shutdowns. This is the Larry Page tsunami.  iGoogle. Google video.  I Google, by the way, in November.  Google video. They've been warning me about this for a while,  saying, you have videos. Would you please move them over?  What's Google Mini? I don't even know what Google Mini is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't that the box? Wasn't that the search appliance?  Oh, it was the search appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have another search appliance, so that's not a big deal.  Presumably, you're using the other search appliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is all normal in a company that's constantly innovating  and changing things.  They try things out in the 20 to 30% of the R&D time.  They shut them down if it doesn't work.  I think that's actually a brilliant model rather than forcing it.  But I get these cool shirts.  They're on the third iteration of social now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it makes that shirt so much more valuable that it's a Google...  Do you want to buy it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where did you get Google Buzz shirt?  I'll trade you numbers. I don't know.  I probably got it at one of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute. If I gave you my number for your number,  my lower number, would you give me that shirt?  Not on air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not wearing anything underneath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not giving you my Tech TV shirt, because that's even more obsolete.  Yeah, I agree, Jeremiah. You shut things down.  We do it here. We cancel shows after a while, and we bring in new shows.  That's just part of... It's called being a good gardener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I wonder which one of these hardware devices are going to get shut down here.  Okay. Let's get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Gina, we've got a Chrome box, but let's say Chrome OS.  We've got a Google Q. We've got Google Glass.  We've got a Nexus 7, and we've got a Galaxy Nexus phone.  Which will be the first to die?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first to die relative to its launch, because Glass isn't going to be out for a while.  Is that what we're saying?  Oh, that's a good point. Well, you could leave Glass out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Q.  Pretty obvious, right? Any dissension here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. That's definitely going away.  I think it already went away. I don't even think... I think it was stillborn.  Can you buy it now?  Yes. Play.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't heard a single person say, oh, I got my Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  I wonder who actually made this. Let's see if we can find a real...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's made in the USA. That was one... It's one recommending point.  Here's what's wrong with it.  If it were $99 or $89, I don't think we'd be disparaging it, right?  It's $300 is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the price tag is the problem.  It seems like the Q is more of a proof of concept of the Android at home stuff  than an actual product they expected people to buy for multiple rooms of their house.  And you know what I got to say? The Q, it's cool. I liked it.  I like playing around with it.  Well, it's pretty.  I would never have bought it. It's pretty. It's interesting.  I like sending songs to it. I had a couple of friends over all of the Android phones.  We were sending YouTube videos to it, which is something we normally do.  We generally pass around the tablet. It's kind of cool to do it on TV,  but it's way too expensive and way too limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're assuming you like your friend's music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of annoying because your friend could actually take over the playlist, right?  You could have a music fight.  And that does never go well.  That's definitely a way to lose friends.  So I'm okay. I'm going to have a hypothesis here because I'm on the site.  Ships soon. This is Play.Google.com. Ships in one to two weeks.  And you can order up to two of them.  Now, remember, the idea of this is if you really want to use it, you need one for every room, right?  Because it's distributed.  So the fact that you can only order two tells me they didn't make very many.  And that tells me that they're never going to make any more.  So I think from that, I deduce this is already dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, I agree. I mean, Google's...  Look at the shotgun spread of products they launched.  I mean, that is the Google model.  Shotgun spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Jeremiah, you just said kind of it was. It's changed.  That was the model.  But then Larry has been trying to focus the company with a laser.  And this is an odd one.  Two lasers.  But it doesn't show the kind of focus that I think that he has wanted to bring,  unless they said we're going to have a whole panoply of products.  Now, the other way around it is that I can't wait.  We talked about the seven.  But it's fascinating that no one made a decent Android tablet until Google made one.  And maybe with Motorola and all that, they have to be in the business of making demonstration products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft clearly thinks that.  They're making the surface because nobody has made or shown a Windows RT tablet that's in the least bit compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know where the big business is.  But then Gene is right, I think.  What they're trying to do is do demonstration of what's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a reference platform.  Well, this isn't a reference platform because they don't want other people to make anything like this.  But they want them to make Android-based media devices.  Appliances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're just trying to figure out how do we get the Google experience in front of the audiovisual setup in your living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But ironically, that doesn't even do this.  This doesn't even do that.  You have to have an Android device to use this.  If I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with DLNA, I don't even need this.  I can do everything that the queue does with my phone right to my TV.  I don't need this thing.  The only thing this offers that my Samsung Galaxy S does not is a 25 watt amplifier.  That's a little pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  That's the best speakers in the house.  This just seemed like an Android.  Last year at Google I.O., they announced Android at home.  The idea of having appliances with Android built in that can do...  Didn't it look like this though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when they waved a CD over something and it looked kind of like this?  Yeah, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  What was it called?  It was an Android powered device hub called Tungsten.  This might be Tungsten.  RFID embedded into CD cases.  The device was able to detect the CD and add it to your library.  So you would wave the CD over the device.  It seems like the Nexus Q is just Google's way of saying here's one application of Android at home.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cool.  It's got 29 LEDs in a ring.  It looks very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The top spins and that's the volume control which I really like.  That's cool.  While you're listening to something and you can tap your...  You can touch it or not even really tap it.  You just touch it to pause.  So it's neat.  It's not anything I would have ever spent 300 bucks on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a conversation piece in front of your TV and then it becomes a doorstop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the rundown, I put up something and since you guys were at iOS and I wasn't, there was the Android device kit.  Have you seen this thing?  It looks like an odd phone.  Android device kit.  The last link under Android.  Accessory development kit.  I thought this was something that they did at iOS.  It's really kind of neat.  It's a device that has tons of sensors in it.  Ooh.  And this I want.  Try to get people to think about using Android with more kinds of devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they announced this at Google I.O.  I didn't hear anything about it.  The ADK.  No, that was an announced at I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that was not.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An update to the ADK they announced at Google I.O.  It comes out of the...  I want this.  This I would get.  Why didn't they offer this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has all these sensors on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has a working alarm clock and audio dock that's compatible with your Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do I get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't at this session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do I get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting because what this does is say it tries to get people to think about new ways to use Android, new ways to connect.  The notion of all the...  I think that the sensor world is going to be the next...  I agree.  You fad for a few months, right?  But we'll have fun with that.  And so it has Pico...  Let me see.  Ken Hackerson.  Some possible uses of the kit.  It's our Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's based on Arduino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pico satellite, hotel room alarm, irrigation controller, motorized remote control, drapes, smart thermostat, egg timer with atmospheric pressure compensation.  That's awesome.  Data watch, weather station.  Did I mention robots?  It's really fun to see what people build.  Now this is something for development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there were a lot of robots at I.O. this year.  And drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've seen the $99 Kickstarter project for an Android gaming device.  Right.  In fact, I should check how that status of that is because they launched a couple of days ago and they'd already raised something like $100,000 in the first couple of days.  What is the name of that?  It's like the Ohuna or something.  Anybody got a name?  The Ouya.  Ouya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ouya.  The link is in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a new kind of video game console?  Oh my goodness.  Oh my goodness.  How much have they raised?  They wanted $950,000.  They've got $3.3 million.  Wow.  In two days.  And it's open.  It's open.  It's Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what the orb should be.  Which is what Google TV should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Google's got to be happy about this.  This is exactly what they're talking about.  Why isn't Google putting up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yes, this is exactly what they want.  I think because Google doesn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want people to do this.  They've got 22,228 backers who pledged $100 to get one.  $100 is nothing.  I should have done this.  They're sold out of like half these packages.  Did you get a Pebble too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you order that?  I ordered a Pebble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Android.  This is amazing.  $3.3 million.  Yeah.  Pebbles, Android, although they're going to make it work with iOS as well.  That's intriguing.  I don't know what that means.  So this is very similar to this.  I want this open accessory protocol kit.  Where do I get the kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I...  Forget that.  I'll trade you a queue for an ADK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think...  Let me just go off on a limb here.  I think that the Twitch network should have a contest for creating...  Forget these hackathons and stuff.  For creating products and things around that kit.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  With a panel of judges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The prize is recognition from Leo the King.  No.  Are you willing to serve as judges?  Absolutely.  All right.  I got a panel of four judges.  Let me put together a prize fund.  We should have a prize fund, right?  Yeah.  We don't need to do much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I think glory is enough.  A thousand bucks from Jeff.  A thousand bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The prize could be to come on Twitch and demo the thing.  And you get to demo it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know what the prize is.  Jeremiah's queue.  And Leo's glass.  No, I'm not giving you my glass.  How about if we give you your very own Nexus queue?  That's just mean.  And then a wave t-shirt to the runner up.  It's a deal.  We're going to figure that out.  We'll do it like, you know, shark tank where you get to come on and you present.  Yeah.  And the four judges will do special edition of Twig with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a developer.android.com slash tools slash ADK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but I don't see the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is no there's no link to get the hardware that I can see.  That's what I want.  I don't know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I could just I'm supposed to build that thing.  No, I'm not that good.  I'm not a hardware hacker.  I'm a software hacker.  I want the hardware so I can hack it.  Yeah, it's based on our Arduino, which is kind of cool.  I'll figure it out.  I'm going to get one of those.  But I so what are we proposing, Jeff, that I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it is it I mean, does it need to be a working prototype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you got to see something.  Yeah, it just can't be PowerPoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or do you think it was just if it's just a board, it doesn't be pretty.  It's showing a concept of a new way to think about using Android as an open platform on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I'm looking now thanks to the chat room who has sent me to a fruit dot com,  which is a really great site for this kind of stuff.  And they have a variety of ADK development boards.  Oh, so that's true.  This is for seventy six bucks as an example.  It's the Arduino mega Android accessory development kit.  It's just a little board.  It's got a USB connector on it.  It's like five bucks.  Yeah, it's fifty four digital IOP pins, 14 of which can be used as PWM output.  Sixteen analog inputs for you are to 16 megahertz crystal oscillator power and ISC SP header and a reset button.  Wow. Now we're going to you know, and then there's a Raspberry Pi.  I mean, there's a lot.  This is an exciting arena.  If I were a young person, but you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Gina, you is my software development queen.  Yes. Yes.  Have you often wanted to make hardware?  You want to work with it. You want to.  You know, you're you're ordered your last and all that.  But but have you ever dreamed of making hardware stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've never I've been more of a software person than hardware.  I mean, I really appreciate hardware hacking.  I appreciate the gadgets that have great design.  But I've never been like a huge gadget person.  I've always wanted to make software like especially with touch screens, you know, where the software really kind of renders the interface like that.  That was super exciting to me.  So, yeah, I think that a block, you know, with with software APIs, I can I can imagine things and I can see different apps and things.  No limitation with right with hardware.  I think maybe it's just because I'm not as just familiar with the landscape.  I have a harder time kind of imagining what's possible.  And, you know, something like, well, if every CD in your collection has an RFID chip and it's like, what?  You know, that's the kind of thing that would would would shut me down.  But I think it's kind of thing where you really have to kind of imagine a future where, you know, everybody kind of has these, you know, these things where things are are enabled.  RFID or NFC enabled.  And I think it's really kind of a bet a bet toward the future, even the queue.  If I'm not mistaken, I don't think the Nexus Q app runs at anything higher than ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not true. It's ginger. According to the website is gingerbread or better.  Oh, it's gingerbread or better. OK, OK, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's one of those things that like you really it really you really have to look toward the future.  And I'm just like, I don't know, maybe it's my ego.  I need to make stuff that people can use now, you know, that I can get people to deploy out to their to their browsers or their phones.  I think I got spoiled by web development, you know, you just get it out and it works.  But I have a question for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's Google's last coming? It's like devices are on our bodies all the time.  You have to factor in that form function.  I mean, you're a developer. How are you going to adjust to that? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be a similar thing to when smartphones became a lot more ubiquitous.  I never thought that I would make mobile native mobile Web app or apps.  I always thought I would just make Web apps.  But, you know, when it became that I had the smartphone in my pocket all the time and it was a device that I love, I started developing for it.  I'm very much a kind of scratch your own itch kind of developer, you know, if I want something.  So if I get the glasses and I love them and I'm dying to see something in my heads up display that hasn't been built yet,  I'll, you know, I'll build it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's so great about software.  Yeah, you just you can, you know, and that's I'm with you, Gina.  Software is infinitely malleable.  Yeah, it's cool to be a hardware hacker and you need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I agree that that these chips and this wearable technology is going to be everywhere.  It's going to be a lot more ubiquitous just the way that I never dreamed that we would have, you know, computers in our pockets the way that we do now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only downside about the software is that you are dependent upon whatever platform you're going to build on.  Absolutely. That's hearing that happen a lot with Facebook, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what Alan Kay said, if you really care about software, you have to do hardware.  That's I mean, so that's not an individual.  Yeah, that's not an is there a Raspberry Pi is the thing you showed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a Raspberry Pi for Android?  Is that what you showed that Arduino thing?  No, that's not a Raspberry Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Raspberry Pi is a thirty dollar Linux box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, is there an equivalent for Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just check if you can run the ADK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A simple little card that will run the Android operating system that you can just plug into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would bet that you could put the ADK on Raspberry Pi.  It's a GNU Linux box.  But I would bet.  And see, that's the key.  That's what's interesting.  And from a Google's point of view, of course, Google is ultimately not a hardware house either.  And but they want to facilitate hardware development.  And that's why the ADK is so smart.  And if you're somebody like Gina or you're interested in technology, you should look.  That would be a very good skill, I think, going forward to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's talk about to have a team.  Right. I mean, in my world, I have content people who obviously have to be tied with with technology people.  You almost wonder if you need if you see more labs popping up with software and hardware people together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And we're seeing the growth of hardware devices emerging on Kickstarter.  So people are and that traditionally we've seen the Web startups and before that media.  But let's talk about Google and why all this hardware push.  So my whole thesis, I want to hear from you guys, is that it's just about getting Google experience everywhere in the world.  And this is why it's a shotgun approach.  They're going to put the hardware everywhere so they can capture the world.  And as and let me translate capture the world means organizing the world's information so you can sell ads against it.  That's really all about what this is.  Google experience everywhere.  Monetize it.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm busy ordering 80 K.  Here's the I.O.I.O.  The mint.  It goes in a little mint box.  Portable.  Yeah, that thing is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything in a mint box.  It is.  Jeremy, you said that you thought that they didn't emphasize the Google Plus announcements as much kind of for this reason.  Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember about a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not talk about.  Let's take a break.  Then when we come back.  All right.  We've talked about hardware.  Let's talk about Google Plus.  Why it wasn't more of Google I.O.  But first, we got a great panel, by the way.  Jeremiah O. Yang is joining us right now.  Gina Tripani, of course, from San Diego and Jeff Jarvis from CUNY.  Anybody went home because the network was all borked.  Good excuse to go home early.  I was rushing my little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  It takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get home.  Is that on the train?  Our 40.  No, it's trains, planes, automobiles.  And I know it takes you a minute and a half.  I love my commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five hundred steps.  I count H.  I hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Five hundred steps.  That's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it could have been better.  I could have lived in the basement here, but they wouldn't let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of windows down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fire marshal wouldn't let me.  I got a bean bag.  I just need a shower.  I want to invite you to start using your time more effectively.  Spend less time at the post office.  How about if your commute to the post office were zero steps?  What about that?  Huh?  To buy not just to buy stamps, but to prepare shipping.  What if you're an eBay seller, an Amazon seller?  A big part of your job, right, is getting that package ready for shipping, getting the right postage, filling out the forms, all of that.  Stamps.com, baby.  This is the way to do it.  If you're a small business, if you do any, you know, any amount of shipping.  Actually, I know a lot of home users really like stamps.com.  Just because you don't have to buy postage anymore.  You print your own postage from your computer and your printer.  You could print it right on the envelope.  You can have your own logo.  It really looks professional.  It looks sweet.  You could print on packages.  You could, if you want, little stickies.  You could print sticky stamps, too.  It's all from stamps.com.  You don't need a postage meter.  You don't need special ink.  You just need stamps.com.  Now, here's the deal.  We got to actually let's say is that the video there we're going to show?  We can show the video real quickly.  This is a happy stamps.com user.  So the idea is actual customers talking about actual stamps.com.  Really the cool thing is the post office loves you.  They love you.  They love stamps.com so much.  It's not like over their dead body kind of thing.  They love it.  They give you discounts you cannot get at the post office on express and priority mail.  If you're doing international postage, which is usually a pain, not only can it print international postage, it will fill out the forms for you.  Same thing with Amazon and eBay sellers.  It'll take the data right from the website.  Now, here's a special no risk trial offer.  Click that.  Go to stamps.com.  Click that radio microphone.  They got one of those classical microphones in the upper right hand corner.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Twig.  That way we get Jeff and Gina get credit.  TWIG.  Now, suddenly the $80 no risk trial is $110.  You get $55 in postage coupons.  You can use over a few month period.  You get a free digital scale.  You just pay shipping and handling for the scales, five bucks.  You get a supply kit and a month free trial.  A $110 offer.  But only when you use the offer code TWIG.  Go to stamps.com right now.  Try it out.  I tell you, you're going to really like this.  By the way, you don't even have to go to the post office to mail stuff.  Even if it's over 13 ounces.  You know, post 9-11, they have a rule that if it's a package over 13 ounces, you have to bring it in for inspection to the post office.  Not when you use stamps.com.  The mail carrier comes, takes it, takes it to the post office.  You can either have your regularly scheduled pickup or you can schedule a free pickup.  Post office, I'm telling you, they love this.  It lets them close down branches.  It lets them eliminate clerks because people just do it themselves.  It's just like the Internet.  Stamps.com.  Try it today.  Don't forget to use the offer code TWIG.  We thank you in advance.  So Google I.O.  You were there, Gina, and Jeremiah was there, brought some tools back.  They, you know, Vic got on stage, was interrupted by Larry, but he got on stage.  He talked about Google Plus, right?  They showed a nice video of happy people.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really think that the focus at Google has changed.  About a year ago, Leo, they said everything's focused around Google Plus.  We want to be a social company.  They're even putting their bonus structure around that.  You get you saw the focus at I.O.  They talked about it a very little, very small amount.  People were expecting a platform, an API.  Right.  There wasn't a lot actually available for people.  There was very few.  There was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I thought the history API was kind of cool.  Gina and I were talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's just a way to get content into Google Plus.  So when people arrive and their real friends aren't there, that it looks populated.  That's not really Google content.  That's kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's too soon to argue that there's a shift just because what they showed at one conference.  I think they're not that fickle.  This is important to their strategy.  It's about more than just a few things.  They haven't figured out how to do an API and not ruin Google Plus.  It goes back to what I've said on the show before about the problem with email.  When it becomes sender controlled, it gets ruined.  If Google Plus gets spammed with my Twitter feed.  That's what happened to Buzz.  As Buzz did.  I don't think they have figured out how to do an API, not technologically, but structurally, socially, architecturally.  And I think that's the issue.  Yeah, I don't want one, too.  But I also don't want Google Plus ruined because I do kind of enjoy the place.  Well, I absolutely use it, too, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when you look, the focus and the intention was on Google Glass.  And this is a smart move because you look at all these products on the table and Google Plus.  These are copies and replicants of other products.  Do you agree?  They're trying to catch up.  Finally, with Google Glass, they can get into a new market, a new type of product and attract people like Gina to develop on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a new I would argue that it's not a Google Glass is not a product.  Google Glass is like Siri and like Google's version.  It is the next step past a surface, past a device.  And so it's a new way to expand the use of the net beyond having to touch a device to do it.  And that's a concept.  And they're pushing that as a big strategic oomph.  But among the things you're going to do is search and use Google Plus and other things, too.  I just don't think I wouldn't read too much into what they put on the agenda, especially considering how much they paid for that stunt around Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But didn't they also say there is no who was it was it was Larry who said there is no Google Plus.  There's just Google.  Exactly. Exactly.  Exactly. And so that's what that could be confirming what Jeremiah is saying, which is, oh, let's not pay so much attention to the man behind the curtain.  Or it could be saying, look, we have a large much we're playing a much larger, broader game than just the Google Plus.  You're thinking of it like Facebook, like a site that's by itself.  But really, it's all Google and all those features in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I think you called it the connective tissue of the of Google.  Google Plus is in your in your plus pose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not apparent yet. To most of us, it still looks like a separate product, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does. But things are slowly converging.  Right. I mean, with the thing, all the things we saw at I.O. first, plus did have a big launch.  Events was a huge Google Plus launch.  No, it was day two. And I know that there were some issues we can talk about with the spam issues.  The skull will freak out.  But it was a big launch. The history the history API that was in developer preview.  That's it. That's you know, that remains to be seen what that will be.  But I mean, the things that we saw glass to me is going to be so I mean, it's going to be an input into into plus or just into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But vice versa. So let me I want to recategorize the piece.  Google Plus or let me be specific, Leo.  The the Google profile is part of Google Plus and it's going to permeate across all Google experiences,  including Glass, including all these tablets and devices here.  And they're going to collect the information from your friends and show it on your feed.  And all of that information will be used to serve up ads in various locations.  It's just all part of the strategy. So it's a horizontal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus is a way and I've argued this before and Android are ways for Google.  And I've said this in the show many times, so I apologize if you've heard it.  But it's a way for them to get us to generate signals about ourselves that they then use.  And that that's what makes it inherent into the strategy of the company.  Correct. And so it's not that they're having a social network versus Facebook.  They have a signal generator versus Facebook or a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And all these products have enabled one another. Right.  Android makes glass possible. Plus makes personalization possible.  Google Now, which they launched in Jelly Bean, that I'm convinced that that's basically what's going to be running on glass.  Right. Because it's aware of where you are and what what what is most interesting to you.  So all these things are just things kind of enabling one another.  But but plus is like like you said, I mean, I think it's the connective tissue.  I think it's going to be the social part of the people part of Google for going.  Well, it is now and it's going forward.  I think it's really well said. I'm sorry. Go ahead.  No, I mean, I don't know that there's a big shift, but I just think it's it's just part of the reality now that we're starting to see the elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just we're just we just a bunch of people saw different parts, but now we're seeing the full elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that it? Exactly. Yeah. What I want to see is you know darn well that there's been a board retreat presentation by Larry Page that says this is what I think the world's going to look like in three to five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the question. They need to aim at that target. That's what they are doing.  They need to skate to where the park is going. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just seeing the parts of the elephant, as you just said, Leo.  But but he's got an elephant in mind.  And, you know, it's being revealed to us bit by bit.  Yeah, we'll see what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And ultimately, isn't that what is required of Tim Cook of Mark Zuckerberg of Larry Page?  If you are running a modern technology company, you're looking a few years ahead and saying we think this is where it's going.  And whoever picks the best wins. Right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're you do that's the same thing running this shop. You're looking. Oh, God, I wish somebody told me I was three years behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, Leo, Leo, Leo. What would you have done differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm not that strategic. I wish I were that smart. These guys are actually smart people.  I just sit here and go, hey, oh, no. Oh, oh, stop with.  I'm not being I'm not being a phony on this. I don't feel that I have any idea.  And when I do, I think every time I try to predict the future with technology, it's like wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then go go back. I love you brought this up. That's great.  Go back for a second. I'll torture you for one more minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was lucky. I'm not saying I wasn't lucky a few years ago. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you go back, given the reality we have today, what different decisions would you would you know what you're doing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you? No, I think we actually we've threaded the needle pretty well.  But I wouldn't say that I have a crystal ball that's telling me what media is going to look like in three years.  I know I shouldn't say that. You know what?  This whole company is based on the notion that of a few things, bandwidth will be high speed bandwidth, be ubiquitous and fair and affordable, that there won't be caps, that there won't be limitations, that people will have high speed Internet, that that people will be able to consume us in some sort of way.  That's basically in parity with traditional mainstream media so that the distinction between NBC and Twitter will will start to dissolve.  And most importantly that audience. Well, to most importantly, audience will discover us. That's we have to work on our discover ability. That's not very good right now. We're working on that.  And and the second part of that is that advertisers will and I feel pretty good about all of these things, by the way, that advertisers will start to realize that this kind of media is as effective, if not more effective, that it is better to buy a small number of engaged viewers than a large number of disengaged viewers.  And I think that all of the trends are in the right direction. And one of the things that we're that the one thing that we're really working on, because everything else is kind of happens is discover ability. That's a real challenge for new media.  What am I going to do? Buy a billboard and one on one? No. Am I going to appear on the live with with Kelly? I've done that. Didn't do anything.  So discover ability is a challenge. And what I've what we've moved from is because it's video, it's not searchable. And so I was all worried about search for years and I didn't understand that search was going to get replaced by sharing.  And so it's very apparent is that the new way of being discoverable is actually the old way. It's word of mouth sharing. And so what we need to be is not searchable. I was all worried about that.  No, we have to be shareable. And so what we're really working on is a way that you could say to a friend, did you see that moment in that show? And then they'd be able to share it. If we can do that, I think that's all we have to worry about for discover ability. We have to be everywhere. People are watching, of course, and we're doing that. We're, you know, we're building apps and, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, so you see the connective tissue at Google. Give me your I want to hear Jeremy too. But Gina, first, what's what's your view of the elephant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My view of the elephant is similar to what Jeremiah said is that Google wants every single way. It wants to be part of every single experience that you have all day long. And it wants to be able to show you enhance that experience with information and with advertisements.  And in glass, you know, glass is part of that. This I really want to talk about this thing a little bit because I absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, you've been begging. We will. We're going to take a break and then you can. OK, let's finish this and then we'll then we'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been talking about this on the show for two years now. I mean, I think it's all about capturing signals as with the least amount of friction possible and then presenting it, you know, an enhanced worldview via devices.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I it's so much fun. The game for us, which I think it's it's kind of like when I was a kid, I played a lot of chess and it was fun to watch Grand Masters play and try to imagine what they're doing and why and why do they make that move? And that was really a fun challenge.  And I feel like that's what we're doing when we watch people. It was felt like that with Steve Jobs when we watch people like Larry Page. We're watching one hopes if one is a stockholder Grand Masters play a game in which they are seeing patterns and moves way ahead of us.  And we're trying to understand. Now you're an analyst. Is that what analysts do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do, but it's really hard to see that far ahead with these visionaries and they have these R&D and think tanks and they hire the best ideation teams in the world.  So they have more data than you do.  Yeah, they also have a huge team. So in our analysis, we tend to look about three years out in disruptive technologies and we can pretty much forecast a lot of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? You feel pretty confident that what you talk about will happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, if you look at my track record, I actually I've been very.  What's next? Tell me what's next.  Well, I cover social really deep. That's where we could talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I knew better. I have a team of zero.  Well, you see three years.  So do you think these guys are Grand Masters are pretty good at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. But I mean, again, look at the revenue model. I was looking at how much money they make in the percentage of it. It's 99% ads. All of this is about ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that that's a concern for Google?  They're happy that I mean, I think there's there's somewhat of a case to be made, for instance, that target ad targeting doesn't work. That's a lot of what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is concern that the targeting is decreasing in accuracy. But as more information should be increasing, as they get more signals from your birthday and Google Plus and all those things, then it should be more targeted.  Yeah, it should be getting better. That's why they have more signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it moves past targeting to relationships. You know, it moves. And this is part of Bob Garfield's view of the chaos scenario that when a company went when it or add in Doc Searls when you could have a direct relationship of value with a company that replaces advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's to me. That's the question. It's pretty clear banner ads don't work, right? It's pretty I mean, Google ads work. It's not true. They do work, but it's a low guaranteed CTR.  But they can promise numbers. Okay, it's low. It's very, very low. If I were making my money selling ads, I'd be looking at new ways to reach consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's actually what my next research reports on. We're looking at how owned media, social media and advertising is all coming together into a new form. We call this converged media, Facebook ads, Twitter ads, search ads. Those are all examples of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're a company, if you're forward, you have to do a concerted effort along many lines to create a whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about your sponsors like stamps.com. Those ads that we will see will start to have the members of the tweet community, right? Creating the content, sharing the content, distributing the content.  It'll all be one. It'll be hard to tell who's media, who's who's a creative and who's distributing. It's all together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real problem is that your customers don't like ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so what you do is you don't turn it into an ad. When you converge all those things together, your friends help to create that ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to be smart about this because you really, it can't look like you're manipulating. It can't look like you're marketing. It has to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your friends are shills, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like what happened to Google with this. They paid that fee, the judgment on this. Your Robert Scoble just like Ford. Why don't you?  That's an ad with using Robert Scoble's name without his permission.  And they just paid some money in a settlement for that in the UK.  So you have to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think as you learn the discoverability for Twitter, that's a skill that you then bring to your advertisers.  As you know the skill loyalty, it's a skill you have to find a way to transfer the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to spend a lot of energy trying to think of, you know, trying to be that the person who's thinking about that, right?  And then I realized that agencies are so conservative that you have to let them think of it.  Yeah, true enough.  You can't say, hey, you know what the next thing is. You have to wait until they say, hey, you know what the next thing is and say, oh, we could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, this problem discoverability, Leo, that you're describing that you have is the problem that Google wants to solve.  And just as an aside, I meant to say I just noticed, I don't know where I've been at the Twitter, the Twitter page on Google Plus is fantastic.  And you post the post shows after they go up.  Please follow us.  And I need to make, I need to make an effort. And I have, I've been kind of a slacker about this, about resharing that and saying, hey, you know, twig is up.  Come watch it the day after. That's just not something I've been so good at.  But you know, there are really good ways to do this and really bad ways to do this.  Like I, I, I, a car company, which I will not name, but a fancy car company offered me one of their newest models for a week and like three grand.  And they wanted me to drive the car for a week and blog about it and tweet about it.  You know, I had to agree to a certain number of blog posts or tweets.  So gross.  And I said no.  Was this because of your clout score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen the stories about how they all they award these things now out of clout scores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure that the cloud, cloud score has something to do with it.  I'm sure they use some sort of metric to figure out that I was, you know, influential in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what clout, that's what clout wants anyway.  They certainly hope that that's what we come to the currency of the rewards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can find some of those in there.  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never written about cars.  I'm not really into cars.  I mean, I'm just, it was just, it was a, it was a really badly targeted.  Right.  You know, I was just not the right person to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand, if Gina, if Google went to you and said, here's a Nexus 7, could you talk about it?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was first in line a bit of a thing.  I love this thing.  I love it.  It's the ultimate Android device.  I have not touched my iPad in two weeks and I love my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not because Google gave you one at all.  That's because you genuinely love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I, because I love, well, they did give it to me at IO.  So I will, I certainly should disclose that.  But I buy, I buy three of these.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't got it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently two to three days.  I wish I had it.  They say two to three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They start shipping.  I feel like, you know, when I was thinking about Google IO 2011, there were so many announcements that just didn't, nothing came out of them.  But just, we were discussing a minute ago is that we're just starting to see the shape of things.  Like this device, like seeing Chrome as the default browser and Google Now and seeing Jelly Bean with butter, like see it be so responsive and seeing the Play Store start to come into its own, although it needs a lot more content in it to be really good.  But to be at this point with Android where the app selection is great now, every single app that I'd ever want is now available for Android.  It's like, I get it.  Like this is where they've been going with it.  This is, this is a great device.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, I've been using the Kindle Fire.  See, I brought them all.  I got the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  They're all the same form factor.  The Nexus is lightest and it feels good in your hand.  But, you know, the Fire, the UI is really clunky because it's not one that we use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also slow hardware.  The Fire is an example of a compromised hardware to get that price down.  And that's what's kind of neat about this is that they got that price point without, right Gina, without compromising the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  Now, rumor has it that they're not making any money on this thing.  Right.  No, it's not rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said it.  I mean, this is an interface to the Play Store, right?  They're making a bet that you're going to buy stuff from the Play Store on this thing.  And the default skin is very Play Store centric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, if you go home, I'll just show you real quickly.  That's the home page, right?  This is very Kindle Fire like.  Yes.  You know, they're clear that that's the home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon's losing money on the Fire surely too, right?  I'm sure they are, yeah.  The tear down cost for the Nexus 7, it's in the run down was $152.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Marketing costs, they're absolutely losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably breaking even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Gina, have you used the Nexus in the sun?  Yeah, but so what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same with the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a dim screen, to be honest with you.  It is an IPS display, right?  So that would be very comparable to the iPad.  It's not an OLED or it's just an IPS LCD display.  You know, I thought Jeff was crazy for saying that he liked the small, that phablet thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is the right size.  This is, oh, this is the right size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, you can lay, I read in bed a lot, reading books and reading into paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that is very comfortable because it's one-handed.  It's extremely light.  It's just great.  It's all the things that I didn't use about the iPad.  I never use the iPad's back camera.  This doesn't have it.  I mean, it's Wi-Fi only, of course.  It's so fast.  I mean, I like to just swipe around on this thing because it's just so fast and responsive.  Jeremiah, you had...  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Jeremiah, you had the, in fact, you have it in front of you, the seven inch Galaxy Tab.  When I first got it, I was like, oh, I'm going to get a new iPad.  When I first got that, which was a year ago, wasn't it?  I kind of fell in love with that size.  I did too.  Yeah, you liked it too, Jeff.  So how does this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem was the software was fairly clunky at that stage.  The typing was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hated Honeycomb.  That was the real problem.  That was the real issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was not thought through as a tablet.  It was rushed out.  How does this compare, do you think, Jeremiah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't really use this.  This is Charlene's.  To be honest.  We've been with the fire for the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you one thing I like about the seven that the Samsung tablet is it has a camera on the back.  This one does not, oddly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that one is light.  Fill this compared to the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the fire is a lot thicker and heavier.  It feels clunky and heavy.  Although I have to say, I was one of the few people who actually thought the fire was a great product.  But this now supersedes it for sure.  It is.  We're watching the free movie that comes with it, the Transformers movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you're Amazon, what do you do now?  Because they have rumors of new devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You ship a new Kindle and they better do it quick.  The rumor is it won't be for a few months, which I think is probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we should assume price points are going to drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.  So especially when Christmas comes around.  I don't know.  Could these things kick down?  I'm saying sub hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you get sub hundred on something like this, everybody buys one just as an impulse purchase, right?  You buy this.  It's sitting next to the People magazine at the grocery store.  And you go, I'll take one of those two.  And you just throw it in your card.  I mean, it gets to be that point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, sub 100 for sure.  I mean, Amazon still has a much better catalog than Play Store.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  But what you get with the Nexus 7 is you get the whole suite of Google apps, Gmail, Calendar, Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's why Apple's doing a seven inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they have to get into this game.  They have to.  This is about media distribution.  This is Charles Dickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have three media libraries, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  iTunes, Play and Amazon.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say this is pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, if you were doing a chart of the Nexus 7 versus your iPad, which you loved, this is fast.  You're selling this to a friend.  What?  You just like Android.  You like the flow.  You like feeling it.  And I get all that.  I'm going to be the same way.  But as a marketing message, what makes the Nexus 7 competitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honestly, I mean, for 200 bucks for something this powerful and great and small and light, it's a no brainer.  It's really the price.  It's about price.  Depending on who the friend is.  My sister-in-law told me that she's in the market for a tablet.  And I said, this is a couple of weeks before Google I.O.  And I said, just hang on to see what Google is going to release.  She said, I want to spend about 200 bucks.  People don't want to spend $500 on a giant tablet.  And I just have a different relationship with the iPad.  The iPad is beautiful, you know, slab.  But this thing I feel like I just live with a little bit more.  It's just lighter and it's got that kind of leathery feel.  I just I feel like it's something that I just that I kind of grab.  It's more casual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm addicted now to my keyboard case for my iPad.  I'm worried about withdrawal from that.  Can you hold it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see Jeff.  He's talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the logic.  Yeah.  Here you could play with it.  This is the ultra thin.  It works with the seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works with the seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any Bluetooth keyboard does.  Yeah, I know.  It doesn't it doesn't fold.  You know, how long before somebody makes a little.  Well, I think soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that's my one concern is that I think I need that because it does make me fluid.  It makes me not fear having a type on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do I start a hangout?  Can I start a hangout?  I want to use this camera.  How do I start a hangout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to the sidebar.  So click home sidebar hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glad somebody knows how to use this.  I don't know any of these people.  Do you mind?  Who should I start a hangout with?  Start one with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These aren't my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, type in Chad.  See if it happens.  No, because this is Jeremiah.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My friends are your friends.  OK.  Just don't.  Chad Johnson my ex-girlfriends and it will be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not on here anyway.  Ring on.  What does this mean?  Now I just press start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe that start.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, Martin, are you in Google?  Hey, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waiting for Chad to join.  Let's see.  Here's the old redhead himself.  Hi, Chad.  How are you?  Good to see you.  Here we go.  One second.  Now, see, this is the point of the front facing camera.  And I guess they figured nobody's going to take pictures with this.  This is probably not so far off.  That's a reasonable assumption.  How many pictures have you taken with that with iPad?  Right.  And it saves you money.  It saves you probably what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twenty bucks on the cost.  I've taken lots of pictures of whiteboards.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  With your iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've taken lots of pictures of white people.  So there you go.  Oh, Chad, don't worry about it.  He's running to get a camera.  It's OK.  I'll call somebody.  I'll call.  Really, what do you got there?  What are you using?  Call Gina.  Yeah, I could call Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Anyway, that's cool.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, you saw there's a new feature for Hangouts that I think it's after you're  off, it will give you a transcript of the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A written transcript?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you mean voice to text?  It automatically does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, I admit.  Here's the thing.  OK, 200 bucks.  But here's the significant interest in this and the fire.  It's fast.  And that's the butter.  There is a reason for Jelly Bean.  That is noticeably.  You feel the speed of that.  Even compared to my quad core Galaxy S3, it feels fast.  We're going to take a break.  We're talking with Jeremiah O Yang, a web strategist who's looking three years ahead  of everybody else.  Gina Trapani, who lives three years ahead of everybody else, and me and Jeff, who are  living in the past.  For three hours.  We just wish Dallas should come back on the...  Wait a minute.  It did.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nothing from Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing from Jeff.  I thought...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is he frozen?  Oh, no, he's not frozen.  He's yawning.  Larry Hagman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry Hagman.  Jeff, Larry Hagman.  Linda Evans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was never into Dallas that much.  What do you think of Newsroom?  Oh, hate it.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hate it.  I'm very disappointed.  He despise it.  Sagamonious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now we people, my people, my people, my people, my people, my people, my people, my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people, my people.  You're journalists.  My people, the media understand what he did to technology people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  And in fact, he's still doing it to technology people.  He acts as if Twitter and email are like something new.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And the truth is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a blog?  His vision for news is retro-grade.  Uncle Walter back, I want him to explain the world.  And in that first show, the structure he showed of having no script and staying just ahead  is a venue for precisely how CNN screwed up the Supreme Court decision.  Not thinking, not doing their work, not holding back.  And it's just utter crap.  And the speechifying is just so obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty apparent that Sorkin hates women.  I mean, all the women are dits in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, I just sent...  I just misused autocomplete in Outlook twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, you're a woman.  Of course you did.  And by the way, knock something over, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, seriously, I'm going to fall down on my heels while I'm running through the newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're a woman.  And I don't care if you were embedded in Iraq.  I don't care if you're the greatest journalist ever.  Please knock over that whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't understand what an email alias is.  It's so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't get it.  Oh wait, let me check my faculty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly what was in the social network that we didn't like about the social network.  And now I'm terrified because this is the same guy who's writing the Steve Jobs biopic.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's going to be a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, or he'll see...  No, he'll see Steve Jobs as the paragon that should be all technology.  The smart guy who knows best, who controls everything, who doesn't let these rabble rousers  decide what should happen in the world, who delivers something from a view of quality  and really doesn't respect the world that much.  That's the way he's going to present Steve Jobs.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, knock something over for us.  You ditz, you...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love to hear journalists talk about Newsnight.  It's one of my favorite things to watch because I just get so angry about it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's awesome.  I was all excited because I want to romanticize the newsroom and romanticize television.  I like that, but this thing is just...  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, after I watched a couple of newsroom things, I went back and I watched part of  social network.  Same problem.  The... the... the preachifying, the worldview just came out even harder terms, in worse  terms as far as I'm concerned.  I think what you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I'm the odd one, but...  No, I think what you catch on to... because Sorkin's musical with language, but once you  catch on to him, you realize, oh, it's drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've heard that tune somewhere before.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  If you love that show, it's a wonderful, wonderful show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we like glee.  No, it's not.  What kind of taste do we have?  What do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's true.  It's true.  I'm a straw cop to that.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but this guy used to be a television reviewer.  He's got credentials.  He's a trained journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they gave Babylon 5 a bad review and the geeks will never forgive you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, that's not forgivable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And somebody in the chat room said, and I kind of agree, that he's giving Sorkin a pass.  We'll always give him a pass because of West Wing, which was a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, it was, but you know what?  I'll bet if you went back to the same problem, romanticizing BS, Sorkin took great pride

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the fact that he never figured, never studied how the White House worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Sorkin is an elitist.  Yeah.  That's the opposite of what I think the internet is about and journalism should be about.  Yeah.  Now you're right.  And it's the same problem with, don't get me started, Leo.  I know you're trying to get a sponsor in.  It's the same problem with what's his name, The Wire.  I love him.  You don't like him?  I don't know.  His attitude toward newspapers and such, it's still that kind of elitist view of you need  to mount a top.  Season two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, season two is all about the newsroom.  That was kind of interesting, but you're probably right.  It was a little bit His Gal Friday, as is newsroom.  Totally, His Gal Friday.  Yeah.  All right.  I keep waiting for Katharine Hepburn to show up.  Spencer Tracy is the editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is Jill Abrams, the editor of the New York Times now.  It's her favorite newspaper movie.  Oh, it's the greatest of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She did a...  Oh yeah, I saw that interview.  But talk about dated.  That's when newspapers were still printed on trees.  Dead trees.  I liked, you know, one thing I missed last week is I wish I could talk to Jeff about  newsroom.  And now you've satisfied my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, it got me started, Leo.  I knew I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now we just have to talk about Louie and it'll be complete, but we should do a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Louie, I've been watching...  I've catched up with season two.  I'm watching season two because it's on Netflix.  Has season three started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's two episodes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's so amazing.  He is.  There's a guy.  There's a guy's guy.  And now Louie CK we're talking about.  He's selling his own tickets to kill scalpers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's killed 95% of all the scalping on his concert tickets.  Everything he's doing is going direct, and that's what the internet does.  Now it helps that he's Louie CK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if I started my comedy career trying to sell tickets to it, it wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It helps these...  I put up a link to David Weinberger on his blog, Hyperorg Joe Ho, did a brilliant essay  about how what Louie CK did with the scalpers and with the show itself was indicative of  our opportunity to reset norms on the net around a simple rule, which is, pardon me  for this, let's try not to be dicks.  Yeah.  And it's really a brilliant piece because it talks about...  It actually also goes through the Weltanschauung of the worldview of Seinfeld and of Curb Your  Enthusiasm and then of Louie CK.  Louie CK's whole thing is let's try not to be a dick.  And that's the opportunity the net gives us.  He just uses his direct relationship with his fans in his show and against scalpers  as an example of doing just that.  It's really a wonderful piece.  Just do the right thing.  Yeah.  I like it.  Because we have the chance to now.  We have the chance to rethink these norms.  We can screw it up, but our norms are all open for questioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's why...  I don't know about you, Gene, but that's why I love the show, Louie, because it's like  a breath of fresh air.  You don't have to be on automatic.  You could think about this for a minute and then you can see the truth of it as opposed  to just kind of...  As we mostly do in life, just kind of, well, that's how we've always done it.  So we'll just keep doing it that way.  Here's a chance to step back and say, oh, it's different.  I like that.  So already two episodes, huh?  Yeah, two episodes.  I won't see it till next year.  What channel is that on?  FX.  FX, okay.  I probably get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think you can get it on my cable.  I don't think it comes on the on-demand or on Hulu either, which is upsetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you're on Dish or DirecTV, they're probably turning it off right as we speak.  That's a mess.  What the hell's going on there?  This is why the internet's going to win, because ultimately these stakeholders are just going  to kill each other off.  It's like dinosaurs are just going to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The risk is they want to turn the internet into cable.  I know.  And they own it so they can.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what these media platforms that we just talked about are part of that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the carriers are unfortunately Comcast, NBC, Verizon, and AT&T.  I mean, we've got to get around that.  Let's build our own.  Let's launch a satellite or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Verizon, which just filed an FCC complaint against their net neutrality power, arguing  that Verizon has a First Amendment right to decide what goes on the internet and a Fourth  Amendment property right to decide as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, I don't think that's new.  I think that's always been the contention that the FCC doesn't have standing, is the  point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But to argue that there's a First Amendment right on behalf of the cable provider to decide  what does and does not go through its wires to our house, that it is not just a common  carrier to the internet, it's not just access to the internet.  It is a newspaper.  It gives the idea that the analogy it makes is that it is a newspaper.  Verizon is a newspaper.  So dumb.  It decides what gets published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a side effect to that that they're going to regret, which is that they're now  responsible for what gets published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's where Cisco comes in too, right?  So Cisco is going to put a technology in place to stop us from our own devilish instincts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the analog is YouTube.  YouTube doesn't want to be responsible for what people put on there.  They're a carrier.  Right.  But as soon as you say, well, no, we're a publisher, then YouTube is responsible for  every single thing on every single page.  Not and it's difficult to do.  Anyway, let me do an ad.  Sorry, Leo.  Half an hour.  The only reason, hey, I just need to we need to pay the bills.  We love this.  We need to think we got lights.  We got a table.  Somebody's got to buy the table.  We got a guy named Chad.  He's five bucks an hour.  But but I still got to pay him.  Stuff like that.  That ain't right.  Poor Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, he's more than five.  I hope he's more than five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really know.  Five fifty.  The way I get at it is I wash my hands of it.  I have no idea what he's paid.  I'm sure it's a fair living wage, but I don't know.  This show brought to you.  No, it's it's fair, right?  Yeah, it's fair.  I don't even know what it is.  I really don't know what we pay you.  I don't handle that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what we pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't handle that.  But, you know, if it's not, let me know and I'll refer you to Lisa.  This show is brought to you by I don't know what Ford paid for this either, though.  So it's it goes both ways by Ford Motor Company.  My dog is excited.  Ozzy, you want to go for a ride in the Mustang?  Come on, boy.  Let's go for a ride.  Ozzy loves Ford Sync.  But you know what he's really excited about?  He's really excited about the new App Link API that lets developers write software that  sits on top of the platform that is your vehicle.  Your vehicle has sensors, it's got capabilities, got wireless, all this stuff.  And now you get in your smartphone and it's interfacing with it.  And it's suddenly your car is a part.  It's like the ADK.  It becomes a part of your environment.  And actually, Ford's demonstrating this.  They kind of have done a reference application.  The MyFord mobile app.  Now, if you want to take a look at it, you go to an EV certified Ford dealer and drive  the new 2012 electric focus because this this works with the electric vehicles only.  And what will happen is, for instance, the app knows where your car is at all.  They could find out about this at Ford.com slash technology as well.  Your app knows exactly where your car is.  I love this thing.  I show this picture.  Where's my car?  Why it's right here.  It also knows where the nearest plugs are.  If you want to charge it up, it also you know, so you get a map of all the charging stations  in your area.  You also get your state of charge.  In fact, if the car is in the garage and you're in the living room, you can still use the  app.  It talks to the car so you can say charge now or hey, I'm going to get in the car at  30 tomorrow morning.  Could you make sure it's 72 degrees in the cabin or on these hot days, you might want  to say 65 degrees and it uses the electricity to do this.  They're available for Blackberry, Android and iOS.  It's called the My Ford mobile app.  So when you go to your EV certified Ford dealer to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus electric,  bring your phone and download the app and then you can see how it works.  It's really sweet.  They also have a My Ford mobile website where you can, you know, there's some gamification  here.  Who saved the most CO2 today?  How much money have you saved?  I just think this is, remember it's a demo.  This is what they want.  I mean, it's more than a demo.  It's a working demo, but this is an example of what you can do when your car talks to  your phone.  The My Ford mobile app, just one of many amazing innovations you can find at ford.com slash  technology or at your Ford dealer.  Visit one today, bring your phone and try it out.  So if I have a cloud score of 76, let's see what my perks are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, can you tell I don't belong to cloud?  I don't plan to.  I don't know what my cloud score is.  I have no idea what my score is.  We'll just go to cloud and you know what you have to sign up for it.  I won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, oh, you don't even want to give them any, uh, any cloud, so to speak.  We can look.  Okay.  I can get 50 business cards from Moo.  I could save up to see this is not, this is, you could show this.  This is not anything I would, I could save rent on the runway.  No, sorry.  You're not eligible.  How to be eligible.  I need a cloud score above one.  See, a lot of these aren't particularly good.  Yeah.  See, this perk is open to other influencers.  Is this the one that was giving you a car?  Acura ILX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, they emailed me directly.  So it wasn't, it didn't see, they didn't mention cloud, but I imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is like a paper post.  This is trying to buy the, because they supposedly have cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what you have to say if you drive a, uh, this Acura.  I was given a free product or sample because I'm a cloud influencer.  I was under no obligation to review the sample or talk about this company.  I get no additional benefits for talking about the product or company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one of the posts I did that drew a lot of attention is when you combine cloud with  Google glass and you can go about the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Damon.  That's a, that's, that's straight out of Daniel Suarez, where you have your reputation score  floating above your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And you can go to a party and then people are going to, Oh, he's got a lot of cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Hey, you're a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just, I just envisioned that as Robert Scoble's worldview.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wishes he wishes cloud would give you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I say that lovingly, Robert.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He would agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think when that happens, you can, people with high cloud scores will also get discounts,  special treatments, free products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  See, here's what's wrong about that.  And the example that I have at hand that's very easy is I had absolutely no cloud, no  influence whatsoever.  You're 65.  In the PC, no, in the PC market, the laptop market, when I complained about my Dell computer,  what had influence was my message.  And there was no way to predict that this guy named Jarvis who comes on Kvetch's with  dirty words about his computer was going to start a storm because the message was at the  right time.  Yeah.  The fact that I had some people following me helped it spread a little easier, but I  was zero cloud in that category.  But that, what's your, what's your Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, Jeff Jarvis.  That was because you identified that Google products and the support had an issue.  You were the voice of the people.  It didn't have to do with direct influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying though, Jeremy, is that, is that the notion of cloud, that  someone is an influencer is predictable as such is, is wrong because the person who has  influence can say something that doesn't have, doesn't resonate.  The person who has zero influence can say something that resonates.  And that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also when that happened was 2006, I think I read you, you do that or something like  that.  There were very few people blogging compared to the amount of people on social.  Now, now we have to have identifiers because everybody's doing it.  The adoption rates in social networking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm still trying to say, I'm still saying that, that, that the idea that you can measure  someone's cloud as a predictor of, of their influence is fallacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I agree.  Okay.  So cloud is great for absolute value.  But when you look at the relative value, which is specific topics, like obviously media,  journalism, advertising, we go to you.  But if it's PC computers, perhaps you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't, isn't that the problem with authority in general is, in fact, I remember this from  talking to a, who was it?  Mr. Twitter was the guy who did this originally.  And he said, the problem is I have a lot of authority when I, to my kids and my parents,  I might have net zero authority to you.  I'm have a lot of authority when I talk about, I tweet, but I might have zero authority when  talk about tires.  So how do you measure authority?  And cloud is a very brute force way to do that.  I think that's why people have problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a number, there's pure indexers.  There's so many of these.  I mean, Edelman has built their own, but they do put in some keywords and you can tag people  and people have been saying you're like influential at raspberries and blueberries and branches.  So it's not perfect.  But people glom onto numbers.  And by the way, the number of brands that use cloud is very, very, very high because  it's embedded in radian six and a number of social monitoring tools.  So they kind of, they've bought into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're buying a crock.  That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think what's more interesting is who the influences are listening to.  Oh, yeah, I've been really kind of obsessed with the idea of like, if you're not an influencer  by its clout measure or whatever, you know, if you don't have a ton of followers, but  you have relationships with people, maybe who do, you know, the car company that comes  to me and says, you should drive our car around and here, we'll give you money to talk about.  That's one thing.  But if someone I respect admire it, Leo asked me to do, you know, to do something or try  something.  Like, I'm going to listen to him.  And I think that's kind of the next step here is like, how do we get people who are not,  you know, influential?  And I'm using that term.  You know, however you measure that, who are they?  Who do they care about?  Who are they listening to?  Because the people who have tons of followers and a high clout score, like they're just,  you know, they're blocked off.  Half of them can't answer their email or can't, you know, sort through all their Twitter mentions  or whatever.  And it's impossible to get to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  And I advise a lot of brands on how to deal with social influencers.  And I say, should you treat people like Leo with high clout scores higher than other people?  And they're like, no way.  That's horrible.  That's a bad behavior.  And I say, well, do you treat customers with high net value differently?  And they go, oh, yes, we do.  Sure.  It's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those of us who are better looking and richer than others should get more clout.  Lady Gaga, how do you think she's going to run her social network?  Little Monsters.  Are you a member, Gina, Little Monsters?  Are you a Little Monster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am a Little Monster.  I thought you might be.  I thought I was.  Really?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You really are?  I really am.  I really am.  How did I know?  So I'll admit, I didn't know about it until I saw it in the rundown, but I signed up instantly.  I was like, oh, I was scanning our story rundown and I was like, Lady Gaga's new social network.  And I signed in instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's at a beta.  Tell me what it looks like.  Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks a lot like Pinterest.  Interestingly, you can sign in with either your Facebook or your Twitter account.  And then it asks you for a couple of little more information, your birthday, maybe your  name.  What's the address?  It's littlemonsters.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what she calls her fans, is Little Monsters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  That's what she calls her fans.  And it looks, the primary UI looks very similar to Pinterest in that it's photo based.  And Gaga is your friend by default.  So you kind of, when you sign in, you see Gaga is the upgraded Tom.  And you just see a lot of images from Gaga, which is, you know, as a fan, that's what  I want.  But there's a chat on the sidebar.  And yeah, I mean, it looks cool.  I don't know that I'm going to spend a lot of time here because it's very Gaga centric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it media consumption or is it for social interaction?  What are you using it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like, well, like I said, I only signed up a few hours ago, so I haven't spent a lot  of time.  It seems like this is for fans to meet one another and chat.  So there's live chat on the sidebar.  And then there's, you can share links and images, a lot of stuff about sort of all of  Gaga's, you know, bullying and fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If this works, the other artists are going to do this.  That's the question.  This replaces, somebody's going to white label this and this replaces Myspace or Ning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This probably was the idea behind Ning, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, something like this, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Create your own social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She owns this versus going through a platform.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this isn't so very different from what you might create on a Myspace page.  Either, right?  I mean, formally known as very much like Pinterest.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks, it doesn't look like Pinterest, but you know, there's like the gay monsters  group.  There's like the Brazilian monster monsters group and you can click on one of those in  the right, the right sidebar and you can start to chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is really a lifestyle, a social site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I wonder, is this the next big thing for not just for Gaga, for other artists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to have massive, massive following for this to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  She does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to gather around, you have to gather around something common.  That's what she's, she's not just music.  She's, it's very glee like, right?  It's losers like us.  It's an affinity group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's fashion.  It's, it's culture.  It's dance.  I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's affirmation.  Right.  It's support because she, her anti-bullying efforts.  I mean, it's, there's, Gaga is a whole thing.  Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She does the Chrome commercials.  Right.  I'm trying to think for somebody like me, what would be, if there's anything that would  be compelling and I mean, I don't, I'm too old for a bit to be a band.  I guess if you were an NFL, if you're a fan of the 49ers, there's people who would do  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can't imagine something like this, like Twitter having its own, I'm not suggesting  that Twitter build its own social network, but you can imagine sort of a personalized  site like this for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we've got a forum.  We've had things kind of like this.  The chat room is that.  Isn't this, isn't this really just a forum, more modern with more, you know, media features,  but really ultimately it's a forum.  Isn't it?  It's a community.  It's not a forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, a forum is a community.  A forum is a tool for a community.  Community are groups of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Leo's saying it's a forum for the community here.  Sure.  He's a convener of people who have similar interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is what is I don't even know what our forum is.  Is it twit commons dot twit dot tv?  Does anybody know?  I haven't used it.  I'm an army.  No, no, it's commons dot twit.  I think it's commons dot twit dot tv.  Let me see.  No, I don't even know.  You know, Ben Fransky, our moderator was here.  He said, you know, you guys don't have a link on the front page anymore.  It's town commons dot twit dot tv.  And this is actually used to be very active.  If we made this more Pinterest, it would be very similar to what Lady Gaga is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Pinteresty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People come here for tech help.  Mostly.  That's where most of the posts are.  But and we could do this.  We could be more active, certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Jeremy's point, if it's truly a community, it doesn't need you.  It'll live on its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can add value.  Well, this does.  It's got 19,000 registered members.  It's got 19,000 posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  So just about every single person has.  And it's completely neglected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry to say I thought, foolish me, forums were dead.  I thought, oh, nobody uses forums anymore.  And then Gaga comes along and that's really just a forum.  I'm telling you.  That's what that is.  Media sharing.  I don't think that's a forum.  Yeah, well, it's dressed up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do people do a lot of on forums?  Put pictures.  Yeah.  Look at what is it?  B slash B. It's pictures.  4chan is a forum.  It's pictures.  Reddit is?  Reddit's a forum.  We're going to do subreddits.  Oh, cool.  For all of our shows.  In fact, this show will have a subreddit.  We just haven't started promoting it.  When should I start promoting that, Chad?  Let me hear back from Greg.  You know what we're looking for for this is eventually we will want community moderators  for all of the things.  Absolutely.  So if you love Twig or Twit or MacBreak Weekly, TNT already has a subreddit.  We would love it if you'd get, and you're a Redditor, you're really into Reddit and  you know how to use all this stuff.  We would love to get you involved.  So just think about that.  I think these have never gone away, but they are, and so when I look at what Gaga's doing,  I go, oh, that's, you know, it's, it's like I was a member of the Well in 1984.  Which is for sale now.  Now for sale, yes.  Yeah, sad to say.  Why don't you buy it, Leo?  Ten bucks.  Why don't you buy it?  How might?  Well, because I don't want it.  What would I do with it?  It's a text.  It's a forum.  But the Well, which was kind of the prototypical forum in the 80s, mid 80s, started by Stuart  Brand of the Whole Earth catalog.  stands for Whole Earth Electronic Link was the first place I experienced the internet.  You could drop through the bottom of the Well user interface to a command line and then  you could run links or gopher or Archie and Veronica.  And that's how I saw the internet the first time.  So in other words, this has been around for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People don't change just the tools and technology.  Yeah, it's more visual than it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true.  It's more visual, which makes sense for Gaga fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we could make ours more visual.  Somebody should write some Pinterest style forum software than we'd use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ning, you know, is now part of glam.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  And full disclosure is I've been an advisor to glam and I'm friendly with them.  Is glam like fab and fancy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is glam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, glam is now larger than AOL.  It has 243 million users.  Glam media?  Glam media.  Glam is basically a network and platform started for women.  Now it has men and other topics.  But it is rather than the old model of the portal or the old model of a content company.  Glam is an enabling network for a couple thousand sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is like Linkin Park is doing essentially what Gaga is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So you could use Ning using their platform.  The the Twitter, I'm sure I'd be happy to introduce you to them.  They have all kinds of great tools for creators now.  That's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you compare glam media to like federated media or other types of influence or networks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Glam, I mean, yes, it started as an ad network, but it has a lot more tools.  So it enables people to create a lot of things and they have very high end ad sales.  They only take high end brand ads.  And again, full disclosure is that I became friendly with Samir Arora, who is the CEO,  because I believe in the network model and it was pretty much the only and it still is  the only large substantiation of that model at scale.  Well, what about demand media?  No, demand is not a network at all.  Demand pays people to go write crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is the opposite the other way around where you've got content, you're a creator.  You need so Dr. Phil is using this Dr. Phil dot com.  It looks like a Dr. Phil website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is it is sitefully.  What Glam does is enable them with ad sales and promotion and some technology.  And so it's a network to enable your the sites that are on it to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a media platform, a media platform with monetization and engagement tools ready to go.  Yes, I just there's this new company.  Check it out. I just met with them yesterday.  I'll disclosure their client now of this moment.  And they allow companies to build these types of things across social networks and even on  HTML pages. So I'm seeing this trend, the white labeling trend starting to emerge now, too, like this.  So there's going to be a lot of permutations of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does does Glam.  Now, see, these are kind of cheap ads up at the top here.  These look like almost Google.  Well, Glam itself. Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's I thought they usually didn't didn't allow you to do that kind of stuff.  They they sell just as far as I know, they sell just branded branded ads.  I don't know that they control everything.  So do you get this site for free and then you do an ad share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they invite you in. They invite you in.  They invite you in.  So that's selective.  So after spending one hundred thousand dollars on our Twitter site,  I'm starting to think maybe this would have been a smart move.  Yeah.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Jeff, how do you think this is different than a a branded  YouTube experience or a Facebook experience just because you can control?  Well, it's unique. I mean, look at these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of these look like they're.  So we're just talking experience here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Glam here, Jeremiah.  The glam is not a brand.  They thought it was going to be originally, but it's really not.  It's an enabling company behind infrastructure.  Two thousand brands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I notice it doesn't say glam. No.  Any. Well, here it is at the bottom.  Glam Health and Wellness Bliss.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So they have bliss, which is health.  They have glam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it has a cross link to another glam site.  That's it. I mean, you wouldn't know this is what's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five years ago, it started and within less than two years,  it was larger than I village, which was the king, the queen of women's sites.  And now it's larger than AOL.  That's kind of building a network.  Two hundred forty four million uniques.  Like it's really I'm just shocked that more haven't seen this network.  So if I were a newspaper company, a magazine company,  you know, Cottingham Astor, Hearst or those kind of places,  this is what they should have been building.  They could have a thousand brands that I've said it to all those companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is a distributed model.  Traditional media companies and you know, best only think  centralized and centralized monetization precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that mean it's so they don't really want to give up any power to glam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that it? You want to hold editorial tight? Yeah.  You want to hold advertising network tight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yet this relationship would be probably to everyone's benefit. Yeah. Yeah.  And I think I was operating out of that kind of mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've gone to sessions with glam bloggers and they don't compete with each other.  They recognize that ships rise in the tide.  They link to each other and they all benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't mean to introduce me to glam. I'd like to meet that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You bet. Samir Arora is a great character. He's in San Francisco area.  I think I blew it. He's an ex Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, we just we literally spent just spent  nearly one hundred thousand dollars on Twitter TV and the new tech guy site,  which is about to launch also.  And it's it's that centralized model where we have the servers, we control it.  We spend thousands of dollars a month running it.  And this would probably make us a hell of a lot more money.  Yeah, but they'd be out there selling your words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is, these ads, I don't we control the ads. Right.  So that you'd be giving up monetization options in order to reduce maintenance costs.  For those, can you make more than 100K in your network at long term value? Yes.  So the question is, do we join or build?  The answer is, when do we do it? How do we do it?  Yes, we do both.  You're all over the social web, too.  So there's like three levels, right?  There's you have your dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like an idiot savant who just stumbled into this world.  Come on, no.  And I don't understand any of it.  And then they get people like you and Jeremiah.  And they explain this to me. And then I go, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you specialize in selling video ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in a certain way, I my only the truth is, my only, only, only, only interest  is in creating a network that helps people understand technology  and and hanging out with smart people and talking about technology.  And the only reason we do any monetization or anything else  is to is to subsidize that.  If I could do this and make if I could, I mean, I, I don't.  But I haven't figured out how to.  I don't know.  What I am is a is a content guy who's kind of trying to thread his way  through this new media universe, which is crazy.  Well, I feel like that guy in newsroom.  I have a blog.  Check the facts.  Where's the facts machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Check the facts machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just knock Gina over by accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The woman was embedded in Iraq, in Afghanistan,  Pulitzer Prize winner, wounded.  But for some reason, she can't figure out that an acronym can't begin with is is is.  I know. I said maybe people get stupid when they got on TV.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron has a deep rooted hate for hatred for women and for technology.  It's it's now become apparent.  And for I would argue populism and democracy and democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he's absolutely the latest as am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I try to hide it in a good way.  When me and my buddies get together, the Bohemian Grove,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we often laugh at you proletarians.  Somebody asked me on Twitter, are you going to the Grove?  So what?  I think they assume that I am a media elite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me and George Schultz were like this.  Let us take a break. I'll tell you what I'm excited about.  Jeff's going to have a number.  Gina is going to have a tip.  I'm going to have a tool.  Jeremiah, I don't know what in just a bit.  But first, I'm going to tell you about how you're going to be able to do it.  You're going to be able to do it.  You're going to be able to do it.  But first, I'm going to tell you about how a great little company  is changing the mobile phone space.  I love this kind of a story.  Elliott Noss, who heads two cows, does Huffer.com,  which is really kind of create a new way to do domain registry.  He's trying to do the same thing with Ting.  I love this.  The idea is you get billing clarity.  You know exactly what you're getting and what you're paying for.  You get great usability, a great interface, big savings at Ting.  This is a phone company.  They're on the Sprint network.  So if Sprint works well for you, then Ting will work great for you.  And I invite you to go to Ting.com slash Twig and try the savings calculator.  So you'll bring your phone bill to that.  And then you can say what your phone bill is and then compare it to the Ting plans.  Now, here's what I like.  These plans are just serving suggestions and they are no way binding.  So you say, well, but I'll give you an idea of how it works.  I'm going to have, let's say this is a family of four.  We've got four phones.  I'll show you where the phones are in a bit.  And we're going to, as a family, on this plan, use a thousand minutes,  four thousand text messages and three gigabytes of data a month.  And that is a total of, when you add it all up,  $113 for that family of four.  Four phones, everything.  Here's the beauty part.  Use less, they give you a rebate.  Use more, they charge you at the same rate.  There's no penalty.  This is the rate.  You charged or credited based on your actual usage without penalties.  You get free voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling,  caller ID, tethering, hotspotting, and a lot more.  It is a brilliant, this is how it should be.  Now, let's look at the devices, Android, of course, and a good variety of devices,  including the Samsung Galaxy S2, the 4G, because it's using the Sprint 4G network,  and other feature phones as well.  They even have data devices.  They have the Sierra Wireless Card 3G or the Huawei Express.  So you buy these devices, you're not paying a subsidized price.  You own it, they're unlocked, and now you're tinging.  Ting.com slash twig.  Find out how much you would save right now.  I think you'll be very impressed.  Easy access to your billing information.  In fact, for business it's great because you can see exactly how the phones are being used.  You get complete controls over the features.  There's lots of help content there.  And you pay for exactly what you use with no premiums and no penalties.  It's just flat.  I highly recommend it.  I want you to give it a try.  They've got, this is a modern company.  They're on Twitter.  They do customer support through Twitter, their blog.  They post release notes.  It's a bunch of geeks.  And everything from the Sanyo Zeo phone at 105 bucks.  They don't take ducks.  Only bucks.  To the Motorola Photon, 545 bucks.  And the Galaxy S2 is in there too.  I'm sure they'll have the S3 any day now.  It's ting.com slash twig.  Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter rolled out a couple of changes to their search option,  which I kind of dig.  Good, tell me.  Twitter search and you type in, say you type in newsroom.  It will auto-complete for you names and topics.  And in your search results, that's pretty cool.  That's okay.  But the thing I think I'm most excited about  is that when you're looking at search results,  you can see the top tweets or you can see all tweets.  That's always been, but now there's a new link,  tweets from people you follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that a lot.  So now it's not all tweets from people you follow over all time.  It's only like the last week of tweets,  they're not in the archiving business.  They're in the tweets of the moment business,  but still really, really useful.  So if you want to find out what your friends are saying  about something that's happening right this minute,  really neat new feature, people you follow,  tweets from people you follow in Twitter search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think this has rolled out  to the Twitter clients yet on mobile phones,  but I believe that it's supposed to in the coming weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think of the fact that Twitter  has basically intimated that they are not,  the third parties are out?  Twitter's really making some,  Dick Gustav is making some big changes right now at Twitter.  This is the beginning, this new search,  but I think there are a lot of people who say,  hey, watch it.  I think I saw an article that said,  Twitter, just remember MySpace and dig.  You got to consider your community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've defended them in the past, Gina.  I've always tried to push you on the developer view  that they're kind of screwing the developers.  You still defend them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter wants developers not to build third party apps.  They want developers to build into Twitter,  like Twitter as a platform.  Twitter wants you to be able to expand the tweet  and see different kinds of content  inside that tweet on the Twitter website.  So I think that Twitter's announcements to developers  haven't been the best handled.  I think that a lot of people have been sort of,  kind of rightfully upset saying like,  hey, we helped make this platform what it is  and now you're telling us to back off  and stop making clients.  But they didn't really say anything.  They said stop making clients a year ago  and said start kind of doing, innovating,  doing things that we can't do, something, doing new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then they turned off LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they said, we're going to have stricter guidelines.  And they launched that Twitter card feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say don't recreate the experience  that you get on the Twitter website.  So don't show your home timeline,  which is what LinkedIn was doing.  They were showing that your, you know.  So I'm not strongly defending Twitter.  I'm not completely offended in turn.  I'm cautiously optimistic that Twitter  is encouraging innovation in new areas.  When they turn off ThinkUp, I'll change my tune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and this is what it seems to be coming down to.  There are many of us, and I'm sure you're in this camp,  who think of Twitter as the dial tone,  as the carrier, as the signal.  And Twitter apparently increasingly  is considering itself as a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter decided, Twitter's not the pipes, right?  They want to be the media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that it's our content that we made  that we're putting on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you get to use it for free.  That's why they say that.  So the product they launched was the Twitter card,  which is taking the media elements,  the whole tweet and the embedded media,  maybe even your videos and pictures, Leo,  and that can be embedded other places.  So they are building media features.  This is part of the game.  Then obviously what happens on top of that  is potential advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Twitter cards are like kind of longer posts,  but they can contain media experiences.  So you put HTML in your web pages,  and then when somebody tweets a link to your content,  the card comes from your page onto the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The content that you tweeted about appears in the card,  as I understand it.  So it's like, yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an example from the Twitter developer site.  So Richard Henry, as an example,  said there's a whole lot of people,  and then posted a link to the New York Times.  And then what you get on the Twitter website,  and presumably at some point on your site,  Twitter clients is a kind of a newsreader synopsis  with an image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Twitter has to compete  with Facebook and Google+,  which supports rich media inside posts.  And you can see this now, right now,  if you look at a tweet with an Instagram link  or a Flickr link, if you expand that tweet  on the Twitter website, it will show you the image in line,  and they want to expand that  to include different kinds of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more thing that I gotta do.  I gotta send a note now to our developers,  ay-yay-yay, and say, hey, what are we doing about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Likely it's the same markup that would work on Facebook  and Google+, Leo, so.  I hope it is.  It should be too expensive for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Glenn, you're gonna get an email.  Crikey.  It's hard to keep up with all of this stuff.  Thank you, Gina Trapani.  Twitter search, take a look.  Our number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Megan Garber wrote a piece on Atlantic Online  and said that a researcher named Matthew Burke  found that 22% of web pages contain Facebook URLs.  Wow.  Which is pretty amazing.  I don't get the numbers, because it then says  the 242 million of 1.3 billion,  and I would think there'd be more  than that number of pages.  But in any case, that means that Facebook has managed  to embed itself into the web.  Then it says that there are 7.5% of websites, he analyzed,  use Facebook's open graph tags in their pages.  So when it comes to signal generation,  when it comes to understanding the web  and understanding more about it,  one starts to wonder who understands  not just people better, but the web better,  Google or Facebook.  They've managed to provide functionality  that sites are using, the like,  the fact that people are linking to their friends' stuff,  they're linking to their own stuff.  All of those things, the sign-in structure,  all of those things start to make tentacles for Facebook  out into the world of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder how this compares to Google Analytics code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really curious too.  One thing I don't understand about this is it says  that there are more than 471 million total Facebook URLs.  Well, there's more Facebook people than that.  There's more Facebook stuff than that.  So I don't understand that.  And then he says of 500 hard-coded links to Facebook,  writes Megan, only 3.5 or 0.7% are unique.  I don't understand that either.  So I don't really get this.  Often don't I say these things,  but I thought I'd throw it out there  because I found it interesting at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tool is something I found as usual in Lifehacker.  They are so good at Android stuff.  I'm so jealous.  I don't have Jelly Bean, so I don't have Google Now.  And I really want Google Now.  That looks, despite the creepy factor we talked about,  looks great because it kind of knows  what you're interested in and it's supply.  Have you been using now?  Nope, not yet.  You use an iPhone?  Yep.  Well, maybe someday I'll get Jelly Bean on one of my phones.  Meanwhile, I'm using something called Bounce GPS Calendar Beta.  This is a very interesting idea.  The kids say, I know this because I have a kid,  when they want to leave, they go, let's bounce.  We're bouncing out of here.  Do you ever say that, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm actually a little too old for that one.  Yeah, I'm going to bounce.  I know what it means.  You've heard people say I'm going to bounce.  Let's bounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's my problem.  I'm always late for everything, as you may have noticed.  I'm late right now.  We were supposed to start triangulation eight minutes ago.  That's okay.  We're going to, any minute now,  Nolan Bushnell will be on this set.  But I know Nicole,  so this is why you're going to like it  that I got this program, except it doesn't help with this.  Bounce knows where you are,  knows where you're going from your calendar  and lets you know ahead of time,  it's time to leave if you want to get there on time.  Is that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it uses Google Calendar or Microsoft Exchange,  provides a reminder before you need to leave.  You can configure it.  So I can say, let me know 30 minutes for each trip,  add 10 minutes to my travel time or less or more.  It is, it runs in the background.  It doesn't have really much of an interface,  but what you'll want to do on your calendar  is put addresses for all of your stuff.  And then Bounce will tell you,  10 minutes before you have to be somewhere,  you got to leave now.  Wild app.  It's free.  And they say it's going to receive frequent updates  that eventually they want to,  it's Google, this is one of the features of Google Now,  appointment reminders,  but eventually they're going to do a lot more.  It does use your GPS, your calendar.  And by the way, it checks traffic data  so that it will add some time if the traffic is bad.  Now, unfortunately, my commute is just  to the other side of the studio.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not going to be much help for them.  What I do for you.  An hour and a half, really, Jeff?  Minimum.  Wow.  Gosh.  And that's so you can live in the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The kids got addicted to oxygen.  What can I say?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they grow out of that,  are you going to move back to the city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then I got my wife got addicted to it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Gina.  Great to have you.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  That's his blog where he writes  and he made an extra effort to be here for the show today.  Thank you.  I really appreciate that.  Very grateful.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.  And of course she writes,  think up the amazing Twitter application.  And with any luck,  she'll continue to be able to do that for years to come  at thinkupapp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to be here.  So good to see you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be back, isn't it?  Yep.  Yeah, great to be back.  Yay.  And thanks to Jeremiah Oyang  for bringing all his Google I.O. schwag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My pleasure.  Thanks for having me.  What is this, a Clia?  Yeah, look at that.  I dug out that, I was cleaning out my closet.  And it's got Palm OS on it.  I don't even know if I can charge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was my favorite Palm device, actually.  Then Sony got out of the business,  but this was a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's before the touch really worked  and you'd actually have to use a stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You use a stylus.  And in fact, I lent this to a friend  and I got it back and it was all scratched up.  And I said, what happened?  She said, I was playing Bejeweled.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there were lines in the grid of Bejeweled  all over it.  So somewhere I have a scratched up Sony Clia.  You brought some fun stuff for us here.  Cool.  We've come a long way, baby.  You can find Jeremiah everywhere at joeyang, right?  J-O-Y-W-Y-A-N-G or at web-strategists.com.  Good to see you.  Thanks, man.  That shirt, awesome.  Buzz shirt.  That's not a, ooh, is that a,  that's not one of those watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is not the Pebble.  This is a Nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, cool, I like Nixon.  Those are skater watches.  Thanks everybody for being here.  We do this week in Google when Leo shows up.
