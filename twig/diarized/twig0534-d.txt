Transcript:  It's time for Twig, this week in Google. I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo one last week.  We've also got Aunt Pruitt sitting next to me here in studio, Florence Ion on one computer,  Matthew Ingram on another computer screen. We're going to be talking about Google's employees.  They're firing a couple of employees for leaks that are happening. Google's also wondering about  political ads. What should it do? Should it go Facebook or should it go Twitter and how it  tackles political ads? Maybe you'll want the new Google checking account that when it launches  at some point in the near future. Phil Schiller from Apple had some words about the Chromebook,  very interesting words. He's dropping some bombs. That's up next on This Week in Google.

I'm Jason Howell, my fourth week replacing Leo on this show  and Leo is back next week because I think he's probably flying back right now. And Pruitt sitting  right next to me here at the table. He's got to be, they've got to be on their way back. Pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  close. Well, I guess close would be like near the East Coast at least. Yeah, because I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're back in town tomorrow. Lisa and Leo get back in town tomorrow and they're far  enough away that this travel is going to take a while. So pretty certain if they have a board  of the plane they are doing so very soon. But I've had so much fun. One more shot to make this show  just totally blow up on air. We'll see what happens. Good to see you, Ant. Good to have you here.  Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham are not here on the show this week. They are gallivanting. Who  knows? Maybe they're connecting with Leo somewhere in the world. I don't think that's what's actually  happening. I wouldn't be surprised. We have two awesome people joining us. First of all, my  co-host from All About Android, Florence Ion. What's up, Flo? I am not a replacement for Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I feel absolutely honored to be here in Stacey's seat. Can you explain bandwidth spectrum to us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  please? We have a lot of bandwidth spectrum questions. Anything that we would normally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ask Stacey, we're going to ask you and we're going to expect an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, maybe not. See, this is why I will never be able to fill in her shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I learned all that stuff from Stacey. That's right. That's right. Good to see you, Flo,  once again. Of course, I saw you last night. It's been less than 12 hours since I saw you.  Great to have you on this show. Also joining us, I'm just always such a huge fan of your work,  Matthew Ingram, Chief Digital Writer for Columbia Journalism Review. How are you doing, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good. I apologize for being blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think most people subscribe through audio anyways. You sound great. But yes, you do look  a little blurry. That's okay. That's not a reflection on you. I'm feeling blurry.  It's great to have you on today. It's been a while since I've had the chance to chat with you and  podcast with you, so I'm happy that you're here. I was going through the doc and everything leading  up to this show and I was just realizing, man, last night on All About Android, we were complaining  because there wasn't a whole lot of Android news. Literally, there was hardly anything  newsy to talk about in the Android world. But it's that time of the year, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suppose. Apparently, it is. You get to the end of the year and you're trying to just wind down  and focus more on what you currently have in the pipe and trying to get customer service up and  running and so forth. Then you're ready for January to kick off the all new projects and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things that's coming down the pipe. So that's what's happening right now? It's not like impeachment  hearings? Maybe. I'm just talking. I just saw it on the internet. No, I think you might be right.  Things do kind of slow down, especially suddenly it's going to be Black Friday right around the  corner. Then it's going to be bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. So it'll be interesting as we head forward  that. Sorry, I'm going under. I'm going underwater. That was the sound of my submarine  going downward. I did too. So let's dive right in. Let's see what we've got here.  Carson and I were able to put together a decent amount of Google stories. So we've got some  random tidbits here and there. Google will start off with kind of the one at the top here.  So I think it's kind of interesting and I would love to get all of your opinion on this.  Google told Bloomberg that it has fired an employee for leaking information to the press.  That's names and personal details for one employee. And then two others have been placed on leave  for violation of company policies. Both of those employees had apparently been  participated in some form or other in activism. And of course, Google has this, like this is a big  recurring theme right now. A lot of like employee activism happening has been for the past year.  If not longer, but it's been really in focus in the media and the press for the past year.  And now Google is taking some action to control these leaks. Also, letting the new, letting the  press know, letting Bloomberg know, hey, we're doing something about this. Even though Bloomberg  probably makes part of its paycheck off of the information that's leaked from these employees.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sort of a double-edged sword though, because Google has to set a precedent to say, hey, yes,  we are aware of these issues and we're working on them and trying to fix them. They have to  say that to the masses or what have you. But at the same time, they still have to keep some  things private because this is their business. You can't just let everything out into the wild  of your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. That seems to be the catch-22. It's like, does Google retaliate against,  like, is this evidence of Google retaliating against people who are, you know, taking a stand  against the company? Or is this just fair game for a company that wants to protect its assets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only a lawyer would know in this instance, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And that's why we have Florence Ion. She's a lawyer. No, she is not a lawyer.  I am just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Much to my parents' chagrin, I did not become a lawyer. I became a journalist.  I was just looking through this and thinking, like, so I do the material podcast every week  on the Real AFM Network. And usually when we're talking about this stuff, it gets me very heated  because it's hard to see this from a user perspective because I'm thinking, like, oh, come on,  just let your employees have their thoughts and have their feelings about how things are going.  But I also agree with Ant that it is this double-edged sword. And, I mean, in the end,  it is business. And if you, I mean, it's the same way that when we cover Android phone leaks,  for instance, those people get fired and they get in trouble for leaking stuff to, like,  e-bleaks or, you know, to all the other leakers out there. I mean, it's the same thing as when  you work for a big company. You're going into a contract that says that, like, you need to  keep things within this box. And, like, this is what the box is. And I'm not saying that this means  dissent should not happen within the company lines. But I think the idea is to keep the dissent within  that particular box. It's like we have no idea, like, what's going on at Apple, for instance.  Yeah.  I brought this up before. Like, they're super good at just not, we never know what's happening  over there. We never know if there's dissent. We never know what really the employees are  talking about. We only know what we see from the keynotes and from, like, perfectly, you know,  a primed PR packages sort of thing. And I think Google's at the point where it's become such a big  player. I mean, there's that whole point of fang, right? The big tech players that they're like,  we have to start putting a button on this, even though we started this business being this, like,  large open company. So it's hard to put the cap back into the bag, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Matthew, how do you feel about this? What do you think about this Catch-22? Because I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  really see both sides. Yeah. I mean, I can understand Google's perspective. If you're  leaking personal details about employees, you know, that's not something that Google wants  to have happen. It's an invasion of privacy. I can see them cracking down on that. The one  accusation I didn't understand was it said something about someone tracking the individual  calendars of staff and that that made them uncomfortable. So I'm not sure what the person  was doing that for to see, I guess, where people were going or where they worked. I don't know.  But I can see Google saying, look, this is our employees' private information and you shouldn't  be publicizing it basically without their permission. Yeah. Not just public, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  privacy, employee privacy, but Google has been able to track, based on this article, been able to track  enough information, enough details about what kind of information these people were accessing to know  that they really shouldn't have had any reason to access it to begin with. Right. And so that ends  up being kind of the alert, the call. And it's like, okay, well, they can probably really pinpoint  what information has made its way out there, compare that to kind of some of the access that  these employees have had, and then really make that determination that, oh, okay, we have a strong  suspicion this might be the person who's behind this and this person shouldn't have really,  would have no need to access this information anyway. So, yeah. I was just reading the Bloomberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  article some more and it sounds like those, the calendar tracking was related to this Chrome  extension that employees had on their browsers that Google employees felt was an internal  surveillance tool, basically, to keep track of who was organizing protests. Oh, shoot. Okay. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  man. All right. That gets interesting. And again, getting back to, we don't know both sides of the  story. I'm sure there's some particular procedures in place as far as if you have a complaint, you go  to your manager. And if nothing happens there, you go to the senior manager and you go to HR,  so on and so forth. That's pretty much everywhere. None of this stuff seems to be mentioned in any of  these reports that we hear from Google having all of this dissension and issues internally.  I still think we have to consider, did any of that stuff even happen? Did any of those procedures  even go through to lead to all of these different activist reactions, if you will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah, interesting. And I'll be very curious to see if this is just the beginning of  more because there has been a lot of this activism happening inside of Google. Is this a signal that,  hey, just want you to know we're doing what we need to do to stop this stuff? And again,  it puts Google in an interesting position because in many cases, a lot of what they're being  criticized for is pretty fair. So there's a fair argument to be made around some of these decisions  that Google has made that some of these employees are understandably upset about. But what are the  lengths that these employees are going to make a change? And maybe the change is worth taking  those risks. Maybe it isn't. I guess we don't understand the actual data that's being shared

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there. It's really hard to know. It does make me wonder just how good is it at Apple or just how  bad at Apple? Because you never hear about this type of stuff coming from the Apple campus or is  Apple really good at keeping that stuff on the wraps and quiet and handling it internally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what Flo was saying. As far as that's concerned, you really do not hear this  sort of thing happening with Apple. And then a decent amount of information has leaked out  of Facebook recently. The all hands videos, that's becoming a new focal point on  interior employee leakers. It's like, all right, well, there's a lot to be gained  if we're going to target these all hands meetings and get those out there. That's really lifting  the veil a little bit even further. And I'm sure they don't appreciate it when that happens too.  But you don't hear about that with Apple. You never hear about that with Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. No, you're good. You're good. It's the Skype not being in person thing. I apologize.  You're okay. I wanted to say that it's interesting because today there was also news that several  employees have resigned at GitHub, which is a Microsoft-owned entity over not just their  involvement with ICE, but a couple of other things, I guess, have been bubbling under the surface.  It's not to say that this is just a Google problem. I think that we're going to see a lot  more from this Silicon Valley-wide and tech sector-wide, just seeing employees who just are  tired of sitting in the cubicle and doling away while all this stuff goes on. I feel like 2020 is  going to be a really... This stuff started seeding in late 2018, so we're approaching that time.  It kind of fits in with what's going on in American politics, so it's going to be an

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting time. No doubt. No question. Yeah, I had missed that GitHub news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been quietly trickling around Twitter, so that's the only reason.  I just happened to follow the right people to get the news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Flo follows the right people. Well, yes.  Yes. Let's see here. There's some really interesting... I'm trying to find the  follow-up story, and I want to keep down this rabbit hole a little bit, because there's a decent  amount of stories that follow along the same vein. I think maybe the same vein is just Google  stepping in puddles here and there and being like, ah, man, not another one, not another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is hilarious, because it hasn't rained in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. It's sad, actually. It's really sad. Google is collecting health data on millions  across 21 states. This was news that broke, I think, maybe this was late last week. I can't  remember. The Wall Street Journal, Project Nightingale began in secret last year with  extension, an agreement with extension, 2,600 hospitals, doctors' offices, facilities working  in secret. Patients weren't notified, doctors weren't notified, yet all the information that  they're entering into the systems, apparently, being shared with Google, this would include  things like lab results, diagnosis, hospitalization records, complete health histories, including  patient names, date of birth, things that, if you're a patient and medical information is about as  private as it gets, you probably want to know at the very least or not have it happen at the very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  most. I didn't see this, this particular article, but it makes me wonder who was involved at the  hospital? Was it the board of directors that was involved in this? Because somebody had to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. There's an obvious agreement here. The hiding of the relationship was done from anyone  who apparently is involved, like, on the ground floor, you know what I mean? Anybody who's actually  collecting this information and data, entering it in the system, apparently, it's being used,  the data is being used for Google to develop software that would suggest certain outcomes  based on all of that data. So maybe this would be software that could be used in a hospital setting,  something like that, that could suggest treatment plans, test suggestions, flagging unusual  deviations. And that's a- Computational medicine, perhaps?  Yeah, sure. Sure. Using their artificial intelligence in medical ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm fine with that, but just say that upfront. Can we work with you?  Yeah, so why did they keep it secret? I mean, it sounds like a great idea, but why not say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's what we're doing? That's a really great question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Optics? Perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the thing is, there are so many healthcare companies that are doing this exact thing. I mean,  if you think about all the consulting companies out there that have been contracted by the big  healthcare providers, they're constantly improving their tech infrastructure, not just as a way to  kind of attract- I mean, it looks good to have good tech, right? Because when you attract people,  I mean, you're charging us all this money for health insurance in the US. So you want to make  it seem like it's worth our while. And so you have to share data in those terms when you're building  out whatever new piece of software is being used, like between patients and doctors. I mean, we  wouldn't have the ability to communicate with our doctors directly via email and all these other  little apps and suites that are available without that data being used and programmed in a way.  I think the biggest thing here, and I've had a couple people kind of bring this up to me because  at first I was like, what's the big deal? This is like a thing that happens in healthcare all the  time. It's not just Google. But I think the big thing is that for Google, the end goal is to push  a product forth. So maybe, yes, it does sound like that's great to have that machine learning kind of  ability, but you don't necessarily need to have Google to do that. There are other cloud backends  that can kind of help. Granted, they're not maybe as sophisticated as Google's machine learning,  but they can help facilitate that, especially just like with the recent news about data,  what we've heard about, like what Google has acquired from Fitbit, that kind of thing.  It scares people because the idea is, oh, well, at the end of the day, all of this is going to be  pushed to push the assistant on us, that kind of thing. I think that's where the real fear  stems for a lot of people versus what the actual benefits will be as patients deal with their  doctors. And I agree with Ant. We should have been opt, we should have opt into it. We should  have had an email come to customers that were dealing with this company and said, hey,  just so you know, do you opt in for your data to be used for this future project?  Why N? That's all you have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tanner Iskra So, correction, this happened on Monday,  the Wall Street Journal article hit on Monday. Tuesday, that's the day after this happened,  the US Department of Health and Human Services Civil Rights Office opened an inquiry into this  alphabet is of course saying that, you know, they're governed by US health privacy law.  That gives them the ability to obtain access to patient records for the task of organizing  their various health care systems. They say we're doing it the way we're allowed to do it.  Aaron Lipset Yeah, I suppose so. I think what's weird  for me in something like this is like not de-identifying it. You know what I mean? And  maybe there's a reason for not anonymizing it. But when I think of like these big data sharing  deals and stuff like that, at least the small glimmer of hope that you can feel that is that  usually it's anonymized at least. And in this case, it's like the most personal information  and names are attached. And you take that in combination with Google and the trouble that  it's been getting into lately, or at least the optics around what it's doing with data and  everything. And like you said, like you said, flow the optics is just not good.  Matthew I was just going to say, if you're concerned about optics,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it looks really bad if you keep something secret and then the Wall Street Journal reports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aaron Lipset Yeah, and isn't it funny? Like that's a  lesson that never seems to get learned and not just by Google. So true, the optics are so much  worse when it's done in secret and then discovered in some big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lauren Ruffin We're supposed to learn this as children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew I'm thinking a little bit more about this with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google potentially pushing a product. I start to think about the health insurance companies.  I've dealt with the healthcare systems in the past from an IT standpoint. And they can be  quite shy and really concerned about the bottom line and taking as much data as they want to try  to figure out their bottom line doing all of this analysis on this type of treatment versus this  type of treatment versus this age, so on and so forth. But yet they seem to get a pass when it  comes to that because they take all of that data and look at it and figure out how are they going  to bill black man over 30 weighing such and such? How are they going to bill him for his insurance  each and every year? And that's big, big business. But no one really seems to gripe about that. Is  it because they're healthcare systems versus Google being as big as Google is? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aaron Lipset Yeah, yeah. Now I'm reading through... I  was not aware that Google had made a post of this a couple of days ago. One of the QAs is,  was your work with Ascension a secret? And they admit in here, they say in here, our work was not  a secret. In fact, we announced it, the partnership with Ascension in July on the Q2 earnings call.  Rob Markman On the call, okay.  Aaron Lipset On the call, so out there.  Aaron Lipset Public knowledge. Public knowledge, except for all the patients whose data was slurped  up. I don't know. Yeah. I'm also trying to not be super reactive to every single little thing,  because that gets you nowhere as well. Rob Markman  Where's the fun in that? Come on, react. Aaron Lipset  That's true. That's true. So trying to be fair here, but there you go. So interesting stuff.  Aaron Lipset Let's take a break. I'm going to thank  the sponsor and then we'll get into a whole lot more.

There's a little bit of a thread in multiple parts of this doc around political  ads because this has been kind of a thing that's happening. And I know, Ant, I know you don't love  the politics stuff. We don't have to get into politics, but I think the policy is interesting.  The policy of the companies who are kind of working around these things can be kind of  interesting. All these big tech platforms are really considering their approach to political  ads right now. Google is taking a look as well. Sources say that Google is looking to change its  ad policy with changes expected to be shared with employees sometime this week. So we might actually,  employees might actually hear something and whether they share that with us or not,  depending on who's leaking on the inside, we'll probably hear at some point too.  We'll hear about it on Saturday.  The changes themselves are unknown at this time, but the sources think that it could have something  to do, could relate to the types of audience targeting that's allowed for ad buying on the  Google networks. Of course, this follows on the heels of Twitter announcing a few weeks ago that  it would stop accepting political ads and issue ads last month. Matthew, I'm really curious on  your take on this. Do you think that Twitter announcing that was, do you think that's the  right approach here? Because I mean, these companies, they're all choosing different  directions. Facebook's kind of like, I don't know, we don't see what the big problem is.  Twitter's like, we don't want anything to do with it. Like, I don't know, what's your take on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think Twitter's announcement was definitely calculated to, I mean,  it was a shot at Facebook. It was basically one giant sub tweet of Mark Zuckerberg.  Everything Jack Dorsey talked about was directed at Facebook, the way they target and how that's bad.  I mean, so I've talked to a bunch of researchers and social scientists and people who work in  advertising and tech and a bunch of them said, you know, it's fine for Twitter to say,  we're just not going to have political ads. But what's a political ad? If you want to advertise,  hey, we want to talk about climate change. Well, that's a political topic. What if you want to  advertise and it relates to education? Well, that's a political topic too. So how is Twitter  going to decide, you know, this is political and this is not. So this is allowed and this is not.  And we've already seen they're having kind of they're talking about, well, we're going to allow  issue ads, but not if they're politically related. Well, that's an impossible gray area.  Yeah, huge gray area.  Yeah, that's the thing. Everything's political. So, you know, you can I think in a way, Twitter and  Facebook, both they've chosen each chosen an extreme and probably both of them are bad. So  Facebook is saying, look, we're just going to basically let anything go because we have to do  that. And that's probably the wrong decision. I mean, there's, there's, you know, fake Trump  campaign ads with filled with lies circulating around Facebook. It's not just  in the United States. Yeah, it's. Yeah. So and they make money from that. And so it looks like  they don't care because it's a big business for them. But some probably the right answer is  somewhere in between somehow to keep political campaigns from just promoting blatant falsehoods  without kind of, you know, trying to do what Twitter is doing and get rid of political ads  completely, which just doesn't seem workable at all. Yeah, it's a bold proclamation to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we're not doing anything. And it did what it was designed to do. It got everybody talking about it  and going, whoa, Twitter. Although at the same time, I'm kind of like, yeah, but Twitter's that's  like the social network that's like never doing as well as it, you know, maybe should be doing.  So cutting off the cutting off, you know, the siphon of money there might not be a good business  move for them anyway. But maybe it wasn't a big business for them anyways. Okay. So there wasn't  so they didn't have as much to lose. Yeah, that's true. Facebook would  Facebook would lose a lot if you decided to lose a lot of Russian money. Sorry, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Possibly. I talked to Alex Stamos, who was the head of security at Facebook. And we were talking  about what he sees as the problem with political advertising on Facebook. And he said, obviously,  blatant falsehoods are a problem. But for him, a bigger problem was targeting. And I know that  Mark Zuckerberg has said that he's, or has reportedly said that he's interested in thinking  about that issue. That's something that Google is thinking about as well. So it's not so much  whether there's just pure falsehoods. If you can micro target falsehoods to people who are more  likely to believe them, that's a significant problem. So Alex Stamos said that he thought  there should be some form of regulation, if the companies don't want to do it themselves to  restrict the sort of size of a group that you can micro target with a political campaign message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that seems very effective. And that seems to fall kind of in line with what the sources  are saying about what Google might be might be working on really narrowing in on that. Just last  week, YouTube ran an ad that was accusing you know, the whole Joe Biden corruption in Ukraine  policies thing, seen 10 to 30 million times. That's a big swing. So somewhere in there,  it's a lot of million views. YouTube says the ad specifically didn't break the rules,  as it currently has no exceptions for political ads. But CNN had pointed out that the term state  we don't allow ads or destinations that intend to deceive users by excluding relevant information  or giving misleading information about product services, businesses, that sort of stuff. And  YouTube would not really explain why the ad didn't fall into enforcement of those rules. So  they're all grappling to deal with this, especially as we are now less than a year away from  the election, the US election. This is the time it's really going to heat up. This is the time.  Yeah, we're going to be hearing more and more about this kind of feels like maybe this should  have been figured out earlier than now. But no, you always want this stuff to happen right around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the US Thanksgiving holiday. It keeps dinner table just full of conversations. Oh boy. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  doesn't it? So joyful every Thanksgiving. Perfect timing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm surprised that we aren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like advertising food that's the best for food fights at Thanksgiving. Because I feel like  that's the artillery that's in front of you at the time. Don't turn up casserole. Yeah. Don't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  take away the pumpkin pie. Don't take that. That would be excellent in a food fight. Don't take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  away though. That's true. And I would be really bummed not to have any of that after fighting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  physically with my family. No, you planted a seed. Actually. Okay. I know I'm going off script here,  but this is fun. Have you ever been in a food fight? Has everyone like, I feel like that's the  kind of thing that you just see on TV and movies, but you've never actually been in one. I have not.  I've seen one, but I have not been in it. I would love to get in a food fight. I've never been in a  food fight. I've been in a mud fight. Okay. That kind of quality. I mean, it's not food. You wouldn't  eat mud. Back when it rained in California. Yeah. Matthew, we want to learn something about you  today. Have you ever been in a food fight? Oh boy. I have not. We invited you on for the really hard  questions. Okay. Like, have you ever been in a food fight? Carsten, I want to know, you seem like  someone who would get in a food fight. He started them. Yes. All right. There you go. I have nothing  more to add. All right. Good. I'm happy we tackled the really difficult publicly available in the  police report. Don't dig too deep. You don't want to go there, man. I've got a pie waiting for you.  Okay. Good. I'm happy that we know this about each other now and we know that we need next time. We're  all in the same room to have a food fight and then we can all say yes. What else? Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Berries and pudding. What's that? Berries and pudding are the best. He already knows. Through

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  experience. Pudding would be good. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Although I imagine it would kind of go in all  directions if you throw it. That's the point. But it's not like a concentrated like, yeah, it's more  of like a spray attack maneuver. Exactly. The important discussion. All right. All right. I'm  sorry. I had to go food fight for some reason. I brought it up. I brought it up. All right. Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo is not going to let this happen ever again. YouTube rolled out some new updated terms of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  service effective December 10th. They say YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve content,  which really just sounds like I'm kind of surprised that wasn't in there to begin with. That makes  sense. But the thing that got everybody all out of sorts was YouTube may terminate your access or  your Google accounts access to all or part of the service if YouTube believes in its sole discretion  that provision of the service to you is no longer commercially viable. Please explain this. My son

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  came to me this Sunday night, almost weeping. He was so worried about that Google was going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  take away his non-commercially viable YouTube channel. Now, how did your son learn about this?  Through you or did he just find it? He found this through creators who are freaking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Through everyone. Everyone is freaking out about this. All the creators out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Video channels on YouTube. Well, yeah. Well, I mean, that's the thing. What is commercially  viable? I mean, those things are getting millions of views. Seems pretty commercially viable to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's the thing. You got to look at what their definition is in far as  how much are they going to capitalize off of it. That's what I'm looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So, I mean, creators, of course, were worried about this. Also, this could potentially  apply to users. Some people were like, well, what if I use an ad block to not see... That makes me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as a user not commercially viable. My son had a question about that too. He was like,  dad, you can't use ad block anymore. They're going to kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're killing my profits, dad. And not only that, they mentioned in here,  terminating access or your Google accounts access. It kind of alludes to this idea that if you are  no longer commercially viable, your Google account goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to lose Gmail now. I didn't read it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I didn't read it that way either, but some people did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how my son read that if you use ad block or your Google or your YouTube channel is not  commercially viable, you are not a good US citizen, then you get no more Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. I have a feeling that comes from creators who realize they could get a special release  with a lot of views by freaking out about this. Google has replied. They've said,  we're not changing the way our products work, how we collect or process data or any of your settings,  which is kind of wide open and everything. But I guess what I'm taking from that is like,  don't worry, the sky is not falling. We're not going to suddenly start just deleting accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  willy-nilly. We'll just delete you in about two years instead of next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you forget about it somewhere down the line. Google also told Mashable,  there are no new rights in our term of service to terminate an account because it's not making  money. As before, we may discontinue certain YouTube features or parts of the service. For  example, if they're outdated or have low usage, this does not impact creators or viewers in any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  new ways. Okay. I hope so. Yeah, that's what we're hoping.  There's a lot of wedding photographers out there who need their channels to remain up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that would be a pretty big deal if YouTube just suddenly started taking down videos.  I don't see that happening. I don't see why YouTube would do that.  Obviously, there must be some reason that they put this in there, but I just really don't see them  suddenly being like, you know how we told you to upload every single thing you've ever done in your  entire life to our service? We've decided we're not going to do that anymore. We're going to take a  bunch of it down. I just don't see them doing that. No, that's not helping their bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're still a business that's wanting to capitalize on any data that you're feeding it.  It just doesn't make any sense to just start cutting things out unless it's something,  of course, that needs to be flagged or what have you, which is a whole different story.  All of this news, it really did just sort of catch me out of left field. This makes no sense.  Who is commercially viable? What does that even mean?  My 10-year-old or the hot producer like Peter McKinnon or what have you. Even him,  he's making money off of YouTube, but that's not his primary source. He's not going to put  all of his effort into YouTube. Most of those great creators, they're not putting all of their  effort there. It's just another little spot to advertise their services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vehicle for something else. Yeah.  So I would guess that the sky is not falling. Not here, anyways. This sky is not falling.  Other skies, maybe, but this particular sky, I'm guessing, is not falling. I guess we don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the 100% on that. The chat room is asking, but does YouTube make money? YouTube is definitely  making some money. Oh, yeah. Definitely.  They're definitely making money. Billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there was a time there where that was always the story. YouTube's still around,  and it still hasn't made any money those days of long past. YouTube's doing pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Creators are not making a ton of money. The last estimate I saw was like $8 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or something. Wow.  Wow. I mean, certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Creators also make money through spawn cons and lots of claps and all these other buzzwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is a spawn con? Sponsored content.  A sponsored content. Sponsored content.  Okay. I know that. Come on, man.  I don't operate in the world of shortening the word sponsored content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even I knew that, and you're way more hip than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hashtag ad. This pen is so great. It's erasable. Did you know? Let me show you.  I can erase it off of a piece of paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I saw something just yesterday that said on average, sponsored content  earns the person who posts it somewhere between like $1,500 and $2,000 for a post.  Wow. That's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not bad. Do you know how much work I have to do for a post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. That's insane.  Maybe you need to get into some spawn con flow.  That's insane.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ethical implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just saying, you got options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have thought about it. I have a list of the day that I decide to just throw it all away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. All right. Keep it as an option on the horizon.  Google is about to make a move into the checking account making business, apparently.  Again, Wall Street Journal reporting on a project called Cache, but not like C-A-S-H,  it's C-A-C-H-E.  That would have been more clever, right?  Yeah. I think they're kind of doing the double meaning thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  C-H-E-S-E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  C-A-C-H-E. So cash, like cash in your browser, even though it's cash money.  For whatever reason they went with the cash in your browser.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because they're Google, I guess.  Nerds.  Partnership with, yes, exactly. Partnership with banks, credit unions to offer checking accounts,  but not positioning itself the way Apple does where it's like, this is an Apple card.  Yes, it's a Google card of some sort, but they're really relying on the banks handling all the  financial, the compliance activities, the banks really just taking the lead being front and center.  With that information, I'm like, well, then how is Google involved?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Pay?  I don't want to be part of that myself because they've been so flaky when it comes to financial  stuff where it's the, was it Android Pay now or is it Google Pay now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been three or four things. Yeah. Now it's Google Pay.  So now it's okay.  And then it was Android Pay and it was Google Wallet and it was anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still the same service and it hasn't changed. They just keep changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except for the name every two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't trust it. If they're leaning on the banks.  It still works just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, yeah, it works.  I use it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're leaning on the banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook Pay is coming too, right?  That's right. Facebook Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a Facebook Pay?  And is that now I know very little about, yes, there's Facebook Pay coming.  I know very little about this.  Are you, are you familiar with it, Matthew?  Like what's like, how does, how, how would it differentiate?  I just read about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think it would just, it sounds like it's going to be payment built into Instagram  and WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger so you could pay people easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Okay. All right.  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine Google would do the same with this sort of thing.  Cause like now when you check out online retailers, like indie retailers,  indie artists, you can use the most common ones I see are PayPal.  Number one. Number two is Afterpay, which is another service that's come out.  That's like, it's basically you're borrowing money and you can pay it in like increments  to the person selling you the thing and Google Pay.  And so that was like layaway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it sounds like digital.  Do you remember layaway?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Afterpay is like digital. It's like digital layaway and the,  I don't know how it works.  So I've been very curious because I've been seeing it all over Instagram,  like now accepting Afterpay for like this indie product.  And so I wouldn't be surprised if Google was trying to like  get a piece of the pie in this to just become more like more online,  more in every part of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, no, no question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're leaning on the banks to handle all of this infrastructure,  what is Google getting out of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so that, yeah, sorry.  Yeah. Well, you're right. Like, right. Data. Great for data gathering,  customer behavior, knowing about all that kind of stuff.  They have plans to offer things like loyalty programs,  also possibly entice people with no service fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the same thing Amazon is doing essentially, right?  Amazon knows what you're buying and when you buy it and what you're using to pay for it with  each and every time because they, they know, hey, all right, last time you used this card.  So let's go ahead and use this card again. And then two days later,  Hey, remember when you bought this, you may want to buy this too.  We can ship it right now.  It's working pretty well for Amazon actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But those Google advertisements kind of really supercharge  their ability to just hone in on exactly what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.  So yeah, would you get a Google credit card, a Google checking account?  No.  Okay. Anne says no.  Flo, I get the feeling that you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it depends on the perk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. It's a perk sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You all know I'm a coupon clipper. So I need, what is, like, what is the perk? Do I get cash back?  Right.  Do I get some added, you know, things with it, like, you know, sweeten the deal for me because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get a credit card that's made of titanium, made out of titanium.  Is that important to you?  Made out of chromium.  Made out of chromium.  Matthew, is this something that sounds like intriguing for you?  Like, would you have a problem with Google having its hands in your finances?  Don't word it like that.  Well, it's kind of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess I wouldn't. I mean, I just assume that they already probably know  almost everything about me anyway, or they could find it out quite easily.  So I don't, I don't actually, this is probably the wrong attitude, but I don't actually feel  like it would be a significant change from what they kind of could already figure out.  Totally.  They have so many connections that, you know, financial databases and health databases and  stuff like Ascension that we don't even know about. I figure they could probably get all  that stuff anyway. So.  Yeah.  I probably would go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With what Ms. Flo said, I guess it would depend on the perks being worth it.  Sure.  So I probably would if it's got nice perks, but it's not offering anything.  It's kind of a toss up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who do you trust less, like your bank, for Google?  It's like, who do you, it's like the worst of two evils, you know?  Like who's worse, the telephone company or the cable company?  Exactly.  It's a toss up, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and considering that Google is working in such close partnership with your bank,  it's kind of like both of them.  Do you just not trust your bank or do you just not trust both of them at the same time?  Damn it.  Both of them.  So then the perks would have to be really good.  Really good.  Really good.  Maybe you get, what is it called when you sign up for the Google data, like two bucks a month?  I'd literally just, what is it, Google One or something like that? Maybe get that for free.  So you get a hundred gigs of extra data every month for free.  And for some people that's a pretty good value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  I remember looking at your drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you remember looking at my drive, do you?  Yeah. I don't know that you looked at it, you talked about it.  If you looked at it, that's news, that's information that I did not, I was not privy to.  I mean, talked about.  So this is kind of Google related.  I thought this was interesting.  Today you may have heard a company called Apple released a new MacBook Pro.  And along with that dynamite, Phil Schiller dropped a bomb on Chromebooks.  He said, and it's just fun to read the whole quote.  You need to have these cutting edge learning tools to help kids really achieve their best results.  He's talking about in schools.  Yeah, Chromebooks don't do that.  Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they're cheap testing tools  for required testing.  If all you want to do is test kids, well,  maybe a cheap notebook will do that, but they're not going to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a $3,000 notebook is the answer for the schools that have no money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. What were you going to say, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I just think it's ridiculous.  I mean, you know, I give him credit for trying to win some cheap PR points or whatever on  Chromebooks, but it's a ridiculous argument.  I mean, I bet there's the vast majority of schools couldn't possibly afford to buy  MacBooks even if they wanted to.  So is Apple going to give every school in the US and every child a MacBook?  That'd be great.  Everybody tweeted him about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you should go ahead and do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even iPads are expensive, by the way.  They're 300 a piece.  Yeah. Well, yeah, they are very expensive.  300 times a classroom of 30.  When you hear about iPads being used in the school,  you are usually hearing about smaller schools, whether they're charter schools or maybe there's  like a private public kind of funding going into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funding coming in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, and, you know, let's also remember that like a lot of schools are funded through  poverty taxes.  And so when you are in a more affluent area, of course, the kids, they're going to be able  to have like Apple computers and startup camps and all that.  But the appeal of the Chromebook was that it was an entry level budget way to get kids that  tech education that they need to have, because some kids still don't even have the internet  at home.  Like it's it is still a privilege and a luxury.  And I understand that a lot of this comment from Phil Schiller was just about like Chromebooks  versus Apple laptops.  But when I look at it deeper, it just it kind of bothers me because it just feels very it just  feels like it's kind of missing the point of why one platform is making it over another.  And granted, both of the companies involved are doing this for money and to propagate their  various ecosystems among the world.  But we have to really think about like, why?  Why is that school district using a Chromebook?  And why is that school district?  Why do they have like Apple computers?  And yeah, agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Phil Schiller actually tweeted about this after the fact.  So this was all from an interview that he did with CNET that published this morning.  His tweet, he says, every child has the ability to succeed.  Helping them to do that has always been our mission in the full conversation with CNET.  We discussed giving kids and teachers the content, curriculum and tools they need to learn,  explore and grow, not just take a test.  So I don't know, is he implying that CNET just didn't print or didn't go with the full  quote or something?  Is that what that means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he screwed up.  He went about this the wrong way because those Chromebooks are not just taking tests.  No, they are not.  Absolutely not.  These tools are being used to the best of their ability, especially in these schools  that don't have the huge budgets.  Even here in the Petaluma area or whatever, they're using Chromebooks and they're getting  work done that needs to be done.  Absolutely.  I've seen it with my eyes.  Cloud base and everything.  You don't need an expensive notebook from Apple or Microsoft to get that stuff done.  If you can do it on a Chromebook, do it on a Chromebook.  Sure enough.  Especially when there's tax dollars at stake.  Get the most out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let's look at why some schools are very focused on testing and ensuring that maybe  kids, it's because they're looking for funding in a lot of ways that money comes through.  It's based on arbitrary test scores really in the end.  So it's not the Chromebook.  These are two companies fighting over each other for our children's market share, I  guess you could say.  But it is also just like coming out a problem that is a lot bigger than just like what each  child has in their hand.  It's just a little tone deaf to have it come from Apple, which is known for prestige and  for being this premium product that is not the most affordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although they sure benefit from holding that line.  They are beholden to their shareholders, so it makes sense and everything.  They are a business.  They want to sell these things, so it makes sense.  But I mean, I've seen with my own eyes how these Chromebooks are used in schools.  And I don't know, to a certain degree, I'm actually really impressed because there was  a time when technology like that in schools was really hard to come by.  Chromebooks has really lowered the bar for the affordability of these things.  Whether you as a user like Chromebooks or not, just the fact that it enables these kids to  learn how to be Internet users and to learn how to use computers and to rely on the Office  Suite and do all these things, that's amazing.  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple has what, $300 billion in cash or something, but you don't see them developing a special  low-cost laptop for schools.  They could easily do that if they wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely they could.  That would actually be pretty smart if they went in that direction.  Then they end up getting the kids as Apple users even earlier than when they are old  enough to ask their parents for an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They used to.  They used to deal a lot with the schools that focus more on the creative arts.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even when I was growing up, granted I grew up here in the Bay Area, so there's obviously…  Yeah, there's a little difference.  Yeah, but here we had Apple computers in the classroom and then they just stopped getting  upgraded after the iMac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They mostly gave up on education, I think.  Just wasn't making enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only problem I have with the Chromebooks in school is one situation, one of my boys had  to do something at home on the computer and I told him to go to the start menu and he  was like, the what?  And it blew my mind and I thought, no, they don't use Windows in school.  They don't use Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use computers, but they're the Chrome OS.  It's Chrome OS.  So they're learning on Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS is way easier to manage than with scale.  Oh, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely.  Definitely.  No question.  Every OS is different, right?  So you could have had a Mac at home and that could be their first time using that too.  That's part of computers as well, is learning how each different OS is different.  They are different.  They're the same, but they're also very different.  It opened my eyes.  That's part of the education.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Let's take a break and thank the sponsor and then we'll get back into more awesome news  from the week.  But first, this week in Google is brought to you by ExpressVPN.  I'm a big fan of ExpressVPN.  I've been using ExpressVPN for a while.  It's super reliable.  It's fast.  That's one of the things I really love about it because I've used VPN before where you  log on and it's like your speed's going all the way slow and you're like, all right,  I realize I'm being safe right now, but my goodness, it's taking a long time to load  this page.  It's just really reliable.  It's an awesome way to make sure that your network data is secure without slowing that  speed down.  So why should you care about encrypting your data, which is exactly what ExpressVPN does?  It's easy for hackers to bypass Wi-Fi security and they can steal your information by exploiting  flaws.  Things like crack, which is a key reinstallation attack, just as one example.  If you ever use Wi-Fi at a hotel or at a shopping mall, what you're doing is you're sending data  over an open network most of the time, meaning no encryption is happening at all.  It's just like open data ready to be grabbed out of thin air by the person who actually  knows how to get at it.  The best way to ensure that all of your data is encrypted and can't be read by hackers is  by using ExpressVPN.  You can download the app on your computer or your smartphone.  And then use the internet as you normally would.  It's just running in the background.  Once you click that one button, you're secure.  100% of your network data is protected.  ExpressVPN is fast, it's reliable, and it's recommended as the number one VPN provider  by TechRadar and CNET.  ExpressVPN takes privacy and security to the next level.  They actually invented a technology that they call Trusted Server to ensure that VPN servers  run from RAM and no data logs are written to the server's hard drive, even by accident.  So that's protecting you even further.  Like I said, I use it.  I love it.  I have it on my phone.  I have it on my computer.  And you can even set it so that when you reboot your computer, it runs automatically.  Especially on the computer, there's an option so that if it goes offline, your internet  access is cut.  So if you want to be absolutely sure that your data is passing through that tunnel,  it makes sure that if for whatever reason ExpressVPN stops working, your data isn't  going to then slip through and you'll be unprotected for that amount of time.

If you go to the Google store and you do a search and you want to get one of the new  Nest Minis, you can find it.  It's there.  It's $49.  If you go to the Google store and you didn't know that Nest Mini is a thing and you do  a search for the Google Home Mini, you can find it.  It costs $49.  So basically these two products, one the evolution of the other, are listed on the store,  not cross-referenced in any way.  So when you go to the Google Home Mini page, it doesn't say, hey, there's a newer version  of this and it costs exactly the same.  Over here, this is a very small story, I totally admit, but little things like that just bug  me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have all of this power of managing and collecting data, but they can't quite figure  out cross-referencing, proper indexing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe there's a reason.  Maybe it's okay.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite thing was the other day when we put up, because we just moved, so we had to  put up all the stuff back in the house.  I have what used to be called the Google Home Hub upstairs and it showed up on the network  as the Nest Hub.  My husband goes, what is the Nest Hub?  I was like, ah, you missed the memo that these things were being renamed in the process of  us moving.  And I have one of those Nest Mini, by the way.  I like the name because it doesn't pop up the command the way that the other name did  when I would say it around the device.  Oh, it doesn't.  I'm afraid to say it.  Okay.  So I don't want to activate it.  The G word, you mean?  Anytime you say the G word, it's like the device is going to listening mode.  It's like, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you talking about something that sounds like the G word?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you talking about Hey Boomer?  Yes.  Because apparently that will awaken them.  It didn't just awaken mine, but I know that it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That actually happened at my house too, yes.  We're really leaning into that meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also a bummer too because I know this is a small story, but just like  a little tip out there for folks who are thinking about doing a stocking stuffer or something.  These could fit into a relatively big stocking.  Sure.  Then the second gen is way better than the first gen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The second gen actually you put it against the wall and I'm finally using this.  It uses the wall to kind of like reverberate the bass and like actually fill the room with music.  I mean, this comes from just a small little tiny speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, the hardware is like the same size, but they did make a noticeable improvement  to the sound.  I will totally admit to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Industrial design at its best, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can stereo pair them now.  That's really nice.  You know what?  I totally forgot about that.  Could I stereo pair a home mini and a Nest mini or is it just the Nest mini?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to Google that for you.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me Google that for you.  I actually don't know the answer to that because it's only the Nest.  Oh, I'll have to get another one in order to stereo pair it.  Okay, that's fine.  They locked it down for sure.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a bummer.  But still very weird that you pay the same price to get the outdated tech.  It's almost like Google needs to take those offline and like give them away or something.  Yeah, that's coming soon, actually.  Maybe when you buy a Pixel 4 XL or-  They've been trying to give them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll have a stack of them.  There's so many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll show up at the studio here soon.  They're like triples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just keep multiplying.  Yeah.  They have nowhere to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true.  I have one too many for my house now after getting the Nest Mini.  It's like, okay, now I've got this one.  I have no idea where to put it.  Do I put it in the hallway?  Put it by the mailbox.  Are you spending much time out by your mailbox?  I have my moment.  Does that judge me?  Just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's returning on the outdoor lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I do have outdoor lights that are controlled by a smart switch.  That's not a bad idea.  But would the Google Home Mini be very weather resistant?  I'm not.  Absolutely not.  I'm convinced that it would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The two days that it will rain this winter, it will be destroyed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  That idea then.  Never mind.  We tried.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Let's see here.  Okay.  I'm going to go in a different direction.  The Daily Beast submitted a test ad to Google and Twitter, among others,  to test the platform's approval process.  This happens every once in a while where they make an ad and see  how are they being vetted, what's happening behind the scenes.  The ads were filled with debunked claims,  conspiracy theories associated with anti-vaccination talking points,  things like don't get vaccinated, know the truth first, call now,  read this before you vaccinate, want to know the truth,  vaccines aren't safe, stuff like that, blah, blah, blah.  We're probably going to get some email, but whatever.  Here it comes.  Google and Twitter approved them.  Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat did not.  This, after platforms had pledged to crack down on the anti-vax messaging.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so much garbage on Snapchat.  I'm actually really surprised it did not make it to Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they submit it before coffee or after coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know the answer to that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So weird that Facebook, this seems to me to be a political topic.  Facebook did not approve these ads and Twitter approved them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook has a special category for health misinformation.  That's the one thing that they make a special case of.  That and voter suppression are the only two things that they crack down on,  regardless of their other policies about advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this fell firmly in line with that.  Interesting though, you're right, Karsten.  It's interesting that Twitter approved them after identifying these things.  How hard is it to identify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is it says in here that they didn't even do half of what  actual spammers who were trying to spread this information do,  which is use vague language or imagery and try and slip it past the censors.  They just literally came out and said,  vaccinations kill you or whatever and they still couldn't catch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They went as obvious as possible and it still happened.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to see that test done a couple of times, not just once.  You know, because you can't really say this was a foolproof plan based on just  submitting it one time and getting one result.  Well, that's true.  Like, give it a law of averages, if you will.  Right.  Just submit it a couple of times.  A coordinated effort.  Right.  You know, just then get back to me and let me know how it went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to this, Google didn't just approve them.  It sent multiple emails prompting them to optimize their ads.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's no, don't do that right now.  But Google, not right now, especially.  I mean, not, not don't do that period, but especially not right now.  Okay, then.  Well, maybe they'll win the next Daily Beast test that I'm sure is already being figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should run an ad for myself.  I should just run an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you have?  I'm curious.  What would your ad be?  Proceed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The flow feed.  It would just be my website.  Just come to my website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should do that and then post a report.  Let us know how that goes.  Be my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come hang out with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's like what I would advertise.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why not?  Let's see here.  Oh, you know what?  Okay, we got flow here.  Let's talk about this flow.  You talked about it a little bit last night.  Your article on the Pixel 4.  Matthew, what phone are you using right now?  Do you have the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I have a Huawei P20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you think of it?  I do.  So I bought it for the cameras because it has a bunch of amazing lenses in it.  And it does fantastic low light and zoom.  I'm a little upset that I won't be getting any more Google software updates, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it is a great phone.  You bought the P20 before the...  Can we call it a brouhaha?  Qualifies as a brouhaha.  So you bought it beforehand and then when all that started happening,  were you pretty upset?  Like kind of regretting your purchase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like things are probably going to keep working for a while.  Maybe I won't get updates of Google Maps or whatever,  but I feel like stuff is probably still going to keep working.  And then once it stops, I get a new phone, I guess.  And meanwhile, all my data is picked up in Shenzhen somewhere, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's comforting if you ever need to get it.  You can just go there and pick it all up.  You could also...  I mean, I realize I'm totally straying away from the story.  We'll get back to it in a second.  This is a little tangent.  But you could also use a site like APK Mirror, I imagine, to do updates on your apps.  It's a little more work for you.  Yeah, I think so.  There are ways to keep it updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it is a great phone.  The cameras are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I've heard.  Matteo Donning has, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has some great shots with that thing.  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so Flo, I teased it and then we strayed and now we're back.  Pixel 4, we spoke about it a little bit last night and all about Android.  Everybody should definitely go to andriopolice.com and check out Flo's article.  But I thought it would make...  You should make your case here as well.  Why do you think people should not upgrade to the Pixel 4?  And upgrade from what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have a lot of opinions about why not to.  Some of the things I included, some people did not agree with me about,  for instance, how I don't like the density between the Pixel 4 and Pixel 3.  That's completely subjective.  And you can go yell at me in the Android police comments about that if you'd like to.  But in the other terms, we have to really consider things...  This is not a full upgrade to last year's Pixel 3.  Now, I'm still on the Pixel 3 and I still love it.  I just got the latest Google camera update.  So it gave me that updated astrophotography mode.  It gave me that updated social share mode.  All these little tidbits that came with the Pixel 4.  And it doesn't feel like a lot of what was announced at the New York event  when they debuted the phone was going to be exclusive to just this flagship.  Now, the things that are exclusive are things like motion sense,  which when we had talked on all about Android,  I had shared the opinion that I felt like it didn't really come through in the proper package.  I felt that maybe the phone wasn't really the way to debut this.  And maybe hinging a flagship product on the fact that you can wave at it  is not... It's just not a marketing appeal the way adding maybe more cameras to the back would have been.  The telephoto lens is great up to two times for that optical zoom,  but past that you're just getting that really grainy digital ability.  And it just feels like with what Samsung and Apple are doing,  the Pixel 4 is just not really there.  And for the price point, it's like, what is the point in getting this?  Not to mention, it's black, white or orange, which we...  Not enough colors.  I didn't include that in the article, but I was thinking about that after the fact.  One of the reasons I am holding on to the Pixel 3 is purely aesthetic,  which is that I have the not pink version.  Because they try and do that thing where they launch a special color with every Pixel device,  but it just seemed... I don't know.  There's just something not entirely cohesive about this lineup.  Also, to add to the fact that battery life has not gotten any better  since the last couple of pixels.  We're shrinking the battery, we're making the phones thinner,  but we're not really getting the kind of performance  that we're sort of promised in the demonstrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And you are a recent Pixel 4 XLR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I am. Thank you, Twit, for purchasing this here, Pixel XL4.  Well, and it matches your favorite team.  Yes. This is a beautiful orange color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What have you thought in the short time that you've had it?  You've had it now...  I've only been using it for about four days now.  Okay. So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with Ms. Flo on a lot of the points.  I actually have the Pixel 2 XL that I was using before this.  And switching over to the 4 XL, not much difference in experience for me  because the OS is just fairly clean and it's not much of a bells and whistles to worry about.  The photography part is what I was curious about and really wanted to dive into it.  I couldn't wait to mount it on a tripod and set it up and see how well this Astro stuff would do.  Yeah, it was sort of underwhelming.  But again, I've only had it a couple of days.  I want to spend a little more time with it.  I agree with Ms. Flo regarding the optical zoom.  One X, fine. Two X, fine. Go beyond that, not so much.  Two X really did surprise me how well it looked,  but I just don't think they should have touted the zoom ability on this phone because it's not there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got to say the Huawei, I've gone to five times zoom and it's mind boggling.  It's like you just took a regular photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jealous on that point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Mateo had done a demo like that for All About Android where he had put,  I think he was in Rome, if I recall, and he had put a banana, a banana for scale,  all the way like a statue across a busy intersection.  He zoomed in with one of the Huawei cameras and the banana was perfectly intact,  where it was laying against the statue.  I think about that demo and I think about all the cameras that are affixed to the back of the iPhone,  the Samsung phones, various Chinese manufacturers, just to have the wide angle,  the ultra wide angle, the zoom, just throw it all in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not?  I will say this though. I'm a different use case, but I use little lens attachments like this.  Is that the Moment?  This is a black eye lens, very similar to Moment when it comes to quality.  And I attached it just earlier to take a picture of our friend, Mr. Moe, in the security guard.  And man, it really does make a difference on quality if you can give it a little additional glass.  But that's for any phone though.  But the Pixel 4 camera is nice for just standard shots, but you can really maximize it with stuff  like this or if you just sort of understand composition a little bit better. Most people  are just out there doing snapshots and stuff like that.  Yeah.  I don't intend on doing that. That's why I said I want to give it a little more time.  I just haven't had time to shoot with it yet since I've been back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. You just got it. Yeah. I mean, I spoke about it a little bit last night.  I'm really happy with the camera. I've gotten some really excellent pictures with the camera.  And even the zoom, I realized it's not perfect. The zoom, I think they call it super res zoom.  It's like an AI assisted zooming capability. AI is not ready for that just yet.  Yeah. But I will say I've got some really interesting pictures out of it that are  way better than any digital zoom I've ever used. But you still see that kind of crustiness around  the edges, not perfectly sharp, just a tiny bit kind of blurry around the edges. So yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not perfect. Now- It's not an improvement over the Pixel  3. I'm still, I love the pictures. I'm still taking the Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Totally. Yep. Yep. And you'll get great pictures out of the Pixel 3. The camera  systems are very similar, I think. So yeah, if the 3 works, then the 3A, you know, for a hundred bucks.  The- Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, the whole astrophotography, it was fun to try it out for the first time. I've only done it  once. And it was fun to just put it on a tripod and just watch it. And it took three minutes to do  that capture. Now, that's not necessarily saying the shutter was open for three minutes.  Right.  You know, and it's just all computational. And it did a pretty good job. But again,  don't necessarily zoom in. Trying to do astro, definitely keep it wide. And you'll get a little  bit better result. I want to try a little bit more, maybe doing a little bit of photo stacking  or something like that. I know that's not something everybody's going to do, but I think it would be a  way to maximize the capability of it, just by- Well, apparently the Pixel 4 does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that for you with its- Yeah, that's kind of how they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Live HDR+.  Well, no, not necessarily from an HDR standpoint, just getting more frames, a wider shot.  Oh, I see. I see.  Stack away.  Stack away.  Oh.  You know, I plan on trying that out. It should be pretty easy with the tripod and just sitting  and waiting and throwing it into Photoshop or Lightroom and doing what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are a super user, a power user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a quick question for Ant. Where was, you had taken a picture during the fires that looked  really cool, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was on Sonoma Mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What camera did you use for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was with my 6D Mark II.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was with a camera. Okay. I thought you did that with the phone. I was like, ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was in my 6D Mark II. But yeah, that shot was eye-opening because we're standing on  the mountain at sunrise. And to the left of the frame is where the sun was. The sunlight  was shining in. But straight back at the, you know, looking straight out to the center of the  frame, it looks like there was more sun, but that was the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  It just really shook me up a little bit when I saw it. I was like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to California, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's good to have you here.  Yeah. Sorry about that.  P30, that's the one you have, right, Matthew?  P20.  No, P20.  P20. Oh, okay. So, you know, P20, you are still going to get updates. I mean, I don't know how  Huawei is, how dialed into it they're going to be. But these were all out prior to the ban.  I was just looking this up. Prior to the ban, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're grandfathered if it's before the ban?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So you're not out of luck. You're actually in a good position, I think, with the P20.  So you're going to continue, Huawei says it will continue to provide security updates and after  sales service to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphones, provide service and support,  including software updates or patches to existing Huawei handsets. How closely they adhere to that  promise remains to be seen, but they are allowed to under the ban. It's just new phones going  forward that were affected. So that's good news for you. That is good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat asked if they should just buy a Pixel 2 XL. I'd say, yeah, you'd get it a  lot cheaper right now and you're still going to get really good functionality.  Buy a 3A XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or a 3A.  Buy a 3A XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, on the Pixel 2 it will stop getting any updates, any software updates at the end of 2020.  So you have a year with it.  Still got a year.  If you can get it under 200, go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. But even this P4 is going to be marked down even more on Black Friday or  whatever. Heck, it's already been knocked down by about 400 bucks.  Like $300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be down, I think I saw $200 expected, maybe on Amazon on Black Friday,  $200 off, something like that. So yeah, every year people say, you know not to buy the Pixel  right when it comes out because that price is going to drop immediately and sure enough it does.  But that's what Black Friday is all about. Again, we talked about that a little bit last night.  Apparently some Pixel 3 and 3 XL owners are complaining of shutdown issues. This might  sound familiar if you ever had the 6P. Remember this?  Yes, I remember. I remember this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I lusted after that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Nexus 6P, it's been a while. I ran across it and was like,  oh I got to bring that in for my Android.  That's why I bought the Pixel.  This is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the first gen Pixel is why I bought the first gen Pixel because the Nexus 6P was having those  problems and I was like, can't do this anymore. I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the shutdown problems and basically that led to a lawsuit and payout of $9.75 million from  Google for users who had the 6P and it was shutting down and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine was a review unit so I did not benefit.  You did not benefit, okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, apparently there's some Pixel 3 and 3 XL owners who are suffering a similar fate.  Some units are hitting 20 to 30% battery and then boom, they rapidly deplete. You can actually watch  the number kind of go down swiftly or they just power off suddenly and that's it. Apparently it's  not as widespread as it was for the 6P but I'm sure Google wants to avoid another payout.  Although $9.75 million for Google is literally like pennies in the couch.  That's cap fair tips.  But I'm sure that they would like to avoid that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This whole battery thing, I meant to touch on that with regards to Ms. Flo's article.  I think my battery is okay with the XL. What about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My battery is fine.  My battery is fine for how I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost 3 PM here on the West Coast and I have 67%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, I also have 67%.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have 67% also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not even making it up. It says right here 67%.  Are you serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  All right, Matthew, you're the tiebreaker here or not a tiebreaker.  Yours has to say 67%.  Yeah, the odd man out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not showing now.  Close.  Okay, you can stay. That's close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The battery hasn't really been an issue for me. Now, granted, I did turn off the 90 Hz display.  I didn't see a need for it. I'm just scrolling through and looking at Instagram.  I don't need a super fast refresh rate.  Which one? Buttery smooth?  It's already smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buttery smooth spawn cons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't see the need for that.  So maybe that's why my battery is a little bit better than what's been advertised on the  different blog spheres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have forced 90 Hz on.  I take it off at 5.30 in the morning.  I put it on the charger somewhere around 10, 10.30, 11 at night.  I always have 20 to 30% battery. Usually closer to 30%, 30, 35 right around there.  It's been totally fine for me. With forcing 90 Hz on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, if I were to do like I did with my previous phone, some nights I would forget to put it on  the charger. Because normally I'd do like you and put it on at 11 o'clock at night.  Something like that.  But if I forget, I'd wake up and it would still have about 15%  or something like that next morning.  And that's still pretty good if you ask me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what's the complaint about batteries? Is it just because the four is a smaller  milliamp hour? Is that the one everyone's complaining about?  That's the one. Yes.  Okay. Well, I get it. It's got smaller milliamp hour rating on it.  So that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. But you stream one show on that thing.  I'm glad I'm not commuting because when I was commuting, I used to watch TV on my phone.  And, you know, battery life to carry you all the way home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. It is a smaller battery. So that's what's going to happen.  But Google should not have let that happen in the first place.  And I think that's a big complaint is that putting out a phone that you're charging premium price  for like they're positioning the Pixel 4 as a top of the line phone.  And that battery is really bad.  Both of them are overpriced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The four and the four.  They should be less expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And my 3A, the battery is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always comes back around to the 3A.  What is your battery life right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carson's right.  Okay.  We're at 67%. What are you?  Are you going to get a kickback?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The 3A is it does not show you your battery percentage.  Okay.  Tells you when your phone will die.  Okay.  My phone says until 10 45 a.m. tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tomorrow. Wow.  That's outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's it's guessing my usage, I guess.  But it's pretty accurate.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Yeah.  Mine is saying until 12 30 tonight, allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm convinced that your battery is at 67%.  Let's just believe that it is, Carson.  Or 59%.  67 or 59% is where your battery is.  End of story.  We've decided.  Let's see here.  How about this?  Let's sound the horns.  We got some Google change logs to get to.  Not that.  ATC.  That doesn't look like a Google.  There.  There.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.  Didn't mean to throw you a curveball there.  My apologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a long time since I screwed up that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that went in three different directions before we finally got there.  It's all good.  You can stay.  You can stick around.  We need you, Carson.  Google is rolling out the ability to edit your public profile from within  Maps that's editing your name, your bio, and how people see your contributions in Maps.  This is a server-side rollout, so if you're not seeing it yet,  you can look there.  You might not even care.  I never share any information through Maps, so this doesn't affect me, but some people do.  I do.  Do you?  I really don't.  Community-wise.  Yeah, like community sharing in Maps, I never think to do it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my.  I share photos everywhere.  Really?  You'll see them in Landmarks by Florence Ion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew, are you a big-time Maps data sharer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do, actually.  I do actually share a lot of photos of things.  Google prompts you and says,  hey, would you like to upload your photos of this thing?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  I found one.  I got an email from Google not that long ago, and it said,  your photos have been viewed over a million times.  I'm like, what?  Yeah, I get those too.  Oh, wow.  I get those too.  Yeah, so I uploaded a photo of a restaurant,  and they basically use it on their Google landing page.  Anytime anybody looks for that restaurant, they get my photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I have like 5 million views overall online,  because I do the local guide stuff pretty regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This kind of applies directly to you, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's helpful, especially from a Maps standpoint,  the speed trap notification.  You're going down the road, and it'll tell you,  because you turn your audio off.  Didn't you say you turn your Maps audio off?  Yeah.  Well, the prompt will tell you, hey, there's a speed trap ahead,  and half a mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I see it when it happens, but yeah, I don't hear it.  Sometimes I will put it on to just the alert mode.  But what annoys me about that is if I'm listening to something  and it's on alert mode, that's what I want it to alert me as.  But every once in a while, it gets confused.  Every once in a while, the Maps will start going,  and bouncing up and down and everything.  Actually, that happens on the Pixel 4,  and it's super duper annoying.  So I don't know if it's the phone or if it's Maps or what it is.  But when it does that, every time it does it, it goes,  and then everything pauses.  And then it starts playing, then it goes,  and it pauses, and it goes back.  That's a feature.  My God, it drives me insane.  So yes, I turn it off because otherwise I jump out the window of the car I'm driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason just may have road rage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To keep you from falling asleep, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Well, I did just drive back from Joshua Tree a couple of days ago,  and it was a solid 11 hours there drive and eight hours back.  So it may have helped, actually, that it was doing me the whole time.  Let's see here.  A compact, or rather, the more compact version of Google Assistant  is now rolling out for devices outside of the Pixel 4 camp.  It has the compact look that you've seen on the Pixel 4.  They redesigned Assistant on the Pixel 4 so things look tighter.  It doesn't have the transparency that's found on the Pixel 4 version.  Voice, you may remember, used to take up the entire display.  Now it shares the screen better with some of the other information that could be found there.  That's definitely useful.  Yeah, so a little bit of a UI change coming to you.  Pixel owners will get a new sound option for when a call comes in.  They're calling it, I think it's called something like a ramping ringer or something along those  lines. Phones will be able to, you can turn on the settings so that your phone will vibrate  for a few seconds before the ringer kicks in.  Then the ring will come in.  If you go to settings, sounds, and then vibrate for calls, you can find the option in there.  Once that update happens, I think it's going to all Pixel phones.  So everyone will get the update.  Even the Pixel 1, which wasn't supposed to get an update,  but they're getting their last in December.  It's the near the end of life for those, right?  Yeah, they've already passed it, actually.  Google did good with the Pixel 1. They extended their update by a year on it.  And then at that year point, they're still giving two extra updates to December.  One of my hardheads uses the OG Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has no complaints about that phone whatsoever.  Still working, still rocking.  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome OS will now show the date of which updates for the device will cease.  And this is going to be found in settings.  Go to settings, about Chrome OS update schedule, and it'll actually show you the date  that you'll stop getting your updates, which in Chrome OS land is usually a pretty far  ways out when compared to like Pixel phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a Chromebook 2 from Toshiba that's a little long in the tube.  It'll probably laugh at me when I open that setting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking at mine.  I don't have that.  I still know people who are on that Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  I love that thing.  Man, I love that thing.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people just like really don't want to update and it's just not a priority for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that is true.  That's very true.  Chrome is going to begin to call out sites that historically load slowly and badge them,  shame them while they are loading.  So if you're loading a website, say it's website.com,  it'll say loading website.com.  Usually load slow with a big red exclamation mark.  If it's typically fast, it's going to have a green progress indicator  shown in place of the blue progress indicator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many people are going to pay attention to that little nugget?  I have no idea, but now you know.  If you're going to a site, you're going to a site.  You're going there for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but if it's loading slowly for you and you're like,  oh man, is my connection bad?  Oh no, it normally loads slow.  Get your act together website.com, I guess is what that's all about.  Lots of angry tweets coming.  Yes, exactly.  Nest Hello is apparently stuck on Halloween mode.  If you had a Nest Hello, you could turn on Halloween sounds and stuff.  Mr. Karsten rejoices now.  It's like you-  Halloween forever.  Halloween never ends.  Nest There was no way to revert to the normal sounds after turning on Halloween mode,  but Google says a fix has been developed and is rolling out.  I think there's going to be one of these modes for the holidays for Christmas coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kirsten I was waiting for a gobble gobble like a turkey.  Yeah, like a turkey kind to do at the door.  Like, why not?  Mr. Karsten Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  That should be in there.  Maybe next year.  Finally, Google's Teachable Machine site.  I didn't realize this site existed.  First launched two years ago.  It's a way to test training AI models without coding.  This launched two years ago.  They have an update that's coming out now with more advanced training models.  Now allows users to define more than three models.  That was the previous limit.  Now you can go more than that.  Also expands.  It used to be just images that you could train with.  Now it includes audio clips, pose data.  I don't know if videos are in there.  Your own data sets.  You can bring your own data sets there.  You can download the model when done so that you can use it in your own projects.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty neato.  I'm all for getting this AI training right.  Any tool that they can put out there to help make this stuff work  better than what it's been doing, I'm all for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that is the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently we don't have the...  I wasn't sure if I should just give up on it, but I had faith in you, Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eventually I'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whatever reason, it eluded Carson this time around.  Next week you can redeem yourself with Leo back in the chair.  Let's take a quick break and then when we come back we can do numbers, tips, tricks,  all that kind of stuff.  And yeah, we'll do that in a second.  But first, this episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by Worldwide Technology.  WWT began building their advanced technology center 10 years ago and it has grown exponentially.  It's like no other testing and research lab.  The lab contains more than a half billion dollars in equipment from hundreds of OEMs  and key partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp, Cisco, and VMware to emerging disruptors  like Tanium, Equinix, and Expanse.

WWT is delivering business and technology outcomes around the world.  And we thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Before we get into the tips, tricks, and things, I did want to circle back real quick here  because I wanted, Matthew, I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about  your piece that you wrote last week about disinformation on Facebook.  I know we, it's like we keep dancing into this topic and out of it and into it and out  of it throughout the course of this show.  So I apologize we didn't talk about this earlier, but it occurred to me that we hadn't.  And it was a good article.  Tell us a little bit about what you were talking about there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this was a study that Avaz did.  Avaz is a site that specializes in sort of community action.  So their sort of global action on policy issues like climate change and disinformation is one  of the things that they are hot about.  So they did a study of disinformation on Facebook and they looked in particular at  sort of the most viral fake news stories.  And what was surprising to me at least, like, you know, we've all seen lots of  misinformation on Facebook, but they looked at the two of the top most shared stories,  one about Trump, one about Nancy Pelosi, both of which were fact-checked by multiple partners  that Facebook uses.  And so when you tried to share in particular, I think the Pelosi one, you would get a warning  would a window would pop up and say, essentially, this thing is fake.  So, you know, you probably shouldn't share it.  And if you do share things like this a lot, we're going to take action against your account.  And it was still shared something like 89 million times.  Or at least viewed, sorry, 89 million times.  We've not shared 89 million times.  So this is the most kind of action Facebook takes on misinformation.  Pops up a warning, says it's been fact-checked.  Someone has said that it's not true.  Please don't share it.  We're going to take action against you if you keep sharing fake stuff.  And people just go ahead and share it anyway.  And then the algorithm shows it to millions of other people.  And you get effectively 80, 90, 100 million people seeing these stories.  So it's just reinforced for me how, you know, even with all these flags and warnings and  basically jumping in front of people and yelling at them and saying, hey, this is fake,  it just, you know, it doesn't seem to have impacted the problem.  Doesn't seem to have really reduced the problem at all.  Lip service is what you're saying?  It kind of feels that way.  Or it's a problem that can't be solved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not Facebook's fault.  Facebook is trying to fix this.  They can't fix this.  The fault is with the people that are spreading this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That are choosing to spread it even in light of, even in the face of these warnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So help me to understand if you have these warnings on the screen,  there's usually an OK or cancel button, perhaps, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not on Facebook, so I don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me neither.  So couldn't that be a part of the fix for the problem?  All right, we can't let you share this.  We're going to disable that OK button.  We're going to disable that share button on this.  Oh, you can't just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they don't want to stop you, like just they don't want to just prevent you from sharing things.  That's Facebook's choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that's a slippery slope.  Just threw it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the Pelosi case, the Pelosi piece was marked as satire.  So it was, presumably, people shared it because they thought it was funny.  But the report mentioned that the satire tag was so small that it was quite easy to completely miss it.  So that's a problem Facebook could quite easily solve.  Part of the problem with the news that shows up on Facebook is it all looks the same.  Something from a website that some, that a couple of 15-year-olds in Macedonia created,  it looks exactly the same as a website with hundreds of trained journalists.  So they could make things look a little different based on where the content comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If evil people are going to use Facebook to do evil, then that's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  The thing that strikes me whenever I talk to...  So I've been talking to a lot of disinformation researchers about this stuff.  And one thing that...  So Facebook encourages you to share things, right?  That's what they want you to do.  Right.  They'd love it if it was pictures of your cat or true news articles.  But fundamentally, I don't think they actually care that much.  I mean, I think they care a little bit.  But what they really want you to do is share things.  So, to some extent, it's not a great environment for quote unquote truth or facts.  It's just, if someone sees something and they're like, oh, that's shocking, amazing, horrifying,  terrible, whatever, they're going to click on it and they're going to share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Content is content.  That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the end of the day, the choice is in the user's hand on what they do with it, what they decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What Facebook focuses on is the emotional response.  So no one has an emotional response to things that are factual or not factual,  except maybe journalists.  Most people are just, is this funny?  Is it interesting?  Is it dumb?  Is it horrifying?  That's what gets them to share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So true.  So true.  Awesome.  I'm happy we got that in there.  It occurred to me.  I really wanted to hear your perspective on that here.  So thank you for that.  All right.  So we are at the, the picks portion of the show and let's see here.  And why don't we start with you?  What you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wanted to share, this is from a photography friend.  Oh, well I can call him a friend now for Mr. Glenn Dewis.  He's over in the UK and he started a project about almost two years ago, I think.  He called it the 3945 project.  And basically he's going to the World War II veterans over there and providing portraiture  of them so they can have something to give to leave to their family and just, you know,  help spread the word and good cheer about all of these service people that served in the war  and help, you know, with them providing freedoms over there.  And he just wanted to spread good cheer about it.  And it has really, really taken off.  It started out as he had a friend that, that I want to say it was this elder or someone  that was in the war and it's like, let me just do a picture for him.  And he did it.  And then he said, well, let me just take it the next step and just start seeking out more  of these people.  And he's been able to raise money for some of them.  Some of these guys are just not, they don't have the money that they need for day to day life.  So he's been able to like start a fund to help go to a foundation.  So these folks could have regular meals every day and help pay some of their regular bills.  But in addition to that, they get a memory with the photograph that they can give to  their family members and things like that.  It's a really good project.  I think it's been going on about two years, but it's finally getting some legs and getting  a lot of great attention.  And Glenn Dewis is like outstanding photographer, hoping to have him on focus on photography  in the next couple of weeks.  We're still working on that because he's pretty busy right now, but I love this project.  Three, nine, four, five.  And you can just see the pictures on the screen.  Now he's doing the same job and in his podcast, he gets to talk to them every now and then.  And he's had the last episode of his podcast.  He sat down with a bunch of the different service people and they shared some stories.  And the stories are just unbelievable and raw.  And you hear it in their British accents.  That's another cool thing for me to hear.  But you hear it in their accents and you hear some of the stories and you think about they  were like 18, 19, 20 year old kids when this stuff was happening.  And the things that they would tell is just, yeah, definitely check it out.  Three, nine, four, five portrait.  I can't speak.  Three, nine, four, five portrait project for Mr. Glenn Dewis.  Yeah.  If you go three, nine, four.  Sounds like a great project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Three, nine, four, five portraits.com is where you can go.  All one word, obviously, no underscore or anything like that.  So nice.  It's an excellent pick.  I love your picks.  I love them.  You bring really good awareness to things and I'm always curious.  Thank you.  Flo, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we can bring articles to this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  You can bring anything you want.  You can bring anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A twig pick.  So I actually haven't fully delved into all of the details on this particular topic,  but I thought it was interesting.  A, this is the speaking Google.  So this is definitely related.  The headline of this article from New York Magazine, it's how to mess up your life by  trying to use iMessage on an Android phone.  And I just think this came out of just a couple hours ago.  I dropped it.  I have a Discord and I dropped it in there, meaning to get back to it later.  What's interesting to note is that this person, actually, what they did is I guess they got  something set up called AirMessage and you can install, it's a server program that you  install on a Mac computer, I guess, to, it's always running, it's always connected,  and it's to help facilitate that connection to the iMessage servers.  So I have yet to get to the conclusion of how this all ends, but obviously the headline  kind of gives it away that this is a lot more maybe trouble than it's worth.  But I thought it was interesting because we talk so much about being the green bubble,  those of us Android users, and just sometimes how it can be, it can be a little alienating  to think about.  And we complain so much about Google's kind of not exactly synced up messaging strategy  and what Apple users have.  And it's just interesting to know if you really want to try and become a part of that  Apple ecosystem, how much work it takes to get in there without actually having an iPhone.  So I'm very curious to just really dive into this article.  I think it's going to be an interesting read, just skimming through it.  It's making me think, oh my god, this is just not worth it.  It seems like it's okay.  I'll just miss out on whatever high resolution videos and things like that, the stuff that I  don't get to benefit from being on the Android end.  I know.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The carriers have you covered with their form of RCS.  It's going up somewhere in the near future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's mentions of RCS in this as well and how it's like absolutely not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard of ways to do this where you can have something kind of running on your Mac  that relays the iMessage messages over to Android before, but what a kludge.  I mean, but it works for some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just noticed that iMessage was on my iPad and I need to figure out a way to disable that  because I don't want to jump into that world and confuse people anymore.  Yeah, that could be confusing for sure.  I'm like, why is this on my iPad?  People use that on their tablets, I guess, because it's essentially just a messaging platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are reality TV show narratives, breakdowns that have happened because of the  messages that have come through on an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Relationships have been destroyed because of iMessage on an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So be careful.  Interesting.  Be careful with that iPad.  Definitely disable it if you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a powerful, powerful tool.  Thank you, Flo.  That's awesome.  That can be found at nymag.com.  Matthew, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was looking at, I don't know if you guys have heard of the Brave browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so they just came out with 1.0, I think, today.  And I think it's, so I don't know if there's a whole bunch different in 1.0.  I did play with an earlier version of it.  And I'm interested in whether their cryptocurrency sort of payment thing is going to work.  I don't know if you guys have talked about that before, the basic attention token, they call it.  So you can earn tokens and then you can spend them compensating websites that  participate in the program.  I mean, it's an interesting idea.  I like the privacy and security settings in Brave as well.  So I'm thinking about trying it out as my main browser, maybe, and see.  But the payment thing, I think, is interesting.  No one's really ever been able to kind of crack that.  You know, you've had tip jars and sort of all sorts of attempts to kind of make that work.  And I honestly don't know whether this is going to work or not.  But it's nice that they're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I saw that news today.  I should also mention Brave is a sponsor on the Twitter network.  So this is not tied in with that in any way.  But yeah, I saw the news that they went with the full version today.  And definitely worth checking out because it's definitely an interesting approach to  try and crack that nut that I think has been tried in many different ways.  It comes to compensating content producers and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my default, by the way, on Android.  Oh, is it really?  Yeah, I don't use Chrome.  I use Brave, which...  And you like it?  I do.  I do.  There are some.  I mean, as a browser, yes, I like it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  And I found websites load a lot faster and I use the simplified mode  when I need to get something into dark mode.  So before this whole dark mode update, I was just simplifying using the Chromium  ability to simplify text to kind of get it white on black.  So it was easier on my eyes at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love to read articles before bed.  That's how I fall asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that you can dream about all that sweet news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually did have like a weird dream the other night about like some people I read  about an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I know.  You gotta be careful what you read about.  Yeah, exactly.  It used to be it used to totally be my habit where I would lay down and I'd spend 20 minutes  No politics.  scanning through Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are like advice columns, like celebrity news.  Oh, okay.  Like, yeah, not the hard stuff.  Fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I would just go into Twitter and that would go wherever Twitter goes.  And then I try to go to sleep.  Yeah, you're all worked up then too late.  Thankfully, I don't do that anymore.  If people want to learn more about the Brave browser,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we had an interview, Leo talked to their chief security officer,  Yon Tzu on triangulation a couple weeks ago.  Oh, cool.  A few months ago.  This was August 23rd.  Really good show.  People should check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent.  Episode 411 of triangulation.  Nice.  Great pick.  Mine's a quick one.  Just I'm sure everybody already heard the Disney Plus launched and we took a look at  it last night and all that Android.  I signed up for the free trial and then I'm like,  there's actually some really great stuff in here.  I might have to stick with it for a little while.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What will you cancel for it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What will you cancel for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's a good question.  And I don't know how long.  I don't know.  All I know is there's like when you're searching through here,  I've got a family, there's a lot of Disney happening in our house.  And it's all here.  Most of it's here.  There's some really cool stuff and I want to check out the Mandalorian.  So I don't know what I'd cancel.  Maybe for a couple of months I wouldn't cancel anything, Flo.  I'd just throw the streaming video money around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Nickelodeon announced that it would be partnering with Netflix today,  so it's going to be an interesting award for your kids.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They own like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they've licensed all the existing IP and they're also going to work on new projects as well.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My oldest son in the army called me yesterday while we were recording a segment.  And I was like, dude, what do you want?  He says, hey, you got to get Disney Plus.  You got to get Disney Plus.  Really?  You called me to tell me this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, I want to make sure you have when you get home tonight  so that we can watch Mandalorian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
