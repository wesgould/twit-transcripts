Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, not to mention me and Kevin Tovel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to mention the wonderful Kevin Tovel and Stacey Higginbotham.  On my left, ladies and gentlemen,  I give you the Leonard Tao Professor  for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark.  Back in two minutes.  Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York, Jeff Jarvis.  Teaching from home.  Are you teaching from home?  Have you been in?  Teaching from home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At all?  March 10th was the last day I was in.  Wow.  I'm teaching from home.  Today was a big day for me, big day.  What happened?  Not a haircut, obviously.  I went to the dentist.  Wow.  I went to the dentist on Monday.  Stacey's been to a doctor.  I hadn't done, this is a big outing for me.  Yeah.  I'm so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was at the dentist on Monday  and it was a totally ancient experience.  They were like,  they were like, we cannot use any of the things  that aerosol stuff.  So they're like hands scraping.  And I was like, oh.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  This is.  Can you, you know, you need a mask for your nose and eyes.  Mouth has to be open.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're more worried about germs.  They had a glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need all the PPE, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're PPE'd up.  They're PPE'd up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just assume everybody has it.  And that I have it.  Oh, for that purpose, yes.  For that purpose.  Yeah.  I mean, I know everybody doesn't have it.  In fact, it's, you know, I mean, knock on wood,  very few people have it around here,  but that could change at any time.  I thought you were going to celebrate, Jeff Jarvis,  not a visit to the dentist,  but the virtual Chipotle Carstensen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chipotle, wash your mouth out.  Taco Bell?  Wash your mouth out Taco Bell.  So thanks to Carsten.  You see that bottle of official,  official Taco Bell hot sauce.  Oh.  Right there.  I got two of them, surprise, surprise, in the mail  from none other than Carsten.  And thank you, Carsten.  For all we joke, we love each other.  And then came taco seasoning.  Envelope of taco seasoning.  So I have, in that picture.  Did it taste like Taco Bell?  In that picture, it was very good.  In the picture you see, so I had refried beans  and some enchilada sauce and the hot sauce  and the tortillas and the cheese.  Yum, yum, yum.  And I've done it.  And then you see the result of the next picture.  Do you have the next, yes, there it is.  I'm not very artful about this.  It's a little lopsided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you heat your tortillas before you folded them?  Yeah, it seems odd, doesn't it?  No, you didn't.  I heated them for too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy is a native of Texas and probably has a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was not very good.  So I'm learning, but I was happy.  We teach burrito making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In junior high, she.  101, yeah.  You gotta take the burrito class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The remedial burrito class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then as you get older, you get into tamales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, that's sophisticated.  That's graduate school.  So I wanna be very clear here  because we joke each other all the time,  but we joke each other with love.  Karsten, thank you.  I'll think of you every time I burp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  There was actually no meat in any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was what I, my normal order at Taco Bell.  Is this a bean burrito?  Is two bean burritos.  I'm very happy with that, very happy.  And the lemonade, but I don't even have that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ScooterX is reminding me there's some really good news.  CES is returning to Las Vegas in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I am not going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CES, having been a hotspot the last time around.  Seems like a better idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I, I'm not going.  They're gonna have a digital something and I'm,  I just, I, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  You know, the interesting thing.  Stacey, doesn't it change your,  we talked about this before.  I'm curious what this has changed.  Cause we talked about the value of being  in this kind of place in person.  But our calculation now is very different.  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do you calculate the value of that?  I think we're also getting better at doing these things.  I have to say Microsoft Build was really incredible.  That we're getting better at doing virtual events  that have some of the benefit of in-person.  What you're gonna do for instance,  next week with Hopin is a lot more,  is less of a present.  You know, you can get more and more of a dialogue going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, they actually, so one of the reasons we chose it,  and I'm not, I'm not a paid shill for Hopin or anything.  But they have, they have this.  Hop on that.  My event goes.  But you can actually start,  like if we were all in the same event,  I can go to the people tag, find you,  and invite you to like a little private video chat.  Which is kind of the equivalent  of grabbing someone at a conference and saying,  hey, let's go chat about this over, you know,  at the coffee station.  So those kinds of things I think will be helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know Jeff Silver, do you remember Jeff Pauver?  Pauver, of course, yeah.  Pauver's great, so Pauver today had a,  he was running 140 conferences.  He's the king of VoIP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yes, I remember him, yes I know him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff is just a great character.  So today he had a session.  He had Dennis Crowley.  Oh wow.  From Four Square.  He had a 17 year old kid  who didn't sell his COVID tracker site for $8 million.  He had a musician that I had to go to the dentist.  And he had people,  Jeff is just the greatest convener alive.  And he brought together 120 people and they were talking  and they were meeting up again in the chat  and it's a kind of a beautiful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, our own Alex Lindsay does now  something he calls office hours,  seven days a week every morning, 7 a.m. Pacific time.  And it is about 40 of the most accomplished filmmakers,  special effects people, you know, everybody in that space.  And then another 300 people watch it.  There's questions and answers.  I think we're learning.  Instead of saying, oh, you know,  oh, I missed the one-on-one, well, you know,  we're learning, you know,  maybe there's a way to do something  that is almost as good or has some value.  I think this idea of the breakouts in Hoppin'  is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And without the need, I mean,  you know, I think I was flying 250,000 miles  without the need to fly, without the expense of flying,  without the damage to the environment of flying,  without the hotel room, without all that stuff  and more time at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's immense pressure in Las Vegas.  To be clear though.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will still go to events when we have some sort of,  when it's safer, when we have either a vaccine or.  Will you go to as many, is my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will you go to as many?  Has this changed your calculation?  That's what I was trying to ask.  Has this changed your calculation about the,  No.  You know, the bar?  No.  It hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I live in a place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I also, you're gonna, okay, go ahead.  You tell me why, Leo.  Well, I know why.  Because you're a good reporter.  And the best way to do your job is to have  one-on-one briefings, side conversations,  to go to events,  because that's where you get the grist for your mill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I would never have used the grist for my mill phrase,  but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because she's not as old as you are.  I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And because I'm in the middle of nowhere.  We used to get our flour from the stone mill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to run around with the donkeys to run the mill,  but then we got it back out and made our bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it also because you live in a rural area?  Is that part of it too?  That you just wanna get out of there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I just, I want to,  I have to go places because I can see,  the volume of people I can see in a short amount of time  is incredibly high.  Yeah, exactly.  It's efficient.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, on the other hand, who have even without COVID-19,  been glad to eschew these events,  will just have an excuse not to go now.  So I have no intention of ever going to CES again,  because if it's, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't have fun with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a great time.  I love CES.  I don't think it's worth the risk.  And they're all, you know, you're gonna get sick.  Anyway, and you know, this isn't the last pandemic.  It may not even be the last pandemic in my lifetime.  So why take a chance, you know?  But my point was gonna be that,  I understand why the Consumer Electronics Association  or Consumer Elective Technology Association is doing it.  Because A, there's tons of pressure in Vegas,  constant pressure in Vegas,  to bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.  That's a town that doesn't exist  without tourism, gambling, and the strip.  I mean, there's a lot more to it than that.  I know that.  And it's a beautiful city.  I love it.  But, and they've just,  I don't know if you remember,  Stacey at CES,  they were building an extension to the convention center  that was as big as the North Hall.  It was huge across the street.  That's almost a billion dollar project  that will be coming to a close right around then.  Why?  Because it's for CES, they're building it.  175,000 people come to CES.  I don't think there's any way to do CES safely.  The CTA says, well, we're gonna regularly clean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and sanitize spaces.  We're gonna offer sanitization stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna-  But most of the transmission is not through surfaces.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're gonna widen aisles and seats to increase distancing.  There's no way 175,000 people  can be six feet apart, all of them.  Well, it's because they're gonna be lucky  to get somebody that would subsume all of Nevada.  To just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I will say that there's gonna be a lot of people  who don't come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So-  It'll be a lot, it'll be interesting.  The other thing is they,  we don't know what it'll be like in January.  It's completely possible, unlikely, but possible.  Everybody will say, oh, it's over.  It mutated into a broccoli-eating germ.  And thank God there's no more broccoli  and we can all go to CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would be so sad without broccoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat-  Go to Brussels sprouts, please.  Okay.  Even better.  It could be a tofu-eating germ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's work on CRISPR right now.  Yeah.  Get the CRISPR running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're gonna limit touch points  by using tech like mobile payments.  They're gonna provide on-site health services like that's-  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  What's that do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is your ICU next to the Microsoft booth?  Yeah.  And-  You can use a Hyundai-  Microsoft won't be there.  They're not doing-  They haven't been there in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CTA says it's going to look into doing temperature scans.  Oh, Jesus.  And that it plans to issue best practices  like wearing a mask,  although they haven't said it'll be required.  Oh, it's a germ fest already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So-  Again, it was seen as a super spreader event  in the early days of the pandemic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, CES is an event.  It's a super spreader for flu, for colds.  Yeah, a lot of it.  The only time I got the flu was a year I later found out  that my flu vaccine was not very effective  and lo and behold, CES gave it to me.  And I would avoid that.  If I didn't get a flu vaccine, I would never go to CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that's interesting is remember these events,  the biggest problem with canceling an event  is you've got contracts for hotel space,  for convention space.  The way CES, I think this is probably how they work.  This is how Comdex works.  At Comdex, they would buy up all the hotel rooms in town.  And I think it's true at CES too.  When you get a hotel room, you don't get it from the hotel.  You get it from CES.  CES basically buys up all the hotel rooms.  And I'm guessing those are long-term contracts.  They don't say around about June.  I think we'll buy some hotel rooms in January.  They have had those and probably owe a considerable amount  of money for them whether they have a show or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when you do an event, you usually,  you contract with a venue or in CES's case,  multiple venues and you, that's where actually  your upfront costs, some of your upfront costs are.  Most of them is contracting with them.  And this is how Sheldon Adelson made so much money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on Comdex and this is the difference.  Shelley, I don't know if he invented it,  but he perfected it, would buy up all the hotel rooms.  So that's why, and they jack up the prices  two or three times for the conference.  And that's where he made all of his money,  huge amount of money.  Enough money to fund Macau casinos and a presidency.  So this was a clever, I don't know if CES does that or not,  but Comdex really did and it was really effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you wonder too, what do others say?  So the story of Mashable from April that says  that CES might have spread COVID through the whole US.  What do other states say at some level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know, this is a problem, we don't know.  The only thing I've read is, and again,  we're not epidemiologists, so anything we say.  They have debunked that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That story was not a responsible story.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, no, don't.  That's a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm saying that, and the event,  same as the Boston event,  and event has an effect on the rest of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually looked at the genetic strains  from people who had the Boston,  the Biogen conference.  But the CES thing is all hypothetical  and it's pretty weak evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they say that there are two,  there's a European strain and an Asian strain, right?  Let's see, CES secures rooms,  I thought it was the New York strain.  A selection of Las Vegas hotels  and use the reservation booking site powered by Onpeek.  So yeah, CES does the same thing,  which means they've probably already committed  a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you go by through CES though,  you tend to pay less for the hotel.  I mean, they're still crazy expensive,  but there is high demand for it.  Like if you try to get a hotel  that's not part of the CES housing block,  it's usually more than what a hotel in the CES has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's getting rich.  So what happens to the event insurance,  which never had pandemic clauses or rarely did now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean, I don't know,  I have any insight, but look what O'Reilly did.  They just said, we're never doing live events ever again.  Really?  Oh yeah.  I didn't know that.  They canceled their event.  They basically killed their live event.  You know, and that's probably a two-fold thing.  One is that early thing we were talking about,  which is maybe online is actually as good or better.  And the other is there's such a consequence  to canceling an event, financial consequence that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The risk is too high.  And the insurance cost would be now stupendous.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I honestly don't think this is the last pandemic.  I know it's a 100-year pandemic.  What's changed is how quickly we move around the world.  And I just, you know, we were lucky with SARS and MERS  and Ebola because those particular viruses,  weren't as dangerous because, well, SARS, for instance,  you always had a temperature before you were contagious.  So it was easy to,  that's where all that temperature measuring came from.  But we now know that's not as useful with COVID  because you're often asymptomatic.  And-  Pre-symptomatic.  Pre-symptomatic, yeah.  So anyway, isn't it funny how in the national news,  COVID just took a backseat very quickly.  I think everybody was so tired of the pandemic  and talking about it and news.  Normally the news cycle is literally, you know,  it's one day and then what's next, what's next, what's next.  And, you know, it's as if there was no pandemic at all.  I guess we're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not really true.  There is, I mean, if you go to like the New York Times,  They're still covering it.  The top stories, they're still covering it.  Yeah, but I think he's talking about cable coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're still covering it, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who gets there?  Like, nobody I know who's my age or younger  spends time watching cable news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's still a lot of, you're right,  there's a lot of pandemic coverage  on the front page of the Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even like the Wall Street Journal, I mean,  they even have, I know, Jeff,  you don't love the Wall Street Journal, but woof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, moving along, moving along.  I just, that actually was kind of a,  the irony of this is apparently it's been on the CES website  since May 7th.  No.  Yeah, nobody-  No way.  Yeah, The Verge noticed it and put a story out,  and that's why everybody's talking about it.  They announced this a month ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they didn't,  because I emailed them like three weeks ago.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is what The Verge is saying.  They're saying, it turns out,  they announced this May 7th, but we just noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you don't think so?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which would be The Verge admitting  they didn't have quite the scoop they thought they had,  which is even funnier, but-  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I sent the, I sent the,  I'm looking at my email.  Because you were interested

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  whether they were going to have a conference.  You wanted to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I was interested  because I was reporting on IFA  and what IFA was doing.  So I just shot an email over to the CTA to say,  hey, big conference, what are you going to do?  And what was your response?  And they were like, we don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they had decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  So, Android 11 announcement was going to be this week.  Was going to be today, I think.  Postponed due to the unrest in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's smart.  I think it is.  I mean, nobody cares about any-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony was going to be doing,  yeah, it could be partly because nobody cares.  Also the optics, it looks like,  it's been challenging for me to think about,  should we do shows?  I don't know.  I don't want to talk about the tech stuff.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of stores are shut.  I mean, there's a lot of stores.  So if you think about your retail outlets going in,  because we talked, didn't we talk about getting the phones  in physical stores?  Those are shut down right now in a lot of areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony's PlayStation 5 game announcement was this week too.  They canceled that.  I think there's some good sense prevailing  that it's just, maybe we shouldn't,  we should be, Google's literally,  or Android actually literally said on Twitter,  we're excited to tell you more about Android 11,  but now is not the time to celebrate.  We'll be back with more soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked about it last week in the context of the foray,  Google foray, Pixel foray,  but it's also a huge proportion of America's unemployed  and they do not have access money to spend on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have time to protest.  They have time for a part lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, sometimes protesting supersedes other issues.  Although you have to think that the amount  and fewer of the protesting was somewhat,  I don't know, you think powered by the fact  that everybody's been stuck at home for three months,  not to diminish the righteous anger,  but it didn't help that unemployment is at 25%.  People have been stuck at home for three months.  Then George Floyd happens.  It was a perfect storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, if you think about,  oh, go on, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, if you think about the loss of life  that has been happening in this country,  it has gone almost unacknowledged by our leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's stunning, 100,000 people.  It's stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're unemployed.  If someone, all you need is a spark in that situation  and you have time, you have anger,  you have personal fear and a stake in this  and you have lost the faith of your country,  of course you're gonna go out and protest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and the key to this,  I was asked to write a piece for an Irish news site,  which will be out tomorrow.  And I'm gonna state the obvious,  but you come off of the racial inequity  of the impact of COVID.  And then on top of that, you have unemployment.  And then on top of that, you now have,  most important of all, in their family's life, George Floyd.  And then on top of that, you have Donald Trump.  It's just, I don't wanna call it a perfect storm  or anything, but it just comes together  in such a way that, of course people are angry  because the underlying factors have been here  for a century, but they are all out in front of us now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked, we've been talking about that.  Early on, we talked about that,  that the virus brought forth the fractions,  the fractures in American society of income inequality.  It disproportionately hits people of color.  I mean, it's just, and now all the businesses  that are so highly leveraged,  we talked about this last week, Stacy, suddenly collapsing.  It just showed what a house of cards we've been living on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I also, go ahead, Jeff.  Go ahead, Stacy.  Go ahead, Stacy.  No, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  Jeff.  Well, no, so I confessed in mine,  what we're seeing is the last stand of the old white man,  and I say that as an old white man.  And that's really what's happening.  It's the fear of being superseded.  It's the fear of all that.  It's the uneducated old white man, too.  And the racial nature of what's happening can't be.  I don't think that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not uneducated.  It's a legitimate fear to have.  It really is.  It's not.  It's fear of black people?  No.  No, no, it's not okay,  but I can understand why it's making people anxious.  Any change to the status quo makes people anxious.  And I don't think it has anything to do with education level.  It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it does in terms of the polls  and who supports a certain person  and who's rock solid there, it is uneducated white men.  That is the base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is not actually true.  There are very educated, rich white men  who have decided to throw in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are those, too, but the most solid,  ever since 2016, the most solid single demographic  has been uneducated white men.  I just say I'm sympathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand how it's scary to have the status quo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only if you choose to make people of color scary.  No, I'm not.  There's no reason for people of color to be scary.  That's what it is.  It's people of color.  It's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to do with women.  It has to, if we as old white men have been on top  and have had all this privilege,  the threat of losing that privilege,  I don't care that it's legit.  Of course it's completely legitimate,  but it's completely the right thing.  Doesn't mean it doesn't make you anxious.  I completely think that's a legitimate response to it is,  yikes, my world is changing.  It should change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, think about it.  Women have always had to be twice as good, right?  And you see that throughout in people of color, gosh,  four times as good, six times as good.  I don't even know.  I don't know the math there, but the point is,  when you realize that you've been holding these people  who are more accomplished, and you're gonna have to work  as hard as they've having to be,  that's scary as all get out for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not diminishing any, you're anxiety either.  No, I'm just saying I understand across the board.  We live in interesting times, that is the Chinese curse.  It's very disorienting for people for a variety of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what I'm trying to say is we've made it  into an awesome disorientation,  and it needn't be that in a country  that supposedly is built on openness and equality,  and it shouldn't be disoriented.  It never was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, that's what I'm saying.  If we had a great American myth,  I would love us to live up to it.  It was a paradox.  I would love us to live up to it, and maybe we will.  Maybe this is the beginning, but it's gonna be a paroxysm.  It's gonna be disruptive, it's gonna be upsetting,  but it's the only way we can make it this, change.  But this country was built on slavery,  on the complete disruption of the indigenous peoples.  And by the way, you know who's really suffering  from COVID-19?  Our Native Americans stuck in reservations,  getting very little healthcare.  We're still mistreating them.  So I mean, the history of this country,  it's so different from the mythos,  and yet I wanna embrace the mythos,  because that's what, by the way,  that's why we've all immigrated here,  all except the Native Americans have immigrated here,  because we believe in this shining city on the hill.  We wanted to be part of what we thought  was going on in America.  Let's make it so.  I think it's great, but it's anxious.  It's anxious making.  By the way, President Obama is now speaking,  and he's using Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there.  With, by the way, a Zoom logo on it,  which none of us have to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I wonder if Zoom's sponsoring.  I would certainly hope not.  That is another sin in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MSNBC slapped its logo over the Zoom logo,  but there's a Zoom logo.  Oh, that's interesting, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So YouTube, this is a big shift for YouTube,  getting back to some Google content briefly.  This is a big shift for YouTube.  Remember, they were all in on bringing in celebrities  and scripted content.  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on that.  And they had a huge success.  They had many, but I think the biggest was Cobra Kai,  the reintroduction, the reboot of the Karate Kid franchise.  They had two hugely successful seasons.  Reportedly, they will not air season three.  They're gonna let it go to another network.  And there are no plans for a fourth season.  And that's because YouTube's shifting away  from this kind of content,  even though it's been very successful.  They wanna do more creator-driven content,  the kind of stuff YouTube's known for.  That makes sense, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That does make sense.  I mean, one's a new and upcoming model of making,  and there's money to be made there, so, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They recently announced a slate of hashtag With Me Originals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, I think it's a...  What is With Me Originals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?  Hashtag With Me.  Let's get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is hashtag?  If it's a hashtag, it must be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does the pound sign With Me Originals mean?  I don't know, I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Let's go to YouTube and find out, shall we?  Let's go to the video.  Let's go to the tape.  I'm sorry that we are simulcasting with the president.  You can go watch that, all right.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We won't say anything interesting.  You can catch us later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, get by together, hashtag With Me.  Build a garden, hashtag With Me.  Watch a concert a day, hashtag With Me.  Hashtag stay home and help save lives with hashtag With Me.  Meditate with me.  So, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this like part of the,  we're all together in this whole COVID-19 thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're trying to create a new style of,  yes, I guess, or a new style of content.  Because remember how well they did with the,  what do they call those, Play With Me,  where they're streaming the video games?  I think they want to create something kind of  a movement like that.  I don't know.  Which like for things that aren't video games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Secret double treat chocolate chip cookie recipe test.  Live bake with me.  Boo, hello, my beautiful little girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  I was like, that is a cute haircut.

Transcript:  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing.  1.95 million subscribers.  That's why they want to do With Me,  bake with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.  You've got people that you feel are your friends  and you get together and you do something with them.  Here's farm with me.  Farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's cute.  Go cow, go, look at it.  Cow farming, milk feeding, pretty girl,  modern, Tatra, military, truck, cow shit cleaning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is she feeding milk to the cow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cows drink milk?  Oh, that's like cannibalism.  No, it's like, is it a baby cow?  Oh, maybe it's a baby cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, maybe, oh, maybe.  She's feeding milk to a baby cow, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm like, wait a second,  grown up cows drink milk?  I thought only grown up humans drink milk.  That's cannibalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not cannibalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stay home, workout with me, legs and hips strengthening.  Oscar the Grouch says stay home with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a COVID thing,  but also like a let's all hang out  and watch YouTube together. Let's Zeppron

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  global watch party with me.  Yeah, I guess this is a COVID thing.  Anyway, it's, yeah.  The new owners, unnamed,  who's gonna buy this Cobra Kai?  It doesn't say.  The new owners will, the plan is,  according to 905 Google, air season three,  get the back catalog,  and then perhaps they'll spend the money on season four.  But that's really wild that season three's done,  and YouTube's, yeah, nevermind.  It was really successful.  In fact, as I remember,  is what everybody told me.  Well, that's when you sell something.  Right, that's right.  That's why John Krasinski sold some good news.  SGN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SGN.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we talk about, oh God.  Should we talk about Facebook and,  I think even you, Jeff, finally had an idea.  What do you mean even?  Even, you're a Facebook apologist, are you not?  I am not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, I thought you, maybe.  I would not poke you with a stick like Leo just did.  We sent you a burrito.  But I would say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, all you said was the sauce.  You sent me the whole damn burrito.  Maybe you could insult me, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want me to FedEx an actual Taco Bell burrito,  do you?  So he asked me for the address, Karsten did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It probably arrived completely fine.  I ruined his joke.  Poor Karsten, I ruined his joke,  but he asked me for the address, and I said,  smart ass, I said, burritos don't travel well.  And so I ruined it.  But it came anyway.  Poor Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Facebook's employees, some high profile employees  actually quitting, the rest doing a virtual walkout,  upset over Mark Zuckerberg's continued unwillingness  to censor the president.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thoughts?  I'd walk out too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know what Mark Zuckerberg's doing here,  but it's not a good look for him.  And we've all known that he is not the most empathetic  human being on the planet.  So in a job that.  Can you deny he's doing exactly what's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for the company?  Oh yeah.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it hurts the company, yes.  It hurts the company, okay.  Oh yeah.  So I really don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wrote a piece.  He has said, and I don't disagree with this.  He said it on Fox News,  social media platforms should not fact check the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said.  When your president is not telling the truth,  maybe you don't fact check a president when they're.  Actually, I think you should always fact check a president,  but that's just my journalistic training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's the battle field.  I think that's the job of journalists and newspapers.  Is it the job of the platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, no.  And that's why it's a false battlefield, I think.  So what I argue is the issue here isn't fact checking him.  The issue here isn't taking him down either.  I think Twitter did the right thing.  The issue here is what does Facebook stand for?  And by doing nothing and choosing to do nothing,  Facebook all but endorses the behavior.  And when you have your employees walking out  and you have this going on,  when you are in the midst of this horrible crisis  and this is happening,  you can no longer just stand back and say,  oh, it's freedom of expression.  He has plenty of expression.  It's not the issue.  And nor can you stand back and say,  oh, we don't fact check.  That's not the issue.  The issue is what does Facebook stand for?  What does Mark Zuckerberg stand for?  What does this give to the public  and the community that he has there?  And he can't run away from that.  So I think the Jack and Mark got into a fact check fight there.  I think that's the wrong place to go here.  They fact check stuff.  That's not what is needed here.  What's needed is for Mark Zuckerberg to say,  this is unacceptable.  Inciting violence is unacceptable.  And he's not sane.  And that's why it's bad for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it were ISIS putting up a post,  they would not only say that,  they would take it down, right?  In fact, they do.  They take terrorist posts down.  They don't want terrorists-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Terrorist posts down, but head of state posts,  I think I can argue that Jack did the right thing,  leaving it up, but not promoting it,  putting a warning in front of it,  in the one case adding more information,  but leaving it up for people to see what he says,  I think is a legitimate decision that Jack made.  But I think that Mark Zuckerberg,  the other thing I said was,  it's time to have,  this is what I said before last weekend,  there's time to have a meeting of the oversight board,  and the oversight board should have their own damn meeting,  whether or not Facebook likes it.  If they don't, then why does it exist?  Now of all times, it has to.  And one of them is a friend of mine,  Alan Rusberger, the former editor of The Guardian,  and I haven't communicated with him on this,  but if they don't at least deliberate on this issue,  and there are things to deliberate on here,  there are choices.  I'm not suggesting that this is a case  where the oversight board gives Mark Zuckerberg  an order, no,  but if any, you have 20 brilliant people there  and you don't convene them to at least advise, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also spoke to the president on Friday.  That's scary in and of itself.  Apparently does that regularly,  at least I saw some reporting.  That's scary.  I really don't know what the answer is.  On the one hand, I almost feel like  they should be common carriers like the phone company  and they should just put up whatever anybody wants  to put up, put up.  If they did that, I think there would be a lot more  willingness on the part of its users to,  both Twitter and Facebook,  to think critically about the stuff they see  knowing that anything goes.  It gives a false sense of security  if Facebook blocks some stuff like,  oh well, the worst stuff is not getting up here  so I probably can trust most of it.  That seems bad too.  And then it really seems bad to put anybody,  especially a Silicon Valley executive,  in charge of determining right and wrong.  That seems pretty tough.  What would be wrong if Facebook and Twitter just said,  okay, anything goes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that may be where we end up  without Section 230 in a sense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Same mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The back end of this,  the back end of this is,  Section 230 gives them the sword and the shield, both.  So everybody concentrates on the shield,  but it gives them the sword.  What happened before 230,  and I highly recommend Jeff Kossoff's book,  The 26 Words that Created the Internet.  It is the definitive work on 230.  Before 230, what publishers said,  my lawyers said to me was,  no, no, no, no, no, no, don't touch anything  because if you touch it once,  then you fail the next time,  then you are more liable.  That's what 230 got rid of.  So you're gonna have one extreme or another.  You're gonna have, on the one extreme,  nobody could do nothing here  because I could get in trouble for it,  or the other extreme is, I'm not touching nothing  because I don't wanna be blamed for it.  I'm just a common carrier man.  And that would be an awful, awful internet.  Now, I also put up a post.  I'm gonna go off for one second here, pardon me.  But I put up a post where I took Benjamin Franklin's 1761,  I think it was, apology for printers.  And he wasn't an apology at all,  but people were pissed at him  for the stuff that he was printing.  And it wasn't so much his newspaper,  it was the ads that he printed for people.  And they got mad at him.  And he went on a beautiful rant  that I took the word printer out  and added in platform and social media and post and serve  instead of the verb and noun print and printer.  And it becomes clear that Franklin saw  that printing was a platform.  And he said, there are things that I will not print.  But if all you want is the things I agree with,  you're not gonna like that.  Or if all you want is the things  that you want and agree with, that's impossible.  So he saw printing as a platform.  But he made judgments.  He said, there are things that I will not do.  And Zuckerberg too makes judgments.  And he's not made a judgment about Trump.  And that's where he's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, he pointed out in the phone call,  they pulled a Trump ad down in March  that misled users into thinking a campaign survey  was the census, the US census.  They did take that down.  So he takes something down.  He said in this phone call,  this is the Verge reporting,  that he's worried that free speech will only ratchet down.  Over time, he said, in general,  we tend to add more policies  to restrict things more and more.  If every time there's something that's controversial,  your instinct is, okay, let's restrict a lot,  then you do end up restricting a lot of things  that I think eventually be good for everyone.  It is kind of Franklin-esque what he said.  There's some things that we won't do,  but most of the things we let-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but his line is very, sorry, Stacey,  his line is a millimeter up from sea level.  It's not very high.  Stacey, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say he has made plenty,  and Facebook as a platform  has made plenty of editorial judgments.  Well, you could argue,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the algorithm does that in the newsfeed every single second,  whether it's editorial or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and they focus on how to tune that.  And they have historically made,  there's a couple things,  and if you look at even free speech in the US,  there are things that,  fire in a crowd of theaters, one of our favorites, right?  There is pornography, obscenity,  that's not actually a free speech.  I think that's a sending it through the mail  kind of legal argument.  But there are things that we have,  as a society, made a judgment about.  There are things that,  and I should say as a society  based on constitutional rights.  As a private company, Zuckerberg and Co.  have made similar editorial judgments  about similar categories.  Breasts.  And sometimes, they've been wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, I mean, they did the naked children  and the Vietnam photo and breasts and breastfeeding, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the key that I think we're looking for here is,  do you say the president is lying,  or do you say we don't wanna incite violence,  which is kind of like a fire in a crowded theater argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ding, ding, ding, ding, exactly, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is a really hard,  these are big constitutional law cases for a reason.  They're hard for people,  and we have all these educated judges and lawyers  that paid a lot and have thought about this a lot.  We have dozens of really smart people  basically trying to figure this stuff out,  and they really haven't been able to.  I mean, I'll know it when I see it,  it's kind of a big dodge.  It was probably the, it's the right call,  but it's a dodge.  So leaving that to,  what is essentially Mark Zuckerberg?  That is scary, and that's what I think people  freak out about is because you've got,  how old is he, 35, 38?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and as somebody pointed out on Twitter,  here you have a guy who never was not rich.  Like he never had a chance.  He never had a chance to have normal developmental 20s.  He went zero to a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have this person who is probably more isolated  than other people whose life experience  does not at all mirror any.  And there is even a legal argument in,  or an argument in legal circles,  how much does life experience,  how much should it affect your arguments, your judgments?  If you talk to like Sonia Santamaior,  she's like, yes, 100%.  You talk to someone like John Roberts,  he's probably like, no, even though it does.  So you've got this person who is probably completely  unequipped to really see and understand the issue  at a level that they should,  and at the importance that his employees  and his users think is real.  And so I think the walkout here is a cry to saying,  hey, listen to us.  You're not the only designer here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me understand that, Stacey.  I'm agreeing with everything you're saying,  but I think there's a little bit of a conundrum in there,  is that in the end,  so what I think I hear you saying is, and I agree,  as I said it too, make this judgment  with the help of others, with the help of your employees  and your users and the oversight board and smart people.  However, it's still his decision then,  because he's the boss, it's his party.  So in a way I hear you saying,  I don't trust you to make this decision,  Zuckerberg, don't make it.  On the other hand, I'm hearing you saying,  yeah, no, make it.  How rich is it there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't trust him to make the decision in isolation.  Alone.  Well isn't that why he created this editorial board

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or whatever they call it?  No, that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you can actually make this decision.  And that's why I feel,  I want to fall down on one side or the other.  Theoretically, you should be able to make this decision.  But the Mark Zuckerberg we've known  is not someone who I would trust to make this decision  even after he's listened to people.  And it's not just because I disagree with his decision,  I just don't feel like he's empathetic enough.  He's not, he doesn't have the mindset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he's the boss.  But he is the boss.  And so I'm going to push you a little bit.  Okay.  He's the hand you're dealt.  So what do you expect of him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you want him to do?  I mean, if he behaves like this, I expect,  I mean, I am glad that his employees are walking out.  I am, hopefully his users will abandon ship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to quote Casey Newton here in The Verge  who says that the people he spoke to  said that the majority of Facebook employees supported Mark.  It was a small group,  it was only a hundred so people in the walkout.  But people were reluctant to say they supported Mark  because it was such a flash point.  Yeah, they didn't want the opprobrium.  Zuckerberg, this is, so Newton got this,  got a recording of this presentation  that Mark did on Tuesday to his staff.  And one of the quotes,  according to the recording obtained by The Verge,  Zuckerberg described being upset by Trump's recent posts,  one of which warned protesters  that when the looting starts, the shooting starts,  but quote, and this is Zuckerberg speaking,  I knew that I needed to separate out my personal opinion  from what our policy is  and the principles of the platform we are running are,  knowing that the decision we made was going to lead  to a lot of people being very upset inside the company  and a lot of the media criticism we're going to get.  So he's not completely unaware.  He sounds like he's self-aware.  He can't be unaware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is the same thing, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've given this guy, rightly or wrongly,  this guy has huge influence worldwide.  He's got, he's a two and a half billion.  Well, I think you're actually giving him too much credit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  A lot of people get their news from Facebook.  A lot, like, a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think most people see Donald Trump on Facebook.  I don't think anybody sees Donald Trump on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not even, that's not even Jermain.  They get their news from Facebook  and from the algorithmically generated Facebook news.  And they get weird news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get news that promotes Trump or promotes his-  They get very little news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whatever they're doing.  2%, 2% of their, I mean, it was 4% of its highest was news.  They get hardly any news from Facebook.  Very little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is to say, people don't get much news.  No, I got rid of Facebook again,  because I couldn't take it.  But for the month or two I was on Facebook,  there's definitely in that stream content that-  That's you.  That sways you one way or the other.  You're weird.  I don't think so.  It wasn't just my family and friends.  Most people aren't getting news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most news is a tiny, tiny portion.  Now I can argue that.  It's all, everything in there is opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of some kind or another.  It's a polemic of some kind or another.  Even if it's just-  About burritos.  Even if it's just, well, maybe it's burritos,  but most, but it's not.  It's a lot of time, oh, look at this influencer  pretending to drill on, you know, put up a board  and then getting in a Mercedes.  There's content in there.  You may not call it news in your standard of what news is.  It's news in the standard of what humans consider  information about the world around them.  And Mark controls it.  He has a huge bully pulpit.  Now I don't think he controls it with his,  like, oh, we should do this, we should do that.  I think he is not that, I mean,  I think the algorithm controls it.  And he gives, he and his team give the rules  to the algorithm.  I think you're going-  They're very powerful, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't say they're not powerful.  Yeah, but I think in ways that do not have evidence.  I don't think evidence is there.  Nonetheless, nonetheless-  I'm critical of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you don't think that people make decisions  about politics based on what,  some degree based on what they read on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I come back to Ben Franklin and John Milton and-  But Franklin, when Franklin's talking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's talking as a, not a publisher, but as a printer, right?  No, he was talking as both.  Cause he ran a print shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did have a newspaper.  He was also a publisher, he had a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I bet you that he made a distinction  between what he'd be willing to run  through his printing press  and what he would be putting out over his name  in his newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know, we're actually not sure, we,  historians aren't sure what the apology is referring to,  what kerfuffle, because they don't have the record.  It was probably an ad in the newspaper.  But we also have John Milton.  And John Milton wrote the legendary  Areopagitica in 1644,  against the licensing of books in the UK.  And I saw a lot of parallels between the oversight board  and the stationers company,  which was a private entity that was supposed to license  and protect us from bad books.  And Milton was inspired in great measure  by his visit to Galileo,  while Galileo was on house arrest,  because he had dangerous ideas.  And Milton is saying that if we don't exercise our minds  by hearing the good and the bad,  and finally deciding what is good,  then I'll be less particular than him.  We're gonna end up with mush minds, right?  So that's why I like Jack's view.  Leave it up, it's out there anyway.  The New York Times is gonna report it.  It's gonna be all over.  But Jack had a stand.  Jack said this incites violence.  That's the question I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he took stands, it was very late to the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh he was, and I disagree with his stand about ads.  I disagree with lots of things.  I'm just saying that in this one moment in time,  I'll praise the one and push more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will say that Jeff, you are in the minority,  according to Pew, 88% of Americans  say that social media companies now have at least  some control over the mix of news that people see each day.  55% of US adults get their news from social media  either often or sometimes, which is up 8% from 2018.  28% say they get their news often from social media,  up from 20% in 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's, what does that mean Leo?  That means oftentimes-  That people get their news from Facebook.  Who do I follow?  It's not Facebook, it's who you choose  to follow on Facebook.  If you follow some of my neighbors-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook shows you things that,  once you start clicking on things,  Facebook will start showing you more things like it.  And that's how you get people escalating down  this weird trail of like conspiracy theories  and anti-vax data or think about all the stuff  targeting moms around-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook shows you a subset of the people  you follow full stop.  So if you don't follow Alex Jones,  you don't see Alex Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should follow.  It also recommends who you will follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  Yeah, but I don't think that's,  I would argue that's not a major factor  and I wanna see the evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that is not true at all because when I,  like when you go on Facebook and it's like,  oh, you know, it's kinda like you're interested in this.  Their whole business model is to find demographics  that you fit in and to draw your attention to those things.  And they do a really good job of it.  And if you're sort of trying out weird ideas,  they'll help you try those out till you get  all the way down the path of those weird ideas.  That's what they do.  That's how they make their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real problem I have with both of your arguments here  is that it's a case of the third person effect, right?  There's tons of people out there that are affected by this,  but I'm okay.  I'm above it.  But there's a lot of people who are just too stupid for this.  And I think we always, that's what both Franklin and Milton  are trying to say to us.  You weren't until a minute ago,  but then you started into the,  oh, the algorithm is really taking people down a bad spot  and it's gonna ruin them.  I don't buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Researchers have looked at Facebook  and seen that people are unaware  that the algorithm is picking stuff up for them  and even deciding what posts they see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, the next step, Stacey,  does this change their whole worldview?  I don't-  Does it change everybody's?  It does change some.  And it pushes people-  Oh, I think they were already there, man.  They were already there.  No.  Which goes back to our first discussion.  We were a racist country  where the racists are gonna find racist.  Sorry, Carson, you gotta end that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're wrong on this one.  How many things have you bought  based on seeing Instagram ads for,  what was that linen shirt that you think?  Some jacket.  I wouldn't wear a linen shirt.  That's why I also deleted for Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Lord, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, I would not wear a linen shirt.  You bought a jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You bought some weird jacket.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did buy a jacket on Instagram.  Yeah, people complimented me.  It's a nice jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a nice jacket.  What's the problem?  Yeah, yeah.  I watched certain shows and there were certain ads on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are there ads on this show?  You see something enough times?  There's influence and you go down that path.  And especially, and this is really important,  if you are in a vulnerable spot  or maybe you feel sad or whatever,  if you feel that, then you're more vulnerable  to those messages.  And yes, you could be smart as anything,  but you're still gonna buy the jacket  that you've seen.  Show me those studies.  I'm sorry, but that's third person effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some people are vulnerable, but I'm not.  People are not.  They're vulnerable out there.  This is gonna affect them.  No, no.  They're sheeple, but I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are not born racist.  That's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they're trained racists very early in their lives.  They're trained racists.  Yeah, by their parents.  Oh, it's only their parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  You're saying only the parents train them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfectly sane, well-educated, normal person  and give them Facebook for a week  and they're gonna turn into a complete not racist.  But there's a gradual erosion.  It's the myth of the filter bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that the anti-vax movement  would be as widespread and strong as it is  without the help of social media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes, because I've been in the kind of towns  where that would not.  It would not.  Absolutely would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I lived in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Austin, Austin.  Oh, she's frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she's frozen.  Hold on a sec, we'll get her back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that horrible sound.  That ringing back.  There you are, you're back.  You said you lived in Austin and then you froze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I lived in Austin by friends who went to Waldorf schools.  I can tell you that not everybody is anti-vax,  but with Facebook, more and more of them were,  they would consider things  that they wouldn't consider before.  Yeah, I agree.  But with consideration, absent absolute scientific certainty,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you kind of hate other people.  It might play into your predisposition,  but if you didn't consume these kind of,  it's YouTube too, by the way,  YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook,  but YouTube and Facebook primarily for normal people.  And I think you might have a predisposition  to believe that thing,  but it's the constant repetition of it  from a variety of sources that we just go,  oh, well, everybody believes this, it must be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me be very clear that we know what we know  about the murder of George Floyd  from a 17-year-old putting the video up on Facebook.  That is how we know it,  because mainstream media isn't covering this,  never covered this,  it's only because of Living While Black  and Black Lives Matter on social media  that we have the movements we have now  to try to tear down the racism that you say  is being built there.  So this is what Franklin is saying.  You're going to have both, and at the end,  the only solution to this is not an algorithm  and not a regulation, it's education, full stop.  And the problem is that there are uneducated people  who don't respect science and don't respect other people,  and that's our problem in society,  and we're ignoring that fundamentally  by trying to blame in, get ready, get ready,  moral panic about the technology and the algorithm.  We're going for an easy bad guy and an easy answer.  The problem is this country has devalued education  over generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's more nuanced than that.  I think that all humans have a lot of inputs,  and you can drown out some bad inputs like Facebook  with good inputs like education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But-  Don't call Facebook entirely a bad influence.  What did I just say about George Floyd?  Well, I'm not convinced that the news media-  To dismiss it entirely, you are dismissing the people  who are using this platform for that purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not convinced that the news media didn't have a lot  to do with the dissemination of that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After that, yes, but the only way it started,  was because of course they did, of course they did.  But it started because that brave,  probably scarred for life 17-year-old girl, young woman,  had the courage to record a murder by police in front of her  and put it onto social media  because that was what she was capable of,  which wasn't there years ago.  True, it was much easier for her to publish it.  To dismiss Facebook as this cesspool was really bad,  that has no nuance, Leo, that has zero nuance.  You're dismissing all the voices that are then there.  That is Franklin's point, that is Milton's point.  Well, actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm arguing for zero control.  I think that it's a mistake to show some control  because I think that's misleading.  And it also lends to editorializing  by some guy who just happened to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think Jack did the wrong thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, I mean, I choose to avoid the streams,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think he did the right thing on Twitter.  Is that what we're talking about, the Twitter?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just making sure, I just want to clarify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What decision do you think,  if you could sit down with Zuckerberg  at a very nice dinner in his house and tell him,  and he left saying, you're right, Stacey,  what would you tell him?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't talk to Mark Zuckerberg, we talked about memcache,  so I'm like, well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Oh no, we froze again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good way to freeze, though, I must say.  I think that's literally Stacey's response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, that was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that's a great question because,  yeah, I mean, the problem is, this is a tough,  this is hard, it's very difficult.  Yeah, it's very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you bought yourself time with the freeze there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, sorry, I would ask him where his loyalties lie.  I would want to understand,  is this a moment to do the best for your business?  Is this the moment to do the best for the country?  Is there a larger picture that you should think about here?  Because for his business, maybe it's, I don't know,  he knows way more about what's going on  under the covers at Facebook than I do.  So maybe that's the right decision based on his strategy  and where he's trying to take it.  But as a, businesses do not exist,  I know they feel like they do today,  but they exist as part of a society.  And I don't think it was the right decision for society.  And I would try to convince him of that.  I have to say, neither Facebook nor Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had any difficulty with COVID-19  and blocking bad information on both of-  Science is a lot different from politics.  Right, so I think that it's possible to do a good job  in some circumstances.  It's much more difficult  when you have a norm-busting president  who is willing to use those platforms for his own ends  to know how to handle this.  Because the norm says the president  should have a bully pulpit.  Now, as Denise Howell pointed out on a Sunday,  he doesn't, he's got a bully pulpit  with or without Twitter.  Yeah.  So, but he's very, very good at using Twitter  and Brad Parscale, his campaign manager,  is very, very good at using Facebook.  And that is a lot harder than saying,  well, this is bad scientific information.  So I don't know.  And that's the problem is,  who should be the arbiter of truth?  It's one thing to say  who should be the arbiter of truth in science.  Truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In this case, it's decency.  I don't wanna use the word civility,  because that's loaded.  That's what Stacey was saying a minute ago.  It's what I'm trying to say too.  What do you stand for?  What does your company stand for?  Well, here, in here.  Do you choose to sell cigarettes or not?  CVS at some point said, we're in the health business.  We're not gonna sell cigarettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right?  I have to say, some of the things  Newton talks about in this phone call,  85 minute recording that he reviewed on The Verge.  Here's a quote from Zuckerberg.  If we're entering a period  where there may be a prolonged period of civil unrest,  then that might suggest we need different policies,  even just temporarily in the US for some period,  compared to where we were before.  Who's saying that?  Zuckerberg.  Zuckerberg.  Dr. Zuckerberg.  And we have some precedence  for what that might look like.  He's talking about the COVID misinformation.  So I think he's thinking about this.  I don't think Mark is  It's not blind.  He's planning his world domination, I don't think.  But it's very difficult with a politician and politics  compared to science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Stacey, what do you think about Snap's decision?  What was Snap's decision?  So the difference here is Snap,  one second, then I'll preamble.  Facebook says we will not judge anything off platform.  We will only judge that which you put on the platform,  which is why it took so long for them to get to Alex Jones.  They were judging that.  it's an issue.  Snap said, we're gonna judge what you do  on other platforms, we're gonna go off the world,  and we're not gonna promote you.  So Snap made a different decision  that was about their disapproval  of not what he did on their platform,  but who he is and what he does.  What'd you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So given Snap's audience, I'm okay with that.  Just because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're even more mush-minded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, they're younger,  they're more influenceable.  Yeah, yeah.  More easily influenced.  And I also, now, I also think that,  I think that the president is doing such a bad job right now  in terms of the country, that it's hard,  that it's hard not to take a stand against him, I guess,  or it's hard not to take a stand that's pretty,  he's such a, it's not just that he's a polarizing figure,  he's also,  this hurts me.  He doesn't live up to what I think America's ideals are,  even if you wanna take the cynical view  of what America's ideals are.  So I feel like if you are a business owner  and you overlook this,  it really does feel like you're complicit  in something that you're gonna regret later on.  And so I understand why Snap would make that decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the other question Leo asked a while ago, sorry.  I was gonna ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, it's also a much smaller platform.  So, but yeah, go ask your deep,  deep question that's gonna make me crazy.  The other question Leo asked a while ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do you think this was good or bad for Snap's business?  Just to pick on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's probably gonna be good for Snap's business.  I mean, it's existing. So now to Facebook.  I think it would probably be a little bit harmful  to Facebook's business in the short term.  Which would be?  I think Facebook, for Facebook to take a stand  against Trump's messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The cynic would say, oh, Facebook's looking forward  to the windfall profits from Trump's massive ad campaigns.  They've already spent many millions of dollars  and plan to spend many more before November.  That's pretty cynical.  And I think Mark's probably made enough money  that he could afford not to take.  I wish, I honestly wish Facebook would say,  we're not gonna do any political ads.  That would be something I would ask Mark to do at dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see, I was against that at Twitter.  I thought that was the wrong move.  I can't remember what you said at the time, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't remember what I said at the time.  What would be wrong about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what would be wrong with Facebook saying,  yeah, you know, we can't control it.  We got the Russians.  I don't know what's going on.  Well, let's just stop taking ad money for political ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's my congressperson here, especially right now.  I'll give you the answer right now,  because I wanna work with my congressperson here  and I can't go knocking on any of your doors.  All I can do is give them money  to put ads up on Facebook targeted.  I thought Facebook didn't influence people though.  To our district.  Ads do.  Oh, ads do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ads do to an extent.  Ads do, but not the news announcements from my friends  telling me about their terrible vaccine experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a playing field, right?  Yes, you can put up stuff to either side of anything.  Witness Benjamin Franklin once again.  And then it's a playing field that's there.  If you get rid of all social media targeted advertising,  my problem is that you're left with television.  You're left with big money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think political ads in general are a good idea.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's that.  Yeah, sure, if you can, in other countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't.  Yeah, let's just ban,  I mean, but since we don't ban political ads,  we can afford to do that.  Yeah, but we can afford to do that on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're gonna do it on one, you're then driving that.  Well, it would be nice to do it elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But since, we're talking about Facebook here.  I'm not talking about ABC's decisions.  But why wouldn't Facebook just ban ads?  I am, because only big money,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  only big money can then run for office in this country,  including small offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, I don't think that's true,  because I don't, my daughter is not on TV.  I am not on TV.  Like, I don't see ads unless they're on the internet,  period, or in a physical magazine.  You're probably unusual though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you are.  You're a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know in a generation,  it would be interesting to see,  like, how that has changed,  because it has changed,  and I don't think it's that unusual.  In a certain demographic, let me rephrase that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I blocked all the ads on Facebook  while I was on Facebook, so I didn't see any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, honestly.  Joe Trippi said in his, well, when did Joe Trippi write it?  Joe Trippi book.  That's one of the beauty parts of the internet.  The revolution will not be televised, 2004.  So he said, television was over then.  We then have Citizens United,  we still have big money involved in all the elections.  And it's not just Facebook.  Facebook is actually little money.  It's pretty damn cheap.  It's quite cheap to advertise that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Super cheap, oh my gosh.  I can run an ad campaign on Facebook for so little.  Yeah.  Sorry.  They're very effective too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $21 million spent on Facebook ads  by the Trump campaign in 2018.  How much revenue, 2018?  I mean, they may be cheap,  but if you buy a lot of them, it adds up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  I'm not spending that much, but wow, go them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook revenue in 2018 was $55 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trump bought 286,476 ads in 2019,  spending $21.5 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Clinton, unfortunately, didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was, by the way, this wasn't in 2016.  This was last year.  Last year.  The campaign goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brad Parscale gets a huge cut of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, he's got several Ferraris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and a yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a yacht.  All right, well, I don't think we're ever gonna solve this,  but we gave it the college try.  Yeah, well, we gave it to one of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We gave it to Jeff and Stacey  yelling at each other for a while.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't yell at you, I yelled at Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm offended, horribly offended, Jeff.  So offended.  I was going to yell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get me to yell about Pixel Buds.  That'll get me to yell.  You still having trouble with him?  I sent back the second pair.  Another story saying they don't work.  I guess I just never should buy anything early.  Just Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just maybe Google isn't good at headphones.  Let's just go with that.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  They're wonderfully designed.  Oh, they're beautifully designed.  I love them, but they don't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's grinding my gears?  Tell us. What?  HBO Max, AT&T, which of course is the corporate parent.  That was good, I liked it, Stacey.  Let me repeat that.  HBO Max.  Remember the world, remember net neutrality?  Remember the idea that a company shouldn't favor  its own content or paid content  over competing company's content?  Remember when the FCC chairman said,  oh, that's just, nobody, that would never,  we don't need that.  Eli Patel writing an article, very upset, and he's right.  AT&T has announced that any content coming in over HBO Max  will not affect your data caps if you're an AT&T subscriber.  However, Netflix and Disney Plus certainly will.  That sounds a little anti-competitive to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Super anti-competitive.  So anti-competitive that when Comcast bought Universal,  we actually, the FCC and the FTC said,  hey, for the next seven years,  you cannot prioritize your content.  And Comcast said, sure.  But that deal, it'll be up soon.  And what we're seeing here is the end of net neutrality.  And I tweeted this, I'll say it again,  for everybody who didn't see it.  This is important because it puts a cost associated  with independent content like Leo, but also things like,  hey, are you gonna watch a protest video  and suck up your data cap,  or are you just gonna sit back and enjoy friends?  My God, you're gonna watch friends.  Yeah, of course you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AT&T owns HBO Max.  AT&T will say, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We have this sponsored data system.  Any company can pay us to excuse the service from data caps.  But of course, AT&T owns HBO Max.  So it's just shuffling money from one division to another.  And Neely says, there are only three streaming services  that pay for sponsored data on AT&T's network.  They're all owned by AT&T.  All owned by AT&T.  You wanna regulate something?  But AT&T, I remember, promised  that they would never do such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never believed the telcos.  Never, ever, ever.  These are people who the internet was a gift  that they just, they didn't want.  They didn't build for it.  And now they wanna charge you for every second.  And the idea of actually making a bigger internet  and then having a bigger pie for everything else,  totally not in their worldview.  It drives me absolutely bonkers.  I hate them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I hate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's the German newspaper  that is delivering beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from Jeff's Buzz Machine blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody loves this one.  So I was reading Tietzeit,  and then Tietzeit brinkt jetzt beer.  There's some German words for you this week.  And the Mindene Tageblatt newspaper  saw that their local merchants were suffering  and they already had a fulfillment operation,  which was delivering newspapers  and taking ad material in and doing things like that.  So they started delivering beer, shoes,  and office supplies.  It's not gonna make them rich.  They have a, I think it's like 250 to 350 euro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the shoes story.  I think we talked about beer and shoes last week, didn't we?  Wasn't that the title?  Oh, did we?  Oh, I'm sorry, did I mess that up?  I think it was the title of the show.  Well, no, I didn't put two and two together.  No, we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we didn't talk about this last week on this show.  Okay.  I know you do a lot of shows, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do a lot of shows.  If I could just get this fine Zimshitneckie.  So then my colleague, Ania Zelina,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who used to work at Der Standard in Austria,  said they bought a local bread company.  So you could get bread delivered every day.  Click on the link with the news.  I want my Zimshitneckie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you say to that?  That looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does look good.  So, here we go.  You can get a whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Stacey, look at this.  Delivered every day.  Basket.  Put a croissant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Croissants with a cinnamon roll in there.  Cinnamon roll.  Zimshitneckie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zimshitneckie.  Zimshitneckie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a shoko muffin.  And an orange saft.  And a darbo marmalade.  Mm, mm, and some corn spit.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's bio corn spits.  Yum, yum.  Bio corn spits.  Yum, yum.  Okay, where's the Nutella?  Don't they have Nutella in Germany?  This is, that's Austria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's Austria.  They have better taste than that.  I don't, I never was a fan of Nutella.  You guys Nutella fans?  I love Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's, I'm into it.  Yeah, Stacey, you see, we're green a lot today.  I know it's not real food, but it's good.  It's too sweet.  Yeah, it's too sweet.  I just feel bad.  Like when people, I'm like, eh, it's all right.  They're like, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but you know what's too sweet and delicious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last pass?  Yes.  Very good.  It sounded like you were going into an ad.  I'm like, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I wasn't, but that's good idea.  I think, I think I agree with you.  That last pass is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just sounded like a segue to an ad.  I was like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the, what's the cookies that you, speculose,  that you grind up and make speculose butter?  Oh, I don't like those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you get them on the airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't eat the cookies.  Grind them into peanut butter like consistency.  And you get something called speculose butter,  which is even sweeter.  Can't eat it.  Than last pass, but delicious.  Our show today brought to you by Last Pass.  As you send your employees home,  you know, I feel like we were so well prepared.  We didn't know about work from home.  We weren't planning on it.  In fact, we really like our employees  to come into the office.  In fact, I miss the social environment that was the office.  But when the virus came along, of course,  we sent everybody home.  And I feel like just by, maybe by accident,  I don't know, we were really well prepared.  This has been great.  One of the things that we did some years ago  that really helped, we started using Last Pass Enterprise.  When you send employees home,  suddenly they're no longer in the warm bath,  the warm protective bath of the IT department at work.  They are out there in the real world.  And God knows what kind of internet situation.  And they're logging into your stuff.  They're logging into your bank accounts  and your databases.  And we have to, our accountant, Robin, has to be doing that.  She does it from the house.  Thank goodness she's using Last Pass.  To make sure your business keeps running smoothly,  every employee login is secure.  And they do it in a lot of ways.  Of course, everybody knows Last Pass  is the greatest password manager.  Last Pass, with their enterprise-grade password management,  gives, ensures oversight of shadow IT,  enforceable policies across all password-protected accounts.  It makes it easy for employees to share passwords securely.  And I can go on and on and on,  but it's more than just password management.  There's also single sign-on.  Last Pass, with their Last Pass Enterprise,  has embraced single sign-on apps.  They have 1,200 plus apps that you can use.  And that's actually better than passwords.  It's both easier and more convenient for employees  and more secure than passwords.  There's also multi-factor authentication.  I love this.  Make sure that that user is really that user.  And I'm not just talking about thumb, print, or face ID.  It's biometrics, yes, but also contextual factors.  Things like geolocation and IP address.  It makes the process smoother for your employees  and it makes it more secure for you.  IT always has full insight into exactly  who has access to what and from where.  You're secure, you're safe,  even though your employees are out there in the real world.  And one of the things you'll love is,  you know, the Last Pass Vault is never decrypted anywhere  but on device, on every device.  Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever you use.  Smart TVs, everywhere Last Pass works.  Only users can get access to their data.  It's encrypted with 256-bit AES.  And it never, the master password is never stored or sent.  Last Pass doesn't have it.  And that's good news, because if they don't have it,  neither can, bad guys can't get it.  Last Pass protects you and your business  and still provides a seamless workflow for your employees.  That's why I say it's super sweet.  Account access and passwords can easily be shared  between employees.  It's easy to onboard new employees  because we have folders that makes it possible  to add somebody to a group and boom,  they've got all the passwords.  And things like single sign-on, just make it easier.  Multi-factor authentication.  Your IT department will love it.  Your employees will love it, you will love it.  Last Pass can help make remote work simple and secure.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit to find out  how they can help you stay productive and secure  no matter what, no matter where.  They even, I love it, it even works offline.  So when your employees, like Stacey,  it drops out once in a while, don't worry,  they still get the multi-factor, they still get the passwords.  LastPass.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  I was thinking speculo-spudder, but.  So almost breaking news.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Almost.  Yes.  53 minutes ago, Medium sends out a message  to its contributors, like me,  that it now offers newsletters.  So as my friend David Cohen said,  does Medium become Substack or does Substack become Medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, because of you, Jeff,  I gave them their five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yay!  Because of you, I put everything up on Buzz Machine  so you didn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I realized, yeah, I was blowing it.  I was blowing it.  I was, you know, it's only five bucks a month.  And I use it so often.  Let me just sign in, I have to use my.  So it's not Facebook.  It's, no, although, okay, now that I have a Facebook account,  I'm paying for.  They see you're muted.  I notice.  Oh, sorry, thank you.  For some reason on the front page,  there's articles as old as three years old  on the front page.  That's the point of Medium.  No, they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to resurface.  The point is, there's good content  that's still relevant later.  Oh, okay, that's good.  That's their point, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay, all right, I'll embrace it.  When they started Medium, they had no dates on any piece.  Ooh.  Which is kind of ridiculous.  It's absolutely boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same here.  Yeah, because I don't want to retweet something  that's three years old.  I will find people coming back.  Well, I also don't want to read something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  without knowing when it was written.  Knowing that, context, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, okay, I saw Jared Diamond says,  there's a 49% chance that The World As We Know  will end by 2050.  Oh, no, and then I see,  oh, that came out in May of last year.  The other thing is, maybe it's because of my advanced age.  I don't know.  I probably read that article a year ago.  I just forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why it's given it to you.  I don't want to reread articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Life's too short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, that was your problem with the article?  Is that it didn't have a date?  Not the fact that this guy,  this guy, yeah, The World's going to end by 2050, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think Jared Diamond knows  what he's talking about.  Besides, I'll be dead by then anyway, so.  Well, I'll be 94.  That's, you know.  That was fast math.  It's wrong math, but it's fast.  I'll be 94.  Why?  No, I will be, I'll be 94.  Yeah, exactly.  Albert Einstein was not happy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the based on your reading history thing,  I've never liked.  Where's that?  That's what it says at the top of it.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, so, yeah, because I read that a year ago.  So, you probably forgot you read this.  Why is it giving me that?  That highly intelligent people are miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An algorithm.  Oh no, it's an algorithm.  How to literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not, okay, we are not reflexively hating on algorithms.  We are reflexively hating on Facebook's algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  Some algorithms, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think, no, it's good, and it's worth paying for.  And so, I, and I felt, you made me feel guilty, Jeff,  so I ponied up.  And actually, there's, it's good content.  It's good, there's good stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also added a new feature I see here to mute people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, I bet there's lots of people out there  clicking that button next to you.  Mute Jeff.  Hey, hey, hey.  You know that there are people  who have very strong anti-Jeff feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there?  I know.  Really?  Shocking.  Everybody loves Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna get yelled at for this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you yelled at Stacey.  That's not nice.  That's exactly what it is, yes.  People don't like it.  I didn't yell at Stacey, I yelled at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey and I were agreeing about everything.  You went past me and hit Stacey.  We were agreeing.  I was interviewing Stacey and asking her lots of questions.  I wanted her opinion.  You, I yelled at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a good question.  You were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a good question.  You did have a good question.  So good, it made me feel.  And I decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You ever answer it?  No, but I did.  Mark, stop letting, no more political ads, Mark.  Take them away.  I didn't like your answer.  I didn't want your answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wanted Stacey's answer.  All right, what's your answer?  I did answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Oh God, now I gotta remember what it was.  Oh, don't remember.  Oh, it was all about.  We can rewind.  It was all about being, sorry.  It was about decency again.  So I'm using your shorthand.  But it was like, hey, sometimes you can't do  what's good for business.  You gotta do what's good for the country, blah, blah, blah.  See, we agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's you, Leo.  You, Leo.  Here's some good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You moral panicker.  Elon Musk is taking a break from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aw.  Actually.  So I went, did you, what was your reaction?  I was so mixed, because I wanted to absolutely love  the space launch, because I did.  I did.  But the fact that it's Elon Musk  just kind of took a little bit of an edge off.  I know.  But I had to give him some credit.  You know, there are real big benefits to society

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that are completely created by big jerks.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Werner von Braun, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, look at that.  We wouldn't have gone to the moon without that Nazi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, sometimes.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Netflix just bought the Egyptian theater in Hollywood.  Is this the old Grumman's Chinese Theater,  which is now the Egyptian theater?  No, I don't think so.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Grumman's Egyptian.  I think the Egyptian is where they were,  they've done the Oscars a couple times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I thought that was Grumman's.  It's a Grumman's, it's just Egyptian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I've walked by it.  Yeah, it was opened on Hollywood Boulevard in 1922  by Sid Grumman.  It's got, you know, a Sphinx,  and the stage has got columns.  The first premiere was the Douglas Fairbanks  flick Robin Hood.  It was closed in 1992,  purchased by the American Cinematique for $1,  with the provision that the historical landmark  would be restored to its original grandeur  and reopened as a movie theater,  showcasing the organization's celebrated public programming.  And it was opened after a $12.8 million renovation in 1998.  And now they've sold it on to Netflix.  Netflix has been buying theaters,  probably mostly so that they can get some of their movies  into the Oscar nominations.  Oh, that would be, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How long before you're comfortable  going back to a movie theater, folks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love my home theater.  Popcorn's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I would go to a movie theater.  I'm not in a hurry.  Uh-oh.  I don't, I mean, I went to the movie theaters  like twice a year,  and that was only for the latest cartoon  or Marvel flick with my daughter.  So Apple TV.  And I would always go to a fancy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple TV just won a bidding war  for Martin Scorsese's next movie  with Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro.  $180 million.  So movies go on, but I think that streaming,  these are the streaming companies buying these movies now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know why?  I went twice a year to, Stacey, you know why?  Why?  Popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you,  I can make you the best popcorn you've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In your $5,000 cooking thing?  Does it do that too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually the Thermomix,  which is far from $5,000. It does not make popcorn.  It does not.  It should.  It could though, Stacey.  Wait a minute.  It has the, it turns around.  It's got a little stirrer.  I bet it does.  Let me, let me investigate.  I have to go to Cookie Do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the dumbest name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's French.  It makes caramel popcorn, I think.  Yeah, the right party popcorn, caramel popcorn.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, caramel popcorn, party popcorn,  salted caramel popcorn.  In the Thermomix, I'm going to make caramel corn tonight.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tonight.  By the way, that'll hold Leo.  You can send that out to us.  Ha ha ha.  You can make Stacey very,  Or if you get bored of the Thermomix,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just feel, send it, send it, send it.  Yeah, just send it to you  and you can send me the popcorn back.  Yeah, Leo, I make bread, I make food.  I'll make popcorn and send it back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you probably would too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This looks good.  I'm making this, man.  This is good.  I did, I'm so glad you brought that up.  Popcorn au caramel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, now it's French popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so fancy.  It has to be at the price of the device.  Everything has to be a fancy name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike Mazik, Tector.  Is it Thermomix?  Go ahead.  Thermomix questions are much more important  than copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I was going to ask if they were French,  but I couldn't remember.  I think it's Swiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I feel like it's Swiss.  The only things I make in it are mashed potatoes and risotto.  I've got to really branch out, but it's very good.  Mashed potatoes, really?  Oh, it's the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are they the best?  I don't know.  And you know what's great?  It's got a little scale in it, right?  So it says, okay, now slice up some potatoes  and put in, what was it, 750 grams of potatoes.  So you put them in until it says 750 grams.  Okay, now put in 150 grams of cream.  I mean, it's all measured out  and it tells you what to do.  There's buttons, there's knobs.  You just do it.  And it comes out a half an hour later.  The creamiest, richest.  These rival the mashed potatoes  at the world famous Joelle Robichon.  They're very good.  By the way, those are the best mashed potatoes in the world.  How much butter is in them?  Lots.  Okay.  Oh, they're not healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really all you need for good mashed potatoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Butter, cream, yeah, I agree.  Speaking of the public domain, Italian prosecutors,  what the hell, Mike Maznik and Mike in Tech Dirt,  I love Mike's stuff,  says that the public prosecutors in Italy  have declared Project Gutenberg, which by the way-  Gutenberg, Gutenberg, did I hear Gutenberg?  Yes, I brought it up just for you.  Gutenberg, Gutenberg.  They take it down for copyright infringement,  even though it is a repository of public domain works.  It seems like some lazy work  on the part of the Italian prosecutor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  What, a lazy prosecutor just-  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How could that be?  How could that be?  How could they be taking-  What?  Apparently they were monitoring  some telegram private channels,  saw someone there linked to some pirate sites,  and Project Gutenberg,  and rather than investigate rights, Mike,  they just decided to ban the entire list.  Now this is facilitated by something in Italy  that I don't like so much.  Apparently it's the law in Italy  that the prosecutor can tell ISPs,  these are sites you must block, period.  And there's no appeal-  Is that a three strikes kind of rule?  No, it's gone.  No, okay.  They never even contacted Project Gutenberg.  But because they have the,  this is where you gotta be careful,  because they have the right to just tell ISPs,  here's a list of sites you must now block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say ISPs, large social media platforms,  search platforms,  I think there is a huge challenge  in getting them to realize the impact  that those kind of blocks can have.  The impact that a casual decision  at the platform level can have on a business,  and setting up the proper channels,  even if they're not scalable,  to deal with that quickly is so essential,  and I don't know how we do it.  I don't know, I mean,  legally there's no framework for dealing with that,  but it is a huge problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we should not really have a law  that says that ISPs can just unilaterally  be instructed to block.  We don't have one.  No, I know, and you should be careful we never get one  without a court order or anything,  just take them off.  And I honestly, it's not merely Project Gutenberg,  which still has probably adherence all over the world,  it's really an amazing thing.  I feel bad for the Italians who won't be able to access  the school kids and stuff who won't be able to read  the Scarlet Letter for their homework.  They'll have to go out and buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then there was also another case  in the last two weeks where book publishers  were pissed at them in the US because they were getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like any- Oh, it's the internet archive.  The internet archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The internet archive, right.  So that's the parallel things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we were talking about that one.  I thought we talked about that on the show, but you know.  Did we?  I feel like we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's hell getting old, Stacey, don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Internet archive, in honor of the quarantine,  decided to put up, it has a lot of books,  put up a collection of books that normally  treats like a library that you borrow.  They call it the open library ebook lending.  Publishers sued them.  And you know what?  In this case, these are copyright.  This is not public domain. They are, yeah.  They're using though that control digital lending,  or they used to use control digital lending  that other public libraries use,  but they announced the National Emergency Library  which suspended wait lists and made all books  immediately accessible to anyone with an account.  And the publishers didn't like that.  That was, that was cause of the quarantine.  It wasn't intended to be a long-term thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see why, I mean, I can see why that would frustrate  publishers and authors.  I mean, if I were an author, I couldn't get paid  for my books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it would have been nice if maybe  the internet archive had gone to publishers and said,  you know, this is gonna be good for your,  you know, good publicity for you, good for us,  good for America.  We'd like to make these available to, you know,  without the restrictions that we normally have to make  for CDL, controlled digital lending.  But they didn't, and I think the publishers  probably will win this case cause they really can't,  have a leg to stand on.  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say that I love, my quarantine reading  has been amazing because I've got, you know,  I get the digital books downloaded to my Kindle.  Yeah.  And I'm just like, and I don't know what's happening,  but all my like holds are coming in like right after  another, I'm like, oh, oh, I've got too many books to read.  This is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which, which software does your library use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They use Overdrive and I use both Overdrive  and then they have Libby and I'm not sure.  I think they're related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why there are two apps that do the same thing.  I think Overdrive owns Libby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but they don't have the same books.  It's very weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is weird.  They should have the same books.  Yeah, Libby is owned by Overdrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a better app experience.  And y'all, if you like to read  and your library supports this,  just do it, it's like the easiest, best thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean- I love it that you can,  they have audio books too, but I love it that you can  just send it to your Kindle or you can listen to it  on your library.  It's really cool.  Really cool.  Overdrive, Libby, there's some other ones too.  So check your local library to see which one they support.  I think most libraries now support,  oh my God, Overdrive's owned by Rakuten.  Really?  Yes.  Really?  That's a little bit of a shock.  Rakuten's buying up everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is crazy.  Oh, who's like-  Where's their money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's behind Rakuten?  It's Japanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it Chinese?  Is it Chinese or Japanese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't remember.  I feel like it's Japanese and they bought,  they've been buying a lot of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Japanese Electronic Commerce  and Online Retailing Company based in Tokyo.  Thank you.  Founded by Hiroshi Mikitani.  I'm reading it from Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Founded in 1997, 18,000 employees.  But they own a lot of other things too.  Ebates, I mean, I've seen the ads anyway.  They bought Ebates.  But I'm kind of surprised to learn that they own Overdrive.  They own this library lending app.  That's kind of wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was a big thing in which publisher was it.  They were talking about with eBooks at libraries,  they were saying that they were gonna do  some more windowing there.  And like a library could only,  cause I know like my library on popular books,  they purchased like 10 licenses for a book, right?  And who was the publisher who was saying  they would only be able to purchase like one or two  and they would put a limit on it.  And the librarians were like brightly upset,  but publishers windowing eBooks.  I think it was it.  Macmillan, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the idea Macmillan, yeah.  And the idea was that people were not buying books.  They were just waiting for them at the library.  And this was cutting into book sales.  To which I'm like, these are eBooks  and that's kind of what libraries do.  And are you gonna like only let a library  buy two print copies of the books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We are back to Ben Franklin.  Had it not been for Franklin,  if publishers had their way, would there ever be librarians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, wasn't it Franklin that started the  public library movement in the United States?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, this guy from Macmillan says 45% of Macmillan eBooks  read every year are read for free in libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, 45%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No wonder they're a little worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he does not go into detail  about how that figure is arrived at,  but whether it's really 45% or not,  I don't doubt that the number of library eBooks is.  Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then the library doesn't, or maybe they do,  maybe they pay them.  No, the library pays for a license.  The physical books, yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When a library buys an eBook,  it's not like you and I buying an eBook.  They're buying a license to lend the eBook,  which is a different pricing model.  Yeah, right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, this week in Google,  episode 560 from May 20th was titled Beer and Shoes.  Oh, sorry, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went looking, I couldn't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly don't know if we,  I mean, we must have talked about that story.  We must have.  But I don't think we'd spent as much.  When did we talk about it?  I know, I don't think we spent as much time.  I don't even see it in the show notes, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was I there that day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe no one was there that day.  Just Karsten.  Just Karsten did that show in his mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In his imagination. Yes.  It was Karsten's show of his dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Karsten, by the way,  I miss getting a note from you at the end of the show  telling us that we didn't focus enough on certain stories.  So I. What?  Does he do that?  Oh no.  No, in a nice way, not in a bad way.  I don't get that.  What?  Yeah, we got it once.  He sent us a little note after.  Oh once, oh, I thought you were like every week or something.  Saying what?  But I kind of liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, saying what?  Here's the stories you missed in the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, just that he thought  we should have focused more on this.  I think it was Karsten's. Who's being a producer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was good.  I'm the guy who chooses what stories we talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He knows you're hopeless, Leo.  He's like, Jeff and Stacey, they can still be taught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're his root in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sent you a note saying you should have covered this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.  It's not even up to you.  You're making it sound so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you give Karsten any trouble.  He's my taco buddy.  Don't you give him any trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now I understand.  He's bribing you. It was helpful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Taco buddy.  Oh, I've got Karsten in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently he sent you a note saying,  here's what I would have talked about on this show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I want Karsten to camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh Lord, I'm facing an insurrection.  Maybe this would be a good time to do the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well done.  Oh man.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I'd throw him, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had his finger on the button.  Good job, Jeff.  Freddie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna call him JC.  Cause we got to distinguish him from JJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you should ask him first.  Maybe he'd like something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would you like me to call you, Jeff?  What's JB?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  JB Rockman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  JB.  JB's good.  Yes, JB.  Thank you, JB.  Good job, JB.  The third pixel feature drop has happened.  Did you get it on your pixel?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah.  There's actually some good stuff.  There's an adapt.  I haven't restarted.  Your battery should be better.  Mine is definitely, I've noticed it.  There's an AI powered adaptive battery feature  that apparently notices which apps are sucking battery  even if you're not using them.  It uses, and this is for Stacey,  a deep convolutional neural net.  I know you like those.  To predict which apps you'll use in the, get this,  which apps you'll use in the next few hours  and which apps you probably won't use until later  and then reduces power to the ones you rarely use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take that.  Why would you need a CNN to figure that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, a CNN.  A deep CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A convolutional neural network.  Yes, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you?  Don't know, because it needs to observe your behavior  and figure it out.  I don't know.  You're asking me.  I don't even know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same thing you do.  It's what you usually use for image recognition  and the idea is you show it lots of things  and then it makes a conclusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's making a prediction as you use your phone  as to which apps you're gonna use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess they do.  They use that for language translations.  So, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Google spokesman says,  adaptive battery now uses multiple models as input  to determine how best to optimize your phone.  In addition to the existing model to predict app usage,  we now also use a model that predicts  how your battery is likely to discharge  and another model that predicts  when you're next likely to plug in.  This is like Minority Report.  The models run locally on the device  and are personalized.  Bringing these together, the device can react  if it predicts you're likely to run out of a charge  and enable some additional power saving techniques  to help your battery last longer.  Wild.  Is that wild?  That's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're actually doing that on other,  using machine learning broadly to predict how long  and how to optimize for battery life  is actually something that's being studied right now  and it might help us.  It's gonna help here on our phones  but it'll also help in like IOT sensors too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These pixel drops are cool.  So this is something Google started last year  where they would add capabilities  to the phone after you bought it  and they've done several now with a pixel.  They're also, you may remember the recorder app  that we talked about.  That's so cool.  It records and transcribes at the same time.  Let's you search.  Wow.  Isn't it great?  Have you been using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a reporter's dream, a student's dream.  It lets you search audio files for words,  export text transcripts, recommends audio message titles  based on keywords or on music, applause or speech.  And now that functionality is being pulled out  by Google Assistant.  Let me try it.  I'm just gonna see if, here I'll mute my microphone.  Start recording my meeting.  And in theory, nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in theory, something would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In theory, something would happen.  Well, I don't know.  Okay.  You should also be able to say,  show me recordings about dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you can also, oh no,  those are the two things you can do.  It doesn't have to be dogs, obviously.  But you could say, show me all the meetings with JB.  You can also export transcripts to Google Docs.  There's new bedtime and personal safety features.  You can now fall asleep to calming sounds  from YouTube Music, Spotify, Calm and other apps.  You could set a bedtime schedule,  get a reminder when it's time for bed  and limit interruptions when you sleep.  And if you take-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens when it's bedtime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, it's time to go to sleep now  and it'll play calming sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  It also-  Does it turn off your access to Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can, yes.  If you stay up on your phone past bedtime,  you'll get a snapshot of how much time you're spending awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how I go to sleep.  I hold myself with my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, going to sleep,  do not go to Twitter before you go to bed.  That's the bad idea.  In the morning, you can wake up to your favorite track  or with a gradually brighter screen with sunrise alarm.  Android users will get some of these functions  later this summer.  So this is right now for Pixel and Pixel 4 XL users.  And there's a new personal safety app, which I really like.  I think I can, well, I could show you this.  But basically, if you're going to go,  let's say you're going to go on a walk, it's late at night,  you don't know if you'll ever come back.  So you can-  It'll be me tonight.  So you could say to the personal safety app,  you could say, I'm going for a walk.  If I don't come back in an hour, call mom or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, so you leave your phones with you?  Yeah, it's with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's not useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, okay.  I'm thinking of like when I go hiking sometimes,  there's no cell phone coverage.  It's like that.  Oh, I see.  But I would leave my phone at the trailhead  where there's coverage.  And then I could be like, if I don't come back-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, you can do this.  Actually, you can do this.  It says, in uncertain situations,  set up a time for your phone to check that you're safe.  So you could say, I should be back in two hours.  Leave the phone.  When you get home, the phone will say, are you home?  Are you okay?  If you don't respond,  emergency sharing automatically starts,  sends your contacts information.  You can also share real-time location  with your emergency contacts.  I think that's, so this is the safety check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can see, I'll end up running to a neighbor  down the street, end up in a conversation.  Forget that I did that.  The cops will come.  My father will be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't call the cops.  It just calls your father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you would just,  if you have your phone still on you,  it would alert you and then you could hit a button  while you're talking.  But in that scenario, it was home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's really mostly designed  for you to have with you, to be honest.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it also sends location information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking for something for when I go  into the back country and I'm by myself  because my husband gets really nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, well, that's kind of the idea of this.  I'm going on a hike and I might,  if I don't get back in a couple hours,  tell everybody I'm not back.  That's pretty cool.  I think that's kind of neat.  And you could share real-time location information using it.  It also lets you turn on crisis alerts  to get notifications about natural disasters  or other public emergencies.  That is in the third pixel drop, pixel feature drop.  Which I got like June 1.  So you should have it by now.  You want to use your phone for social distancing?  Google has a new AR tool called Sodar  that will tell you how close somebody is.  You don't even need an app.  You just visit the Sodar website using Chrome  or pull up using Google's QR code  and your browser will turn into a standalone tool  that uses your phone's camera  to draw a six foot perimeter around you.  That's cool.  Let me go to the Sodar.  It's S-O-D-A-R with google.com.  And well, here I got the QR code on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There we go.  Sodar, I didn't even, that was nice.  I didn't even have to type it in.  Your connection is not private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is their website not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  The QR code didn't put in the HTTPS or maybe it did.  It did.  That might be something local.  Anyway, I can show you a little video.  So that's cool, S-O-D-A-R.  See this?  It shows you.  That's two meters.  Don't get any closer.  Actually, I could have used that yesterday.  I had a guy come right up to me.  Have you ever done this?  You do the thing where you kind of go,  you stagger backward.  You go, oh!  I staggered backwards.  He's like, no!  Put my hand out.  I feel bad doing that, but I think it's good to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a guy I know in Europe  that's as specific as I'll get.  Nice guy.  I see him at conferences and I forget.  Nobody violates my space more than this guy.  Oh, he's a close talker?  Close talker.  If you used my phone and did a root,  you'd see me trying to get away  and I'll return and I fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you just done this?  Hey, hold back off just a bit.  I just need my space, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just go, chill, man, COVID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, even if, I mean, people try to get up.  I have a very wide personal space  and I'm just like, hey, just take a step back, please.  And they're like, oh, okay.  Yeah, I feel bad, but I think you gotta do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The guy didn't have a mask or anything  and he just started coming up to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I come up to people sometimes because I forget.  You forget.  I think I terrify our PS man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so if you do that and I did,  whoa, let's social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now we can say social distancing.  Now I'm very happy.  Now we can just say that all the time.  It'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Social distancing.  Oh, I'm sorry, I don't wanna get sick and you look ill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My last meeting in New York,  I remember people started shaking hands and I said,  uh-uh, and they were kinda,  first they kinda looked at me funny  and then they realized, no, that's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a story Karsten would have done,  but I'm not gonna do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's about Stadia?  How did you know it was about Stadia?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who abused the poor boy?  My friend, my taco buddy.  Taco buddy would have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm not gonna do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's some stupid Stadia story.  You want it?  Okay, okay.  I don't care about Stadia.  You be the judge.  You be the judge.  I don't care.  Google Stadia 2.19, preps playing on non-certified phones,  free weekends, touch controls, and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, excuse me, I'm gonna go to social media  and tell all the world this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, you're right, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right, you're right.  All right, here's one you're gonna care about, Jeff.  G Suite customers will soon be able  to make Google voice calls right from Gmail.  Whoop-de-doo.  Hey, it should be in the change log though.  You will agree.  Yes, I will.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Google Maps makes it easier to share your location,  even if you don't have an address.  Oh my God, plus codes.  Yeah, the plus codes.  Remember we talked about what three words.  So why didn't they just use what three words?  Because plus codes are actually, aren't they,  tell me about this, Stacey.  This is more of a standard, right?  Plus codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's got a larger company behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's still a private company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That bothered me, yeah.  All three words is open source, isn't it?  No, it's a company also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, did you see that the Jabra 675T refurbished  were cheaper?  Did you see that?  Scroll back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you want me to go to an ad?  Oh, good deals.  I might need to do this because I fried my Jabras.  But I don't know, I don't know what happened.  I had two Jabras, both of which I can't charge anymore.  I think I had a bad Type-C cable.  I mean, a micro USB cable.  I should only buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that one is USB-C.  That one's USB-C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's a good reason to buy it.  This is the one you bought, right?  Right here.  100 bucks refurbished at Newegg.  What about, how do we feel about refurbished?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, refurbished at Newegg?  You're the expert.  Do they replace the little plasticky thingies?  On the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all like, mm.  On the other hand, you can't sell something as new  if it's opened, right?  Even if it's never worn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd probably buy it, actually.  Especially for 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good price for these.  Damn.  I still have not used mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine still work.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not looking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  The top critical review says, truly refurbished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that even mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, how did I get?  I was telling you a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, you were telling us about.  Plus codes.  Plus codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I think what three words.  For instance, we are glow walnut nasal.  You enter that into what three words.  It'll give you the longitude and latitude.  Yeah, it's easy to remember.  That's my point.  Three words, easy to remember.  P, R, seven, G, plus J, two.  Is that what it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like plus three words.  I'm unhappy that you used that.  What three words are better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are.  Plus codes.  So, you can use plus codes now in Google Maps.  It generates a six digit code based on your location,  which you can give to others.  It's certainly easier than saying an address.  And it's from plus dot codes.  But I like.  Does Google own a piece of this?  I don't know.  No, I think they just decided.  Oh!  What, Stacy?  I love it when Stacy does that.  No.  Stacy, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys, we are talking about three words.  And I was like, oh, my Helium router  is named three words.  And I was gonna say it, but I then Googled it just to see.  It had cast my address.  So, I can't ever tell you the name of my router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding.  That seems like a, that's intentional, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because it's a distributed network  and there's probably like, yeah.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, if I use what three words to figure out where you live,  I can use your router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or if I had a what three words with my address,  you could definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm just thinking,  oh, I would never share my what three words.  And then I'm like, what about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  So, if I got a Helium router.  Then how do you get your delivery?  Glow walnut nasal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  I wouldn't share it on this show.  I would share it with someone  who's trying to send me a package.  Yeah.  It's your front door.  But I don't.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know that I would tell everybody  who listens to Twig where I live.  No.  I'm sure you're all very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should probably, I think probably that's sensible.  And finally, Google has added a suite of bedtime tools.  I think this is related to the pixel drop.  Do not disturb, gray scale effect, pixels get it first.  I think this is related.  So we'll just say we already did that one.  I thought the pixel drop was pretty cool.  There's something about it.  This is a six month old phone.  There's just something about it  getting nice new features like that.  I think that's pretty cool.  Like that voice recorder, that thing's amazing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that is neat.  Although that's the beauty of having a connected device.  It could get better over time.  It could be smarter.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ta-da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that ta-da.  Wait, wait, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't talk about Nest adding, sorry.  I'm gonna add something to the Google change box.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not in there.  You need to get it in there.  WWKD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would Karsten do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's gonna be fine with this.  Nest is adding Google's advanced protection services.  Oh, I saw this.  To its devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one where you use a physical key in addition.  Two physical keys.  Two physical keys in addition.  Well, you only use one, but you have two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should always have a backup physical key anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should never just use one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if you lost it?  That'd be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, I thought that was really good,  although I don't think I would use it.  I'm actually curious.  Do any of y'all use the advanced security?  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have.  And you lose so many features that I use  that I've turned it on twice and turned it off twice.  And most recently, the feature to embed Google Docs  in other things, which I really valued,  but you can't do that if you're using  the advanced protection.  But advanced protection, but, and I should point this out,  you could still use a YubiKey or some sort  of physical dongle as your authentication on Google.  So it's not like-  Without the advanced protection.  Without advanced protection.  So it's not like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, okay.  Yeah, so I do that.  And advanced protection is for super secure people.  Although if you're super secure like that,  you probably wouldn't have an off the shelf  connected video camera in your home, is my thought.  Exactly, exactly.  But I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I thought it was worth mentioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything else?  Are we, any other new Google features?  Karsten?  Oh, I see.  What would you do?  Anything else?  Okay.  That's the Google Change Log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we could, we could go to the end  of the show at this point.  Ooh, yeah, I think you did it.  I think so.  I think you did it.  I think so.  I want you to start, Stacey, if you have a thing or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm gonna confess to you guys,  I have been painting all weekend.  Yeah.  No, I just, I haven't had any time.  What are you painting?  Are you painting a tree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rooms in my house. A little bird?  Oh, rooms in your house.  Well, that sounds like a nice painting.  Oh, so you're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you weren't closing yet.  You closed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we have now closed and we are now.  Oh, muzzle.  Tweaking.  Thank you.  So yes, I have, I have, I'm trying to think  if I've purchased anything interesting  related to housing stuff.  I'm about to start doing all of my connected home stuff.  But I haven't yet, so. Nice.  Well, we definitely got a report then

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  once you get the house all wired up.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, right now, I'm sorry, y'all.  I wish I had, oh, I did read a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's kind of old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always want to hear what to read.  I'm always looking for other books to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was the 2018 Pulitzer Prize winning book.  So it's not secret, but it's The Overstory by Richard Power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really good.  And it, it's really slow getting there.  And I thought I was reading one book  and then like a third of the way through,  I realized I was reading a totally different book,  but it's really good.  And it makes you think about,  part of it's because I like nature and trees  and a lot of it's set in the Pacific Northwest,  but I liked it.  It actually.  Well, this sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a really good book.  Yeah.  So that's what I've been doing in my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Short list for the Man Booker Prize,  Pulitzer Prize winner in 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I saw that in the store.  Oh, 2019.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am, I'm adding this to my list.  That sounds great.  So.  Thank you.  See, I don't.  There you go, sorry.  It doesn't have to be a TV show.  It doesn't have to be, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna see if it's on Audible  because I no longer can read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  22 hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I listened to East West Street, which is spectacular.  What's that?  It is a really fascinating story of the origins  of genocide and crimes against humanity  at an individual or group level  in the Nuremberg trials told by an author  who follows his own relative  and then runs into two other relatives from the same,  they were all involved in the same town.  It's amazing.  He has a new book coming out.  It's really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  East West Street.  By the way, the over story is on a two for one sale  right now at Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, so you buy one and you get two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they the same book?  Oh, you get two of the same book?  Well, that wouldn't be, especially an audio book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm curious with.  No, you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a list of books.  Buy one, get one free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not a BOGO.  It's a two for one selection.  Now listen, you just,  and there's a bunch of books in that.  And if it's in those lists,  then you could buy one and you could then pick another one  for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the other book I read that's really good.  I'm gonna give it to you  because it also made me change my world.  The Water Dancer by Tanishi Coates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ta-Nehisi.  Ta-Nehisi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Baratunde finally told me how to say that,  Ta-Nehisi, which is not how it's spelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He taught at our school.  That's how I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did he?  I thought Between the World and Me.  In fact, that's one I would recommend as one of the,  and it's one of Baratunde's books  that would help you understand  what it's like to be black in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very powerful Between the World and Me.  And that is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a great writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was so good.  And I am mad that children do not read this in school  because I thought that he wrote a quintessential story  about America that we really haven't heard before.  And it made me very aware of how much,  because I had no part in slavery.  I'm not a part of that.  And I recognize what that has done, Jim Crow,  and all the way up to today in terms of systemic racism.  But he talks about how it, I mean,  he really drove home the point of how it compromised  and is such an essential part of the creation  of our country in a way that was really beautiful  and just entertaining and speaks to the heart.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway.  It's on my list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just added it.  Jeff, see, you had two picks you didn't even know.  There we go.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, your number.  Well, I could do a number,  but I could piss off Carson, my taco buddy.  Yeah.  Piss off the taco buddy.  Why would you do that?  Because he wants me to do numbers all the time,  but I have German words.  I have a whole German thing.  You could do anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody says you have to do numbers.  Yeah, I didn't do a thing today, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody's ever said you have to do numbers.  I even volunteered to take numbers over if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Carson objected and he's my taco buddy  and I'm listening to Carson.  Carson doesn't have a say in that.  With the power grab here.  No, it's not a grab.  He is a threatened old white man, man.  Jeez.  Okay, I give in.  Threatened by a Harvard grad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I submit to my Carson overlord.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, no, so now he says you've done books,  I'm gonna do a book.  I'm not really a book, a story.  A story.  So I just started, it just came out yesterday,  Humankind by Rutger Bregman.  He was the guy who went to Davos  and lectured all the Davosians  about how screwed up they were  and wrong where they were and everything.  He's just written a book called Humankind,  which is about, we're not so bad after all.  You probably won't like it as a result  because you want to think people are just slimed.  But anyway, he has a story in there  and his research that he did in The Guardian.  I just put it up on the bottom of the rundown under other.  The real Lord of the Flies story.  Did you see this tale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did see that on Medium, I think, but go ahead.  It was not in The Guardian.  It was in The Guardian.  But actually, I think I've also read somewhere  that this maybe isn't quite exactly how it was.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'll find that article for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, do?  Yeah.  So obviously, William Golding's novel  we were all forced to read in school  says we're all just horrible people  and it comes out, we're on the island alone.  And then he found the real story of five boys  in Tonga, I think it was,  who basically stole a boat  and ended up shipwrecked for a year and a half  and they had a nice society and they got along.  They made a pact never to quarrel.  And then if they did, they would go take timeouts.  And they would come back together  and then a ship captain, a fishing boat captain  happened to by the island, happened to all of them,  rescued them and they're friends to this day  and it's really quite a remarkable, wonderful little story.  So I've just started the book.  I don't know whether I'm gonna like the book or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were saved by the ship captain  who noticed burning patches on the green cliffs.  Then he saw a boy naked, hair down to his shoulders  who leaped from the cliff side, plunged into the water.  Suddenly more boys followed,  screaming at the top of their lungs.  It didn't take long for the first boy to reach the boat.  My name is Steven, he cried in perfect English.  There are six of us and we reckon we've been here 15 months.  Students at a boarding school in Nukalofa,  the Tongan capital, sick of school meals,  they decided to go fishing, they got caught in a storm.  Okay, nice story.  And there they are later after they grew up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was kind of a goose bumpy story.  So you think it's not the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I don't know, I should never say things like that.  You probably read that on Facebook.  It's a headline I scanned quickly and thought,  oh I gotta read that.  You know what, I'm always suspicious of nice stories.  See, that's the problem.  That's the problem.  I always believe there's probably more to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than meets the eye.  You see, that's your problem.  You're too much of a nihilist.  That comes into your attitude about Facebook  and everything.  Yes, there are.  See, Stacey and I agree again.  You're even mean to my taco buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm mean to, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Leo's mean to my taco buddy.  Now he's gonna find the story and say yes.  In fact, humankind is corrupt and awful  and miserable and jarvis, you fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is both.  I think most people want to do the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  most of the time.  The story as told by the Dutch historian and author  Gert Bregman has upset some members  of the Pacific Island community  who argue the story of the six young Tongan boys  had been instead told through a colonial lens  and missed the Pacific point of view.  Gardening expert, by the way, that gardening expert  has been read more than seven million times.  Yeah, it's phenomenal.  Holy cow.  The story's based on Tongans.  I'm Tongan and I do not relate to that story  because it was told through a colonial lens.  Let me see what they, I told him.  Okay, but I want to see what she didn't like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the account we should have had first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, basically it's because they're Tongan.  We were raised to build community.  It's very hard to exist outside of community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so that's, I guess.  So it wasn't about the nature of mankind  but the nature of Tongans.  Yeah, it's the nature of Tongans, yeah.  Nah, it's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For me, it's hard to process because whiteness believes  it can own everything and everything.  Blah, blah, blah.  I don't think she disagrees about the facts of it.  Okay.  She just mad that, she felt like it was cultural

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  appropriation that this guy got all the credit.  The glory.  The glory.  About writing about Tongans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tongans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you want, you can go back to The Guardian  and read the actual survivor's story of what happened.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's 73 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I think they're resenting that Rooker Bregman's  humankind and the excerpt we just talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got all the attention when it really should have been  the Tongans who told their own story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you want, read the, also read the actual account  by the kid now in his 70s who was rescued.  He says he has nothing but praise for Warner,  the rescuer, Peter Warner.  But he says initially, Warner and the crew  were fearful of the boys because we were all naked  and had long hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because what he explains is that certain places  would drop off miscreants in their own little Australia.  And so you didn't know whether they were dropped there.  And the other part of the story was when they got back  to Tonga, the fishing boat owner whose boat they'd stolen  was still upset and so the boys all got arrested.  And so the fishing boat captain had connections  in Australia and so he said, I'll give you the rights  to the story in Australia for a TV show one time  and give me the money and then I'll buy the boat  from the guy and get them out of jail.  And that's what happened.  And then he, a little more, so he had gone to the  king of Tonga asking to do a lobster business  and the king of Tonga said no.  But after he did this amazing thing, rescuing the boys,  the king of Tonga said, what would you like from me?  And he said, I'd like to do a lobster business.  And the king of Tonga said, okay, you can do  a lobster business.  So what did the guy do, the fishing boat captain?  He hired all the boys on the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so he was good, Peter Warner, in fact.  Yeah, he was very good.  In fact, this guy in his story says, I have nothing  but love and respect for Peter Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, Leo, your reflex, you just wanted to find  a nice story about humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he also said, he said, I wanted to write  Now this Wagner guy's come along and it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I don't think so because the story is so light.  There's a lot more there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, I don't want anybody to tell my full story  until I publish a book from maybe make some living  for my grandchildren.  But he says, I don't blame Warner.  He says, and I know a lot of people say to me things  like Mr. Warner makes a lot of money from our story.  Who cares?  If no Mr. Warner, we never survive.  If no Mr. Warner, we won't be here to tell our story.  If Mr. Warner makes some money from it, good luck for him.  That's my opinion.  I would tell everybody, please shut up.  So there you go, the final word from Totale.  Okay.  And now my pick, I'm exhausted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well yeah, you tear down all of mankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tear it down, I just said I heard, I remember reading  there was more to the story than meets the eye.  I'm not a nihilist.  All right, maybe I am.  So my pick of the week is a free audio editor web based  so this is good for you.  I miss this, I love.  You Chromebook users.  Yeah, this is cool.  Because it's all in the browser.  It's audiomass.co.  And honestly, and I use a lot of audio editors.  This is a very power, this is kind of amazing.  This is the kind of thing.  My students could use this.  Yes, journalists can use it.  It has recording built in, multi-track.  It has effects built in, including normalizing.  It has graphic equalizer.  It's got a limiter, distortion, reverb.  This is essentially the most important parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if I were doing, so this is just editing.  If I were doing an interview with you,  you could record yourself using this  and I could record me using it  and then I could mush the two together.  You wouldn't have to have anything fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and the nice thing is this would work  on your Chromebook.  This is finally a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is exciting because Kevin records,  he does gymnastics to get Audacity running.  That's right.  Well, he's got two machines.  So this is.  He's got to do Linux and all that.  How long have you, how large of a file  have you brought into this to edit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be an interesting question.  And if it's really big, obviously,  it's gonna take a while to upload, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's full audio, not that much.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can take a while.  We'll check a look at this.  Check a look at this.  Check a look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's tired.  Oh, let's go.  And then I wanna mention this is related  and I think this is really interesting too.  Kevin Rose brought this to my attention in his Twitter.  Yes, I read Twitter once in a while.  It's called Descript.  Descript.com.  This is not free, but it's really interesting.  And this might be useful for you, Stacey.  You record audio and then it transcribes it  and instead of editing the audio directly,  you edit the text and that edits the audio.  That's also good for my students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I could just say ums, but not just by,  because right now I take out the ums via the live form.  So you're good if you have the consistent um.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it actually does have a free tier,  three hours a month for free.  You also, if you pay 10 bucks a month,  you can get the human audio transcriptions  and all sorts of stuff.  I mean, it's pretty amazing.  It's a really interesting concept.  That is.  Edit audio by editing text.  So there's two different things for you.  One of more traditional.  And this one is kind of interesting.  I'm sorry, what's this called again?  It's Descript.com.  Descript.com.  Or Descript if you think about it.  I guess it's a.  Oh, I see.  You're Descripting.  I get it.  It does transcription.  Apparently you could do video editing as well  because you can,  what you do is take the audio track like of this show  and then export the edits to premiere or final cut  and do a video edit based on that,  which is pretty darn amazing.  That's fancy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Pretty darn cool.  Also, real time multi-user editing and commenting.  So as you're working with Kevin,  you know, you could do it together.  As I don't know how well you get along,  but you can do this together to edit your podcast, right?  I think it's very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I maintain all editorial control over the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you'd have no Karsten to bother you.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kevin just records with me.  And then, yeah, I don't have a Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten to piss you off, huh?  Watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch it.  I, you know, I don't take feedback.  That doesn't make me angry, Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  I hate you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate you all.  Thank you everybody for being here.  Stacey Higginbotham and her fabulous podcast  on IOT with Kevin Toffle.  You'll find that at staceyoniot.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's next week.  It's actually on Thursday.  Oh, okay.  No, it's not on the 10th.  Next Thursday.  I'm taking off because Thursday's when I do my newsletter.  But I need the time to write the newsletter.  So I'm sorry.  That's fine.  You're so organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll have Karsten do the show.  Wow.  And it'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, don't be sad.  You're gonna get Ant.  And he is just like a cheery teddy bear of a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a cuddly teddy bear of a guy.  Unless he gets mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just.  He's got muscles.  I'm with Ant and I die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't imagine Ant getting mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I've never seen him mad.  He's just the sweetest.  Yep.  And by the way, he posted, we've tweeted it.  He posted on YouTube, on his YouTube channel.  Kind of just a 15 minute stream of consciousness  about George Floyd and about the unrest.  Oh, I very much wanna watch that.  It's very good.  And I just love Ant.  And I think one of the things that really helps  is just to get to know somebody.  I've seen other black people do this on Twitter  and other places where just, let me tell you about myself.  I'm not the enemy.  I'm a human just like you.  I think that's very valuable.  Just to remind us, we're all in this together.  The darkness of one's skin  does not really change anything at all.  At all.  I don't like you, Jeff,  because you're so much whiter than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I am extremely white, thus pink on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Practically pink.  And the more hair I get, the worse it is.  And some would say a pinko.  He is the director of the town.  Look how white he is.  The townite center for the entrepreneurial journalism  at the Craig Newmark.  Craig Newmark, graduate school of journalism.  The Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism  at the City University of New York.  New York.  New York.  New York, I was watching an interview  with the highest ranking uniformed police officer  in the NYPD, and it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was such a New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was so great.  We're gonna try to keep these streets clear tonight.  It was so great.  Oh man, I miss New York.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Stacey.  Be well, be safe. Thank you.  We'll see you in two weeks, Stacey.  Love you guys.  Love you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show is Wednesdays, 1.30 Pacific.  I know it says one on the calendar.  I just learned that myself.  I've been late half an hour for less five years.  So, I don't know.  We'll see if we can do it at one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that was the way to fool you  by telling you it was one.  We actually got to do it by 1.30.  Now, it's gonna be two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Smart.  Smart.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not gonna change the calendar.  That's a very clever idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, every now and then,  Karsten's like, hey, do you wanna do it at one?  And I'm always like, ah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  We could, I mean, I could have today.  We were, Windows Weekly was done at 12.45,  but I instead decided to have a leisurely lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good for you.  I was late today,  but it was cause I dropped my coffee on the floor  and I had to clean it up before I,  I was like, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the most, that's awful.  That's worse than like anything, dropping your coffee.  You have this beautiful cup of coffee,  looking forward to drinking it, and it's gone.  There are lots of things worse.  Not much.  That's as bad as it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh dear.  I'm an nihilist and a Pollyanna.  How does it happen?  I don't get it, I don't understand it.  It's a contradiction.  We do this show every whenever,  Wednesday, 1.30, sort of.
