Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, I want to say, and I know you wouldn't bring this up because you're not that kind of guy,  but I do want to say that I am hurt and chagrined that the school is dropping the engagement journalism program.

Start time: 245.23
End time: 251.78
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  I'm not talking about it.  They say they're pausing it, but I'm not sure exactly what that means.

Start time: 253.04
End time: 255.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tell us what engagement journalism is and why it's important.

Start time: 256.26
End time: 295.30
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So engagement journalism is a program that is the proudest accomplishment of my career to start this program.  And the idea is that you don't start with the journalists and our ideas.  You start by listening to and observing and understanding and relating to communities.  And only then can you imagine what journalism they might need.  And our students come out and they get the most amazing jobs.  They are changing newsrooms.  They're the Trojan horses to change the relationship of the journalist to the public.  And they're just great.  Oh my God.  They were talking about this and it's a great, great program.  And somehow, someway the flame will continue.  Damn it.  Good.  Yeah, it's too bad.

Start time: 296.02
End time: 301.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this wasn't the entirety of your job there.  No, no, no.  I started.

Start time: 301.36
End time: 331.34
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've started three bachelor's degrees and I don't have a bachelor's degree.  I just have a bachelor's degree.  That's hysterical.  Wow.  But you're a working journalist.  I started entrepreneurial journalism, but that's now a slightly different program than I am.  It's a slightly different program though.  I started our executive program, news innovation leadership, which is phenomenal.  It's people, the order of managing editors and editors and CEO, vice presidents and such,  the next leaders.  And then I started engagement with my colleague, Kerry Brown, who's just brilliant.

Start time: 331.80
End time: 346.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And what I admire, of course, is that while everybody is talking about the death of journalism,  the death of local news and the death of newspapers, you're doing something about it,  which I think you deserve some praise for.  You're really looking for new ways for journalism to be relevant.

Start time: 348.61
End time: 393.20
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And the students do that.  They do.  They spend the entire year and a half with one community.  So they get very much in depth with that community to understand that community's needs.  And they do creative things.  One of our students, one of our brand students, for example, used the theater of the oppressed  to get women who had been abused to be able to tell their own stories and change their endings.  One student was a recovering addict and she found ways to serve addicts with data.  Another student lost a sister to addiction and found ways to bring their families together.  Oh, that's great.  It's journalism of a very different stripe.  So I thank you for noticing.  I really am grateful.  I'm very, very proud of everything the students have done.  The school says it's going to come back in some form, but we're going to have to see what they say.

Start time: 393.96
End time: 412.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I put in my vote to support.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It makes a lot of sense.  And we need these new ways to become relevant because we need journalism for crying out loud.  And speaking of which, big change is CNN.  Hmm.  You know, I read the Atlantic.  Oh, that's what we're leading with?

Start time: 412.50
End time: 412.58
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 414.53
End time: 446.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I thought we could do a whole journalism block.  You're a journalist.  Okay.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  Yeah, sure.  It seems relevant.  It all started with an Atlantic profile.  And actually, here's why I'm interested in this.  This is Christopher Lick, who is the CEO, was the CEO.  T.L.M. Iberta was embedded with him for, I think, more than a year and got really unprecedented access,  so much so that he was able to write a long profile in the Atlantic,  which pretty much caused Chris Lick to lose his job, I would say.

Start time: 447.52
End time: 448.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It begins with taking...

Start time: 449.12
End time: 457.82
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was when Brian Stelter said that no one was surprised by what was in it because they were living it.  But once the world saw what they were living, then that was it.

Start time: 458.10
End time: 492.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if David Zaslov had a choice at that point.  So it's because at CNN, Jeff Zucker, right before Zaslov took over,  or maybe shortly after he took over in the merger,  Jeff Zucker, who had been running CNN quite effectively,  had to leave because he was engaged in a relationship with a subordinate.  And Chris Lick was brought in without experience running a giant news division,  but he had experience running...  He created Morning Joe for MSNBC.  And what, he worked at Conan O'Brien?  He worked at Colbert.

Start time: 493.42
End time: 495.83
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He worked at the morning show on CBS.  Right.

Start time: 496.40
End time: 527.95
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So he had some experience in news,  but apparently just it wasn't a good mesh.  And the final straw, and of course, that's all part of this,  I think really well done article by Tim Alberta, assuming that it's accurate.  It ended with, of course, the Trump Town Hall,  which all the people at CNN, the insiders were appalled by apparently.  They hit it fairly well, not all of them, but they hit it.  Nevertheless, it was the beginning of the end.  So...

Start time: 529.26
End time: 562.37
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Perry Bacon Jr. at the Washington Post had a superb column today about it.  He was talking about Lick as an effort to create anti-woke centrism.  That, oh, we're centric and we're not going to deal with this or that or that.  And we're going to hide a doctrine under this idea of centrism  as if there's any such thing,  in a world where we are so unbalanced to find a center between one extreme  and something that's not extreme is not a center.  It's closer to the extreme.

Start time: 563.68
End time: 568.05
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let me channel Ant Pruitt.  I don't really need to. He's sitting right here.  Oh, boy.

Start time: 569.54
End time: 572.31
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I can't wait.  I'm going to...

Start time: 573.30
End time: 578.59
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo is the... it's a little known fact he's the Ant Whisperer.  Oh, okay.  So you say anyway.

Start time: 580.11
End time: 587.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just...  I think that probably  you are fed up and frustrated in general with 24-hour news.

Start time: 588.90
End time: 626.90
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I am. It's really, really hard for me to keep up with pretty much anything going on today  because of the way news is reported.  It's so sensationalized and then there's a whole lot of slant to it.  It doesn't necessarily have to be slanted.  Just give us the facts. Give us the news.  There's a fire that's happening in Canada right now.  That is news.  It shouldn't be a story that says there's a fire in Canada that's happening because of this vaccination  or this whatever propaganda, whatever.  It's always some type of weird slant to everything that's presented to us and I can't stand it.

Start time: 628.15
End time: 640.66
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  You can't give people news without giving them context though.  You can't say there's a fire in Canada without explaining why that fire exists  because otherwise you're never going to help solve a problem.  So I think that's where people get into trouble.  Yeah, this is true.

Start time: 642.26
End time: 649.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But isn't your job to have them solve the problem?  I mean I understand the real problem is if you have a 24-hour news channel

Start time: 650.32
End time: 651.78
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  you've got a lot of space to fill.

Start time: 652.50
End time: 674.57
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I remember when we decided to do 8 hours of news.  This feels like a 24-hour news show.  Yeah, it really does.  I learned my chops there.  I can fill hours with nothing.  So I understand that that's probably a particular challenge.  But are the days when a newspaper would just, or did it never exist?  Just the facts, right?  Which is what Aunt wants, right?

Start time: 675.60
End time: 677.28
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's all I need. Just the facts of the matter.

Start time: 678.23
End time: 679.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just the facts.

Start time: 679.96
End time: 690.75
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I imagine that if you had just the facts, they would not be as valuable as what you're looking for.  It's insufficient.

Start time: 691.94
End time: 698.75
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  In some instances, right.  In some instances, yeah, I would want some.  You want to know why.  Even with sports.

Start time: 700.00
End time: 723.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Think about a sporting event.  When you watch someone broadcast sports, obviously you want the facts.  You want the scores and the stats that go with the person.  But there's a tremendous value in having a commentator who knows the team.  It can be like, oh, Ricky Bob has just lost his father last week,  so he's probably playing pretty poorly.  I don't see how he's going to handle this time.

Start time: 723.92
End time: 726.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a cricket player. You don't know the cricket.

Start time: 727.36
End time: 729.10
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Actually probably is, I wouldn't know.

Start time: 729.85
End time: 753.30
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's good.  But what I don't necessarily want is if I turn on NBC to watch the game of the week,  and it's say Oklahoma versus Texas, and the broadcasters are clearly for the Oklahoma seniors,  that's a problem.  Neither one of those are my teams.  But I still want to enjoy the fact that this is a competitive football game.

Start time: 753.40
End time: 758.63
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's the proof of what Stacey said.  You could just watch the game.  But you want commentary?

Start time: 759.44
End time: 774.40
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  You could just turn the sound off and just...  Give me the commentary of first and 10.  Some color.  The 28-yard line, and it's a little warm out here today,  so expect a lot of drop balls and humidity.  See, I love it when Tony Romo does his color because he was a quarterback.

Start time: 775.00
End time: 777.65
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See here, they're looking for the...  They're playing the defense.

Start time: 778.74
End time: 783.64
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  It's an eight-man front, so they're probably expecting a run on third and two.  So I love that kind of stuff.

Start time: 783.78
End time: 787.03
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me try this out on you. Not sports, but in the room.  By the way, that's what I have Lisa for.

Start time: 788.26
End time: 790.66

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Start time: 798.70
End time: 818.65
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a movement called Solutions Journalism.  The idea is that the journalists don't solve anything,  but that when you report a problem,  if a community is working on a solution,  you should also report that.  You should let people know what they're working on,  and we can judge that, we can judge success or failure,  but to leave it alone with saying,  the world's F'd up here and F'd up there and F'd up here,  is insufficient.

Start time: 820.00
End time: 828.00
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  The fact that they're mentioning that there is a solution out there,  that's factual.  That's giving me the facts.  Let me channel you one more time.

Start time: 828.08
End time: 851.61
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because what news does now, and it's all about ratings,  it's the same thing.  Twitter is the way it is.  You're going to stick around longer if you're upset,  if you're outraged.  Whether it's MSNBC or Fox or CNN,  if they want ratings, the thing to do...  They admitted that.  They know that.  The thing to do is get you pissed off.  And that's wrong.  You're tired of being pissed off.

Start time: 852.36
End time: 868.36
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's the thing.  I'm not saying everybody needs to be like Aunt Pruitt,  even though there's nothing really wrong with that.  Why?  There's a lot right with that.  There's a lot of society saying,  hey, this is not good.  Stop giving us this garbage.

Start time: 868.62
End time: 872.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bet you, you feel manipulated by these guys.  It's very easy to be manipulated.

Start time: 872.82
End time: 873.33
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Very easy.

Start time: 874.64
End time: 908.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is.  And they know how and they've refined it over years.  And it's a challenge.  Now, the reason I bring it up, there is a tech angle.  Although I'm fascinated by the soap opera as well.  But there is a tech angle.  Because I saw somebody say,  you see what Alberta did to Licht?  Watch out.  Because Michael Lewis has been embedded with Elon Musk  for the same amount of time.  Watch out.  This is an interesting new form of journalism  where you spend a year with the subject,  a long time with the subject and create a profile.  And there's a high risk level  to giving that person that kind of access.

Start time: 909.97

Start time: 913.08
End time: 919.44

Start time: 935.71
End time: 936.94

End time: 955.20
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'd prefer not to hand over my recordings.  Anyway, I guess I have to.  So that's of interest from a tech point of view.

Start time: 955.50

Start time: 959.54
End time: 974.71
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was doing research this week  for the internet book I'm working on.  And I was on the AI chapter.  And I started digging into long-termism.  Whoa!  What a rabbit hole, a rat hole that is.  Have you looked at that much?  What is long-termism?

Start time: 975.82
End time: 979.58
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Are those like the clock of the long now type people?  Not really. It's more than that.

Start time: 979.84
End time: 993.38
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's what Peter Thiel believes in.  I think it's a little bit of Sam Altman.  Fried was also there.  It's related to effective altruism.  Musk is into this.  So the deal is...  This is where, by the way,

Start time: 993.80
End time: 1006.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  from previous shows,  the term existential risk comes from.  Right, exactly.  This whole notion of AI being an existential risk,  when you see that in that 20-word statement,  that's long-termism.  Right.

Start time: 1008.24
End time: 1052.64
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's related to a whole bunch of things.  Let me find it here in my write-up.  So they believe that in the future  there will be  10 to the 54th human beings  if we do a good job  and if we populate the solar system  and maybe the universe.  The future has so many more people  than we have today or in the past.  So that really changes our priorities  about things.  We should really worry about our obligation  to that future, which on the one hand  sounds okay, because let's get rid of climate change  because we want to be nice to our  great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren.  But it brings with it  all kinds of things.  I'll give you the real problem here,  which is

Start time: 1054.56
End time: 1059.85
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it ends up becoming  something the Nazis used to say,  the ends justify the means.

Start time: 1060.74
End time: 1080.58
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  But it also means other things too.  Enhanced human beings is part of this  so that you can move ahead.  Well, that starts to look like eugenics pretty quickly,  which is another Nazi thing.  The idea that  maybe you should  push resources and money to rich people  because they're more likely to improve the future.

Start time: 1080.70
End time: 1085.75
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very beneficial to billionaires.  It's all you really need to know.  And then you can stop right there.

Start time: 1087.00
End time: 1129.28
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  An acronym, test creale.  So it's a combination of  transhumanism,  extropianism,  the belief that technology can make us  immortal, singulatarianism,  you know what that is, the singularity,  cosmism,  a cosmic belief in promoting  life off Earth, rationalism,  we know what that is from our  philosophy courses, effective altruism,  it's good to make a fortune,  and long-termism, which also  is utilitarianism in there too.  You start digging into the beliefs  and it gets  wacky.  It ends up justifying a lot of  and the things that happen like the Holocaust  are just ripples in the bigger context.

Start time: 1129.54
End time: 1149.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It justifies a lot of bad behavior in the present  because you're projecting  down the road and oh, it's all about,  trust me, it's okay for me to be rich  and build a house in a silo  because it's all about the future  and not the present.  It really is a terrible  point of view.  There's a guy named Emil Torres

Start time: 1149.62
End time: 1162.75
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  who was a long-termist  who's now a non-believer  and they have written  a lot of really interesting things  digging into this.  It so informs  these tech boys.

Start time: 1164.15
End time: 1180.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's appealing  because the principles aren't wrong  so it's very appealing especially if you have  a sci-fi, futurist mindset  but it's used to justify really  poor behavior. It's really why Elon Musk  and Peter Thiel and  why would all these guys  support RFK Jr.?

Transcript:  It's a great way of  avoiding responsibility for what's happening  right now in your factories.  But I'm thinking of the future.  Right, exactly.  Anyway,  the other side of this that I thought of  when all of this came out  because of course  one of the great issues  that Jeff Zucker had to face and  Chris Licht had to face at CNN  is this issue of 2020 denialism.  2020, you know, the election  was a lie  and Trump won.  Of course, the very first thing  that happened in the Donald Trump  rally that CNN hosted  was  you know, Kaitlin Collins said  who won the election in 2020 and Trump said I did.  And as much as she would try  there was no way  she could interject on that.  Which they knew was going to happen.  They knew it was going to happen.  So you may remember Twitter, Facebook,  YouTube all blocked  election denialism.  What is the term for this  2020 lie?  The big lie.  They have now  and this is an article from platformer  Casey Newton all given up  blocking those. YouTube announced this week  yeah, we're not going to block videos  with the big lie  anymore. Twitter has  long stopped blocking  that. There's this huge  movement and one of the things  Casey says which is really interesting  is that Elon has been the stalking horse for all this.  Companies like YouTube  and Facebook watch carefully what Elon  gets away with at Twitter  and go oh  okay, we can do it now too.  This does not bode well for 2024.  Forget the  future.

Transcript:  That's actually  I don't know. I couldn't find  the reason.  Casey says one function Musk now serves  in the tech ecosystem is to give  cover to other companies seeking  to make unpalatable decisions.  Across a variety of dimensions, Musk  has moved fast and loudest  and when others have followed the response  has been Bailey and Wimper because we're all paying  attention to Elon, right?  Mass layoffs, stricter job performance  requirement. Remember Twitter laid off  almost more than half of its time.  Damn near everybody.  Show up or death.  A war on remote work, paid verification  for social accounts,  Twitter checks. All of these served  as a kind of aphrodisiac  for other Silicon Valley  CEOs who proceeded  to implement their own slightly softer  versions of Musk's  cultural reset. In effect, he moved  the Overton window, I guess.  He was so extreme.

You thought it was Taco Tuesday.  Though he might end his day  working on Twitter, which also has a T. So it could be  Twitter Tuesday.

I don't have to work as hard because  everybody on the team was working for  that same goal. We knew it was just going to be a little bit  of a rough patch right now, but just get  there and then things would even out.  And we all agreed on it.

Transcript:  Here is YouTube's official blog post,  an update on an approach to  U.S. election misinformation.  We craft our policies.  We always keep two goals in mind.  Protecting our community and  providing a home. Oh, boy, here  you go, for open discussion and debate.  These goals are sometimes  in tension with each other.  They feel it's important to be able to openly  debate political ideas.  Is it really a fair thing to say that a political idea  is Donald Trump's assertion that  he did not lose the election four  years ago? No, it's not. Three years ago.  That doesn't seem like, that's like flat  earthers saying, well, you know, if you had an open  mind, you might consider  anyway, when we first  instituted... You can go two ways.

Transcript:  You can say, this is a place where  anybody can say anything and it's up to you to judge  and we're not going to do that. Or  this is a place where we're going to try to have a quality  conversation and we're going to act upon that  and put the investment into that. But  you can't kind of be in the middle of that. You can't  you know, and that's where section 230  came in, is you can't  kind of say, I'm going to warrant  that I have a good place, but then I'm not going to do

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  anything. Right. So YouTube is saying  we have taken down  tens of thousands of videos.  But we decided to reevaluate  the effects of this policy in today's  changed landscape in the  current environment.  Now listen carefully to this logic. We find  that while removing this content  does curb some misinformation,  some, it  could also have the unintended effect  of curtailing political  speech  without meaningfully reducing the  risk of violence or other real world  harm. What the hell is that?  I debate all those points. First of all,  a lie about something that happened three years  ago is not, I mean,  that's misinformation.  Is that you also were saying, hey, we want you to have  your free speech? That's not political speech.  Maybe it is. Yeah, political speech is

See, they don't want you to know.  They don't want you to know this stuff.  Okay. And so I'm  going to play devil's advocate here. I'm not, I'm not necessarily  believing this. I'm not as good at this as Leo is.  But one could argue that  you're better off to leave the crap up  and let the best stuff win.  That's kind of the argument about the  marketplace of ideas.  And that by thinking that we can get rid  of all wrong and stupid and bad things,  um, we're going to  constantly fail against that. And so  why try?  That would be an argument. I'm going to

Transcript:  All of our election misinformation,  this is YouTube again, misinformation policies  remain in place, including those that  disallow content aiming to mislead  voters about the time, place,  means or eligibility requirements for voting.  That's good. Cause one of the  voter suppression is a very big issue, right?  False claims that could materially  discourage voting,  including those disputing the validity of voting  by mail and content encourages others  to interfere with the democratic processes.  So they're going to keep taking that down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have these, they have  panels,  death panels. No, that's a different kind of panel.  They have,  it sounds like, so we have an election  focused team,  including members of our intelligence desk,  trust and safety, and  product teams monitoring real  time developments and making adjustments to our  strategy as needed.  So maybe they're saying, look, if this really does  get to be out of control, maybe  we'll change this policy.  We'll have more details to share about our approaches  as the election comes. I think all  social networks,  really you're going to have to pay attention to what's going on  because it is going to be a very  changing landscape with AI misinformation  and all sorts of stuff.  So it's absolutely prudent  to say, we're going to watch this  closely.  I don't think, do you, so  remember that  we just recently had a Supreme Court case  where the plaintiffs  asserted that YouTube by recommending  terrorist videos  was in fact liable for terrorist attacks.  By the way,  YouTube was protected.  The plaintiffs lost that case.  As did Twitter one as well.  Both YouTube and Twitter won in those  two cases.  So they're not liable.  In a way,  that's the Section 230, that's good,  that gets them off the hook if they do  recommend election denialism  or if they take down election denial  videos.  So really, basically  all that happened is  you can do whatever you think is right.

When  steam powered presses, Atlanta types, and  stereotyping came in, the average circulation  of a daily newspaper in America before that was  4,000, it was a substack newsletter,  it was smaller than your  newspaper, it was smaller than your  instance. And then it went  into the millions. And that led to mass  media, it led to a whole attention economy  and advertising, and this presumption that  everything had to be huge to be  worthwhile. I think that's what corrupted  so much of our worldview.  And it came from media, and it went into  the internet, and now we've got to try to  get rid of that.

And also, if weird  sub-communities  start niche and then they come out and  start affecting things, and that's where we  are with some of these like weird  QAnon and H-chan.

Because I think that's what the internet pretends to do.  I think you're right. Yes.  And it came from  that... again, there's a technology  story. It was because of number one,  the steam powered press, number two,  cheap paper made from wood,  three paper made into rolls for machines.  But that made it possible. For the Linotype.

And that's what you got.  In this book is the directory  of American newspapers in 1900.  And when you look  at the time, and this is to put to your point, Stacy,  the reason I ran away to get this, is because  if you look at New York City, I mean,  it's just phenomenal what existed  together.

Transcript:  of what you're promoting with engagement  journalism, is this notion that  a journal should serve a community,  not just a mass market.  Yes, a mass market is good for  the guanets of the world,  but really, for the  people, it's better  to have a local market, an  engaged market. I sure prefer that.  What if you have both? Okay.

Start time: 2418.34
End time: 2462.16
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Because there is value in pulling  stories. Like a Joe Rogan, for instance.  Okay, I was going to say  there's value in pulling small  stories and niche stories  up from those places to the  mass, because  normal people aren't going to care  about a particular topic,  but it could be like, let's look at a  solution. Maybe a  small community in New York has come up  with a really cool solution to stop  people from  idling at schools,  which is terrible for air pollution,  it's bad for kids. So they've created  a great program. It's really important  that a mass media picks up that  niche solution that has been written about  in a local paper to broadcast  it other places. Does it have to be mass

End time: 2483.43
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  everything spreads. That's how things, how did  Black Lives Matter and Me Too spread?  Mass media came late to that party, and  mass media did not cover those stories that have existed  for decades and generations. It  spread because the people  had the mechanism to do it. So it spread through

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  social media, which we're kind of  in this era of...  Yeah, highly decentralized.  We don't have a mechanism  that's good for the viral  flow of compelling stories.  And, you know,  there's always going to be a  culture, there's going to be a point in the  culture, or positions in the culture  that decide what the culture  wants to care about.  And that is mass.  And so...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No.  Really? I'll disagree there.  Again, that comes to the  economics of mass, which is  what Ant was saying, is how you make money  by getting as many people as possible.  Before broadcast,  before mechanized print,  that wasn't the case.  And it was big enough to have a vaudeville  show. It was big enough to have  a newspaper that covered your community. It was big  enough to have a magazine. Yeah, okay, maybe it was before

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I'm suffering some brain...  Okay, I  think Stacy needs...  We did a whole  live stream of the event on Monday.  Apple announced  a lot of stuff, but I think you  always are watching with an eye towards  IoT and Apple's... They didn't mention  HomeKit much.

Start time: 2986.89
End time: 3027.35
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I watched it because  I was like, if they launch a  headset, I'm very curious  because this has been  marketed as  the next generation of computing.  Ultimately, I just care about computing,  right? We watched... Kevin and  I watched it together. Sure, HomeKit.  Yes, we were definitely like, oh, do we  care? Do we care? But we also watched it because  oh my god, was Apple going to  actually do a headset and would it be  compelling? We thought,  well, yes, they did.  And it was compelling  for...  It was compelling.  We'll throw out the caveats later,  but I was really excited by  this. I really thought...

Start time: 3054.77
End time: 3128.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They solved a lot of the  issues.  There is a role for this sort of  device in our lives.  If you take it for that role  and not for... It is not an  iPhone. It is probably more  of an additional device like the  watch and maybe even the HomePod,  which we're not sure if it's ever going to be.  But the watch is a success that we were first like  what the heck? But it's not  a replacement  for your phone. What it is,  it's a device  that will give you  deep immersive entertainment.  It's also a device that really  has the potential to change the way we work.  I think that's really  compelling. I also love  the sensor integration. I think the work  that Apple's doing there on low-latency  sensor integration  on a computing device  will be useful for robotics.  It'll be  mostly useful for robotics.  It'll also be useful for bringing  a spatial  computing that's not limited  to a headset, but for computing  and sensor integration throughout our bodies,  like devices on our bodies  to a central device.  I think there's a lot of potential here.

Start time: 3128.24
End time: 3138.16
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But Ms. Stacey, there's been a gazillion  different headsets and things out there  these last couple years.  I guess timing is everything. That's the difference now.  No, let's talk about what Apple did right.

Start time: 3140.54
End time: 3173.39
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think Apple did a couple things that  really addressed some of the issues. I've tried both  the Oculus, I've tried the  Magic Leap, I've tried  the HoloLens. Those are the four  headsets that I've had in my life. I have  not tried this device.  I hate  augmented reality, and I hate augmented reality  a lot because I don't  feel safe in it because I can't see my  environment around me. So I thought the fact  that it lets me see the environment around me  and...  But I thought AR did let you see...  Okay, alright, yeah.  AR does. So the HoloLens does.

Start time: 3174.44
End time: 3176.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So did the Magic Leap.  Yes.

Start time: 3178.20
End time: 3180.18
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Magic Leap was the closest to this because

Start time: 3180.20
End time: 3188.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you could go either direction.  Right. I was going to say the...  It's a little digital crown that lets you tune  in or out the background, the real

Start time: 3188.26
End time: 3224.12
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  world. And I think that's really compelling. That  gives you a lot of power is the ability to tune  in and out. Yeah, I did that.  And then it also gives...  I think the context is pretty  creepy, like the little eyes,  like the vision of my eyes is creepy.  But it is also...  That is a nice way to  clue people into what's happening.  And then the ability to actually  do smaller gestures and not  have additional hardware, I think is important.  That is cool. And I also think...  This isn't something...  I don't even think Apple wants  you to wear this all the time.  And I think that's really important. You can only do it

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There may be one... I don't think normal  people will walk around... Five years from now  I don't think we're going to see people walking  around with us on their face. I think this is  going to be like the iPad in  the sense like it's a great  entertainment consumption device.  And some people like it for work because it  lets them bring their work to their couch or  someplace a little more comfortable.  I think this is a similar type of device.

Start time: 3266.54
End time: 3312.64
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  And see, you're saying  pretty much the same things that I was thinking  the other day because  when it popped up on the screen, all I  could think about was Google Daydream and how Google  just totally ruined that because  it was something from an entertainment standpoint  I thought was quite good.  It could have been a little bit more refined  down the road and not necessarily  require you to have your phone  right there and heating  up on your forehead. I'm sure Apple  has figured all of that out from a heat dissipation  and all that stuff. But the  whole immersion with  entertainment, I thought that was brilliant.  I used to love taking a break from  work, just sitting in my workspace or whatever  and then take a little 10 minute break,  grab the Daydream, turn on Netflix  and watch something and just totally  forget about work for 15, 20  minutes.

End time: 3380.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One thing people say is, well, three grand a day,  three to five hundred a day, but in a couple of years  it will be less and so forth. That's not the problem.  I have a fundamental  flaw.  To me, I've seen many technologies with  fundamental flaws flop.  Not because they, A plus  on the technologies,  A plus on execution,  A plus on marketing. I'm sure they'll spend  billions, literally billions over the next  six months marketing it. That's what they do.  But no, maybe  I'm wrong. You tell me. I have  this visceral reaction to strapping a  computer or strapping a screen on my face.  I don't think anybody wants to do  that. I certainly don't.  I've done it. You've done it.  It's cool, but I don't  want to do it. I don't like it. It's not even that  cool. I don't think normals are supposed to do it. It's briefly cool.

Start time: 3380.26
End time: 3396.20
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think you will strap a computer on your face for an immersive entertainment, like luxury or immersive entertainment experience.  I really do. I think some of the things they presented are so compelling that you will not mind strapping a computer to your face.

Transcript:  I agree. Once the spectacles you're wearing right now, Jeff Jarvis, or the ones I wear when I'm not on TV,  can have augmented reality, fantastic.  I will pay $5,000 for that.  I'm not against that idea.  There's a big leap from what we've got today to that.  Many of those technologies are not existent.  Furthermore, there's a real risk that just like the Segway, which was a great technology,  but it was DOA because people said you look like a dork on that thing.  If enough people go, I don't like it, it could kill the real valuable technology down the road, spectacles.  If Apple says, geez, we spent $50 billion and nobody bought it, I ain't going to develop spectacles.  It's AR winner.  I like that.

Transcript:  Sure.  I was excited about this because I thought the fine resolution, the fact that I could start consuming more information and manipulating it was really compelling because I deal with a lot of information in my day.  I love the idea of having all those big screens, like 120 inch.

Transcript:  When I'm sitting down to do like a finance story is a great example because I need a lot of information from me and instead of going back and forth,  like having all of my relevant information while I'm sitting there and I tend to write and then leave a lot of TKs to fill in.  But if I had and I do that because it's too distracting for me to go like find it.  But if I can organize a story like that and then just sit there and be like, OK, it's 60 million dollars a year.  OK. And oh, this happened in 1942.  Like that's really compelling.  OK, so let me understand.  It is niche, but there are lots of people who are trying to assimilate information.

I thought I thought if I even said it out loud to our tour guide and to Lisa, probably the next time I come back, I will be wearing some sort of augmented reality device that lets me go switch back and forth between what I'm seeing right now and what it looked like 2000 years ago.  It just can't.  It just would be amazing.

And I can see going up to the kiosk as I go towards the, you know, the Palatine Hill and say, I'd like to rent that for a day, because that would be really cool.  And so I agree with you, Stacy.  There's some definite educational valuable, you know, if you're going to train a mechanic, if you're I mean, there's a lot possible.  But these are all very niche.  And I think in the long run, aren't enough to sustain a market that Apple needs a big market for this to succeed.

Like when they talked about like capturing moments and stuff that obviously this think of this like your old school DSLR camera.  So you had situations like maybe your trip to Rome where you would bring this in it when it comes to capturing memories.  Maybe when you like thinking about like, should I bring my headset on this trip?  This is the device that you're going to bring with you consciously because you want the features it offers.  OK, and you're going to pick it up at decisive moments.  You're going to make it.  It's not like a casual thing like your smartphone where you're like, oh, cool pictures.  Snap.

We're probably not going to make a lot of money on it, but we're going to get a lot of feedback.  I would figure out how we can refine this to make sure into the iPhone four based on the bill of materials.

Start time: 3817.90
End time: 3850.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the bill of materials, I would guess Apple's not making a penny on these.  That's the first thing I understand.  This probably cost them almost exactly what they're charging.  Right. It's a lot of stuff.  It is. It's eleven cameras.  Seven screens. It's a huge effort.  And not to mention twelve cameras, sorry, and not to mention what must have been ten years of sunk cost and developing it.  This is a massive effort.  And I'm wondering if Apple thought this was a good idea, as we all did five years ago, and it has made them put it out because I don't think there's a market for it.

Transcript:  Hold on. They designed the R1.  This is a chip designed to deal at a low latency level with dozens of inputs from high powered sensors.  It's a fancy DSP.  It is a fancy DSP, but they now have this.  So when you look at that development and developing an operating system for that and understanding just the drama that's going to come from trying to deal with all of that signal coming in and managing it, that's valuable for them.  That's going to be valuable even if this flops.  And Apple knows, I mean, Apple builds stuff with an eye towards the future in everything.  I mean, look at the fact that they're focused on vision for all the stupid things for HealthKit because of this stupid device or because of this device.  And I'm like, oh, okay, go Apple. Yeah.  And I think if you think about a future with an Apple watch, think about the earbuds talking to something, you've got your phone on your body, maybe you've got some health sensors that are like maybe you're wearing a continuous glucose monitor.  Imagine being able to take all of that data in processing it locally and privately and being able to, you know, I'm not arguing against that at all.

Yeah.  What about Glass?  How do you carry them?  What about?  I mean, there's all sorts of whatabouts.  There's technologies that don't exist.  I understand you need to take the first step.  And so maybe this is just the first step.  I think there's a great risk, though, that this first step is going to be such a horrendous experience for everybody that people don't take the second step.  Apple might just pour hundreds of billions of dollars into this.

Just somewhere there's a there's my box.  Twenty six.  The iPad.  You know what people it really makes people mad for me to say this.  So I apologize for, you know, as I said, pissing in your cornflakes.  But I think as it's my responsibility as a tech journalist to say this is what are you talking about?  The emperor's wearing is naked naked.  I see his twig and berries swinging in the wind.  Yeah.  And I'm sorry.  I don't.  That's just it's my job to call him as I see him.  And you know what?  I hope I said you should be.  I hope I'm wrong.  And I hope in five years I'm wearing spectacles that are full are with with earbuds in that are detecting my blood glucose.

Thank you, Adam Singer.  It's a picture of Jim Carrey is the mask.  I get it.  Big green face.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you honestly, that is true as an Android user.  This is an absolute ecosystem lock in to use vision pro.  You scan your face with an iPhone.  Yep.  This is have to.  This is.  This is never ever going to be available to Android users.

The first thing they do is they scan your phone later to create your avatar.  You scan it with the vision pro.  But in order to do the iris scan and stuff, they need the you have to have a late model iPhone with the LIDAR on the front of it.  Yep.  Now that may change when it comes out.

So the work they've done on gaze detection here is very compelling.  I actually thought Google solely would be amazing for the gesture sensing.  We're using camera data.  That's fine.  But that's going to be really important for what I would call true spatial computing, which is when the computing is actually all around you and you're trying to interact with that.  But sure, they can call this face computing spatial computing, too.  So I just want like in a real world of spatial computing, the user interaction data and work that they've done here is also going to come in super handy.  That's all.

And it is, I may have to authenticate on the phone, but I may not if, because if I'm already  logged in and authenticated, it'll say, no, he's, yeah, he's, he's Leo.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Transcript:  We had to a couple of years ago when the wildfires hit Northern California,  we were six miles away from one of the biggest fires in Sonoma County.  And in fact, we had our go bags packed.  It was so scary.  And we had a backup plan for the studio in case it burned to the ground.  And at that time I got purple air sensors in the house because I want to know what the air quality inside was as well as outside the house.

Start time: 5330.70
End time: 5348.04
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And the benefit of purple air is these are expensive.  Like also an outside air quality monitor is like 200 bucks.  But if you put it outside, you're actually contributing to the purple air network, which takes data from all of those sensors.  And that's how I can find out what that's three miles from me.

Start time: 5348.30
End time: 5348.47
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 5349.63
End time: 5389.51
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's actually one down the street for me.  And air quality dramatically differs based on distance, based on all kinds of things.  Like if you're at a lower elevation, you're going to have poor air quality typically.  You know, so like I live on an island and the air quality across the island can differ on the air quality index by like 50 or even 60 points sometimes.  Wow.  So outside, that's great.  Right. The purple air quality sensor, that data feeds into things like Google.  Google on your displays has a QI air quality index measurement.  It has both a color and a number.  And your color you're looking for is green or maybe yellow.

Start time: 5392.12
End time: 5393.97

Start time: 5407.71
End time: 5414.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what?  It's so awful.  You don't want to go out.  Now I have to point out that the purple only measures particulate pollution, right?  Right.

Start time: 5415.64
End time: 5427.20
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So let's talk about your inside.  So that's measuring things outside and being a citizen scientist.  Yay for you if you decide to do it.  But let's say you're just a normal person and life is just sucky and you're looking for a good air quality monitor.

Start time: 5427.68
End time: 5434.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and I wanted to know what it was like inside because we fled the outside because it was unsafe.  But I wanted to make sure it wasn't getting in.  Right?  Yeah.

Start time: 5436.40
End time: 5442.20
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So some things you need to know about, you need to close, like I was talking to somebody who had their windows open today.

Start time: 5442.49
End time: 5443.93
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, close the windows.  Their area.

Start time: 5444.20
End time: 5449.10
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And I was like, close your windows.  Normally fresh air is your friend, but if it's smoky outside, it's not.

Start time: 5449.24
End time: 5449.47
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 5450.47
End time: 5471.04
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  Your air conditioner is going to pull in outside air.  That's what your air filter is for.  If you're having like wildfires, like we would change our, like when it was bad, we would change our air filters like every week and they were, they needed it.  So you need to keep an eye on that.  Not every three months.  That is not like when it's this bad, you need to change them more often.  Is it visible?

Start time: 5471.40
End time: 5472.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can look at it and it's yellow.

Start time: 5472.58

Start time: 5474.52
End time: 5501.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got, I think maybe we got suckered.  I'm not going to say that.  But we had the guy come out and he gave, we bought a thing that goes on the furnace, on the heat pump, on the first slash air conditioner that does some sort of static charge.  And then we bought filters that are electrified.  The idea being they ionize and as a result attract particles and do a better job than regular filters.

Start time: 5502.87

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Start time: 5503.94
End time: 5508.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5508.38
End time: 5555.05
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Ionization does, yeah, it does help.  And so once you're inside, so there are air quality monitors for indoors.  Aware makes one, AirThings makes them.  Amazon even has one.  Usually, so for fire damage, you need to check for one that measures particular particulate matter.  PM 2.5.  Yes.  And that's, that's your big, so, cause the big things they're going to monitor is temperature and humidity.  Almost every single one will do that.  Some of them will monitor carbon dioxide and the idea is if carbon dioxide gets high, you want to open a window because it's going to make you sleepy.  But not in the case of fires.  It's complicated.  Particulate matter and then VOCs.  Volatile organic compounds.

Start time: 5556.22
End time: 5556.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 5557.88
End time: 5570.02
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And that's another open the window situation.  But a lot of them don't measure VOCs or they won't measure particulate matter.  So you really, in this case, look for particulate matter because that's what you're looking for.

Start time: 5570.92
End time: 5583.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the 2.5 and PM 2.5 is the microns, the size of the particles.  They're very bad.  You can get PM 1.0, those are going to be much more expensive, I think, because it's smaller particles.

Start time: 5583.75
End time: 5606.20
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, and your filters may not tackle that.  So these are just like warning systems, right?  Now we're going to talk about filtration.  So you got your filtration of your indoor air.  I can tell you there's tons of great smart options that'll be like, oh crap, your air is terrible.  Boom. Take it out.  But what Leo's about to show you is the Kowei.  This is like my favorite air filter.  You know what, really?

Start time: 5606.69
End time: 5637.99
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's expensive.  It's funny. When we had the fires out here, a lot of people made TikToks on how you can make your own HEPA filter by those furnace filters and build a box around a fan and strap it in.  But that's kind of it.  You actually just need to take it.  That's what this is.  Yeah.  Inside here, there's a physical filter which is capturing dog hairs and things like that.  But inside the physical filter, there's a HEPA filter, which is kind of a paper, corrugated paper filter.  And that's what's catching the apol—we've got to clean this.  So here's the next thing.

Start time: 5639.40
End time: 5648.16
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So there are two things you need to know when you have these air filters.  The Kowei, most of them will have the air megas.  I have an air mega that is also really good.

Start time: 5648.26
End time: 5653.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5656.22
End time: 5662.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5662.24
End time: 5665.18
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then there's—  Oh, that's the HEPA filter.

Start time: 5665.20
End time: 5672.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the HEPA filter.  That's the HEPA, right?  Yeah.  Yeah. If I take this out, you can see it.  So you wash that screen one.  It looks just like a furnace filter, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 5673.71
End time: 5674.79
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  You replace that guy.

Start time: 5676.48
End time: 5681.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the co-ways have a reminder when to replace and all of that stuff.  I think it's—

Start time: 5681.20
End time: 5684.46
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So is this the same stuff people were putting in because of COVID when we thought—

Start time: 5685.47
End time: 5685.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Start time: 5686.75
End time: 5687.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  That's effective.

Start time: 5688.22
End time: 5716.54
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Because the virus particles are also—they're smaller than the PM5, but the PM5s are what  people were—2.5, sorry, 2.5.  So once you have these—so I have used and like—oh, the other important thing you need  to know about this is these are sized for rooms.  So if you have one running in your room, you need to close the door.  So the co-way that Leo has is about, what, would you say a 10 or a 10 by 15 room, 10  by 10 room?  Yeah.

Start time: 5717.46
End time: 5728.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's probably too small for this room.  I have one in my other studio.  It's exactly the right size.  And the Mega, which is a big cube, that'll do 600 square feet.  That's a pretty big device.

Start time: 5728.54
End time: 5730.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think this is 150 square feet.

Start time: 5732.77
End time: 5748.56
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you want to close off those areas if you can, and you want to sleep with that running.  And a lot of them will have a—if you're buying one, you want to look for—some of  them have a smart mode where it'll be like, oh, I detect problems, and then it'll go  —and start moving harder and harder.  Yeah.

Start time: 5749.40
End time: 5750.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have that in all of these.

Start time: 5750.42
End time: 5758.38
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that doesn't mean internet connected.  That's just a nice feature.  And the other feature you want to look for is the ability to turn the LEDs off at night.  Yes.  So they'll have a sleep or night mode.

Start time: 5759.09
End time: 5779.49
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  I agree.  So this is good.  So this is good.  We have co-ways all over the place, and we're very happy with those.  There is a secondary issue of ozone, which these things don't take care of.  Some of these fires are so nasty, they're actually putting not only particulate matter  in the air, but ozone in the air.  I don't know what you do for that.  I really don't, so.

Transcript:  Well, the molecules help with ozone.  They're really more for things, VOCs like formaldehyde.  They're more for that kind of stuff.  So I don't know how you get rid of ozone, to be honest with you.  One of the problems with a lot of filters, and you should always look and see, is they  put more ozone into the air than they take out.  Sometimes it's a side effect of the filters.  So you want to be careful about that.  And Wirecutter did a very good job at least talking about these particularly HEPA filters,  and they recommended the co-ways.  So that's why we got co-ways.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or get yourself some Dyson face filter headphones.  And if you wear them with a Vision Pro, you don't have to worry about people because they're  run when they see you.  Those don't work.

Transcript:  Joe in Club Twit had actually a really good tip, one that I have not followed because  of my life.  But his pro tip is if you're going to get multiple air purifiers, get the same brand  so you can stock up on the same filters.  And your air purifier, y'all, is only as good as your filters.  And they'll all give you a notification, say, hey, watch that screen.  And that happens like every probably a couple of weeks in my house.  And then they'll be like, OK, it's time to change the filter.  And that's that's what's filtering your air.  So you actually do need to have those.  Oh, and if you go outside, N95, not a surgical mask.

Transcript:  Right.  U.S. has sued Coinbase and Binance.  The SEC says these crypto exchanges are basically fraudulent.  They are subject to SEC rules.  They haven't registered.  Coinbase said, wait, what?  Hold on.  We wanted you to tell us this a long time ago, but you refused.  I saw Jim Cramer.  Not that I trust Jim Cramer say he knows that all this is the time to get out of to get out of cryptocurrency.  Yeah, you know, that's probably right.  And then I don't know if you saw this Financial Times piece.  It's unfortunately behind a paywall.  The SEC is wrong about crypto exchanges.  This is a guy named Robert Armstrong who says no.  He says, let's see.  He says, I, on the other hand, can only die on the hill where I planted my flag back in November.  Cryptocurrencies are not securities.  And so the SEC should leave them alone.  This, by the way, not based on a view that crypto has a special value that needs to preserve.  On the contrary, cryptocurrencies are dangerous nonsense.  One, the market can be trusted to kill before long.  If this does not happen, cryptocurrencies should be regulated like smoking, gambling or pyramid schemes.  Is that Leo Laporte or someone else?  Sounds like me, doesn't it?  In either case, this stuff should not be granted the dignity of regulation under securities law.  I kind of agree with them.  They're not securities.  They're magic.

Transcript:  accusing the firm of mishandling customer funds, inflating trading volume on the site and taking steps to evade US regulation.  In addition, yesterday, financial regulators from 10 states, including California,  also filed legal actions alleging Coinbase was operating as an unregistered securities dealer.  And I understand the FT's point that it's you shouldn't even think of it as a security.  It's just gambling.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  So you shouldn't regulate it then?  There's going to be more reason to regulate it?  Yeah.

Which I agree.  They really shouldn't be thought of as securities.  I don't know.  I mean, is it more risky to invest your thousand dollars in Bitcoin than it is put your thousand dollars in McDonald's?  And lotto tickets?  No, it's still.  It's more like lotto tickets in McDonald's stock.  Is it though?  I mean.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Really?  This is not a straw man you want to toss up because McDonald's, they're regulated by the SEC.

Remember the whole T-Mobile sprint deal required, the government required that they offload  a lot of their stuff to Dish, Boost Mobile particularly, and that they would support  Dish in creating a, because the regulators are concerned, and now you're down to three  big carriers.  So T-Mobile said, no, no, no, we're going to make Dish the new fourth carrier.  Right.  But Dish has a lot of debt.  They're struggling a little bit.  They still haven't launched Boost's infinite wireless service.  So why not just buy them?  Amazon.  Well, I think there might be regulatory issues there too.  I don't know.

So maybe there is something there with Dish.  They talked to one analyst who said this is perceived as a lifeline for Dish.  For the three big carriers, Amazon's entry is troublesome.  Yes, sure it is.  Anyway, yeah, it's just a rumor still.  It's from Bloomberg.  Consider the source.  I said Engadget earlier, but Engadget is quoting Bloomberg.  Oh, okay.  Oh, this is great news.  This actually is a cautionary tale.  There's a Menlo Park, California company called Grail that sold a very expensive $950 blood  test to detect cancer.  Customers signed up.  Grail inadvertently told about 400 of them, you've got cancer.  They didn't.  The company said it sent a form letter to some customers who had bought its gallery  test, which detects a marker for more than 50 types of cancer, stating incorrectly that  a cancer signal was detected.  I don't know if that means you've got cancer or not.  It means you might have this gene.

Transcript:  Well, by the way, that's also in the news.  CNET has said it's got new guidelines for AI journalism to which the writers union said,  no, you don't.  Was it journalism in quotes?  Yeah.  As you may remember, CNET got in a little bit of trouble because  about 70 articles were written by an AI.  They didn't disclose it.  And worse, the articles, which were mostly written for their personal finance section,  were often wrong.

Transcript:  That's why there are no fat Swiss people.  They're all dead.  Ratclad is a great tradition for the new year.  I think everybody should have more cheese in their life.  There are two broad categories of pursuits where CNET's responsible AI machine partner,  RAMP, will be deployed.  The first, which CNET calls organizing large amounts of information.  Actually, AI is very good at that, right?  Provides an example that seems more authorial though than that umbrella descriptor lets on  this in gadget writing.  RAMP will help us sort things like pricing and availability data and present it in a way  that tailors information to certain audiences.  Without AI, this volume of work wouldn't be possible.  This customization wouldn't be possible.

Start time: 7311.38
End time: 7350.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you don't have any writers, and you don't have any actors, what do you got?  Podcasts.  CNET's new guy, let's see, Google,  I Heart Media says, don't use chat GPT.  Joining a long list of companies, including Apple, by the way,  that won't let their employees use chat GPT.  And then there's the Wall Street Journal article about  a chat bot designed to help prevent eating disorders.  The National Eating Disorders Association created a bot  and replaced, of course, their operators on their hotline.  Thoughts?  With the bot.

Start time: 7350.62
End time: 7386.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, this story is a mess.  It is a mess.  Thank you.  This story is like the reporting is all over the place.  It's clear that someone is not telling the whole truth on the timeline,  but they started out with a traditional chatbot that had a flow chart,  like set of predetermined answers.  At some point, it added generative AI,  but it's unclear if they did that before or after they shut down their hotline.  And they shut down their hotline because people were waiting too long.  Seven days.  And probably.

Start time: 7388.58
End time: 7400.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said this is, it's not like, it's just an informational line.  It's not a crisis line.  It's still seven days.  If you're looking for help in your eating disorders, wait too long.

Start time: 7401.84
End time: 7440.47
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So it feels like this is not as simple like they fired all their workers because AI was awesome  and then AI just messed up.  What they had was they had a bad chatbot or they had a chatbot  and then they had a really slow AI hotline.  So they fired the hotline people because they were like, it's no good to anyone.  Somewhere in that timeline, they also took their chatbot and added generative AI.  And then the generative AI started promoting things that is not good for people who have  eating disorders.  Like, Hey, you should count your calories, which is not great.

Start time: 7443.71
End time: 7479.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's really, it was a very confusing story.  There is a paragraph way down that says internet or other interests surged on the hotline  because over Memorial Day, they had 600% increase in volume after news reports said that Nita  was using Tessa to replace the humans who were in the process of trying to form a union.  However, Nita says, no, no, that's not what happened.  We decided to shut down the hotline after a three year review from our board of directors  because of increasing risk factors and overwhelming demand, causing long waits.  Well, how well did that work out for you then?

Start time: 7479.86
End time: 7480.64
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That didn't work either.

Start time: 7484.77
End time: 7487.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 7488.26
End time: 7492.34

Start time: 7493.15
End time: 7500.63
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  But again, I agree with you, Stacey.  Very unclear article.  I couldn't figure out what happened really.  And you don't want AI around.

Start time: 7502.38
End time: 7529.78
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, mental health is pretty nuanced.  So if you want to do it like as a screening mechanism, you can do it.  Sure.  But you can't actually deliver quality mental health through.  And I know that everyone wants that to be scalable because how awesome would it be  to have mental health be scalable?  But even working with a therapist, it's not scalable.  You're going to go in fits and starts.  So tech solutionism does it again.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Transcript:  This is Brewster Kale writing, ended last month, tens of thousands of requests per second  for our public domain OCR files were launched from 64 virtual hosts on Amazon's AWS.  The activity brought us down for everybody for about an hour.  Engineers scrambled on a Sunday afternoon on Memorial Day weekend to work on this.  We got the service back up by blocking those addresses.  But another 64 addresses started the same activity.  A couple hours later, we figured out how to block the news set.  He says, finally, if you're starting a large project, please email info at archive.org,  because while we want to help you, we can't.  We don't have the bandwidth.  Gosh, I love it.  Archive.org.  I give them money every month.  I got to give them more.  That's all I could say.

Start time: 7686.92
End time: 7749.06
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So he goes on.  He says that there are the religious people who are saying AI has bad force.  He calls the AI boys who were saying it's going to kill everybody, bootleggers,  because they're trying to promote themselves.  Yes.  It goes through that.  He's right there.  He's right there.  Absolutely right.  He goes to the risks.  Will AI kill us?  No.  Will it ruin society?  No.  Will it take all the jobs?  No.  He has backup for that, some of that.  Will it lead to crippling inequality?  Well, we can debate about that because it's just capitalism.  Will lead to bad people doing bad things?  Yes, it will.  Then he goes on.  Then his final shtick is what's to be done.  Well, this is amusing because it's a BC libertarian saying, well, don't regulate AI.  Don't do regulatory capture.  Allow open source.  I agree with that because we're going to have more competition.  I think we need more competition.  I think that's true.  And what we see happening in Europe is they're going to try to regulate the hell out of it  and stop AI from being open source, which I also agree would be a mistake.  I said nice things about him.  This actually is pretty good.  Of course, he can't see it because he blocks me.

Start time: 7750.09
End time: 7754.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 7755.06
End time: 7787.76
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do too, actually.  Yeah.  But there is a little bluster in it about how it's going to change all of our lives  and save the world.  It's not going to do that.  It occurred to me too that it's the mistake of it's the problem of using the word intelligence  with this stuff.  It after it modifies it from the start.  It's not intelligence.  It's an augmenting thing to help us do what we want to do.  And it will be more efficient and it will gain knowledge of all kinds of things.  It will do neat stuff, but it's not going to change.  It's not going to save the world nor is it going to destroy the world.

Start time: 7788.98
End time: 7806.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we should have a new segment on this show called Bromide and Bluster.  I really like that.  That's a show title.  That's really good.  If you get past the bromides and ignore the bluster, what he's saying is actually,  I think, a pretty good prescription for how we should treat AI going forward.

Start time: 7808.58
End time: 7827.36
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Okay.  The bromide was human intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better.  No.  The bluster.

End time: 7878.57
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to that first.  Go down a little bit, Leo, because the paragraph just amused the hell out of me.  The one right there, the last sentence there,  fasten your seat belts for an insightful, engaging and potentially worrisome ride.  But the thing is, Leo, that paper, Natural Selection Favors AIs Over Humans,  that's a real paper.  And I read it and it's ridiculous.  Like out of this long-termism thing that AIs are going to become their own bodies  and then they're going to compete with each other.  And then, you know, it's Darwin time.  Daffy Digital Darwin, that the most powerful AI will survive over all the others.  Yeah.

Because last week you said, and I think this is true, you have now become pigeonholed as that  waffle eating, complaining.  Own it.  Always ready to go home.  Own it.  Host.  And you're not.  I know you're not.  You're just playing it up.  And so we're going to rehabilitate Stacey's image.  She's going to become the Della Street of this show.  If we start talking media again, she's going to become that person.  And by the way, he's Paul Drake.  Jeff's Paul Drake.  We're talking Perry Mason and I'm Perry Mason.

The idea is it's a camera.  It doesn't have a lens.  It's really just a little computer.  You enter in a prompt while pointing.  It has a GPS, I guess.  While pointing it and then it will generate an artificial reality  picture of what you're actually taking a picture of.  You see he's trying different things.  He wants to set.  He can get rid of all of his cameras.  Look at this.  It does an AI graphic of where you are.  Look at that.

Transcript:  Our show today, we'll be right back with our picks of the week.  Our show today brought to you by the great folks at Cisco  Meraki.  They are the experts in cloud-based networking from hybrid work.  Whether your employees are working at home, at a cabin in the mountains,  or in a lounge chair at the beach,  a cloud-managed network is designed to provide the same exceptional work experience.  Doesn't matter where they are, whether they're in the office or not.  And by the way, you might as well roll out the welcome app because hybrid work is here to stay.  Hybrid work though works best in the cloud and it literally does have perks for both employees  and leaders.  Workers love it, right?  They can move faster.  They can give you better results as long as they've got that cloud-managed network.  So everybody's on the same page.  Leaders like it because they can automate distributed operations,  build more sustainable workspaces, proactively protect the network.  Actually, that's really important.  Meraki commissioned an IDG market pulse research report  highlighting the top tier opportunities in supporting hybrid work.  First of all, good to know, hybrid work a priority for 78% of C-suite executives.  Leaders want to drive collaboration forward, but they also need to stay on top of or even  boost productivity and security.  And that's one of the big challenges.  The IDG report raises the red flag about security.  Now, 48% of leaders report cybersecurity threats are the number one obstacle  to improving workforce experiences.  So that's where you turn to Cisco Meraki for always-on security monitoring,  part of what makes the cloud-managed network so awesome.  IT can use apps from Meraki's vast ecosystem of partners,  turnkey solutions built to work seamlessly with the Meraki cloud platform.  They can do things like asset tracking and location analytics.  You can gather insights on how people are using the workspace, right?  In fact, in a smart workspace, environmental sensors can track activity  and occupancy levels, stay on top of cleanliness.  You can reserve workspaces based on vacancy and employee profiles.  So you can efficiently hot desk.  Employees can quickly scout out a place to work.  And if, by the way, you have restricted environments,  get the employees to book in advance and then include time-based door access  so they can only get in during that period of time.  You also get mobile device management too as well, integrating devices and systems,  which means IT can manage, update, and troubleshoot company-owned devices,  even if the device and the employee are elsewhere, at the coffee shop, on the beach.  You can turn any space into a place of productivity.  And these days, you got to look at this.  Empower your organization with the same exceptional experience,  no matter where your workers are.  With Meraki and the Cisco Suite of Technology,  learn how your organization can make hybrid work work.  Visit Meraki.Cisco.com slash Twitter.  That's Meraki.Cisco.com slash Twitter.  I always feel a little guilty when I'm talking about that  because we made you all come back to work.

End time: 8534.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to hot desk.  You got your own desk.  I really have mixed feelings about this, but I decided I missed having everybody here.  And I think we, as a group, it didn't quite work as well.  I wasn't worried about productivity, but I think there is something that happens  when everybody's in the same space.  And I know that's been a little hard for people to kind of get used to it.  But I think it's...  I'm getting used to seeing you again.  Yeah.  Well, for instance, we had editorial meetings.  They used to all be on Zoom.  Now we're all in the same room.  Yeah, we're all in the same room.  I think they're much more effective.

Transcript:  Stacey, what's your thing this week?

Start time: 8592.84
End time: 8636.00
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  You know what?  I'm going to help you all out if you all care.  If you're worried about your indoor air quality, the aware element for $209  measures all five of the things I told you it would measure,  which if you care about carbon dioxide, VOCs, particulate matter at 2.5, humidity and temperature,  this particular one is one of the only ones on the market that measures all of those things.  And it's $209, which feels like a lot.  Amazon does have one that's about 70 bucks, but it does not measure VOCs.  And I don't think it measures carbon dioxide.  I think it measures carbon monoxide.

Start time: 8637.16
End time: 8663.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have, of course, by law, we have to have carbon monoxide detectors in the house.  And I do.  And yeah, you definitely want that.  Actually, we had a furnace guys come in, check the furnace.  He said, you know, I have a big hole in your flue.  And you're what?  You know, the, with an exhaust for the furnace.  And I said, we have carbon monoxide detectors.  How come they didn't go off?  So now I'm worried that we got to.  So he sold you some new carbon monoxide detectors?

Start time: 8663.58
End time: 8664.60
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  No, he sold us an influe.

Start time: 8664.82
End time: 8666.12
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Stop having people come to your house, man.

Start time: 8666.64
End time: 8677.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He said, I'm going to tape it up with duct tape.  I said, you know what?  Can you give me a new flu?  It was in the garage, but that's where the carbon monoxide detector is.  I was.  Oh boy.  Anyway, what do you, what's the brand name?  What do you recommend?

Start time: 8678.86
End time: 8742.94
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So this is the aware is the brand name and their software is some of my favorite software for this.  I used to have the aware glow, which was fun.  Now, if you're like Stacy, that's way too much money and it doesn't actually clean my air.  I have another $200 option for you.  That's really good.  And this is the three M filtrate smart air purifier and air quality monitor.  Now this was the one 99 99 one is going to get you rooms up to 310 square feet.  So that's going to clean larger rooms.  You will have to replace the filter with the three M HEPA filters, but those are actually  really good filters.  And this is not going to tell you things like VOCs or carbon dioxide or monoxide really,  but it will tell you particulate matter.  And I think it tells you humidity.  Most air purifiers, if they're running on the higher settings, they're pretty loud.  So this one is kind of loud on the higher settings.  So if your air is really dirty, you're going to hear this.  But that's the same thing for my air mega.  I think the Co way is probably the quietest one I own.

Start time: 8743.08
End time: 8751.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  We have the Co ways running right next to our microphones and you don't hear them  unless it suddenly says, oh, and it goes up to high and then you're going to hear.

Start time: 8751.84
End time: 8752.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Start time: 8752.28
End time: 8766.54
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And the three M quiet when it's not, but the nice thing about this one is it has a display  on the top that tells you the index.  And then it also gives you like a green, a red or a purple light.

Start time: 8766.94
End time: 8769.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it ties to your smartphone as well.  So you can see it on your smartphone.

Start time: 8770.50
End time: 8789.82
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it'll tell you like, it'll give you the battery information, the filter change  information and that sort of thing.  So I've been running, I've run those and they're good.  They do clean the air.  And they have screen filters that help if you keep those washed, that helps trap more  particulates before it gets to your filter.

Start time: 8790.02
End time: 8792.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was that thing we showed you on the Co way as well.  Yeah.

Start time: 8793.25
End time: 8797.46
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's that.  Filtrate.  Those are my things.

Start time: 8798.38
End time: 8802.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 8804.26
End time: 8806.66
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Not the aware glow.  It's the aware element that does all five.

Start time: 8806.86
End time: 8807.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you like the aware element.

Start time: 8808.16
End time: 8815.14
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It, yeah, I had the, they don't make the aware glow anymore.  They don't support it anymore, but I did love that thing.

Start time: 8816.76
End time: 8822.46

Castle, which is a, I think does, does work in, in, in office stuff and all those things.  They have a regular, um, back to work barometer.  The 10 city average of office occupancy is 47.6% if you scroll up.

Start time: 8861.54

End time: 8898.82

Start time: 8905.14
End time: 8944.98
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's always felt that way, but it's really, it's so much better than when I used to live there.  It's way better a place than when I was there, but still, yeah, it's a deserted field.  Austin and Houston are relatively high.  Austin has 56%.  Uh, Houston, 57%, 58%.  Wow.  But, um, but yeah, average is 47.6%, 47.6% ten city occupancy, less than half, which makes me worry  a little bit about the, um, coming real estate crash.  Cause a lot of those are leases that are still on and the buildings are still getting paid.  When those leases come up, then nobody's going to want them.

Start time: 8946.94

Start time: 8956.44
End time: 8985.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, certainly downtown San Francisco is hard to work there because you got to wade through,  you know, a fentanyl market and, uh, an outdoor, uh, privy and it's just not pleasant.  Um, but now it, there's Hilton and Park 55, both.  Park 55, right.  Closing, uh, in San Francisco, just walking away, ceasing payments on hotel properties,  let they're, they're going bankrupt, uh, and say, you know, let the creditors have them.

Oh yeah.  This is really bad.  And went way down and, and at some point the cops came up to him and said, what are you,  what are you doing here?  They get in the back.  Really?  Yes.  Holy cow.

Uh, Lisa and I went down there and it was like, we're never going back here again.  Um, the restaurant was amazing, but she walked a block away,  you know, we're, we're parked a few blocks away, uh, literally 50 feet from the front door,  some guys defecating in the street.  That really kind of puts you off your food.  Fifth is where I used to work.  Yeah, it's across the street from the old Chronicle building.  It's terrible.  It's very sad.  Um, you know, but I was mad when I saw the CNN Anderson Cooper, San Francisco is dying thing, but  at the same time, it's hard to deny that there's trouble.
