Transcript:  I'm excited. Yeah, I love doing all about Android on Tuesdays with you Jason and we miss you Gina and  Yeah, it's great to great to talk about things other than Android because I'm not a one-trick pony

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Well and you've been on you've been on tech news today a handful of times and I mean you talk about it  All you don't care. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do my best to stay informed as I can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent. All right. Well, we've got a lot of stuff here in the dock  Actually this being Ron's first time he looked at the dock and he was like, whoa, we're talking about all this stuff  It's okay. It's okay. This is a list of all the things that are happening  To blather on yeah, exactly exactly  So Jeff, why don't we start with you?  Cuz you're in your your as you said Anaheim for VidCon and you go there. I think you go there every year  I know you were there last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the story is last year I was coming to interview Jake Uygur of Young Turks on stage and  As I was leaving that morning my daughter said where you going and I said, oh, why should I why you going?  I said I'm going to say have you heard of it con and her response was  Well, yeah  Why the hell aren't you taking me you awful father so I begged Jim Lauderbach  I begged him to please I would I would do anything this year to get back in so I can bring my daughter who is  Down the hall and is looking forward to tomorrow and Jim has me interviewing Sean Atkins  Who's the new CEO of MTV on stage on Thursday, which I'm really looking forward to and it's an amazing  I don't know. I was looking up the number because I need a number this week  Last year was 23,000 people  It's phenomenal. A  Just an absolutely packed. There's three floors, right? The bottom floor is the fans  And and and my daughter has a wrist filled with four wristbands so she can get into the meet-and-greets with four of her  Favorite stars the floor above that is creators who make all this stuff  The floor above that is the industry that exploits the hell out of the two floors below  So I'm here for industry and speaking for the old farts floor  But it's really really amazing last year the big lesson  I got last year from being a VidCon that I've dined out on for the whole year since is  That I saw that with these young people video content is not a destination. It's not a product. It's not a thing  It's a social token that people use in their own  Conversations to their own ends we in media have to figure out how to make things that work similarly  We don't know how to do that because we're egotistical and we think that we are the be all and end all and that's just not  The case that the relationship that people have to media is very different here the pity of this year's VidCon  They did something very very smart something they absolutely had to do  I'm very glad they did it but they had to tighten down on security given the two attacks in Orlando  Don't forget the first one was on a you know a popular YouTube star and a tragic murderer  So they've really they have 450 security people here this year  You know the fans won't be able to just mob around their their people to be very organized and the meet and greets  It's a real pity that the world comes to this, but that's where we are  But nonetheless, I'm looking forward to VidCon. It's really well run. That's what indication of how well they really think they  Are responsible for a lot of young people here, and they take that very seriously. That's a great conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're talking about kind of kind of the state of video obviously VidCon. That's what it's all about and  Twitter I believe this happened to VidCon. This was an announcement at VidCon. I think it was yesterday  That they're kind of changing some things at least with Twitter's approach to video and then beyond that  Vines approach to video we're all used to vine videos  You know being six-second short videos  And I think they're still staying that way from what I understand from their announcement yesterday VidCon  Is that vine video the the primary vine video that is posted is still six seconds?  But you can post related videos that are opening up that restriction from six seconds out to what is it?  140 seconds long so lengthening it out so all the so yet again these video services or you know services  Social networks that are serving video are getting closer and closer to being kind of the same thing to each other  I don't know. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I know I know that you know  There's a huge following on vine of people who love the six-second limit and have been incredibly creative  In using it and there are people who you know are specific  You know specifically vine creators because of that limitation and you know there's always that die-hard audience who just loves you know what you know  This is the platform they came up on and they don't want to see anything change of it  But for me as a content like I'm not I'm not an active user of vine  I probably I watch a video on snapchat more than I watch on vine  But I think having the option to do extended videos is a good idea  And it just shows that you know that you know these companies have to evolve because it's funny because Jeff I wanted to ask you  You know is VidCon how much of an emphasis on YouTube is there a Vidcom or is it?  Completely because I've never been is it supportive of other platforms like vine and Vimeo and what not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They talk about it all I think that John and Hank Green intended to start it as a as a YouTube thing  But decided just oh what the hell let's make it broader than that and  Smart that they did but yes YouTube is gigantic here Susan Wojcicki the CEO gives a keynote last year  She did this year. She will again  This is YouTube space, but but it's everything else is as well  My favorite thing in the in the old farts industry track tomorrow warning. There's a half hour primer to us old farts about how to use snapchat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been playing with it for the past couple of months and and the first month was rough  It was I mean less at all as as as a as a burgeoning old fart Jeff. I was I found it to be  I've had a  But um, but no I've been but but after a couple of months of using it  I've actually been enjoying it a lot and some of the you know  Some of my friends who I follow really good at it and I I think the stuff they've been doing a content is really interesting  It's really compelling, but yeah, it does it does. It's a bit of a Rubik's Cube to actually figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a really it's a reprogramming of how anyone who's like used to you know working with video  I mean we do video on a professional level  So we've got that extra layer of complication when it comes to figuring out a service like snapchat  But just general users, you know recording video the thought if you have any sort of legacy kind of exposure to that is  You're recording everything to keep it, you know  And you're recording everything to make sure that ten years from now you could still watch it or that is there when you want  To refer back to it later  Even though I've got hundreds of thousands of photos and videos and most of those I'm probably not going to look at ever again  You know because I've got so many so I don't know if that makes sense either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, that's the that's the thing with snapchat that I've struggled the most with is that there's actually two things  I've struggled with is one is the temporary nature of it, which is you know, I'm so used to leaving a digital  Breadcrumb trail behind me, you know, you can go back  I can scroll through my Instagram feed for the past couple of years and see where I've gone what I've seen all that sort of  Stuff but the idea that stuff is gone and snapchat. I don't like because there's stuff  I've seen that I wish I could have hold on to  Furthermore the lack of a feedback loop. I'm used to you know hitting the you know, this the heart or the star  Whatever is the icon or the like button or whatever the the plus one whatever the the kind of thing to give the creator  Yes, I've seen this and I liked it  But without other than chatting or sending something back to the other creator, it's just like there's no feedback loop  So I have a hard time with it, but but people say that's why it's so good  So to each their own but it's it's definitely been fun to play with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about you Gina have you spent any time messing around with snapchat?  Have you been lulled over pulled over into the dark side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have I had a friend of mine who works at a college  Give me like a snapchat lesson and it was extremely eye-opening  like and I felt I just I felt like the way that my  Parents must have felt when I was like a kid and showing them how technology worked  I literally was just like this is crazy and and just it's a whole different whole different culture  I also just getting used to the you know, the ephemeral nature of it  Although you can take a screenshot of someone snaps, but then they get notified that you do that  I heard I guess this is one of those sort of more advanced  So I got into it for a little while  But but yeah, I think it's I think it's a really interesting app  But also I feel like young folks keep the old folks out by making it sort of difficult  On your own  Which good for them, you know, that's cool. Everybody needs their their

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Space sandbox, I suppose the keepout sign on the door. Yes, that's pretty much what snapchat this snapchat icon is  Megan Moroney on yesterday's techniques today really made a good point as far as snapchat is concerned and just involving kind of like  kids being  Open to the idea of this kind of ephemeral disappears, you know that we leave no more breadcrumb chale  And that's just because they've heard  you know the grown-ups talking about it and talking about how you have to be safe on the Internet and how you have to  Make sure that you don't share too much and this and that and that's that's their exposure to the Internet from such a young age  So it makes a little more sense  I wish that I could reprogram my brain like that because I think that sometimes it's probably a good idea to not throw  Everything out into the Internet  I'm just so used to it and maybe a part of that is just because it's part of what I do for a living  And it's kind of ingrained in not only my personal life but my career  but I think there's value to kind of taking a step back and and opening yourself up to  kind of the goofiness of just  recording something that's nothing more than a silly thing to watch one time and react to and move on and I have a hard time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it really makes you it really makes you realize the kind of concepts that you just have just become ingrained  Like I mean, I'm old enough that I remember that the idea of the permalink, you know was just like  Revolutionary, you know that you publish something online  You're gonna keep it at this link and it's always gonna be there and people can you know refer back to it  You know was was such a big deal and that's something I just always held on to that  Of course, you would have this item archived at a certain place where you could always get to it  But I love how snapchat kind of throws that on its head and I also think for us  I mean we're broadcasters, right?  But I think the majority of snapchat users are just messaging with their friends, right?  Like they're not necessarily performing or using stories or at least as far as I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, all I know all I know is that I've been actively using it for about three or four months now and I've yet to receive any nudes  So I was told there would be nudes and there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  disappointing Ron  You're doing it wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearly clearly I can't find the button to unlock them. That's the problem. You have to swipe diagonally from the top. That's the secret code  Whole new world apparently  So do we think I mean vine has as a service has kind of it had a lot of traction in the beginning and  because of its limitations, you know kind of mimics Twitter's idea of  Keeping keeping things short keeping things refined to a smaller, you know in that case a shorter video and  Seeing just what would happen. I remember when I first heard of about vine  I thought it was the most ridiculous idea in the world six-second videos. Who's even gonna take the time to record six-second videos  What can you even do with it?  But a lot of people, you know created an art form out of it  But it really seems like vine over time over a short period of time has really kind of been left a little bit in the dust

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyways, has it died on the vine

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are using vine to like tease their longer videos on Instagram or YouTube and so this change is just about vine wanted to  Capture those folks, right? I mean, this is what that's about  They just don't want people to tease and then say okay watch the full video at this other place. Yeah over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean and I just generally I have a I mean we all know the the problems at Twitter and and you know  and over the past year and as we've seen that drama unfold, but I  Generally have a problem with the way Twitter has implemented things like vine and periscope into their own products as opposed to  Folding them into the Twitter platform themselves. I would believe that they would have a much  You know better  penetration of use and more activity and stuff like that if they were coming up my Twitter feed or if they were integrated somehow if  There was some way to make them, you know, not so autonomous and make it kind of unified  You know, I remember a couple months ago having a car when Facebook rolled out Facebook live  And we're having a conversation with some friends about how it's you know  It's probably gonna you know eat periscope and meerkats lunch because Facebook is so big it might have even been on all about Android  This conversation I've had but um, you know and and if if Twitter had just embraced periscope and  Made it a live video streaming function of Twitter from the get-go. I bet you it would have been that much more successful  And then things like that happen today  Down in DC with the with the sit-in in Congress being on periscope more people would see stuff because  Periscope is like this ghetto periscope and vine  I feel like these ghetto eyes little applications within Twitter that don't get a massive amount of use because they're not a primary focus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and you only really know to use them if you know that they even exist  I mean Facebook does this with Instagram right like Facebook owns Instagram Instagram's doing all right  It was doing all right before Facebook came along and snapped it up  But Instagram absolutely benefits from the sheer fact that there's that cross play right?  Like even if you're just on Facebook  You still see the people that you follow their Instagram posts kind of come in and it says, you know  Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Memory jog there. Yeah, or even how Facebook is implemented Facebook live  I mean  I have a friend who likes that he gets off work and he grabs his guitar and he just does indie rock covers  To anybody who wants to watch and I open up Facebook and I see hey Russ is on live right now  And I and I watch I've watched it more  I've watched him on Facebook more than I've watched anybody on periscope and I think I think it's because it's it's it's you know  Serving up that content where I am  You know and and whether or not they're you know, whether or not, you know  I know YouTube is is tinkering a bit with the streaming with the live streaming stuff, but it's not a huge focus  But there's I think there's a lot to be said about  Serving content to people to where they are and I feel like Twitter kind of cut their nose off to spite their face with those with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These two products. Yeah, I also think it's interesting that that on on Facebook  I felt there was a time when I think Facebook discouraged you from putting your Twitter feed onto Facebook and  Now I don't sense that because I think there's exactly what you just said Instagram is there any way other things are there anyway  What the hell?  This is your place for people come together and I think I think it's the Instagram ownership even changed some of the kind of ethic  of Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. And yeah, you just jogged my memory. That's that's exactly how I used to use Facebook for the majority  It would import my Twitter feed  And I know this because you get those memories those look back memories of this day and it's like up to a certain point going backwards  It's actual stuff and then before that it's like these short little blurbs that make absolutely no sense because I was putting it on on Twitter  So I'm actually pretty happy they did that because it forced you to use the service a little bit differently  Speaking of Facebook and their video kind of pursuits  There was a document that was sent to Wall Street Journal that shows about how much Facebook is paying for its live streaming  Efforts with Facebook live we've heard plenty of times in the past that they're paying  Organizations paying celebrities that sort of stuff to stream using the service and  It turns out at least based on these documents around 140 contracts  Totaling more than 50 million dollars, which I don't know if that seems like a lot or a little I mean to Facebook  I realize that's like a penny if even a penny that's probably less than a penny to Facebook  But but still they're they're willing to pay for this. Is there any reason why they shouldn't be doing this? Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that if you look at it as face-to-face content  Got a problem with that a problem with the telephone conflict, but what the  Publish it to me  This is and this is the this is taking the place of ad revenue that they believe will come in when start my time last

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we were losing you a little bit there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other feed we'll fire that up when we get there I went ahead and disconnected  This is this is something for a little bit later in the show. We can maybe talk about it next but  Yeah, so I don't know Gina. Do you think I mean should Facebook be doing this? What do you think? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do think that Facebook should be doing this should should should media companies be agreeing to this easy  That I really really don't know about  Because yeah, it feels I don't know whatever I guess I have this kind of sinister view of Facebook  I just feels like they lay in the trap  And then you know and then what happens, right?  Right, but then what happens? I mean like what's what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean like they they clearly have money to burn and if content I mean we we we as content creators  often struggle with you know how to monetize our content and if this is an avenue for  Organizations like BuzzFeed or whomever else to monetize their content. It seems like a win-win  I mean, what would be that what you know, I don't really I think I'm glad to see Facebook investing in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, we're gonna call Jeff back what were you gonna say Gina I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was just saying like, you know until they change their terms or change the rules or you know the kind of you know  It just it just feels like  Whatever. It's that icky feeling that I have about like just becoming dependent upon a platform for distribution

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But and all the platforms would love for you to become dependent on their platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly, and maybe it's not listen. Maybe it's not a bad thing. It just makes me feel a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worried for the media companies not play Facebook, right? But we're not we're not hearing that we're not hearing the the the e-word  We're not hearing exclusive in this way  I mean, maybe they're doing exclusive content for Facebook live  But they're not keeping BuzzFeed from doing stuff on snapchat or for what obviously because they're active in those other platforms  You know, I mean if I was a mean, I mean I I'm I'm a content creator and if I was at a larger media company  That Facebook was wooing and offering three million dollars to commit to using the platform over the next two years that it's great  Yeah, sure  You know and and I think that we've got this we've got this weird and and I get it  but we've got this weird feeling of  you know trepidation or or you're kind of you know kind of fearful of Google of Facebook of these big companies of  What they're doing, but I just see it as them investing in the in the ecosystem, you know  They want content so they need to support the people creating content to put on their platform and the circles got to keep going  And will that money always be there probably not I mean we saw the same thing with YouTube a couple years ago when YouTube got  super  You know hyper supportive of vloggers and and made YouTube stars and all stuff like that and that has evolved and changed over the years  Since that started happening like five years ago  So, you know who knows what it will be in 2017, but for now good buzzfeed cash that check go go do stuff on Facebook  I think that's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fair  Kind of  Is if they favor the content they pay for over the content that they don't right then a company like twit  Can't break in if they're favoring. Yeah, I don't know. Let me cut up CNET. Yeah, that's the that's the issue  What's the the channel conflict? Yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, but that's what that said that that's that's fair market, right?  I mean, that's I mean that that's them, you know, it's it's frustrating for an upstart  Video content creator company to do that, but then the argument could be made that that's the  That's the motivation to make better content to increase your audience to get noticed so that this is just another level  I mean, you know just you know, you know, I know nowadays any you know, Jason  We often talk about music a lot and all that Android but you know nowadays any band can get together and record  Garageband and put mp3s up on band camp and now they're published but years ago  There was a hierarchy and bands got signed by record labels because they did the work and they were you know  And earn that spot and I think there's something to be said for having a discipline in your content creation and having levels to attain  And you know putting money back into the content creators  I think is a good thing in this in this period of ad blockers and you know all these other ways to  Reroute around revenue and and it's really hard to make content. We know we know this personally so I  Mean I would worry too about the prioritization, but at least they're putting money into the into the ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knows maybe Facebook will pay all of us to do live video at some point great  I would gladly three point zero five million dollars or does that just go to BuzzFeed the highest paid publisher on that list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I tried out I we tried out the new mevo camera at CUNY  We had Sri Sri Navas in the social media weekend at CUNY last week  So we did an episode of dot NYC  Using the mevo camera and the sound isn't there yet because they don't have the software yet for the direct input  It was just the mic, but it's really impressive  Producers sitting there with an iPhone it will click on faces move boxes around produce the entire show  With with a $400 camera and an iPhone and you think about what people could do on Facebook live coming up  It's gonna be amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I had not really looked into this camera a whole lot before  I mean I'd heard about it, so this is basically the little kind of like tabletop you put it down  Live event camera does it follow the action as as it's no no it's a hundred fifty degree angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like getting a four camera shot in one  So it's get mevo comm yep and  From live stream, and it's and it's really sweet  It's it's just amazing because all you do is it all and what it does do is it recognizes?  Faces I think you're right actually Jason  I think that if you have a focused on my face, and I move unlike what just happened  I think that it would stick with me if you want that I think that it can do that  No rig required math, but the camera is not moving. It's just moving the division within 150 degrees right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got the full resolution, and it can lock on to you yeah there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, is this an episode of dot and we see which episode is this like the latest episode of that at me see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we did we did we did kind of a test an experiment with  Social media weekend yeah  Nice that's cool  So I put it we put it on dot NYC's  Facebook stream which didn't get many users I get in the future. I probably should put on my stream on Facebook  And the sound is not perfect, but it's but it's it's impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. I like that a lot being able to just smack it down there and all of these things that are that are making it less and less  Required to have a jammer be standing behind the tricaster right now. Thank you somebody somebody go pat him on the back

Transcript:  We go back to video for one. Let's do it  Fascinating story so I don't if you saw that that members of the Congress held a sit-down  Over over the lack of action on gun control legislation and  Because the cameras that C-SPAN uses are controlled by the government that is to say the majority they were turned off  But C-SPAN went on  Broadcasting because legislators used periscope  to  broadcast what was happening and  So when around the government cameras and around the I guess we should say government censorship of what was happening in our own House of Representatives  I just found that fascinating the periscope became a  Revolutionary tool for our government

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was a combination it was a combination of periscope and Facebook live  Because I think periscope kept on crashing for a lot of them so they moved over to Facebook live at one point  So which is funny because it goes back to our previous point, but yeah  Fascinating that C-SPAN doesn't have someone in the building there. It's literally just like a security camera. That's triggered by the gavels  so you know  So glad to see the folks in Washington figuring out how to actually get video out of an important moment like that  So let's hope it has some results. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guess that's the benefit of having multiple services though as if one doesn't work you can always fall back onto the next one  The problem for periscope is if they then use Facebook live and hey, what do you know that worked actually really well?  Goodbye Facebook live  That's cool though. That's crap  That's awesome that they were that that those that were out on the floor actually cared enough to make that happen  You know what I mean instead of just business as usual. That's really cool. Yeah, very cool  I guess we can stay on Twitter because we really only have one other Twitter story in here  And it's actually a pretty interesting one if we want to move over to kind of machine learning  Twitter announced it bought AI startup magic pony which has an incredible awesome name. I do say so myself  No, some was disclosed on that CEO Jack Dorsey said this would help make  Twitter the first and best place to see what's happening in the world  Which is kind of okay, so it's it's AI but it's AI related to video from what I could gather  Basically what they do what magic pony is known to do is things like upgrading low-res video  Into better looking video essentially another part of their technology is taking analyzing images  So amala analyzing a series of images about a certain area or place or whatever and then taking a single image that doesn't include  All of that information and taking what's in the other images and smashing it in so kind of filling in the blanks so to speak  Possibly creating kind of like like taking a texture of an image that isn't evident in one  Place and I don't know lifting that from another one and kind of filling in the blanks  Twitter is doing I guess more and more in AI this seems like it might actually translate somewhat into their video product  And I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out what the importance of this acquisition is dude. Does anyone have any ideas here? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean it seems like I mean there it seems like they could use this tech to kind of stitch together  You know I mean if you have a live event happening where a bunch of people are you know posting pictures of videos from one place  Kind of using those to enhance one another that those that kind of the moments kind of application. I don't know my stretching here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know that sounds pretty forward-thinking  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think that's where the war is  If you look at the discussions we've had about  Google assistant that's going to be powered by AI Facebook's ability to show you what you want is fed powered by AI  So yes the ability to predict what you want and change your feeds and change how it knows what content is what content sure on  The other hand AI is just the magic fairy dust. It's being thrown on everything  I don't know if you guys have seen the trunk video this week. Yes  Oh  Might want to show a bit of it. It's yeah, it's the former  Tribune  It was I worked for  Boundaries are rolling in their graves  Rename trunk and they put out a video talking about how AI is just gonna solve everything they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  here we go, I put the video down at the bottom and the  Strange thing about this video is it's really hard to tell whether it's actually taking itself seriously or whether it's total parody  It's just a strange strange deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we have audio and it also means pooling of resources?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's about meeting in the middle having a tech startup culture meet a  Legacy corporate culture and then evolving and changing and that's really the fun part. That's exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have great titles we produce tons of great content every single day  We're really focused on how we deliver it to people in a way that they want to consume it more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the key ways we're going to harness the power of video too is to watch this video

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so this is this is just targeted at employees. Okay, which the motivated boys get behind this wonderful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Feed it into a funnel and then optimize it so that we reach the biggest global audience possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The key to making our content really valuable to the broadest possible audience is to use machine learning  to maximize all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Artificial intelligence is going to allow  Journalists to do their jobs more efficiently finding the right photos the videos the databases the things that you would package your stories with right now  That's a manual effort with artificial intelligence. You can create a system that  Automatically is doing that for you almost instantaneously as you are writing as you're working on a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ultimately those efficiencies will help us produce more content better content that will make stories  Much more exciting much more visual and today that's what people expect

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Jeff, what is your takeaway on this?  I mean other than the video and the pretty kind of the production level of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have no strategy whatsoever. They're trying to imagine that there's gonna take their content factory  Find more ways to throw more crap at you and make more crap to then more throw more crap at you  Now so that I I put this up on Twitter and I said be the first on your block to mock this and then an executive at  another  Major newspaper companies scolded me and said well, well people should be trying new things  It's that they're not I dare you to tell me what the strategy is here  Except throwing jargon at it and saying we're gonna have artificial intelligence make more stuff  It's not a strategy they're not a content factory, but that's all another discussion  So it's been it's been completely roundly mocked everywhere. I think there's a parody version out already though. There must be it's rather redundant  Anyway, so artificial intelligence becomes the secret sauce for everybody  Oh, we'll just add some in and it'll do amazing things and and and that's what I worry about Twitter  If Twitter is really just a feed of what you want  Does artificial intelligence help that? I don't know then again, as I said, that's where the war is being fought with the other platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's kind of this recurring theme everyone feels like they need to invest in artificial intelligence  Because everybody else is investing in artificial intelligence  And but simply having AI as part of your as part of your I don't know your your your plate of food  Is not necessarily enough. How do you actually put it to work? And how does it make sense for you?  That's that and I think that's kind of part of why I was a little confused with this whole magic pony thing is like, okay  you know AI makes sense for a lot of company AI makes a lot of sense for something like  Facebook and you know Google and kind of commerce companies search problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Lots of companies that make sense for fit places that are gonna try to learn you better learn processes better make better recommendations to you  Know where better to merchandise and where better to recommend things to you. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Place where Twitter the problem that Twitter needs to solve is user acquisition  Right getting people you said if Twitter is a feed of all the things that you want  There's a big step between signing up for Twitter and getting to the place where the feed is everything you want, right?  So they're big challenge for Twitter is is going from signing up new users and then giving them a great experience to begin with here  This is something I would interest you  So if this is about like making Kim Kardashian's fuzzy photos a little bit sharper and making that a you know a thing  Oh, yeah, this is a thing on Twitter. I'm gonna follow this person then maybe that's what's worth it for them  You know, I don't know but but yeah  I mean  I think that's where the AI comes in for them is stronger recommendations for when you first are on boarding to convert  lurkers or deserters into regular Twitter users

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to get them to come back  I mean they might sign up and say okay what the big deal is then then walk away and never come back or never  Log back in again. I think that's the great point  You know, I think that the I mean at this point it's either AI or VR  I mean it's it's pick one that that's being invested in and and and and in all probable realities  It's both because I imagine a lot of the work that the AI is doing is gonna drive eventually  You know the crisper photos all stuff is gonna drive an eventual VR experience because that needs to be so high-res and so much  better and that sort of thing so  But yeah, I what Twitter is up to and what they're doing  I don't know  They clearly need to be doing something to get out of the rut they're in and it looks like they're making  Small moves in pieces that we might not know what the end result is for a while  But at least they're trying, you know  At least they're that they're seeing where there's new technology and grabbing it and seeing how they can apply it to I think that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you say should we talk about Google a little bit because I guess this is this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The great explainer is on the show I wanted to explain the the two-factor change

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Explain listen this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please do because I've been realizing in quick order very recently  How necessary it probably is for me to do this whole two-factor thing and for some reason I hesitate  I don't know if I fear it. I don't know what it is. I know it's safer  But I know it's also more inconvenient with security comes in convenience. I totally get it  But does this that we're gonna talk about here this two-factor change that Google made  Is is this an improvement is does this make it easier? What do you think Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Definitely, definitely. I mean so the current state of two-factor authentication  Is that you have to copy a code that you know that when you try to log in somewhere  That you get an SMS with a link or a code or you have to use an authenticator app to get a code  Which then you you know hand manually key in to say yes, this is me  This is my two-factor code and so this change so the problem with that is way inconvenient, right?  It's really annoying and convenient and that's why folks like Jason don't turn it on  This change is instead of having to like look at a code and scan a barcode whatever or get an SMS you you get a push  notification  With a button. Yes  Authenticate me or no, right and so you just tap it. So just makes the experience of authenticating with two-factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google now or something and you say hey somebody has tried to be you here. Is that you is that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you just click the button. Yes, that's my understanding. I haven't tried this new update, but that is my understanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually I actually got I got hit with this last week actually on one of my  Personal domains that are that are running Google Apps where I logged in on a new computer  And then all of a sudden on my phone, you know, I have two-factor authentication turned on  I've been using it for a very very long time. I actually like the SMS, you know, like I get a code  I'm fine typing it in all that sort of stuff  But I got this new experience without knowing what it was and I almost didn't believe it like I kind of had to do like  Whoa, what changed?  The Jurassic Park move as I'm looking at my computer  But it actually made it that much easier. It just it just said it said, you know  You're you have an attempted login on this computer of this IP address, you know allow and I said yes  And then it just worked and so I was impressed by it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting rid of passwords as they've supposedly vowed they're gonna do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd love I'd love to see that I gotta I gotta say as some as somebody who now, you know  I'm as Gina and Jason know and Jeff I'll fill you in I'm using the next bit Robin phone and  It's got the it's got the thumbprint verification, which I'm a little I'm late to the game on this  I know the Nexus 6p and other devices have had this for a while  But it's my first device that I've been using on a daily basis with the thumbprint  Recognition and I've been turning that on wherever I can so like logging into the Bank of America app  I have a very long complicated password for my online banking and it's always been a pain in the butt with my fat fingers  To type it in on the keyboard every time now  I just scan my fingerprint and I log into my bank stuff and it works like that to me like that's the  Greatest argument against passwords and if Google can figure out something whether it's thumbprint based or some other way to eliminate passwords  I would be the first to sign up for it because you know with with all the  Requirements with capital letters and lowercase letters and numbers and symbols and all this or something's getting out of hand for the right reason  But it is also making it a larger obstacle to actually get to the data  I want to get you on a daily basis, so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean I mean passwords are the single biggest usability problem for everything  I mean ice every time I see my mom I have to reset her iTunes login  I'm every single time I think she's trying to download an app and I change it last night  I want to increment it because you can't use the password that you saw I mean passwords are they're terrible and yeah  I hope that this is some indication that Google Google knows that you know  We need we need something better than passwords the thing about two-factor auth the SMS  Method I think is really flawed  I heard a friend of mine was saying that her account got hacked because someone managed to call Verizon which was her her  her carrier mobile carrier and  basically transfer her line to a different sim and then used to factor off got the message and like hacked her account that way by  By basically hacking her mobile account, right?  So like I mean look there's always gonna be places where things can get you know where there are vulnerabilities and and the more  The thing about two-factor is that it sort of spreads like now there are more places vectors for for security attacks  Even though it is more secure  so I mean  This method and this is why I use off the the app or Google Authenticator  I use off the because it's a little bit nicer why I use that method versus the SMS method method  So I think this is just kind of another way you can implement this without tying it to your mobile carrier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically if you take this to the extreme then any time you try to sign into anything  If it goes to the device that Google knows you have and you say okay that will sign you in  Yes, but you still had to use your password. It's still two-factor  You still had to use your password back on the original sign in it's just you didn't have to put the number in now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right exactly exactly right that's that's what two-factor is is to prove that you've got this other  Factor is the is the phone or the tablet or whatever the other device prove on the other device that you want that you want  You know that you are you and so it used to be via SMS  It used to be with this code that you get on the other device and now it's just a push notification where you can just  tap the button and confirm I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think I did something I should not have done you guys  I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and do this two-factor thing  Oh  Sometimes the best things happen live though like when I finally did it and hit okay  Suddenly my my Chrome OS said I needed to reauthenticate right because like now I'm protected by by two-factor I  Click the button to do it it powered off  So then I powered it back on and now I'm stuck at the sign and waiting to receive the code  Here's where I messed up  Because the number I gave it was my Google voice number  My Google voice number is on the other side of the authentication

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't your phone receiving Google voice number it's not anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the flip can you go to Google voice of the flip? Oh boy probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm happy this happened live because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If anything I could I could at least tell tell you not to do that  Let's see I just I just need to get the voice that's all I need to do come on Google this one time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mess up and let me in  Hmm. Let's see here. It's a sign outside back in. Yeah, so this is synced now  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't believe I did this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sign back in it powered down. Yeah. No, it's gonna be the same issue. I'm not gonna be able to  Why are I giving my Google voice number why because that's what I give everything is my Google voice number  But that yeah, but I can't get the Google voice number code that was sent via SMS. So then great explainer  What are alternatives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, let's okay, let's think this through you guys  so  The own the ways in which you can access your Google voice SMS messages  Isn't there isn't there in Gmail a chat label? Is that still true?  Your Google voice messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, a lot of things have changed with Google voice, but I mean the problem is in any way that I would get  Access to that I'm gonna need to the two-factor to log in right and  Are you logged in on your phone? No, it said it needed to re-authenticate there as well  It just went away

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You kidding me it said it and then it went away. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know I can do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, because I think I got it I think I got it hold on hold on I hope this works

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can you can vamp if you like I've got a pace this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The danger of two-factor right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know and a part of it is my misunderstanding but I can understand why I why I didn't see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you ask for the printout of the ten codes? Sorry, this is  That's it pretty much what I got was 10 10 codes because I've requested them from everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so I'm gonna sign in again. I think I can do this do to do do do  This is a cautionary tale entering my password

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wrinkle is definitely a wrinkle. I use my Google voice number primarily  But when you set up, you know when I set up my backup phone number  I have to use my I use my like native phone number because you know  My Google voice number is attached to my my Google account, but I'm always so worried that I'm gonna forget that and just get myself locked  But you're gonna resolve this Jason we're gonna figure this out together we're with you. Okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the verification code that you are sent that is the thing that you paste over there, right? So I got that right  Why I didn't accept it, I don't know  Yeah, it's weird. It's not accepting it when I put it in  All right. I'll continue work. Actually. I can't even move the show along. I came to see our dock anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seemed like a good idea at the time let me try again  Audio listeners like wow you suck  Yeah, no, it's just not working  Okay, tell me this is something that Leo would do right hold on when you when you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sign up for two-factor. Yeah the option to get ten permanent codes that you can put in your wallet and use  That's I should you ever need a code. I should have done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, so you can't even get to your account dashboard now to do that though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says try another way to sign in when I do that  The only thing there is send a text message to your phone because that's the only thing I have sent it set up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so Jason you never got to the code that went to Google voice  Like that's what you need you need to get the code that went to Google voice  Is it is your voice number forwarding anywhere?  Is there any device that that it forwarded to or might still be in the shade or wait a minute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute  You have the Google voice app on your phone that but there's no way the Google voice app is updated to support two-factor authentication yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hasn't been updated for years. I do have it on here, but I don't think I was signed in because oh  Boy, it's not gonna work again. Yeah, it's gonna do the whole changes thing  Is there a story you guys want to talk about?  So so let me just tell you this two-factor authentication is really effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good humor you're keeping up this I know I don't have a choice  Is the chat room have any recommendations have we gone to the chat room? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just like I'm struck. I'm stuck  I'm I'm gonna log into this is a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it have a can't can't can't access phone or didn't receive the message?  Question like when it's asking for the code when it's prompting you for a code

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there any way out? No, it basically just says well, I mean it gives me the option right here  Let me see if I can show it without revealing any anything. I think I  Mean it gives me so basically if you show well, maybe it doesn't matter  So if you see there, it basically says, you know, try another way to sign in  That's the only option I have when I do it. It's going to let's see here. I'm trying  It's basically like phone. Do you want to send a text text message? Oh my god, Jason  No, I know you guys I think I might I think I might have to start over with a brand new email account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't that can't be it  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to log in as a guest on my Chromebook because I can  I know he'd probably be able to like totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why did I do that you guys you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really should have been smart enough to realize that you had entered your Google voice number for that Google account and that you shouldn't  Have been allowed to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a recursion. Yeah, but yeah, I mean it's right like it  Sends to the thing that's behind the wall and in order for me to get to that thing that's behind the wall  I need the thing that it sent me  So I don't know what to say on that. All right, so I'm using my work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you what if you used off II and put an off II number in that doesn't work because you didn't I didn't install off II

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he would have needed to needed to scan the QR code and get off you set up. I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean I have different a different Gmail login. That's how I'm getting into the dock right now  So it's like I have another Gmail account

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was not my apps account if it was your apps account the admin can unlock you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a Russian nesting doll

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I said, I'm happy it happened on the show because if anything it's a lesson to be learned for somebody else  So there you go. That's what we do here. We educate  Honestly Gina you painted such a beautiful picture of it. I was like, well, this is easy then I'm gonna just go ahead and do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  X-factor authentication the truth is out there  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm googling I'm sure that there probably is and I'm having I'm I have a feeling that once I'm like out of  The mode of yeah show mode  I might be able to focus on it and I'm certain that somebody's watching  In the chat room or at some point that can email us and let us know go ahead and email me  I don't know the best email to reach us  But a a a a twitch.tv is the all about Android email and I'll get it that way for sure but man, man  I was so close  It was one phone number off  and so anyways  Deep breath

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moving on what else should we talk about what else Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see here anything  I've got the rundown now. Thankfully. I'm just in with a different account  What about the DMCA Google's getting a lot of requests apparently DMC DMCA takedown requests the number  quadrupled over the past two years  As basically copyright holders just trying to wipe away, you know the links to pirate sites from Google search all that kind of stuff  And you know, obviously DMCA is  Essentially it provides safe harbor for internet services like Google artists and music groups want to amend US copyright law  To kind of change it because they say, you know that it's that it's just kind of unfair  They're playing this game of whack-a-mole essentially. What do they want to do exactly?  Yeah, that's a that's a great question. They want to change they want to change how it's worded  I'm not sure that I was able to find exactly the change that they're looking for  But uh, yeah, they definitely want to change things so that they don't have to play whack-a-mole essentially  Chasing things down Google has said that it handles around three three million pirate links every single day and  That you know, they're they're getting notice the notice then takedown approach, which is what is going on right now  They say is working extremely. Well, it's got an upward trend  Because it's scalable and you know artists and and and the like  Must like it because they're putting in a lot more requests and it's usable and everything  But the rights holders are basically saying it's like bailing out the ocean  Bailing out an ocean with a teaspoon, which is a great way to summarize it. I know is it broken

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you guys think? I mean a great example of this  I think is something that I personally have dealt with is that so for you know years ago like five years ago  whatever for  My comic book site I fanboy we we did used to do video shows  We're on revision 3 and all that sort of stuff and we had a theme song and that theme song was done by an indie band  That I knew people in the band and I have a written  Approval to allow us to use the portion of the song as our theme song from them  You know, I covered my bases back in 2007 and that's what I did  Maybe about six months or so. We started getting DMCA takedown notices from YouTube  That were filed by the distribution company that distributes this band's record and  they found our videos flagged them and YouTube took the videos down because we did we you know because we didn't have  Approval to use that, you know to use the song even though I do have approval to use the song  but of course, there's no way to  Challenge it you just have to deal with it or or choose to not monetize the video  Which and which I ended up doing because I brought out the video up  It was not a really a large monetization channel for me right now  But that's a great example of it where they just have these there there's just organization after organization  Which is scanning YouTube and filing these DMCA  notes  You know to anyone and everyone because everyone's scrambling to make sure they're getting the money for the use of their own music  Which I get but it's a mess. It's a total mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean YouTube YouTube specifically that's like smack dab in the middle of their crosshairs artists just kind of feel YouTube  Monetizes their music without fair compensation YouTube doesn't have a thing where they've and they've been doing this for at least a couple of years  Now I know where they're scanning  Everything that's uploaded and you know matching it against the database and if it matches they can  You know basically monetize that unlicensed content  They say they've paid out three billion dollars to date in doing that  Which is a lot of money, but I don't know what that you know what that is compared to how however much other unlicensed music

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or licensed music is there and what I understand is there's all these pirate links are totally big  I mean like go to YouTube and type in and you search for anything and you find people just uploading complete albums people are uploading  Complete like it's just all up there and I and and it's this is this is awful  Whack-a-mole game like you said that is just I think I don't know what the solution is and I don't know what the you know  The the artists want to see YouTube to do because I feel as if YouTube is trying to do the right thing by  Setting up tools to you know to allow you know content owners to to flag their con  You know flag content that is that they don't have approval for and chase down the money and all stuff like that  But I it's a problem that I feel like it's too big to solve at this point. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm unclear on what the artists are are you know proposing I mean, you know Google's saying that take down  You know notice then take down is working  I mean I get I get where you know Taylor Swift and Billy Joel are coming from like hey my stuff is being hosted on YouTube  Unfairly and it shouldn't be but yeah  I mean the other option is that no one can upload anything until they've proven that it's fair right or that it's not you know  Copyrighted which isn't which is insane. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean, yeah, they're really complaining in the letter about saying well  Well technology has made it possible to put you know all histories and all the music in your pocket  Well, yeah, that's the reality you have to deal with now. That's exactly where we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff you're not making me feel any better in the back channels chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just saw those oh, yeah. Oh, we should definitely update the viewers and the listeners on this  I think I might have totally screwed my personal account with this move  so basically  Google has a page and  Jam or be I don't know if you have the link but I'll go ahead and paste it under the two-factor thing  There it is in the dock has a page that the Warrens  Against using Google Voice to send verification codes. Oh, man  So if you use your Google Voice to receive verification codes, you can easily create a situation as I've demonstrated  Where you've locked yourself out of your account, for example, if you're signed out of your Google Voice app, you might need a  Can't even get through this without laughing you might need a verification code to get back in  However, you won't be able to receive this verification code because it will be sent to your Google Voice  Which you can't access end of line end of paragraph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If in case you've done this this is what you should do it's just like you won't be able to access it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the truth is and you'll never get a job at Google  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know how to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Know that you just entered your Google Voice  That email address it should have known like that's like not I'm mad at Google like that was user error  They do could have easily caught well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to get a lot of this look at the next the next link if I understand it correctly says that  That using Google Voice is a is a vulnerability to hackers because they can change both at once  So all you need to do is hack yourself. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so that's all I need to do then is I need to become a hacker myself  At offy.com they have a they have an entry that says security notice to not use a Google Voice number for two-factor authentication  These are all very useful articles. I certainly would have reason a different reason here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep going. That's what's interesting is it's not because of the obvious. It's because of another reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see here the past few months we've seen a large number of accounts being compromised on several of our clients all of them  Had two-factor authentication. How are they hacked simple first the attacker and I'm reading from offy.com's post here  Obviously first the attacker compromises the user email. Should I be reading this out loud?  The emails compromised mostly via phishing or by stealing the cookie  Okay, I didn't know that happened because Google uses the same cookie account for all of their products  Also access to voice.google.com here the attacker can see any SMS messages sent to you in real time  This means that hacker can now easily reset your password  And then use Google voice. Okay  I don't know. I think I'm scared. I think I'm a little scared now  I don't know what to think about my future in this world if I can't get into my email address anymore. I  Know that sounds stupid, but my life is built upon that email address

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There has to be yeah, I know like it's not like you can just abandon it to move on  I mean, I can't even imagine what's in that email account like you've got to be able to get back into that  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Recovery form  Google account recovery form and just walk through that there's it's a questionnaire  See if there's any option for you there Jason. Let's see here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason didn't we have didn't didn't we wasn't there a Google support number that we called on the air once

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody very nice. Oh, that was the nexus. Yes. That was the account. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if there's a Google support number we can call in the air and get their help

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds like a great plan. I don't have my nexus device  I think that was that was isolated to nexus devices and I've got the one plus three right now  Which is another another wrinkle because I don't have all my normal apps installed on this so getting into them is a challenge  And  These are name these to sign in oh boy. This is just crazy you guys. I can't believe I did that  Yeah, see this this seems based around  Around forgetting your password  More than anything. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an operative scene that has an article which I also sent that says how to do it with Google voice  And it says use email forwarding

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay  Email forwarding that's something into I'm doing the the help here and one of the options is I'm having other issues with two-step verification  Which would definitely be what I'm having

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From tomorrow Matt cuts is out jogging in Washington DC and he's chortling to himself a lot of Potomac  He's in DC now yes  And and he's saying you're never gonna government job. We're not letting you in the Pentagon fella  And then I also envision those five people somewhere in Google with a beer right now  We've done this before who's just chortling their heads off say we got another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what okay so by the way I followed through on what you were saying Gina  And it took me to that that basically that support that support page for the entry that we already read on the show  That's what it takes. That's what it takes you to  I think what bothers me a little bit about this is many times when I install apps that are SMS apps  It I end up having to manually put in my Google voice number because what it recognizes is the number from the SIM card  And I'm wondering why that wasn't the why that didn't happen  why because that would be the safest way to  to activate  Two-factor I mean especially considering Google voice is  Spelled out as not being you know as being avoid this by all costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why didn't auto detect your phone number? Yeah exactly? Yeah exactly and I don't Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have like Leo you have probably a hundred Android phone  I do is there another phone that operates not with the with the with the SIM card  But instead of Wi-Fi that might have already received the SMS

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh  That's a good question. I wonder I  Don't know if any of that stuff is is isolated to just mobile networks though  It would still it would still get the the authentication

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Message voice Wi-Fi not dependent upon the SIM Google voice operates through the internet doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does yeah  It does but you still gotta log in you still gotta log in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless you have it's not gonna be hanging out your notification shade because it's auto logging you out right like auto

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless there was some sort of weird blip along the way. It's probably I mean that's that's a good thought and actually  Back in in my office. I do have a device  I don't know if it has the voice app installed on it though right now because it's like my demo device for here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyways

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes  We'll talk in vamp you go back to your office get another phone, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before you do that, I actually I just put into the into the back channel doc. I've been I was scrolling through the gmail help forum and  Somebody with your exact same problem locked out locked out on two-step verification using Google voice number and this happened  About a year ago and it looks as if like Gina said there's the account recovery form  Where you can tell them what you did and then within three to five days someone will get back to you and they'll turn two-step  Verification off and give you access back to your account. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell me what you did. Tell me what you did Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that at least at least that's this is an example of someone who's had the same problem and got their account back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So like that's that's not the worst thing in the world. There we go Ron. You just made my day  My day has been destroyed and then made in a matter of 20 minutes  No need to vamp let's see there's plenty of stories to talk about  Jeff what have you thought about?  Android apps on Chrome you have it installed on your flip

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so so I have so happens that I have the Chromebook flip and it's the first device that's allowed to put Android into Chrome  So you're not gonna be surprised get ready for this Gina, you know what I'm gonna say I  Couldn't do it with my apps account  So I I used my my regular account  But was there it's a little buggy because the weird thing is that it puts it puts the  Play Store in the app tray  Sometimes when I click on it, nothing happens. It's a little confused about where it is  but once I get an operating once I once I open it up either through that or I go to the  The search icon and click there and there it gives me the Play Store icon and there I open the Play Store  So it'll work and then I put in you know anything  Facebook Twitter  And it installs the app and it goes in with all the other Chrome apps  So you don't know which one's which until you open it up and it's in its own smaller window, which you can then make large  And it operates as a separate window  So I'm operating Twitter Facebook and and other things and the big news is we'll go to this one Jason gets back  The big news is that I could operate Skype and that you folks will remember that I tortured Leo for like a year and a half  Jammer be in company trying to come up with all kinds of technical solutions to me trying to do Skype on Chromebook  Doesn't work. So I was using hangouts and then there was an effort to kludge apps onto a Chromebook  It was absolutely awful would not work at all. But Jason and I did indeed call each other though  Probably he can't get to it because it's you know  Jason's Jason's been locked out of the office because two-factor won't let him back in  Well, it's it's that's really Jeff that's really interesting because lastly yes the last night on all about Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason had a had a flip on hand and we were playing with it. We were looking at it and the the conversation around  installing apps on a Chromebook  Was similar, you know  Basically the question I posed is that what app is there that I would need to use on a Chromebook as the Android app that?  I couldn't use on an equivalent  browser or web-based experience  I think Microsoft Word. Yep Microsoft Word right is different plus  Yeah, so it's I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think it's photo editing apps. There's some other apps you should simply get get on Chrome. Yes, right  And interestingly enough like we were talking about photos and so Jason went to go install Instagram  And it is not compatible with your device to install it on your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think it's a good thing that you can install it on your phone  Instagram and  It is not compatible with your device to install it  Oh, yeah, so in so so, you know kind of you're gonna see apps that really utilize the rear-facing camera  Probably will will not have compatibility because the a Chromebook doesn't have a rear-facing camera  So maybe that's one of the things that are flagging them. Ah, yeah  So it's gonna be interesting to see which ones are compatible and actually do work and which ones do get blocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other interesting thing is that is that when I go to the chrome, so I went to the chrome  I'm sorry to the app store  I'm sorry the Google Play app store  Elsewhere and said let me try to install an app on my flip as I can install it on any one of my phones  It says where do you want to install this app lists all the compatible phones? I can install it there  It doesn't list the flip  so it doesn't see the flip as  A phone equivalent now, maybe that's just a bug  Maybe maybe that's something architectural but that was interesting too that I couldn't do that  I don't think it's life-changing  For most people they're gonna say oh I can finally to your point Ron  No, I can finally do this one thing for me. It was Skype and that matters, but I obviously have other devices  I'm on one right now the pixel C  however  What we said before I think is once once you know across all Chromebooks that you can get all or virtually all  Android apps  Then that makes a different sales pitch for the device  Absolutely other issue of course is that not every Chromebook will be able to do this the original pixel won't the new pixel will there's a  There's an extensive list of all of the brands and devices that will be able to do this in time  So it's gonna roll out over time. I'm on the dev channel on the flip, which is which is you know  Risky and it moments man, but works. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just fired up  the  Flip and logged into a different email address  Because yeah  That'd work  Didn't sink anything over. I'm gonna have to go the long route in order to get back into this, but I have hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cuz we got contacts at Google I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly hope so but yeah, I can show this off a little bit and I'm kind of all be firing it up right now  I still have to like install things  I don't I will try and get it fired up quick enough to to call you but right now like there it is  The Play Store is basically just kind of like logging in for the most part and I do remember last night  It took this it took a little bit of time in order to get in there. And yeah, there you go  You've got the windowed kind of Play Store experience. I could go in here. I don't know. What should I install?  Facebook's Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure we can do this I hope you don't have two-factor on Facebook do you  I don't have to factor on Facebook. I do have a pretty long

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Long complicated password though that I can't remember. So that's a challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really weird to see the Play Store on a window. I gotta tell you and I like a detached window. That is weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It adds like a little frame to the top of it and it's got the maximize minimize close buttons and all is it  It's it's takes them getting used to that's for sure. Yeah, and yeah, that's wacky

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go full screen Play Store, I feel better now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly like I think I  Kind of missed what you what some some of the points that you you guys were talking about obviously while I was out of  The room but my thoughts on this kind of match what I thought when I saw it  Which is if I'm in the market for let's say a tablet form factor going forward  Personally, I probably wouldn't buy a tablet  I would buy a Chromebook with touch and which means if I want anywhere near like the resolution  Or screen that you get on normal Android tablets  I'd probably have to pay a little bit more than a couple hundred dollars for a flip because this display is it's okay  But that gives you more or less the tablet  you know the things that you would use an Android tablet for as well as the productivity layout and then Chrome OS for  You know a lot of the kind of day-to-day computing stuff that seems like the best the best case scenario for me  I don't know if I don't know if Android apps on Chrome OS is a big deal for everyone, but I certainly like it  I like the option that it's there and of the apps that I've loaded on they seem to work pretty pretty darn well  I mean barring apps that require things like rear-facing cameras or apps that automatically  orientate to portrait, you know like Instagram  Force you into that that that layout I have a problem on my Pixel C

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I run for example Facebook if I go into certain groups it insists on being vertical not horizontal  right  Certain things on the United Airlines app same thing it insists on vertical. It's weird  How it doesn't know that it's it's on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it. That's something that you can set in your app. You can you can say only this orientation  You can force an orientation. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the explainer is back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the developer gets to decide I guess is what I'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now Jeff you've you've definitely spent more time with your pixel C than I have spent with the pixel C  Between these two like are you do you find yourself pulled in one direction over the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I travel now I am carrying by carrying by flip because I knew we're gonna talk about this today  I traveled with the pixel C and it works pretty darn. Well, the problem is I can't do anything with a  Thumb drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Won't do external memory. Mm-hmm. And so if I want to move a presentation off or doing that kind of stuff  I've got an issue  So the weird thing is I've been traveling with both the pixel C and the flip  But not my big old Chromebook pixel  And I hardly use the flip only there are certain things medium works really badly  They just aren't doing enough QA on on the mobile app. So it works better on  Chrome Chrome OS  Some a lot of Google Docs things are clumsy on  Android that work well on Chrome so I can see I mean part of that's just fixing  The way these apps work and making them better and if you're gonna produce something pickles pixels you think this through  But but yeah, no the pixel C. I've got to say I'm gravitated toward it. It's working pretty darn  Well, and the other weird thing I have by the way is I use it for these very long flights. I'm on  and I  Watch shows and now my play  Google Play will suddenly decide that it's gonna crash on a show and I think it's probably something to do with  Authentication  And so I have to wait till I'm back online and then I play the show again and it's fine  But it'll start yelling at me and then I you know  The my nightmares I'm gonna be on a 12-hour flight and I can't I can't play any movies and I'll be going berserk and screaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And everyone will hear it because everyone hears when Jeff screams  So I've got okay, so I finally got into into Facebook took a little while because I don't actually know the password  Yeah  That's a good thing right, it's a good thing  Password managers, that's that's why I rely on password managers and they factor  Not yet. I bet you I will rely on two factor once I figure it out  Once I once I install it when I'm not doing a show probably so man  So yeah, so I mean I think the challenge here then becomes  Why or how do you decide one?  Kind of offering versus another, you know Facebook's Facebook has a pretty decent web  Kind of web app  Actually, some people would say that Facebook's web app is too cluttered  And so if you use the mobile app the way you're seeing right now  It actually streamlines things it just gives you your feed gives you a few things on the side  It's everything up in the bar. So  So it gives you a choice I suppose could be a little confusing  To you know, just the average person that happens to pick this up  But I don't know how many Android apps the average person is gonna be installing on a Chromebook anyways  So yeah, it looks cool though  Do you have sky pork in or no? Oh, that's right. That's right. That was the other thing my apologies  Just for historic moment  We go ahead and install this yeah, cuz we had this call going before the show was even even happening and  It looked pretty good. I honestly I don't know what I expected but but it worked about as well as as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hotel Wi-Fi, right? It'll ruin it. It'll ruin this call again, but that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably so yeah, it's installing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Installing already. I don't know. I love my pixel one if that's what you would call this the very first generation of the pixel  I'm bummed that it's not going to get these Android apps access to them because I mean I use this every single day here at  work, so  I would love to be able to to do that. All right, so we might cut away for a second while I sign in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean no matter what I mean, I think this is this is like we said  This is a moment in history a moment in time the fact that you know  It's bridging this gap because we've you know for how long we've been wondering  the about the divide between Chrome OS and Android apps and this appears to be the solution and and I think I think it's a  It's a great moment and it gives it gives like Jeff said  This is a added value to when you're shopping for your next device to consider, you know  I'm absolutely considering it now, you know, because it opens up a whole, you know  A whole a whole store of apps that you can use  13 rather than the ASUS flipbook. Yeah. Yeah the Acer the Acer  the the the Acer Chromebook is supposed to be pretty good as well to at the  yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Aces is a nice, you know for the price the Aces is worth it. It's to 229. I think but it's slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go. Yep should be getting a call look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skype in an app on a Chromebook. Yeah, there it is. There it is. Hey Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Chromebook on the show  There's two Jarvis's now yeah, there's nasty Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It works we proved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, let's see that we proved that we could make this work at least  Excellent stuff  All right. And actually the the the steps if you happen to have a Chromebook flip  It's not that difficult to opt-in you just basically have to get on kind of like the the dev channel  essentially and reboot into it and then it becomes an option in settings to  Run Android apps on and once you trigger it once you tag that on the Play Store magically appears in your tray and you're off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And running so but Jason I the Play Store appeared in my tray under my apps account and I don't think I couldn't get it working  Oh  I've already had my fit while you were gone. So I won't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The apps divide that has been had all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fair enough. What else what else Android anything jump out at you guys?  there was a oh that the timeline for Nexus devices essentially the the  Google is being upfront with how long its Nexus devices will in fact receive security updates again  You know Google uses the Nexus devices as kind of an example for others who are creating devices  That run Android and in in some ways this kind of mirrors that but from a an update standpoint

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like hey a little bit of a rude shock this week by  My my moto 360 is not getting the next version of Android wear. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does that is that it's kind of it's got to be coming up on two years now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which isn't that long for a multi-hundred dollar device that you hardly use  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in the same I'm in the same boat Jeff  We were talking about this on all about Android is that they given this new, you know  The latest update in terms of these timelines my beloved Nexus 9 tablet will no longer receive Android OS updates after October  And so yeah  So and and and also looking at that, you know kind of timeline of the devices and when they no longer get the OS updates  Really points out that we're due for a new line of Nexus hardware to be announced soon  Which I'm sure is gonna come in September or August or September right in time for the holiday rush  And so if you care to see what the next generation are  But yeah  I mean we're looking at the the the obsolescence life span of a Nexus devices two years at best at this point. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which is kind of what Google has has already said for the most part. I think it's 18  What is it 18 months Android? No, yeah, you're right two years from when it was available on the Play Store  When it was first made available and then security patches beyond or just in general a total of either three years  Or 18 months from the last sale date  So if it was a flop and it came out of the Play Store early, you'd still get the full three years of  Security updates. So I just I just like that they're being upfront about it and I trust that Google is going to hold themselves to this  And I think that's a good thing  I think that's a good example for some of the other OEMs out there who are all so focused on  Creating whatever the next thing is that they just kind of lose interest in supporting their previous devices. That's a big bummer  Let's see here what else  Do we have?  We're kind of at the point to where we start kind of jumping through and and tackle a few of these quickly here  Google is going to help you self-medicate basically  Or self-diagnose  Maybe self-medicate if you if you think you understand what Google is telling you to do Google will enable you  With updates to the Google app to kind of get kind of symptom results on health searches  So if you ask it, what does a headache on one side of the head mean?  Google would surface related conditions associated with this  I mean, I feel like this is what people do already with WebMD  But maybe maybe Google is in a position to you know create  Better recommendations and not make you think you have cancer because you have a head it's just gonna make it easier to increase your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hypochondria and make you think that you're out

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been thinking about this a lot lately because well first I have a small child who gets sick a lot  But also I have a family member who got like a somewhat upsetting  Diagnosis for a thing that like I had never heard of so I started googling and I just feel like the user experience  Around this just like finding out more about symptoms and diseases is so so bad  I mean the first thing that I should see is like don't panic  It's okay  And that's never that's never the first thing that you see the message is always the exact opposite like this could lead to death  But probably won't I mean, you know, that's generally the messaging so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some measure of authority to come to rise beyond just the page rank  Right, let me try we try night this is related somewhat related idea  Let me try this idea out you see if this makes sense because I was writing a post about this  so I was on Facebook the other day and somebody posted a picture of  Justin Trudeau in a lip lock with another man a politician  And one could guess this is the kind of bold thing he would do to make a statement about Orlando  And so I moused over the item thinking oh, it's weird. I hadn't heard of that yet  Hmm, but and when you mouse over something on Facebook it pops up related things right on the screen, right?  the first screen that popped up was BuzzFeed saying people are passing a raw along a  Bogus picture of Trudeau kissing the next thing you can see was Snopes bogus  And and so I saw that there was the beginnings there of the opportunity for Facebook and Google and Twitter  to indeed  surface authority  And the same thing goes with this medical stuff, right so we're not asking them to surface what's true  But you it's easier to surface what's false, and I think there were like three ways you could do this  One is if something's been debunked  Then and you know what the photo or the item then just surface it and say hello. That's been debunked  Second what was the other second before you post something?  To say you might want to see these other things about this same item and then the third is  Gee if that really happened  There was another post. I saw a couple days ago that said that  On Sunday that Obama had signed an executive order banning assault weapons. I thought oh  Then I thought by my journalist mind said  Well, why haven't I heard that all over and it's not on the Washington Post. It's not the New York Times  It's not the Guardian hmm, but I looked in the URL was suspicious and whoever killed it so  There are ways then that I think and the ways that we in media could help we could we could post and tag  debunkings if  You are the AMA or or a good medical service  You could post and tag and be recognized as a credible source that requires Google and Facebook and such to  Recognize some sources as better than others, but they do it in Google News  They write they allow the New York Times to post things why wouldn't you allow the you know Harvard Medical School?  To do that and say if somebody searches on this this is what they should see first

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely  I mean if things get sticky right because then you're assigned I mean you know then Google's becoming you know an editor  It's the algorithm whatever but I think algorithmically right you'd I'm sure that certain sources are weighted higher  Certainly Wikipedia is weighted as a very reliable source and is very high and search results. I mean that's what search results do  Yeah, I would love to see that. I mean certainly at when I whenever I search for her health stuff  I think all right like WebMD is not bad like I'll look at a page there  Or if I see you know government medical organization, I'll be like okay. I'm gonna read that but uh  Yeah, the medical stuff is it's it's a problem and I have user experience is so bad still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have I have noticed in my own  You know cut you know you try when you know you get sick  And you do the whole thing you Google it then you find out that it's horrible and you're dying and it turns out  Then you go to the doctor and you're not  But I have noticed that there is you know kind of Google has  An interface for around medical search results in this you know if you type in any sort of thing  It gets this kind of blue box  And it's pulling in information from other sources and kind of you know organizing it by symptoms and by you know  You know medicines that are used and and you know treatment things and things like that  So I've noticed they've been making little steps in this direction that have been interesting and so this is kind of more of a you know  Kind of you know as opposed to leaning on the WebMDs of the world to actually bring in that content and among them  Amongst themselves is interesting  But yeah  I feel like they've already been trying to organize that because you're right you know the the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The user experience is awful and trying to research this stuff. Yeah, yeah the knowledge graph stuff is good, and I and I've seen that you know  I think maybe what I'm thinking about is like you know he like maybe there needs to be a link or so some sort of  Interface of like it are you experiencing this right now?  Or did you just get this diagnosis like go here is I feel like the way that a lot of the information is presented  And you know is just very sort of this passionate researcher base when most of the time  You or a family member or somebody's experiencing these problems  And you're googling because you're worried and scared and you don't know what to do  And you know I don't know if that's a Google thing or if that's just a way that we write about health stuff online  But I feel like there are ways to make that experience  Like just way way better and more useful for people who are dealing with those symptoms or getting that diagnosis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you're saying is that this kind of content requires a little better bedside manner on this?  On the screen which is true. I think that's you know  I think that there's a there's definitely a way to keep it in a more clinical and more information-based than not as  Soft or sympathetic  And I don't know how you do that  I don't know you know how you put someone at ease via text on a screen  But I guess you know that's something to think about that they're probably not thinking about the the human factor right right yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe that's too tall in order  But I think I think there are ways to write words that are more reassuring and can be reassuring and informative at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know you know what I think might help with this. I think artificial intelligence might help with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dab of AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it will save us all  Another change that Google is making not to search but to maps and this is actually pretty pretty cool  If you travel a lot  Let's say you go to Japan and you do a map search and you see all these points on the map  But you don't know what they actually are you see the names for them  You don't read the language and so it's very you know difficult to pick it apart  You might see that it's a restaurant, but you don't know what kind of restaurant it is  There's a new Google Maps feature. It's actually being developed and launched first in  Japan it reveals icons for businesses and locations more than a thousand categories  That'll basically help tourists who happen to be searching around on the map to see kind of that nuance essentially  So even if they don't know the language they're gonna know that this you know they called out the example of this is a  Ramen noodle restaurant as opposed to just a place to eat or whatever  I can see that as being really really useful  And that's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of these you just you know  It is what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Google smart enough to do that why aren't they smart enough to stop me from signing in with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm torn on it to be honest like that's that obviously two-factor works well, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Work well we've proven that it does not work. No, it works well in keeping someone out of the account  This was stupid I'm really angry that Google let you put in the Google voice number for the account that you were locking down

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is that is the challenge that is the challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Easy programmers, it's a simple Boolean check is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People to the moon and we can't let Jason into his email

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We cannot let him get into as you stop Jason for his email, right? Yes, please protect me from myself because I obviously need your help  Gina I know that you have you and I have talked to quite a bit in the past about the nanodegree the Android nanodegree  From I think a little more than a year ago  They announced it at Google I O and then you were actually taking it apparently there's a new Android basics nanodegree  This is a again. It's a Udacity service  Or series rather for people who have little to no programming experience  To build simple Android apps, which sounds really cool  But where are you at with with your nanodegree and do you recommend kind of going in this route?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had a great great experience with the nanodegree I'm doing and I've slowed down  I mean one of the things about a nanodegree is that you go at your own pace and I got this new job and got  Kind of busy and so I've slowed down in my progress  But but I've had a great experience with it I highly recommend all the Udacity stuff  I've been really really impressed with how how good it is  And I'm actually really glad to hear that they've got something that's a little more accessible to people who don't have a lot of  Programming experience the course that I'm taking is for you know exist, you know people who've already programmed in Java  But if you're interested in building Android apps, you know program experience. I highly recommend the Udacity stuff  I've been super impressed with it and I really learned a lot  And I need to get back to it because I had some really good momentum going and then and then life happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that like me by Spanish lessons, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the hardest thing about these online courses is just is being really consistent about them  But but they're but they're fantastic and it is a learn at your own pace  So if you can carve out an extra hour or two, you know  A couple times a week you really can make a lot of progress and learn a lot. So highly recommend

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At Google I oh they announced this course and and they see it as a sequence  so it's a guy feeds the next and  And they needed they needed the funnel as we like to say to get people going in and I think Gina's right  they're very good son Jake is taking one in iOS and  It's a great way to get people to hold new jobs and careers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, especially because there are a lot of people that  You know myself included like I think about an app or whatever and I think oh how how difficult would it be to actually do  This I know nothing about you know coding  So I'm just not going to take that next step but knowing that there's kind of an official route  I mean this I suppose would be as official as it gets coming from, you know  Of course created by Google that's targeted for someone who knows little the know you're certified. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason I hear they're gonna offer one and two factor

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Know the thing and I want to say about the Udacity course is that the thing that surprised me about is that it's extremely  Career-focused it's like for people who want to change careers and do this thing like they part part of my course is a resume review  practice Android developer interview questions  You know, they review like that. They you know, they look through your resume  Like there's a career coaching involved which I I didn't need so and it's optional  But it's really set up to and there's ways to like get in touch with recruiter  They have you know hookups with recruiters. I mean they're looking to turn you into you know  I'm a brand new Android developer and I'm gonna get a job as this  So even if it's you know  Whether it's idle curiosity of wanting to build an app on the side or if you really want to change your career  I think that's very possible and then I think that's what I really like about I think there are lots of ways to learn how  To code a lots of really good ways  That's what I liked with the Udacity stuff is because they have that partnership with Google and they've got that kind of career  career flow  recruiter flow going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  excellent  Few quick bits before we get to our last  Sponsor and then do some tips and and pics and all that kind of stuff  You might want to check your spam folder folder because Amazon is doing some credits based on the Apple ebooks  antitrust  Settlement I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  19 bucks. I was this is this has been like this has been like a  Class action suit of Palooza this this year  Like like a month ago or so I got like $30 in my uber account  Then then there's this and then there's the then unfortunately, there's the ridiculous ticketmaster one, which is nonsense  But yeah, lots of class action suits. We're cashing in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I was gonna say the ticketmaster one is the other one where if you paid, you know  It basically if you bought anything between what is it 1990 and 2013?  You were paying fees that were seem to be you know, kind of shady a shady processing fees

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you log into your ticketmaster account to see what you got or how much you had I had oh, sorry go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, after you just I logged in  Right after they announced it, but they didn't have any supported shows  So basically what they're offering is they're offering you free tickets pairs of free tickets to upcoming shows  And those at one point were to be determined and everyone just expected them to be horrible shows  Basically, I am very very minimal discounts for for others. So you should definitely check it out  I didn't get an email notice. I just happened to like log in and saw it and I was like, whoa  Oh, yeah, I guess that happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw people talking about it on Facebook and then I logged in and I saw I just had  Page after page after page of two dollars and 25 cent vouchers  Which I guess was the amount of the fee for years of shows  I guess that you know bought through ticketmaster and then finally now the the list  What I find annoying about this like so the Amazon one is great because it's like hey to me just here's  $19 that you can go buy books with awesome great done  But for some reason to take a master one is these are you can only use those credits on  This list of shows which are none of those shows are shows. I want to go to  So it's basically an unknown thing  They should just give me credit to buy more tickets with because that's what I would have done  But yeah, so but who knows what the legal ramifications of that all that were but the at least the at least the Amazon at  The benefit from the Apple class action suit with Amazon is that we now I get 19 bucks to buy a book to read on  My vacation in July. I got $15

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what I really enjoyed the most is that like on my phone the Amazon app like sent me this push notification  That was like surprise  Amazon's got a gift for you and I was like, oh really?  Okay, and then I tapped on it was like this class arch and lawsuit with Apple  Like was all this legal ease with a number and I was like, okay, that's a surprise  I mean it was indeed a surprise for me  I just love that the copy editor for the push notification was like  Boring long explanation about a class action lawsuit. Also you get like $14.92 like enjoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright sure $14 to spend almost on anything on Amazon though. That's yeah, that's the right way to do it  I completely agree with you Ron. Yeah  Really really that's what okay, whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was giving away Apple's money and ticket master was having to give away ticket ticket master. Yeah, that's that's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go for Amazon. It's a feature for ticket master

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best shot we can't give me away all of Apple's money. Yes. Yes. There we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any last story ideas before we get to the break and then do picks anything you guys were dying to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three good. Oh, what about you? What about what about what about the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kfc box that allows you to charge your phone. That's that's a good last story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's that's the right one to go with that was a good pick. I saw I saw that I was like wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Colonel Sanders is getting 21st century eyes  Yeah, basically KFC has come up with a new takeout box  That's called the five-in-one meal box and not only do you get a delicious fried chicken dinner  But this is only available in in New Delhi and Mumbai, India  But the KFC box comes equipped with a USB port that allows you to charge your device as you're eating  And that's actually a great photo of it if we can pull up the link on it, but you can see it  It's this it's this it's this great  cardboard box with the USB  Hook up to it. It's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Batteries with everyone these meals seriously. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is crazy like what I'm what I don't understand what I got a metal yeah exactly  I couldn't figure out in the article whether like is that battery rechargeable and then so that's like a  An external battery that you can recharge and then recharge your phone with later  I couldn't find whether that is the case or not. I'm assuming so but if not, wow, that is a big environmental waste  What a box

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Image of a person like throwing a thing into the trash on the side of that water box. Yeah, you're right. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This please

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a whole video that goes with it  Yeah, well they've got the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like oh no, is this you  Your cell phone runs out of batteries when you're at KFC. All you need to do is  Get this meal and there you go it comes with a cord

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just asked you out you have to get back to him Oh you got your message from Rohan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got into your account that's better than me  We think what a meal box can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very Apple s branding rethink what your KFC box can do. No one no one I'm convinced

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one ever rethought that a KFC box should charge their phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one ever thought that for the marketing team no one ever thought what else can I do with this box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently a fully charged KFC box provided 17% charge over a half an hour before it burned through its battery and died  So it's not a huge lift

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so now here's the other question though is that while it's charging that battery is it also keeping the food in the box warm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, you'd hope so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if not, they really need to retool it yes, they need to retool it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This story was like a Christmas gift. This was just like here. Here's this wonderful bit of fried chicken charging your phone

How about we start with the new guy?  We'll start with you Ron what do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well consider I didn't know I had to come to the picks I think we get it over with yeah  We let you off the hook, but yeah  So consider considering that one of my personal GTD heroes Gina is on the show and in honor of that  I thought I'd share a neat little  Productivity chrome extension that I use on a daily basis, and you guys have probably heard about it  It is one of those things where I don't know you know  I never know how ubiquitous these extensions are I figure is better you know better safe to bring it up than not  But I've installed the momentum chrome extension and what this is is that basically this  installs on chrome and every time I open a new tab instead of getting the default chrome tabs or whatnot I get the momentum screen  which  Very you know prominently displays the time it greets me  It says good afternoon Ron and then at the beginning of the day and asked me  What is your main focus for today?  So if you know if I'm working on a project or I've got a deliverable that I've do whatever I can just say hey  I'm doing this so and what happens is is that every time I open a tab after I've entered in my main focus as opposed to  Seeing a list of links or chrome apps or things like that  I get the momentum page and it reminds me that I really should be working on that document  So it's a great way to keep you from having your mind wander keep you on task keep you focused  It's also got integrations with it's got weather integration so shows me that it's currently 58 degrees in San Francisco  It does have support for a small to-do list  So if I wanted to add more to-do's other than my main focus I could  but basically it's just a neat little extension that keeps you on task as well as give you very pretty pictures and  Make you aware what time it is because we all know we need to stay focused on what we're working on so momentum  It's free in the in the chrome store. It's a small install and it's once I installed it  I can't live without it so every machine every every my laptop my desktop every computer. I have I always make sure it's on chrome so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is momentum chrome extension excellent pick  Especially because you were told to come up with a pick right before the show began so you did a good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I scramble what happened was is that I went to open a new tab to go look for something and momentum open

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See it was meant to be it was meant to be  Let's see here Gina, what about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my thing this week is a little bit self-indulgent. I hope I hope you'll hear me  It's a new app by Twitter called Twitter engage which does something near and dear to my heart  Which is give you insights about your activity on Twitter wait a minute this sounds familiar  It's iOS only and and yeah that verge review is like engages a place for Twitter celebrities to you know to  Interact with their followers. It's not just for celebrities it works for everyone, but it is like I said iOS only  And I'll tell you things like did you get followed by a verified user user who your biggest?  Fans are who your you know followers what your followers have been talking about the most in the past 24 hours  Kind of live analytics of retweets and likes if you tweet you can kind of see these like cool live bar charts change  you know as activity happens on your tweets and  Yeah, so I'm I'm recommending this app because  Poor one outs we are we just announced we're in the process of shutting down think up  So this is a really good alternative to to think up  We are we're funding all our subscribers subscribers, and we're made that this is a very difficult decision for a variety of reasons  Which you can read about on we wrote a post that you can just go to Twitter  Slash think up if you if you if you care and you want to learn more you can find out more there  But I really liked this engage app and I was also I was happy to hear that in the early product  Discussions at Twitter they were actually looking at think up and it's a one form some of their designs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly they they should have looked a little closer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Indeed  But you know sincere  Pantons hanging around  Unfortunately, no  But you know engage I think is gonna be really good because you know they're not they're not dealing with API limitations  This is a Twitter app an API limitations is one of the reasons why I think up didn't didn't make it is it  It's just game really difficult to get to do things to show insights in the app because we just didn't have access to the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the real challenge. You know, you know, I had lunch last week in New York  Which was delightful and always good to see you in person  but one of the things we talked about was the challenge of  Building an application that's dependent on other applications and when they make changes you've got to make changes and it can get overwhelming  And and it's a it's a real challenge to make that a success  And I think you should be immensely proud of what you guys did with think up and it was one of my favorite applications  So it's definitely yeah, so definitely you added added good to the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I really appreciate that and I really appreciate all the support from everyone at twit and everyone who listens to watches twit  And endured all my think up promotions week after week. I really do appreciate it  So but this engage app is really cool  And if you if you are looking for those kinds of insights it looks it looks promising

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mashed potato and chat room has a really good point think up you should have bought Twitter  I love I love think up. I've been I've been a happy  subscriber  For the last couple years as it's been around and I've enjoyed getting those notices in the morning about the previous  Day and kind of take a look at all the information that I wouldn't know otherwise  So I really really applaud all the work that you guys did with think up and I'm bummed to see it go away  Jeff what is your number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this this is one of those stories that I think will lead to a wonderful topsy-turvy  Silicon Valley moment so the what's it called fiber to the home council of which Google is a member released a study saying that  Having Google fiber could raise rents by 11%  So here's what I bet is how  They're saying that is a good thing in other words that your property is worth more you should want Google fiber  But you know darn well what's gonna happen in in  insane  Real-estate market San Francisco there probably be demonstrations and egg throwing  Insisting how dare you install Google fiber in our neighborhood? We'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And  Fascinating stuff I want Google fiber. It's rolling out to all these different places  It never comes up to Petaluma. I'm just kind of bummed about that one of these days Petaluma will be on its roadmap  Sure keeps  If there's two things I want Google to walk away from the show with it's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Petaluma for Google fiber and two

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should really rethink the two-factor thing with Google voice. I don't think you've got the priority mixed up on those

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before you get Google fighter fiber, let's just say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure my pick my thing could be anything other than that cautionary tale that you had earlier today  If you're thinking about doing two-factor authentication as I was  Take the time to think about the implications of using your Google voice account with it and don't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that I think the large lesson here is that if you're whenever you're doing anything that involves security and two-factor authentication  Or anything with passwords password like whether it's awfully or our last pass or whatever app you're using  Do it slowly and do it in an environment where you have no other distractions or I don't know not host a podcast  While you're doing it that might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I said Ron it actually seemed like a good idea at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason this is a tribute a tribute to you and I mean this because obviously if you've been doing it the quiet of a room  You would have thought this through you have been it but you instead you got okay. I got a break Jarvis is yammering on now  I'll do it right now  What have I done and and so I appreciate we all appreciate your sacrifice for the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
