Transcript:  It's time for This Week in Google.  I lied to you last week when I said the report would be back.  He's off to Norway this week actually for TWiT Photo.  They're at the Nordic Light Festival.  Is that right?  So I get to fill in again on This Week in Google.  I'm very excited to be here, of course, with Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.  Welcome Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great to be here as well with Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  Hey, all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I actually know the truth.  You stuffed Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that seems to be the rumor.  Yeah.  No, Leo will be back next week, I promise.  But we have a great guest with us from This Week in Law, Denise Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's it going, Denise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for joining us and helping our audience get through their long Leo-less weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it can make things very tedious, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I'm so sorry, everyone.  But we got some good Google news to get through today.  The big thing was the unicorn-made-real Google Drive showed up yesterday.  Everybody got it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  No?  Denise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, don't have it.  But anxious to hear Gina's take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got mine this morning, actually.  I didn't have it and I was being all grumpy about it.  And then the email showed up this morning.  So I can give you hope, at least.  It does eventually show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So have you played around with it a lot, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have.  I installed the client on my Mac and on my Android phone.  And I like it a lot.  I mean, I have this model in my head for how these apps should go.  And truthfully, my idea of how these apps should be is kind of modeled on Dropbox because  that's what I've been using for a long time.  What's interesting about Google Drive is that it converts Google Docs into Google Drive.  So once you opt into it, you don't have Docs anymore in the black bar.  It just says Drive.  And when you sync your documents, you get all the spreadsheets and drawings and Docs  that you've created in Google Docs on your desktop.  But what's weird about it, what surprised me about it, is that you get links to those  Docs.  Like if you click on the Doc, it doesn't launch Microsoft Word to open a Doc file.  It launches your browser to edit it online in Google Docs.  So that was a little surprising.  But you can store regular files in Google Docs.  You've been able to do this for a while.  You can upload a move file or a PNG file and those sync and those open locally the  same way they do on other products that do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me understand that, Gina, for one second.  So if I have a Microsoft Word Doc that I've saved to this folder, right, and I open it  up, it does not open Microsoft Word, you said it opens it up in...  No.  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you've created a Microsoft Word document and saved it as a .doc into your Google Drive,  it syncs as a file and it opens with Microsoft Word.  If you create a Doc in Google Docs, it actually gets this special extension called .gdoc and  the spreadsheets are .gsheet and there's .gdraw.  All the .g something files are actually just our links to open up inside the browser so  you edit them in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I've got one syncing on my machine here and you can see you get these little  googly icons for all the Google stuff but then down here I've got an actual Doc and  you get, it's kind of really hard to see on this, but you get a more typical Word Doc  icon so you can visually tell the difference between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So at first I think this confused a lot of people.  It was like, well then what's the point?  If it's just a link, what do I need this for?  I was happy about it because I saw a lot of Docs that I haven't looked at in years and  years.  I've even been using Docs that long and you can sync other kinds of documents.  I never organized my Google Docs.  I never made folders and organized them so it was just kind of, you know, when I installed  Google Drive I got this folder, it was just this pile of unorganized, you know, it was  just this big mess of links to Google Docs that I had saved.  But you can organize them in folders and it'll sync back to, well it's not Google Docs anymore,  it's just Drive, Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you look, the interface looks exactly like the old Google Docs interface except  it says Drive up in the upper left corner and you've got a few different options if  you drill down into it but otherwise you wouldn't even notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, it looks similar.  Although there are a couple of little changes.  If you look on the upper right hand corner you can view a list or by grid.  So next there's, to the right of sort, yeah, like there's that grid view which you'll be  able, you can preview images, you can previews of documents which is interesting.  And the search has improved a lot.  So if you look up at the search box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I stopped using the search a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you click on that down arrow on the far right of the search box you can search by  file type, right?  So one cool thing that Google Drive does, it does OCR on images, right?  So if you snap a picture of a poster or whiteboard and you save the image to Google Drive, you  can, it will recognize the text or it will try to recognize text.  So in the search box you can say show me all the images which have the word, you know,  cat in them and it'll show you that.  So that's pretty useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have any images.  You don't have any images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, PDFs, presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Show me all the PDFs that have the word cat in them.  Actually, how many spreadsheets have the word cat in them?  There is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at that.  Right, there you go.  Cat 6 cable.  Tell me you need cat.  Not meow.  All the cats that meow are feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, one thing I like about this too is that you get My Drive which shows you,  you know, your folders and your docs separate from shared with me.  Yes.  And that declutters it quite a bit.  Because some people share stuff with me that I just need to glance at but then it constantly  is bubbling up to the top.  Right.  Now, you do have to, when you sort, it sorts by either share date or headline.  So you have to go in and change that.  I can't remember now where you changed that.  But you can change that to sort by activity instead.  Oh, it's over on the left.  There's a selection for shared with me where you click activity.  And then it'll show you based on like, oh, what was the latest one updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm sorry to be remedial here as usual.  But you put a folder on your desktop as you do with Dropbox.  Is it operate like Dropbox in terms of just moving something over?  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  Can I have more than one folder that is synced or I have to do folders within that folder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you install a client on your desktop, say on your Mac, it creates a folder called  Google Drive and you authenticate with one Google account.  And that represents your drive.  Right.  So everything in that folder is exactly what's on the website, you know, the web app.  Right.  So if you create a subfolder within it, it creates a subfolder, you know, inside Drive.  If you organize files, if you edit files, that kind of thing, it all gets reflected.  So it's just like Dropbox.  You know, when you install Dropbox, it creates a Dropbox folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My next one, which is my chronic yes, but to all things Google these days, I have two  Gmail accounts.  Can I have two instances of Drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that I can see.  It's a single user.  Yeah, I know.  You can sign out.  Why has that forsaken us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny you mentioned that because one of the things is if you type in docs.google.com,  it's supposed to redirect to Google Drive because that's docs.  I found funny.  I put in docs.google.com and it redirected to wait for it.  Well maybe it'll redirect.  Now it won't because I want to do it live.  But oh yeah, there it goes.  It redirected to my sword and laser Google apps on the domain account instead, which  is not a Google Drive account.  Google, you got to fix this.  I'm curious why, why that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have shared documents under both Gmail accounts.  So does that mean I can't have Drive?  Do I even have the option of not having Drive?  Can I still keep docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh sure.  Well you don't have to install the software.  You can just use it on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can just use it on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can only do it for one account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well you can in the desktop client, you can log out from your current Google account and  log in with another.  But I think then it would have to, it would resync everything again.  I actually haven't tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's going to confuse every other thing I have open.  And it's going to sign me out of it.  What it does is it signs me out of everything.  And then I have to find the secret wizards handle with my left foot raised to get the  right order to exactly restart everything.  And so my one Gmail, my other Gmail, my Google plus is this account, but my docs is that  account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the multi-account issue is an issue for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to have a similar issue I guess in our household because my son and I frequently  share a computer and he has his own Google account and I have my own and he uses docs  for school and I use it for work.  So I can see where this would be a bit difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Young man, why are you submitting a brief for this essay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you switch user accounts on the computer itself?  Yes.  Or do you log in with one computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just to make it clean, we usually use a different browser.  Okay.  Okay.  So, you know, if I'm logged in in one browser, I won't be in the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I think it's on a per user basis.  So if I'm logged in as me and my computer, that Google Drive folder is within my user  folder.  But if I log out and my wife logs in or someone else my family logs in, they can have a separate  syncing folder.  I think it's only if you're sharing the same computer user where it might be an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But do you log in from the Google Drive app?  Or do you like if I log out of my web browser, it doesn't log me out of the app.  It doesn't change the Google Drive folder on my desktop.  Right.  That's right.  Yeah, that's right.  All right.  Wow.  I'm only using 0.01 gigabytes.  Figured I would add more in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, is there any indication that now that Google has this in place, there are other  things obviously that we're storing to the cloud with Google other than our documents?  It has its music piece.  It has Picasa.  Is there any indication these are going to be put together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like the next logical step, right, that Picasa, that photos and music  would tie into this eventually.  And I'm actually kind of surprised that they're not right now.  I mean, it took a really long time for Drive to launch.  I mean, it's a solid 1.0 launch, but it doesn't have any.  I thought there was going to be some crazy magic multi-Google product sauce that they  couldn't launch until after the privacy policy thing had been worked out or something.  And we're obviously not seeing that in this version, but it seems that would make the  most logical sense that music and Picasa would follow suit and get integrated with Drive  pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else do you think they could do now that they have our docs for our desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one point to make is that the storage fees are now the same across all the platforms.  So people who were using Picasa now have to pay more for storage, even if they still just  want to use Picasa.  So I think that indicates they will eventually unify all this stuff.  But more to your question, Jeff, one of the things they're doing is putting in apps that  are tied into Google Drive because Sundar Pichai is the guy who killed G Drive when  he came to Google a few years ago.  And I read an interview on All Things D today where they're like, well, now what changed  your mind?  He said, the reason we killed G Drive is because it was about files.  And we said, look, Google Docs is a better solution for this.  So we went and we rebuilt it around Google Docs.  And one of the things we want to do is get rid of this idea of files and get rid of and  get to the idea of use cases and what people do with their data.  And so they've added all of these apps and they plan to add more.  Hello Facts, WeVideo, Balsamic, which allows you designers to collaboratively create wireframes.  Lulu, the book on demand publisher where you can self publish actually has got an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The online video editing program?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  That's there as well.  Yes.  So it's like you use all these disparate web apps, but the place where you store your data  for them is Google.  Right.  So it's like all of your web activity or all the files that you create across the web if  you're editing documents or making wireframes or self publishing a book or editing video.  It all just is in your Google account.  But you can use all these different apps around the web, Aviary and WeVideo and Balsamic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are those Chrome apps?  Are those all the old Chrome apps?  Are they the same thing or is this another bifurcated world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, when you install these apps, you install them as a Chrome app and there's a little  icon that says works with Google Drive.  So one of my favorite ones, MindMeister is a mind mapping app.  It's really good mind mapping app.  I've actually really liked it.  I reviewed on a life hacker years ago.  And so you can install MindMeister into Chrome.  So it installs the little shortcut in your new tab page in Chrome.  And then when you launch it, it says, hey, can I off you on Google Drive?  Can I store files in Google Drive?  And you say yes.  And then when you create maps, they all just get stored in Google Drive, which is really  nice because if you share a folder with your team, for example, and you want to store the  mind maps, the wireframes, the images, the videos all in one place and just share that  one folder to everyone, then that's really useful.  So you don't have to say, hey, log into this app here and log into that app here to get  this or that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got it.  Does this give new life to Chrome as an OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting thought because they are talking about the fact that Google  Drive will be the file management system for Chrome OS in the next version.  There's a beta version of it being used in the current version.  But the next rev, I can't remember, is a 12 or 13.  Off the top of my head, I can't remember.  But they are going to say that's going to be your file management.  File management's been kind of tricky in Chrome OS up till now.  Now this will be how you manage files.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next question.  Google read our email and added all kinds of value to that to prioritize things for  get rid of people we don't pay attention to and all these wonderful things.  It can be a new excuse for not answering your email.  When we get in the habit of storing all of our documents in this device, if that comes,  what else, I got to go back to my other question, what else could Google do with that knowledge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steal your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not where you go with that.  Oh, willy nilly.  It'll be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'm not directly answering your question, Jeff, because I do, for example,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  couldn't they, couldn't they yet improve Gmail even more?  Knowing which documents we actually manipulate, who we send them to, what's in them, what  things we save, what we do with them.  I mean, I always argue that Google is looking for more signals, signal generation, and having  all of our docs and having the permission, we'll discuss this in a minute, to do things  to them, like translate them or whatever, gives them knowledge about us that they can  use in other ways.  The one that will freak people out is when you find an ad on your Microsoft Word document.  But that won't happen.  I don't think.  But does this potentially overnight even improve Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it could, right?  And this is kind of what Wave, like the vision of Wave, not to bring up Wave, the long-departed  Google Wave, was to put communication and collaboration all in one place, right?  So to be able to chat and email back and forth, but also co-edit a document.  And this does it in a way that's a lot clearer, right?  We know that we edit docs and we know that we send emails.  But now that Google, with the new privacy policy, can share that information across  the products, they can make it easier to collaborate, to talk to one another about a doc as you  write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, things like...  So Gina, what did Wave do that this isn't doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Wave had kind of the real-time as you type technology.  It was a completely different place that you went, though.  It wasn't your email inbox and it wasn't Google Docs.  So that was kind of confusing.  I mean, Wave had...  But HoloNotes have it.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  HoloNotes have it.  Yeah, well, you're talking about the video, the ad with HoloNotes for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I interrupted for a cheap joke.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Wave is really geeky.  It had this very full-featured API where you could create widgets like polls and maps and  you could collaborate on things inside of Wave, but they're all really wonky and no  one knew how to get them.  You think this could ever get there?  Well, this is...  I mean, this is what's happening with Drive, being able to connect to other web apps.  I mean, this is a way to be extensible.  I think that's just a lot more sustainable and that people just have a model of what  this means a little bit better.  I'm going to use this mind mapping app and it's just going to save the document back  to Google Drive.  I think that makes a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's available across...  If you're living in the Google universe, it's available across everything, right?  So I don't have to save it to my desktop, edit it, and then put it back into Gmail.  I can actually just continue to work on whatever it is and go to Gmail and mail it off or mail  a link to collaborate or edit that YouTube video.  I mean, it just...  It gets rid of the barriers, but it also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uploading, downloading.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also puts huge barriers around you on the outside.  So there's no more barriers on the inside, but it makes it so you don't want to go out  and use Yahoo mail, for instance, because that's not going to have the same integration.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, to some extent.  And if someone wants to open your file, they have to sign in with their Google account.  They have to off with their Google account to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're in Redmond, what are you thinking to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're thinking SkyDrive is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  SkyDrive has seven gigabytes free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're possibly thinking antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you?  Are you thinking antitrust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You're in Redmond.  Microsoft's always thinking antitrust.  Yes, that might...  No, I'm saying...  On one side or the other.  Because the more that Google ties its products together, the more it starts to resemble what  Microsoft went through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question, right?  SkyDrive, is it integrated with Hotmail in the same way that Gmail is now integrated with  Google Drive?  I don't think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I've been touching Hotmail in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chat mail?  Chat room?  Anybody use Hotmail?  I think Office Live is.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Admit it.  Well, I can tell you what is true is that Office Live is not integrated with SkyDrive  the same way that Google Drive is integrated with Google Docs.  So they've at least got one thing to point to to say like, okay, well, we're not forcing  you into this situation.  But I think they'd like to force you into that situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It said that Google still has ways to go to get to Microsoft Word compatibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very true.  I use Google Docs to create Word documents because I don't care about making them very  fancy.  But there are all kinds of things I can do in Word that I can't, which is one of the  reasons I was surprised to see Lulu as a self-publisher have an app.  I assume that means that they have a template that works in Google Docs.  But I have published two books on Lulu and both of them I had to format in either Open  Office or Microsoft Word because Google Docs just didn't have the functionalities to do  the layout that it needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So maybe that's why you need the app is the app allows you to make those those further  tweaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think this wee video thing is a big deal.  Since I teach in a journalism school, every student here has to get we give them free  use of Final Cut and it's less expensive than it was.  But I think we move more and more away from those apps, you know, from Word and Final  Cut and all that.  You know, and I'm thinking that you could teach journalism students going forward with  a Chromebook.  You can edit photos, you could edit video, you can create graphics.  You could, you know, unfortunately, you can't get the lights to stay on.  Sorry.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm alive.  It's just because you're so calm.  You're so centered and Zen that the lights just forget that you're there.  Somebody in the chat room is pointing out that SkyDrive does have Word docs now.  So that's that is something that they can they can compete on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next question.  If you're Dropbox today, what are you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're thinking, gosh, I wish I was integrated with something.  But otherwise, I don't know.  I think I think you're also thinking that I don't necessarily want to rush us into this  next story.  But you're thinking, why didn't you watch the mistakes we made Google Drive with your  Terms of Service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we move off to that, anything else that Dropbox versus Google Drive?  I mean, it's a matter of trust, I think, really.  And integration.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and does Dropbox have an API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dropbox has a great API.  I use it for the mobile apps that I built.  Save your file back to Dropbox.  From what I understand.  No, I don't support SkyDrive.  Although I shouldn't.  I don't know if I should say this publicly.  But Microsoft reached out to me and said, hey, will you add SkyDrive support to your  app?  I mean, it's an open source app and most people are using it at the command line or on Linux.  I mean, it's very like it's kind of a cultural thing.  It's like, you know, there's a little bit of a cultural clash there.  But I know that a lot of people are going to want Google Drive support just because they  probably are already using it.  I'm using I'm going to use both.  Right.  Like I use Google Docs before.  I'm using Google Docs now.  I use Dropbox before.  I'm just going to, you know, I also have the Google Music client running.  I mean, at this point, I don't see I don't think it's an either or proposition.  Dropbox's API is definitely better than Google Drive's is at the moment.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been hinting around at this terms of service situation, so we might as well get  right to it.  There is some controversy amongst some that Google Drive in their terms of service says  that when you upload or otherwise submit content to your service, you give Google and those  we work with a worldwide license, license, not ownership, to use, host, store, reproduce,  modify, create derivative works such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or  other changes that we make so that your content works better with our services, communicate,  publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.  The rights you grant in the license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting  and improving our services and to develop new ones.  This license continues even if you stop using our services.  I think that's one that got people's feathers ruffled.  This sounds awful, Denise, but can you translate this?  What is this?  What does this actually give Google the right to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So the reason part of the reason this sounds awful is because Google tried to consolidate  their terms and make them apply across their various services.  So when you're thinking of some of these things, modify, publicly perform, etc., they don't  really have a whole lot of application to things that you might do with a docs kind  of format.  So it's one of the pitfalls of trying to make things apply to each and every service.  There are going to be some things unique to each service that maybe deserve their own  terms.  It's just a downside to taking that approach.  The other thing that is important, and I wrote about this when Google Plus came out and people  were worried about uploading their photos and using the Picasa aspect of that, is that  Google does do what a lot of other companies don't and say, yes, you're going to grant  us a license so that we can effectively give you access to and make our services work well  with your stuff.  But we're going to limit that license to operating and promoting and improving our services.  Now I have no idea why Google feels compelled to throw promote in there because the last  thing anybody wants is for their private photo or their private document to show up in some  promotion of Google services.  And I think Google is probably well aware of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be that if you put something on to Google Plus, if you share it there and  choose to share it there, they have a new share thing, you are promoting that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, maybe that's what they mean by promote.  But to the extent they mean help us with our advertising strategy, I think they can toss  that one right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you upload a public YouTube video of you doing a Lady Gaga cover, right, and they  run a Lady Gaga commercial for Chrome, which is like a bunch of people on YouTube who have  uploaded public videos like Dancing the Gaga.  Can Google put cut together a commercial like that without asking those people?  Or is this keeping them the right to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they can.  So that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you've made something public, like a YouTube video, in that example, you now have  a new tool to make things public.  And once they're public, they're public, is what Google is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But they don't say that.  And that's something that I wish they'd said in the terms.  If you have made something, if you've made content public.  I mean, this is the thing.  I don't have a problem with Google Voice using my voicemails to improve their voice recognition.  I don't have a problem with Google, you know, translating email messages that I get in Italian  to English for me.  I mean, they ask me, you know, when they detect another language, do you want this translated?  No problem with that.  I don't have a problem with Google looking at my images and doing OCR for me and making  them more searchable.  I mean, this is all stuff that makes sense.  It's all stuff that requires that they have access to my private data in order to make  the service better.  It sounds like these terms mean that if I've uploaded my super secret business model from  my new company and I've only shared it with my co-founder, that Google can publish that  without my permission.  And that doesn't sound like that's what they're saying.  These terms seem to imply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's this language for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving  our services, whatever Google and ultimately a court decides those terms mean.  The problem I have, Gina, and you've you've hit the nail right on the head, is that Google  has made great strides in giving people fine grained ways to share and to lock things down  that should be locked down.  And these terms aren't acknowledging that.  What they say is when you upload or otherwise submit content to our services and they don't  acknowledge in their terms that there are fine variations on how that can be done and  what sort of permissions and expectations are going along with each upload and submission.  And the terms should acknowledge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it an example of lawyers saying, well, we need to write language that gives us the  right to translate Gina's document and share from YouTube to Google Docs to Drive.  So let's write it in a way that's as broad as possible to make sure we're covered.  And then it looks like it's protecting rights that they don't really care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I think that's exactly what's going on.  And they don't need to do that.  You know, it just leads to controversy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, or as a junior's earlier point, Denise, they could also explain it better, which has  been the problem we talked about this last week.  That's been the problem with with Google, I think a lot lately is then sit down and  anticipate these questions and deal with them.  And so this is why we're doing it.  Also, put limits are necessary on it.  And we will never do this, this or this and say it in a way that we can go back and get  them if they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Dropbox went through this already, where they put these same terms of service  out, everybody freaked out.  They clarified them.  At least they tried to clarify them to say, look, we we are only doing this so that we  can provide you the service.  And they added some clarification that says we do not take ownership of anything you put  in Dropbox, you retain ownership.  And Google actually has that in their terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need you to give us the rights so that we can do what you want us to do with your  documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's also lots of really good examples.  And I guess, you know, if you're a lawyer at Google, you may look at Amazon and say,  oh, well, they're not covering themselves very well.  But the Amazon Web Services, Ed Bott points out, as between you and us, you or your  licensors own all right, title and interest in and to your content, except as provided  in this section eight, we obtain no rights under this agreement from you or your licensors  to your content, including any related intellectual property rights.  You consent to our use of your content to provide the service offerings to you and any  end users. Now, is that too vague?  Because they're basically saying you keep all the rights except what we need to provide  you the service. I guess they could just redefine the service to mean anything later.  Counselor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that approach better, certainly.  And then you get into arguing about, OK, so what is the exception encompass?  But better that than the default being, you know, that we're giving you everything, Google.  And Google's terms don't say that.  But, you know, they my main problem with it is that they are forging ahead and doing these  great things with their products to help people share things only in ways that they want to.  And yet they're not reflecting that in their terms.  They're just being it seems to me lazy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, is it OK?  You're you're a lawyer. You get to say that.  I always feel I always feel careful about calling somebody lazy when I don't understand the  job they do. But yeah, it does strike me as being sort of like, well, it's cast the net  as widely as possible and it's going to cause a lot of controversy.  And Google has responded by basically pointing to the clause that says we don't keep any  ownership of any of your data.  So I think some people are overreacting to it, but it may be sloppy is another word.  For the way it was. Yeah, yeah, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there just needs to be, you know, right hand, left hand coordination.  They really should say, OK, well, we've got things out there performing in this way.  Our terms should reflect it.  And it seems to me like, you know, the legal department hasn't really quite sat down  enough with the product department to make sure that it all meshes together well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think there's another step there, which is the PR department and PR defined  differently. PR defined as truly the public's representative.  You know, and it has been suggested, I think elsewhere, Google doesn't need Google  has a problem with this messaging.  It has a problem with anticipating the problems that are going to come up.  I've long argued that they should have user committees, user advisory boards, user  juries, ombudsman, something because it's a weakness in what they do.  We could anticipate exactly this. You just didn't anticipate at all.  You know, you know exactly what was going to happen.  Gina gave the scenario you knew you were going to see.  No surprise. And it's then they don't see it sometimes.  I think if they think the world is all logical and they've got to see in these holes  and they've got to anticipate them, they've got to have the answers for them.  And it's only in their benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I can jump back and forth across the fence in Google's defense, I don't think  these terms changed with Google Drive.  I think these were the same terms that Google Docs had and nobody noticed.  So if you're Google, you're like, why are you suddenly complaining now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's the same terms.  Still, but you know what's going to happen.  Of course, yeah, you still know it.  They're not bad terms. Gina's right.  They lead to impressions that may not be accurate, but you've got to deal  with the impressions, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you also have to have a degree of trust.  And you're right, Tom, I don't think they did change.  But maybe the increased scrutiny is because the assumption is that Drive  is going to bring more users into the fold than what was existing under Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's any opportunity to go after Goliath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. True.  Yeah, it's just true. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's find everything we can. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Any time a new service comes out from from anybody big like Google,  people are going to start investigating it, look point poking at it,  seeing if there's weaknesses.  That's good. You want people to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.  But, you know, I think to kind of zoom out, I think the truth is that when you're  using free services like the ones Google provides, there has to be a level of trust.  Right. I mean, if you're not paying for something,  if you're not paying with money, right, you're paying with data.  You can pay, but.  Well, you can. But but for the most part, I mean, you can pay in some in some  some circumstances, yeah.  But but for the most part, people use free Gmail, free, you know, the free end.  And the reality is that you're giving your data to get advertised to, you know,  more effectively. And if you don't trust the company that's providing that service,  then you shouldn't use it.  You know, I mean, like I, you know, we talked about the issue of trust a lot.  I trust Google enough to use their their services.  And so to me, it's like, so I think Google's going to, you know,  publish my secret documents on Drive.  No, I don't, because I trust them.  And I'm pretty sure that they know that if people don't trust them,  that they'll lose customers.  But if you read the terms of service, if you distrust Google,  which I think a lot of people increasingly are to some degree, then  then this might not be acceptable to you.  But it's a question about whether or not, you know, what is acceptable to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Just want to point out before we move off of Google Drive as a topic,  the verge has an excellent chart up  comparing Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Sky Drive,  Syncplicity, Walla, Mozi,  Spider Oak Box, Sugarsync, Cubby, which is from Logmein, Live, Kyve and InSync.  Wow. So you can just add and in many different categories  from how much storage you get for free to the file size limits, encryption,  what clients are available for what platforms.  By the way, Google, one of the Google employees on Google Plus today  pointed out that there is not a Linux client yet for Google Drive,  but it's in the works. They're working on it.  And they all they'll say is soon, but it's definitely something they want to provide.  That's an advantage Dropbox has right now is Dropbox has a Linux client.  But, yeah, Sky Drive wins in storage.  Seven gigabytes.  iCloud is the only one who doesn't do version tracking.  There's some interesting stuff that kind of comes out when you look at it in this chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Question. Why didn't Amazon do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Amazon does have a storage locker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry about it. Not a consumer level, really, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they do. Yeah, it's a really it has.  It's part of your your music subscription.  If you buy from Amazon. Right.  There is a there is a general purpose.  Five gigabytes free Amazon storage and everything.  It doesn't have the docs. It doesn't have version.  It doesn't have a lot of these features.  It's a very basic storage. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have AWS and they have that storage, the vault.  It just seems like it was it was a baby step.  And they have the ability to read things anywhere.  On Kindle. I don't know. Just seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, exactly.  When you're S3 and you're powering things like Jungle Disc,  which is a backup service, you think it'd be easy to just put one of these together.  But I guess that's the thing is it's not easy to make one of these front ends  that does all the things that Spydero and SkyDrive and Google Drive are going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I that was the big innovation, right?  Is that it mounted this folder on your desktop and it's synced in the background.  You don't have to think about it.  And it was and you know, it was on all your devices and in the cloud  without very passively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jungle Disc. Jungle Disc uses Rackspace.  I'm told I haven't used Jungle Disc in a couple of years, so they must have switched off S3.  All right. Well, let's take a quick break  and thank our sponsor, VIA, the magic of Leo Laporte's traveling through space and time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Tom, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a little break during the show,  give you all a chance to stretch your legs while I talk a little bit about Go To My PC.  Now, if you're listening to the show on the treadmill, continue stretching your legs.  I'll tell you about the best remote access anywhere from the folks at Citrix.  They know remote access better than anybody better than the Microsoft  licensed Citrix technology to do their remote desktop.  But we've come a long way since then.  And Go To My PC is amazing.  Allows you to access your Mac or your PC, Windows or Mac from anywhere.  You just log on to your Go To My PC accounts.  It's easy to set up. It uses Natroversial 128-bit SSL.  So, so simple, so secure.  And here's the beauty part.  You can actually access your office computer from your iPhone, your iPad, your iPhone.  So you pull out... This is so awesome.  You pull out your iPhone.  Let's say you get a call from work that says,  you forgot you didn't do the thing that we asked you to do.  Your TPS reports are due. Can you hurry up?  You're on the way to the airport. You want to turn around? No problem.  You got your iPhone. You fire up the Go To My PC app.  And you're online using...  It's weird to see a Windows machine or a Mac on an iPhone.  But with that red display, it's actually pretty usable.  You can send and receive email, access any network resource.  You can run any program just like you're at the office.  It's got a keyboard, a mouse, everything.  And you're done. You didn't have to turn around.  You got it done with the iPhone.  That is pretty awesome.  But it won't work unless you install it right now.  So if you're sitting at your office computer,  visit GoToMyPC.com, use the offer code TWIG.  It'll just set up. It'll just take literally a minute or two to set up.  And you're good to go.  And then make sure you get the free app for your iPad and your iPhone too,  because it's so cool.  GoToMyPC.com, use the offer code TWIG for 30 days, absolutely free.  The apps are always free.  Thanks, GoToMyPC and Citrix, for your support of This Week in Google.  Back to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We miss you, Leo. Come back from Norway.  There we go. So good to see Leo's face.  So you don't forget him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's good to see him.  Yeah.  Time shifted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's move on to the Google Oracle World Series of Intellectual Property.  In its second week, Google's Andy Rubin was on stage in the witness stand.  Monday, let's see. Yeah.  Today, actually this morning and also a little bit yesterday,  Eric Schmidt defended Android in court.  This is one of the reasons we wanted to have Denise on the show.  What's your take on where this is going?  I mean, we talked about it quite a bit last week on This Week in Google,  and you guys have talked about it on This Week in Law.  We spent Monday with a computer science explanation about APIs,  and then we seem to have spent the past couple days saying,  in this email, are you admitting that you needed a license to Java?  And Andy Rubin said, no, I don't believe we do.  And Eric Schmidt said, I don't remember anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And it's interesting that all these singers are coming out on cross-examination, too.  Google is putting on its case, its defense at this point.  So the sound bites that you've been seeing in a lot of the media coverage  are when David Boyce gets up and cross-examines Google's witnesses.  So he's making some headway with them.  The most critical thing at this point, I think, is this API issue.  What the court is going to do with that,  whether they're going to determine that APIs can actually be something  that are subject to copyright infringement.  I think that has huge ramifications.  And in the meantime, it's just kind of Google what you know when,  and Boyce, as I mentioned, is making a lot of headway with Google's witnesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting to me, too, that the developers that have emailed into the various shows here are split.  Some of them very vigorously, religiously say, no, APIs should not be copyrightable.  They're just addresses in the address book.  You can't copyright the phone book.  You can't copyright APIs.  Others say, no, it's not the same thing.  It takes work to create an API.  It's code that I've created.  I know we talked about this a little last week, Geeta,  but having had a week of this case banging around in public,  any additional insight into which way you think they might go with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Andy Rubin sent an email in 2006 or something saying,  hey, we should get the license for the Java.Lang APIs.  That seemed pretty damaging, right?  I mean, that's what the other side has been saying,  that every other company has bought the license for these APIs, everybody except Google.  And then Rubin sends this email saying, hey, we should buy this license.  I mean, you know, I'm not a lawyer.  I'm just a developer.  From my point of view, I'm a little bit of a hippie about things.  Everything should just be, you know, a friend.  I don't think everything should be free.  But to me, you know, as a Java developer, these APIs seem so incredibly core to the language.  And because there's so little that you can do with the language without them,  it seems to me to make sense that they would be part, like I take Google's side of it.  But if Rubin sent this email, then he knew that it sounds as if he knew  that they should have bought a license.  So now I think it makes it just makes them look bad to say, oh, you know, we didn't we don't need this license.  This is just part of the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, what kind of scale do you have any idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have any idea how much it would have cost.  I mean, I think we can safely say that Google could afford it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not a lawyer, Gina, and neither is Andy Rubin.  You know, I think it's really interesting that the strategy in the case has been to get all these  non-lawyer engineers to come out and say, you know, to delve into their emails and see, gee, you know,  I guess we need a license. They don't know whether they need a license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not their job to know. Right. I mean, that's a good point.  I mean, there have been plenty of times when I've, you know, I've sent emails in situations at companies  and be like, hey, we need to buy whatever license we need to cover cover our butts with this,  you know, whatever we need, let's get it.  So, I mean, that could have been that could have been I think Andy Rubin probably knows a whole lot more about Java than I do.  But so, yeah, this is interesting. I still agree with Google that it seems APIs are a lot of work to create.  Absolutely. But these core Java.lang APIs are just they're so, you know, they're so absolutely core to the language.  It just I know I have a hard time thinking that there had to be, you know, another purchase.  It's really interesting to hear this conversation still the play out, though, in this trial, you know, even just, you know, making the explanations.  You know, understandable by the by the jury and having all these kind of rock stars and tech, you know, take the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the reasons it's getting so much attention is you're like, oh, look at that.  And Larry Page is on and now Larry Ellison and now it's Eric Schmidt.  It's you know, it's a cavalcade of stars. Yeah.  But but Denise, to your point, I mean, a lot of what they're asking them is, you know, what did you know and when did you know it?  But is that just maneuvering to try to affect the damages?  Because it's not evidence of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does have an impact on on the ultimate liability issue, whether whether they knew that they were infringing.  And yeah, I think it's mostly on the damages like some kind of willful infringement or something like that.  Exactly. OK. But, you know, getting back to the API point, it's just sort of the sequel to when source code became acknowledged as something that was copyrightable.  Which wasn't always universally understood.  So, you know, I think this this just takes another really kind of complicated issue and something that copyright law was never designed to really encompass.  You know, we're talking about creative works.  We're talking about things that you can immediately identify as, you know, a work of literature, a work of music.  I'm sure Gina and other developers probably feel that what they're doing is plenty creative and and a lot of work and involves perhaps expression.  But it's not so straightforward when you start to impose it into the framework of copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also some interesting court documents that are being uncovered.  The Verge has broken a couple of them.  This is something the judge also had indicated at the beginning of the case.  I think he was trying to make one last ditch to get these guys to settle out of court.  He said, look, unless it's the formula for Coke, we're not going to we're not going to make anything confidential.  So what comes out in the case comes out in public.  And a couple of interesting things have come out.  One, the original Google phone was presented in 2006 and there's some mock up presentations.  Remember, this is pre iPhone.  This is pre anybody knowing that Apple was creating an iPhone and they had a basic phone interface.  They wanted the ability to integrate with with like I think they were showing this off to T-Mobile.  But but look at this thing. It's got some weird keyboard down here.  They essentially had a basic requirement of at least two soft buttons, if not a QWERTY keyboard.  They made no indication of moving towards a touch screen at all in any of this.  But it doesn't I don't know. It looks kind of cool.  I'm not sure what that alphabet is on the keyboard down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's fascinating to see this model now that we've moved into this touch screen, full touch screen world.  Like, it's so obvious that the full QWERTY keyboard isn't isn't always a good solution.  This thing is kind of ugly. It's got a lot of buttons.  A lot of blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it does look like a blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that the the basic phone user interfaces and the ability to integrate as a third party are still a barrier.  And they wanted to they wanted to revolutionize phone interfaces, but they aren't the ones who actually really did that eventually.  The other court document that is getting some attention is Google's proposal to subsidize the data plan instead of subsidizing the phone.  In current situation, you go and you pay less for the phone and you sign up for a two year data plan.  Google said we want to we want to turn that on its head.  We want T-Mobile to sell the data plan for our phone for nine ninety nine a month.  This is in 2006, mind you, to reduce the cost.  And the company would then forgo commission it earned from T-Mobile for referring Android buyers to its online store.  So they thought that might balance it out.  T-Mobile, you keep the cash for all the masses we're going to send to you and you reduce the data plan.  It is brilliant. Why don't you think it happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phone companies don't like change.  Yeah, and it's probably because I think it undercuts it undercuts their pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fifteen megabytes per month to that probably that wouldn't have lasted long.  I mean, this was 2006, mind you, but still this is all I want is a smartphone with unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's it. You know, I like, you know, you so few of my minutes.  This would have been awesome. But, you know, think about it.  This is really the Chromebook model, right?  It's like, hey, we're going to give you the computer.  I mean, in this case, sure, it was a small it was a phone.  But a phone at this point is a computer.  We're going to give you a computer. We're going to build in the data plan.  And you pay kind of a low rate just to get on the Internet wherever you are.  I would have loved to see back in 2006.  This would have been amazing.  I mean, even now, just getting a phone.  Can you get a phone with unlimited data only?  Not in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sprint. Well, from Ting.  That's true. That's true.  Ting and Sprint. Sprint has an unlimited data plan.  In fact, Sprint said today that if they get an iPhone on LTE,  they will continue to offer an unlimited data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great. 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sprint also posted horrible losses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like, please don't forget.  Stick around. We offer phones for sale.  Apple, by the way, speaking to Apple, they had their earnings call yesterday,  and there was one of the analysts asked Tim Cook in the question  and answer portion of the earnings call about patent litigation.  It was a veiled question about, you know, the ongoing  troubles between Android and the rest of the world.  Tim Cook told analysts he always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it.  If we could get to some kind of arrangement where we could be assured  that people invent their own stuff, I highly prefer to settle versus battle.  That's a change of tune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little passive aggressive. Maybe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot different than thermonuclear war. Yeah, exactly.  That's what I was thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just aggressive.  Exactly. This at least is passively aggressive.  Yeah, it's, you know, he's offering a bit of an olive branch.  It's it's a backhanded olive branch, I guess.  It depends on how you look at it.  All right. Let's let's move on to Google getting back into the smartphone sales game.  They are going to sell their they are selling the unlocked Galaxy Nexus HSP plus.  So they did finally get a deal  to sell wholesale unlocked phone here in the United States.  Three hundred ninety nine dollars.  Now, granted, this is not an LTE phone.  It's not a WiMAX phone. It's HSP plus.  But that means it'll do pretty good speeds on the T-Mobile network.  You could also use it on AT&T.  It'll do pretty good speeds there as well.  And it's free and clear. You buy it.  It's got ice cream sandwich. It's the reference design.  It's going to get all the updates when Google pushes them out.  This is it.  This seems like what they should have done with the Nexus the first time around.  And then they did that crazy store where they were promising the moon.  And then they ended up having to roll the store back. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. Three ninety nine.  Getting better, getting much better.  What's the unlocked iPhone now is seven hundred.  I mean, six fifty, I think, for the six.  Yeah, I mean, usually you're talking six, seven hundred.  So three ninety nine, four hundred bucks. We're getting there.  Yeah, I mean, this is for someone who travels internationally a lot  and who wants the pure ice cream sandwich, a pure Google experience,  the ice cream sandwich.  This is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could use this on Ting, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think. Can you? No, no, no, no, no, no.  Ting is no sprint.  It's not GSM.  Oh, it's not GSM. You're right.  OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I was mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I think the problem I'm going to bet that Ting can only do a deal with Sprint.  Right. And otherwise, yeah, it's too bad they're not GSM.  I mean, that'll all change at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, when Sprint finally I mean, Sprint has LTE in like  60 locations and by locations, I mean, like 60 towers, most of it's in Kankakee.  But by the end of this year, they actually want to be in seven or eight big cities  and they're going to keep rolling until 2013.  Whether they can get there in time to keep themselves from going bankrupt  is a whole different matter.  But I really like that Google is getting behind this idea of unlocked phones.  You buy the unlocked phone at a reasonable price for unlocked, for sure.  It's not top of the line for data connection,  but it's the it's the Galaxy Nexus, so it's a good phone.  Yeah. And the other interesting thing to this is it's sold through the Google Play Store  in a new area called Devices.  Plurals. Now, are we reading too much into that?  I mean, you wouldn't call it device, I guess.  But everybody's looking at this as as evidence that Google will be selling  a tablet, as Eric Schmidt has promised by the summer and glasses and the glasses.  Right. OK. The self-driving car might show up there someday, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The self-driving car, Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, in fact, Google, this is a story farther down,  but Google has been shopping the self-driving car in Detroit.  Trying to get a partner, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google also upped their cash reward for being hacked.  This is this is a good thing.  They now will pay you up to twenty thousand dollars  if you find a qualifying vulnerability.  The obvious deal here is they want somebody to find it and turn it into them  and get the money so that they can patch the bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twenty thousand dollars. That's a lot of money.  That's a pretty good bounty. Yeah.  I think that's good enough to turn turn the the blackout cracker,  you know, crackers into white hat hackers.  You know, they want to make that. That's a nice payout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there enough of them that you could make a living at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting question.  If you're you'd have to find all of them, though.  In over a year, the just over a year, the program has paid out  four hundred sixty thousand dollars to roughly 200 individuals.  So it sounds like the rate of discovery is not enough to make it your sole day job.  Let's you live in a really cheap area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you could enter into a cooperative. Yes.  If you were sharing in that pool by throwing in more brains  and beating everybody else to the punch, you are winning the lottery  in the sense that you're getting higher odds of actually getting a payout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we should point out that it's not twenty thousand dollars  for every single vulnerability.  There are certain qualifying vulnerabilities that get you that much.  A sequel injection is going to only bring you ten thousand dollars.  XSS, XSRF, other high impact flaws and sensitive applications.  Three thousand dollars. So.  It depends on which bug you find to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what I'm really asking is whether or not.  If they're putting the software out there,  couldn't you outsource even more of your debugging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's great from a recruiting talent point of view,  but from the point of view of the person looking for vulnerabilities,  basically you have two choices.  You can join up with the bad guys and find vulnerabilities  so that you can steal personal information and credit cards  and identity theft and send spam and all that stuff.  Or you can find vulnerabilities and if you make more money doing  finding vulnerabilities or reporting them to Google and getting  getting money from Google and getting the opportunity to work  with Google's internal teams and maybe even getting a job with Google.  You know, if that's a little more attractive, then then that's  you know, that's that's a good thing.  If you have people on the fence that are just like, I know enough about this code  and I just want to find vulnerabilities for fun.  Now, who should I tell about them?  You know, paying offering these kind of bounties is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google's spending a lot of money on other things, too.  Apparently, five point oh three million dollars on lobbying.  What was it that long ago when we were bemoaning the fact  that tech companies just they they aren't represented on the Hill.  They're not up there spending the money.  Five point oh three million dollars, according to The New York Times on Monday.  That's bigger than a lot of tobacco companies.  Yeah. Which I guess they're on the decline in a way, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this may be the time I want to mention something I was at yesterday.  Union Square Ventures in New York held an event called Hacking Society,  an amazing group there, among them,  Yochai Bankler, John Perry Barlow,  Bram Cohen, Wow, great crowd.  Steven Johnson, Larry Lessig, Mike Basnik, Beth Novick, Craig Newmark.  Always good for a punchline.  Tim O'Reilly, Alexis Sohanian,  Yancey Strickler and others.  So it was an amazing group, plus venture capitalist, plus others.  Plus, I managed to sneak in.  And it was about how do we keep going after so many people?  How do we worry about how to hack society  and how to have networks that really turned into how do we protect the Internet?  And there was the only heated moment in there  is when one of the people in the room said that you need to hire your own lobbyists.  You need to buy your own congressman.  And others about puked at that idea.  And there was kind of a view of do we hack around the problem of politics  or do we have to face it head on and do we have to face it head on in politics ways?  So this goes to Google spending this much money on lobbying.  Google is obviously doing it for its own problems and its own PR problems  and its own issues.  But it goes to the larger issue.  And Tim O'Reilly said it very well in the end  that we have to have the narrative of the net.  And that narrative is about numbers and how the net has value to society  and how we quantify that and we catalog that.  And it's about anecdotes and memes of people talking about  how the net has made a difference in their lives.  We've never gotten good at that.  Then once you have that, what do you do with that?  Well, you you want to sell it to the public, but you also need to sell it to Congress.  John Perry Barlow said that or maybe it was somebody else,  maybe said that one of the problems, the sova pipa was that  members of Congress were turning back stories,  anecdotes because they got fed them by the lobbyists from Hollywood.  We didn't we on our side didn't feed them any anecdotes.  And you could argue that that's corrupt lobbying or you can argue  that that's a necessary thing.  And then Yochai Benkler proposed a pledge that politicians should take  before they get our votes and money, which is an Internet freedom pledge.  A very simple thing. Any party.  You don't do it. You don't get the vote.  So it was an interesting group, an interesting discussion.  And I'm not sure it got, you know, to any destinations.  But if Google is spending money on lobbying, yes, they're doing it  for their own purposes. Yes, they have to do that.  But it's also part of a larger question of do we  finally educate Congress?  Do we are we willing to not vote for Al Franken, even though we like him otherwise  because he's defending Hollywood?  These are some of the things we have to start considering as a community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how do we make sure that Google is representing our interests?  You know, if they're going to be outspending everyone else,  they're going to be pursuing Google's interests.  You know, that's fair.  And you may they may be on your side on a lot of issues,  but then again, they may not precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I my example always is I think Google did the right thing finally  in getting out of China.  But then they turned around and did the devil's deal with Verizon  on net neutrality, wired, no net neutrality, wireless Internet  versus Internet. And,  yeah, Google was following its own interests because it got in bed  with Verizon and then it needs to.  And I hope there are a lot of people at Google who hate that, too.  But they crossed a line there.  And no, they are not there to represent our interests.  As much as I'm a certified Google fanboy, they are not the representatives  of Internet Nation. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think the closest that we have, I mean, of all the companies  that are advocating for the open web, don't you feel like Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gets the closest on the power to issue ratio?  They're probably the closest. Yeah.  They have the most. Oh, they absolutely are. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, and part of what was asked for to yesterday was early warning signals,  which, you know, EFF is out there, but EFF was saying that, you know,  we don't know everything that's coming down the pike.  That's the problem. We only know some proportion of it.  Clay Shirky was arguing for an Internet fire brigade  where the people who were masked together against so many people  could be kind of called together again in a true emergency.  It sounds good and Clay's brilliant, but I don't know that that  is going to work practically.  So, yes, Gina, you're right.  The best we have right now is Google and Google.  I've heard this from Eric Schmidt. They don't want to be in that position.  They don't want to be the ambassadors of the Internet.  They don't want to be the governance of the Internet.  They don't want to be the policeman of the Internet. Any of those things.  But right now, if we don't do it, then we're putting them in their position  and we better trust them to do it.  Then we better not complain when  there's no one else fighting for our interests against Verizon  when they end up in bed with Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And frankly, as Google gets larger, it gets harder for them  to be true to their own ideals, much less anybody else's.  Because, yes, you know, because they they they become no longer  Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as much influence as Larry Page has  and as much command as he's taken and focused it.  Google is bigger than than everyone who works there.  They're an effing phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't like phone companies. Right.  There was there was a great moment when I think it was Yancy Strickler said  that, you know, there was the whole day started with the notion of  how do you know a network when you see it?  And somebody said a network is when you say, ah, and and it's not a network  when you say so, you say  Kickstarter, Reddit, Verizon.  And so so what Yancy said was that  a company like his, he believes, tries to educate its its users.  He had educated customers that you want smarter users, that that's  that's the view.  And the clay shirky popped in with a line from I think it was Scott Adams  that as opposed to the confuse op-ole.  And that's our phone companies, our cable companies and companies like that  that try to just confuse the heck out of us.  I just had with me at AT&T.  I have the international AT&T because I go off on it.  I pay one hundred dollars a month for one hundred megs of international data  that I rarely use.  Well, I use it, but I use it so sporadically.  I don't know what I'm going to need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't you don't want to go through the the the the.  Yeah, I went in yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually in one hundred nineteen.  I went in yesterday to change something else and I saw that I could get  two hundred seventy five for one hundred.  Now, why didn't they just change me?  Why have they been ripping me off that level for the same amount of money?  Because that's what we do.  That's how we make money.  It's capitalism. It's free market.  And I would know what capitalism can really be better.  But but so if we're going to think like ecosystems and networks  and we're going to think like the open Internet,  we're going to preserve that open Internet to create this new society.  You know, it all started off to or ended off with somebody from,  I forget where, quoting Joey Ito in the op-ed he did in the New York Times  a while ago, saying starting off with this sentence,  the Internet is a belief system.  And I've argued in the show often that we have to have a discussion of principles.  And that's where the discussion has to start,  not into the weeds of this reg or that reg, this congressperson,  that congressperson, this suit or that cert.  If we don't have a discussion of level principles, we're going to get messed up.  So sorry to go off on this rant.  No, no, it's great.  That's just a play on the terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it ties in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does. It starts with the idea of lobbying and it partially explains  why Google is making this huge effort.  Cash Hill over at Forbes has a great rundown of at least seven big categories  of legislation that begin to explain why Google would be so engaged in Washington.  And I think they've probably reached the conclusion that, you know,  in order to hack Washington, this is what you do.  You send your lobbyists there and it's an education effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, power lies where people believe it lies.  I learned that from Game of Thrones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just shadows on the wall.  Tom, it's just perception.  Exactly. Thank you.  I was going to say, like, the best and worst thing about geeks  is that they look at a crappy system and they just want to, like,  rebuild the entire thing from scratch.  But the reality is that in some situations, you have to work within the crappy system  first before you take the whole thing down.  So that's how I feel about the lobbying.  It's the buyer bill decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It's totally the buyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It totally is.  It's not for real society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, are they buying or building?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was thinking about you often yesterday,  because, you know, I quoted you often on this point that hackers hack around.  And sometimes you can't hack around.  Sometimes you have to face it.  And that's what that was a lot of the divide yesterday.  But it came it was distasteful when when it was David Wolfe  was talking about how you have to hire lobbyists, you have to raise money,  you have to, you know, kind of buy your congressman.  And others. And and and I find it distasteful, too.  But John Perry Barlow said that he used to be, you know, a wholehearted libertarian  and kind of tear it all down.  He said that we need some legacy institutions to continue.  We need to continue smarter.  We can't get rid of them all.  You know, we do need a mix.  And I agree with that.  But we are in the process of reinventing these institutions wholeheartedly.  And, you know, it's a beautiful way to put it.  But it's buyer build and Tom, too, that sometimes you have to rebuild  and you have to disrupt and you have to leave the past.  And I think that's what's happening in the news to a great extent.  But sometimes you can't afford the price of that much disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I'm sorry, I'm laughing at Coyote Brown in the chat room.  He says a Google engineer, a senator and a venture capitalist  each bid a common sellsword to kill the other two who lives, who dies.  Well played.  Real quickly, we got to speak into paying bills.  We got to pay ours in a second.  But I like what you're saying about the the or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when we say I wish I could think who said that.  But it was not my line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. When we say Google, what what's your reaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, there we go again.  I still am in the column.  So there are things they do after all these years.  But I'm still in the column.  Yeah, sure. Given what they did today, what we just announced.  I think there's a lot of I in that.  What about you guys? Denise, what about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they announced today. Google Drive.  Oh, Google Drive. Well, yes, I think there's a lot of I  in in what Google does in general.  I'm in the column to Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You still are. Yeah, I'm still lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still lying. Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'm.  I don't get the leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mostly, mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not in.  So how do we name the show this?  That's going to be Google makes you say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how to spell that.  All right. Speaking of Leo, he's he's got a butt in again  and tell you about another great sponsor that we have for this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Tom. I don't want to horn in, but I'm here from Norway.  Actually, it's amazing.  Looks just like my office talking, talking about Carmonite online backup.  If you heard Steve Gibson, I think he was kind of surprised and security.  Now he did a review of all the cloud backup cloud.  Actually, it wasn't a backup review.  It's about cloud storage, like Dropbox and stuff.  And he said, you know what? Carbonite's actually really good.  I was pretty pleased.  Unlimited backup, $59.  That's less than five bucks a month for everything on your internal hard drive.  Secure, reliable backup for 59 bucks a year.  Carbonite dot com.  Mac or PC. This is great.  Now, if you have a PC and an external drive or multiple PCs,  they've got a solution for that as well.  Just visit carbonite dot com and try it free for two weeks.  If you use the offer code twig, do use the offer code twig for the trial,  because then when you buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.  You'll get two free months.  C.A.R. B.O.N. I.T.E. dot com.  Easy to install, easy to use.  You just set it and forget it.  And it's backing up whenever you're online securely to the cloud.  Steve said it's great cloud storage, but it's also a great backup.  Continuous automatic backup to the Internet.  That's carbonite.  I want you to try it free.  And then you tell me next two weeks.  Use the offer code twig.  And back we go to our roundtable already in progress. Tom.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And come back soon from the cold fjords, please.  Before we get to our tool tip and number, any other stories here we want?  Thank you so much for talking about hacking society, by the way, Jeff.  That was good stuff.  We mentioned the self-driving car with Detroit.  Anything more to mention on that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, one of the things about that one is they say it could also be an aftermarket product.  So, you know, imagine imagine getting your old Volkswagen Beetle  and suddenly it's a self-driving beetle and you can call it.  Oh, now I'm missing the punch line.  What was the name of the car? Herbie Herbie Herbie.  You can get the true Herbie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could I I'd like to Herbie the love bug my my car, please.  I'd like to ask. That's really they said that.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're cool. I'd like to ask the group one question.  Sure. Do you really think there's money to be made in asteroids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Planetary. What is it? Planetary Resources.  Is that the name of that?  We covered this on Tech News today yesterday.  Yeah. Planetary Resources Inc.  Co-founded by Eric Anderson of Space Adventures.  So the guy has done space tourism already.  And Peter Diamandis of the X-Prize Foundation.  So he's figured out how to give people money to start private ventures into space.  I think actually coming up, we've got one of our first trips  to the International Space Station from a private company.  So they want to mine asteroids.  There are nine thousand asteroids that are greater than 150 feet in diameter  near Earth. Some they think could have more platinum  than is mined on Earth in a year. Just on the one asteroid.  The trick is getting your robotic ship to the right asteroid,  mining the platinum, refining it and getting it back down to Earth  without spending six billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a big trick. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to take my only if I can take my space elevator up there.  We'll have green peas for asteroids cropping up as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, actually, actually, counselor,  there was discussion about in some of the stories about the state of space law  and where they claim title to an asteroid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  The one I read, I think, was the Wired ad that said that the nearest  analog is the seabed mining rights in international waters.  Now, I'm pretty sure I don't know, Denise, are you an expert  in international seabed mining law?  Maritime law? Yeah, probably not.  But that's a good analogy.  But but yeah, I mean, how how does that work?  I mean, how how do we come up with law in in space where everyone's  just kind of laughed, you know, for many decades, it was like, well,  that's not even an issue. We don't have to worry about that.  If somebody wants to go and start mining an asteroid,  did they get to just go do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I can't stop thinking about law in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what most of us were thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think  that there has been some interesting stuff around that and different ventures  that have been proposed for going to the moon and doing things.  So I think it's a bridge yet to be crossed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a space bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. I just ask this, who would buy stock in this venture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how much I would totally buy it.  I mean, I can't because I cover it, but but I would.  I absolutely would.  Unless it was really expensive, but just a few shares.  I'm not going to like sink sink my investments in it.  But just to say, like, yeah, I own a little bit of that asteroid mining company.  I mean, that's just a cool factor alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. All right.  Gina? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I get the cool factor.  If I was, you know, truly wanted to to make my do,  I think it's a good investment right at the moment.  There's a lot of unknown.  It's the great unknown. Jeff, this.  And also, how rich am I in this scenario?  You know, I even take even take the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what Tom's made is saying right now.  You will not invest our money in that.  Yeah, not going to happen.  Can I buy some space stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See me, we're right right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's like, we're Lord and Lady just recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. Our friend Terpster in England bought us a Lordship.  So perfect. On a side note.  So we have we have a hall at Wansley Manor.  No, it's not in Heron Hall.  Heron Hall's all melted.  Couldn't buy that place.  I know. Horrible.  I was wondering what kind of gift it was. Yeah.  Yes, we were not gifted to Heron Hall.  Thank goodness.  That's a bad idea.  Game of Thrones reference.  If you don't understand what we're talking about.  Anything else before we move on that you guys want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got a lot of real quick.  All right. One more.  So did when Microsoft resold  Microsoft bought patents from a well for.  Right. Yeah. Yeah.  We sold a bunch to Facebook for five hundred fifty million.  And they both get to use both of them.  Because AOL would not allow group bids.  Was that screwing AOL or.  Because it competes with Facebook,  but didn't compete with Microsoft or.  Now, that's the way it goes. It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a that's a you know, it's an interesting question.  I mean, and there's the other side of this is Facebook is going to use it  to go after Yahoo, who is a partner with Microsoft.  So Microsoft just armed Facebook against Yahoo.  And what a tangled web we've we've they messaged Yahoo and AOL.  It's like pre-World War One Europe. Yeah.  I know. I you know, I I think AOL probably doesn't care.  They didn't want people grouping up to bid.  I don't know for what reason.  Why wouldn't they want them to group up to bid?  Wouldn't that mean bigger bids because people could pool their money together?  I would think so.  So I guess I guess they wanted to keep it out of the hands of competitors.  But Microsoft figured out a way around it.  They're like, well, once we own it, we can sell to whoever we want.  We're going to sell some to Facebook.  But obviously, Microsoft to Facebook planned it that way because it was on a dime.  As soon as Microsoft got the patents from AOL,  they took a bunch of them and licensed them and sold a bunch of them to Facebook.  And now Yahoo's calling them up about the big deal.  Like, wait a minute, what are you doing?  But everybody is mad at Yahoo for the patent lawsuit against Facebook.  So I think Microsoft is probably a little pretty safe.  Like, look, Yahoo, nobody's on your side in this one, even us.  So let it go. All right. Thank you.  All right. Let's get to Gina's tip.  What do you got for us this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually just a Google Drive related tip  that we talked about a little bit earlier.  There are apps, as we talked about, that you can install to access Google Drive.  But it's not really easy to see where you can install them.  Once you do have Drive and it's enabled, it will it will replace Docs.  And Docs now Drive has that big red create button.  When you click on the create button, there's a more link.  And then there's a link to get more apps.  And that will lead you to the Chrome Web Store, which has all the apps,  the Chrome apps that save to Google Drive.  From there, you can see some of the apps that we talked about earlier.  We video and Mindmeister and Aviary, which is an image editing app.  And so you can install any one of those apps  and then you can save files back to your drive from it.  That was kind of my just tip for installing apps that access Google Drive.  My second tip is if you're really worried about privacy  and you want to keep it, you want to encrypt your files before you put them anywhere.  If you're really worried about someone opening up or Google  or anyone being able to see your files, just encrypt them before you transfer them.  I use a open source open source product called True Crypt,  which works across platform encrypts anything before you upload it  to a cloud service provider if you're really, really, really worried about privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a that's actually a very responsible thing  that you should consider doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I had I had a tax accountant come to me and say, you know, I've got all my clients  returns with their Social Security numbers and their financial histories.  And, you know, I feel a little wary about storing them in, you know,  some cloud service provider.  And I said, yes, that you should feel wary.  Just, you know, encrypt those and save them in an encrypted volume  before you upload them.  So at least you have that extra level of protections, your clients data.  It's personal private data.  You don't you don't want you don't want to go anywhere.  You know, be transferring in the clear or anything like that.  Not a lot of us are dealing with, you know, the Social Security numbers of our clients.  But if there is something you're really worried about, you can either plenty  of tools out there that will help you encrypt things.  I think there's an Apple script that's going around as well  that on the Mac will automatically encrypt files that you drop into a folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shouldn't you encrypt them on your hard drive anyway, in case your machine gets stolen  and you're liable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there's that right. Exactly. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you should use TrueCrypt to create the hidden volume  so that when you're at customs and they ask you to type in your TrueCrypt password,  you can type in a password, but it gives them an empty volume of the operating system.  Oh, that's why I like to do sneaky stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I also like like the name because it sounds like an FX series.

Transcript:  True coming to coming to FX only from the minds of the FX.  TrueCrypt.  Denise, do you have anything in that?  I don't know if we asked you for anything ahead of time.  I don't mean to put you on the spot, but if you've got a tip  or a tool or anything like that, you want to pass along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just kind of a follow on to Jeff's discussion of Hacking Society.  There was a great program at the Brooklyn Law, Incubator  and Policy Clinic that was kind of in the same vein.  They had a legal hackathon last weekend.  I don't know if you know these guys, Jeff, but Jonathan Askin over there.  Jonathan is just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He helps my art for rural students in incredible ways.  He is just wonderful. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just a shout out to them and great job at having a legal hackathon.  One of the things they did was try and hack together  something that was better than SOPA and PIPA.  And I actually have a few submissions from that hackathon  that I need to go through and judge that I haven't done so yet.  So I just like the idea.  I encourage more law schools to follow their lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool. Very great.  All right. Mr. Jarvis, you have a number for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's what we know, but I love Henry Blodgett on Business Insider  takes the obnoxious story that should be on one page  and making it into a 20 page slideshow to its extremes.  But sometimes it's fun to watch him get himself in a lather.  So he did one on Apple's results that said that Apple went from a 100 million  in five years, went from zero to 100 million as iPhones alone.  Say that again.  The iPhone business alone went from zero to 100 million in five years.  Wow. Wait, there's more.  Apple generates seven million dollars in cash per hour.  But that's not all.  It has 100 billion dollars in cash, which is make the 37th  largest country's economy.  But wait, there's even more call now.  We're going to tell you that Apple's profit was bigger than Google's revenue,  which is Apple's profit was bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep that in mind. Revenue is everything.  Profits, revenue minus costs.  Roughly speaking. Uncompeavable.  Oh, snap. They are cheap at Apple.  They don't spend money on anything.  That's crazy.  Numbers, I should have said. Numbers.  Do I also do you do C.O.D. or  if I use my credit card, do I get a bonus?  All right. I've got a tool.  Actually, I'm prepared this time.  I do this week at Google two weeks in a row.  I end up being prepared.  I have a tool that I just installed this past week.  I use SimpleNote to manage my to do list.  Actually, it's a hack together system of my own.  But all I have is I have a next actions, a waiting  and a projects list in SimpleNote that I can access in the cloud  on any of my devices for my Mac laptop.  I use notational velocity, but I've been looking for a better solution  for my Windows desktop.  And I ran across a Chrome extension, which actually works on OS 10  Chrome called Syncpad for SimpleNote.  And I was OK, I'll just I'll just use I'll just use this on Windows.  But I think I may end up using it on OS 10 as well.  It installs this little notepad icon up in the upper right.  Of your of your your Chrome browser.  And then when you drop it down, it just gives you all of your SimpleNotes.  So you know, opens up, you can edit them.  You can you can say, you know,  remember to tweet about twig.  And and there it goes.  Now it's synced to it's synced to my phone, it's synced to my tablet,  it's synced to my Windows desktop.  And and then when I'm done, I just pop it away.  It's great. Very nice.

Transcript:  You live in the Vita text file, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, right.  I pretty much hacked together something like that.  I and it just it's so easy.  It just works for me to do it that way.
