Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Canuckistan.  Canuckistan. Did you have a lovely holiday break?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was great. Yeah. I'm currently working on losing all the pounds I gained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me too. Did it snow? Did you get a white Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did. Actually, we were even further north at a friend's farm.  There was probably a foot and a half of fresh snow. It was quite, it was beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No snow for New York, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, then I went to Florida to see my folks.  Definitely no snow there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I foolishly for the week after Christmas went to Rhode Island province.  How was it?  Well, unfortunately, my mom's there. So that made it worthwhile. It was great to see her and my sister.  But there's no, there was no either snow nor heat nor warmth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no palm trees.  I was thinking you took a poor child into the cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. Michael went with us. He kicked out screaming. He's 14. Never had been to New England.  Said, what am I going to see? What's there?  Fortunately, the hotel was connected via tunnel to a buster in Dave and Buster's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it all worked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perfect.  Yeah, all worked out very nicely.  We also, we went up to Boston for a day. I love Boston. It was, it's always fun to go to Boston.  We visited the Boston Common, the frozen tundra, the squirrels just as aggressive as ever.  The public garden, Fanoil Hall. How do you pronounce that? Fanoil? Faneal? Faneal? I should ask a Bostonian.  Good question.  Yeah. Spelled F-A-N-E-I-U-L or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's probably funnel.  Funnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably pronounced cappac. Cappac Hall.  And saw the Old North Church and went to the Boston Museum of Science, which is still the best science museum in the world.  I haven't been there.  It's the original. It really is awfully good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ran around Harvard trying to figure out which room was Mark Zuckerberg's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, what did Mark Zuckerberg do for Christmas?  He found God.  He probably learned a new language or something.  Yeah. Well, he did. He found God. He's no longer an atheist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But he wasn't, he was kind of coy about what exactly he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he was not, he was, yeah, he was, I guess, I don't know, did he actually find God or did he switch to, it was switched from, it's complicated to agnostic, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he suggested he believes there's some sort of higher power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy Christmas and happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas from Priscilla Mark Beast, his dog and me, to which one user replied, that was his Facebook post.  Aren't you an atheist? No, Zuckerberg responded.  I was raised Jewish. And then I went through a period when I questioned things.  But now I believe, oh, boy, this is fudge words. Religion is very important.  Yeah.  I don't think that's what they mean, Mark, when they say I believe, I believe religion is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he believes in all religions, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my religion. I went back to visit the church that I went to as a child, the First Unitarian Church of Providence, Rhode Island, where I was taught.  Yeah, yours is a...  Worship the God of your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah. It's not even a church really, it's more of a club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a club. And mostly Jewish, actually, which is very weird.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you can actually be Jewish and believe in other sort of faith-based things.  Yeah. Fair enough. Mark, that's what Mark means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also announced that his project for 2017 is to talk to people in every state, all 50 states.  Yeah.  How is he... has he got a plan for that? How is he going to do that? Is he going to do town halls?  He's going to travel by blimp, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, by drone.  Just touch down, touch down.  What's the name of their drone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Akilah.  Akilah, I can drop you in there.  Or Akilah, depending on your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you buy... so this leads to speculation that he's going to run for president. Do you buy that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. That's why I understand the speculation. And I think he's going from denying that he's a media platform to saying, actually, I want to run for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and he did the whole structure of what came out in that lawsuit over the share restructuring was that he specifically wanted to leave the door open to potentially running for office or getting involved in government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding. That was given as a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if he goes to work for government, yes, he can...  Goes to work for government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a clause that allows him to retain ownership even if he goes to... and I think Mark Andreessen was saying that's not going to fly with the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The board? What about the emoluments clause of the Constitution? Forget the board.  Oh, wait a minute. That's out the window. That's out the window. I'm sorry. I forgot.  Actually, it makes sense because I think you can make a very strong case that President-elect Trump won the election by being very adept in his use of Facebook and Twitter.  More Twitter.  Twitter.  No, Twitter. Okay, so I've been thinking about this. Twitter for sure because it allows him to speak directly to the people much like those rallies where he's un-intermediated by media, which of course is the goal of every politician. Get the media out of this interpreting what I'm saying.  I want to talk to the people directly. FDR started it with fireside chats, right? As soon as there was mass media, presidents and politicians have tried to go direct to the electorate.  Radio.  I can't really say that's a bad thing. He's used Twitter really to great effect that way. But I'm saying that it was the strategy and probably really the strategy of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to use Facebook very efficiently and very effectively to both...  In terms of the advertising, yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's just that targeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And suppress. Because they bought ads that would encourage people who would vote for Trump to vote for Trump, but they also, we understand, bought ads to encourage others to sit by the wayside. Don't vote.  No, that was smart.  Very smart. And they used Cambridge Analytica to target super precisely.  I was talking to an old friend in radio this morning, and he said, Leo, I'm glad both of us are at the end of our careers because, frankly, mainstream media cannot compete.  And this is, by the way, why you're seeing such huge profits for Google and Facebook. Mainstream media cannot compete in the ads it offers with these highly targeted, really powerful medium of the Internet, of a particular Facebook and Google.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. I just wrote about it today. Their control over 85, 90 percent at least of the growth in digital advertising went to those two companies.  So that leaves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they offer better services. They offer more effectiveness. They offer more value. Did you see big half news for Medium? It looks like Ed is basically giving up on advertising.  It sounds like it.  Why?  Down to the bottom of the other.  And letting go a third of its staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's saying we're not going to do advertising. What are we? He's pivoting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A third of the staff. So everything to do with advertising, it sounds like, is gone. And he's going to try and compensate writers and publishers based on value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fifty jobs, mostly in sales, support and other business functions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's closing New York. He's closing Washington.  And Washington.  And he's saying that advertising is responsible for various ills in society.  And it's not working in media. We need a new model.  But then he doesn't say what the model. So keep on going down. We're building this new model. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Further reflection. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We decided to need a different, bolder approach. Blah, blah, blah, blah.  It is too soon to say exactly what this will look like.  This strategy is more focused, but less proven. It will require time to get it right as well as some different skills. That's all he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And he says that. So in the paragraph above that, it says writers and creators should be rewarded based on the value they're creating.  But it's not clear how that value is going to be measured. Is it going to be measured on time spent?  How do you measure the value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In psychic dollars? In heaven? In frequent flyer miles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you're not monetizing... Well, this sounds more like a philosophical decision on Ev's part than a business decision.  Because the moral you could take away from you, and this is your article, Matt, in Fortune, how Google and Facebook have taken over the digital additive industry,  which is clearly the case, the moral you could take away from that if you're Ev is, well, that's where I need to go because I could gather that same information about my readers and offer the same kind of granular advertising that Facebook is.  So he's decided from a purely philosophical point of view, he doesn't want to go down that road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think he also, he made it clear it's not working. That's the incentive I got.  He hasn't gone all in and rough. Yeah, yeah, it's not working.  Well, they tried. They've tried a number. They've tried native. They've tried sponsored content. They've tried. They did a deal with BMW for vertical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, all of that's wrong. That's all wrong. And that's not what Facebook does.  No, no, it's not.  It's all old school, even native, which feels like the new thing, which is not, of course, is all old school mass advertising.  Right.  And where Facebook and Google are winning, and I would guess this is what you talk about in your article, where is by highly targeted advertising.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean.  Right. They understand their users in a way that most media companies do not and probably never will.  And there's a corollary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And especially at scale.  There's a corollary to that because the advertisers and the businesses who are going to succeed are the people who understand that.  This was I was talking about this morning.  So with Bill Handel, who's the morning host at KFI, is that you can't you can't compete.  I mean, I guess Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble will still spend ad dollars on branding.  What do you think?  Sure. Sure. They will. I mean, I think those types of advertising.  Would your ad dollars be more efficient even for branding ads where all you're trying to do is get the brand name out there?  If you did it in a more targeted way, look at the kinds of things Trump did, for instance, using Cambridge Analytica.  And I've mentioned this before is it wasn't merely, oh, let's see who's going to vote for Trump based on gun control and do a pro-gun ad.  It wasn't even that broad a brush.  It was let's OK, we're going to do an ad that says Trump favors the Second Amendment.  But what we're going to do is those ads will be further tailored depending on the target audience.  So if you are if you believe that you need guns because you fear government or crime, you would have an ad that highlights crime or an ad that highlights government.  If you want to have guns because you're a hunter, you'd have an.  So you target if you even to emotion, if you're a happy-go-lucky type, you have an ad that targets a hunter who's happy-go-lucky and then a different ad that targets a hunter who's depressed.  Yeah.  And that kind of granularity, even for Coca-Cola, I would think would be more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although it's interesting that not that long ago, Procter & Gamble said that it was.  It sort of couched it in vague terms, but it sounded like they were not as enthusiastic about the sort of targeted approach for all things that not that they were shrinking their Facebook budget,  but that it was probably not going to grow by as much as they had said earlier.  A number of brands abandoned Facebook, didn't they?  And in effect, they said targeting works for certain things, but we do lots of other things that targeting doesn't work.  So it could be that their own business is evolving and they have to figure out how to wrong or they think.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they like media are addicted to something from the past.  The bottom bottom line, Leo.  Well, the Internet killed his mass media business model and thus mass media precisely.  And and we and it affects us not just on the outside, it affects us in our product side.  What we are, we're still putting out mass products, right?  You know, we're not look at the election, not just in Cambridge Analytica, but look at it in terms of memes and things that people passed around.  We just can't think, get our heads around thinking that way in media.  And it's a it's a it's insoluble if we still stick to the ways we used to do things.  But it's even more than this.  I want to bounce this off you guys.  So I've been thinking partly out of the fake news, ha ha.  But I've been thinking too about this idea that that all of journalism's tools are reductive.  Right. We reduce complexity to a simple narrative with a story arc.  We reduce things to a opinion poll where the where the pollster chooses the agenda to a data visualization, to fact checking.  In fact, of course, the world is far more complex than that.  And Google and Facebook and this whole fake news thing are being shoved into media as metaphors.  You know, you have to do fact checking and you have to get rid of fake news.  You have to do this and do that.  And Google and Facebook, for their part, say, oh, we just reflect the world.  We don't make it right.  When you type in Jews are in the search bar, it comes up with awful stuff.  That's because there's awful people out there doing stuff.  And sorry, that's not our fault.  They can't say that anymore because it's the world is being warped to exploit them.  Right. It's always happened to us in media with PR, but it's being warped to exploit the algorithms of Google and Facebook.  So my argument is finally that Google and Facebook have to have the capability to draw far more complex maps of the world and controversies  and understanding where things are going on and where they are.  I'll bet the alt right fault fight that got Trump elected was actually started with maybe 100 people.  It's probably very small and it got reflected and amplified by media and then by social media and then by by by purchase of things you just talked about.  And I think what we have to do in both media and the platforms is is be able to reflect and understand and analyze through new tools,  through artificial intelligence and learning systems, a far more complex picture than we ever could do in the past.  So it goes to advertising. Everything you've just said that also plays back to the content itself.  Why should I read the same newspaper you read? We're different people.  You didn't like La La Land. You have that capability at this point of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I also wonder whether there were some there were some social benefits you could argue to mass media.  There were social benefits to have a common conversation, right?  Common conversation, shared experience, etc.  But what happens when when everyone's having their own conversation?  We had it before television killed the third and fourth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know we did. Papers and towns, right? I know we did.  We had that. We're talking about it. And it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got there. We're talking about expanding that by orders of magnitude.  We're talking about having micro conversations about micro issues with everyone else who already agrees with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where it gets scary to me is tribalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we've seen that. That's exactly what happened during the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tribes can be good in bed. Sebastian Jürger has a book called Tribes Out in which he argues that there are benefits to tribes.  That goes back to the beginning of America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Historic. No, it goes back to the beginning of human beings.  Exactly.  Evolutionary. There's an evolutionary benefit to tribalism. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in the right tribe, there's a benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but if you're competing, if all tribes are competing, settlers, white people, settlers from Europe were, you know,  taken hostage, taken prisoner by Native American tribes and then so-called rescued back and they couldn't stand it.  They went back to the tribes.  Tribalism done well is a powerful force for good. Tribalism done badly is a mob.  It's an evolutionary force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you get the good and the bad.  So we saw tribes voting for Trump based on lies, based on things he said that simply weren't true.  So that's a problem, I think.  And if we're, if they're being served by media and by technology that confirms their assumptions,  even if they're based on inaccuracies or things that just simply aren't true, then how does that benefit anyone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's media's fault. We're not doing a good job.  It's Facebook's fault.  I argue constantly that we in liberal media, and I'm liberal and I'm media, abandoned the right half of America.  Ever since Watergate, conservatives have not trusted media and we have not served them.  And we left a vacuum that was filled in by the likes of Fox News and Breitbart.  And before you go tweeting and emailing me, I'm being sympathetic and empathetic to saying that, yes,  liberal media has ill-served conservative America.  And that's why we're in this boat.  And we should be investing in conservative media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've evolved a little bit past this narrative because I think that the narrative, while true,  it doesn't grasp the real shift that's happening.  Go ahead, Matthew, and I'll talk about what I'm saying.  No, no, you go ahead.  Because, okay, so I've been rereading Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States,  which is really a great book to read, if only because it's a knock in the head.  It's like when you look at the map of the world and you turn it upside down and say there isn't really an up and down.  As you know, it's just Eurocentric that we see us in the middle in Australia.  It could be the other way around because it's a globe.  So his book is very much like that.  It kind of reassesses American history in the light of a kind of a more Marxist, frankly, point of view,  which is a way that I've started to be thinking about what's been happening in our society,  not just in the U.S., but globally in the last few years.  And so I guess what I'm thinking is and what his kind of thesis is that the coalitions,  these kind of common conversations that we talked about, these coalitions are really themselves phony.  They're created for a variety of reasons.  He says the founding fathers, for instance, were basically landholders.  They were wealthy.  George Washington was the wealthiest man in the country who decided that it was that their real threat to them was Indians,  slaves and indentured white servants.  A revolt by them would have overpowered them.  They wanted to consolidate their control.  And the best way to control it was to create patriotism and to and to find a new enemy, a common enemy, Britain,  and distract them because there were a number of revolts, popular revolts prior to the revolution that really threatened these landholders.  And which is a very interesting recontextualization.  I'm not saying it's true or false, but it but it's an interesting recontextualization.  And in that light, what we kind of honor as this national conversation and our vision of what democracy.  I won't just say America, you're from Canada.  It's the same vision.  This kind of liberal vision is really a historic and it really isn't a common point.  Do you believe in the nation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you believe is the nation a necessary institution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His point is the nation was a creation of an upper class.  The middle class itself was a creation of an upper class.  The notion that you could rise to the upper class was creation to preserve civilization so that they could continue to to amass fortunes.  And in that light, if you think about it in that way, that's the you're holding up on a book, the institutional revolution.  I'll talk about that in the best way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best way to bring your tribe together is to find an enemy to attack a common enemy, which is exactly what happened in this election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And one if if one is in a tribe, one might want to consider whether that common enemy is who's that who's benefiting from that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also I think we've seen abundant evidence that in those types of situations where the tribe is united against a common enemy with a vision of whatever their good might be.  Truth takes a backseat.  It literally does not matter.  And unfortunately, we have engines like Facebook that are machines for confirmation bias that effectively encourage you to share things that fit your worldview, regardless of whether they're true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That they're trying to adapt that.  That's not Facebook's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not saying they're doing it.  I think Facebook's reflecting society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The problem with lies is the liars.  And we're concentrating on the wrong end of this.  We're concentrating on on on on Facebook.  So the reason I held up the revolution is an academic book.  But but it's really influential in my thinking because it's an it's an economic analysis of obsolete institutions like dueling and the aristocracy and other things.  And what he argued was there were there were there were institutions that were established to guarantee trust because there weren't measurements necessary to be able to measure performance.  I won't go through the whole description.  But but you you you had the aristocracy because that was the way the king guaranteed that you were one of his people.  And because you couldn't communicate with him and you couldn't measure his performance and you didn't know where the admiral was on the ship because you couldn't measure the latitude and longitude and so on.  Right. So that's his argument.  He says when those measurements came along, they replaced those institutions.  The institutions became obsolete.  I think we have new measurements.  That is to say we move past measurement in society now where you can listen to people.  You can speak.  You can listen.  You can find other people.  You can act together.  You can form new tribes together and act as these tribes in ways that you can.  Not do before before you were stuck on the tribe you were born in.  Yes.  Now you can form tribes wherever those tribes can be for good or bad.  Tribe used to be geography.  They don't be geography at all.  Used to be geography.  It's not any use for geography.  But now what it also means is the institutions that rest a higher order of society, whether that's media and journalism or government or politics, education, they have to readjust themselves.  They become obsolete now because we're based on old opinion polls that said we're all red or we're all blue.  No, no, no.  We're far more complex than that.  And if you're Cambridge Analytical, you're coming along and you are going to every tribe you can imagine and you're exploiting that.  Meanwhile, the counterbalance to that, which would be journalism and media or responsible political parties or government, they just they they're they're they're a century behind.  This is classic twig going off absolutely nowhere in your technology.  Someone in the chat room said politics got into my tech show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not.  It's not.  No, this is not politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes where we're going back to a new world of media that is powered by Google and Facebook.  What we're talking about is the impact of those two mighty companies on on a nation state, on the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think this is a fundamental like what we're seeing, what we saw during the election, what we're seeing in all kinds of ways, whether it's fake news or is is just the disintermediation of of traditional gatekeepers.  And there are all kinds of implications to the fact that the media is not going to be able to do that.  And there are all kinds of implications to that.  I think I said at one point, you know, when I was cheering for the disintermediation, I thought that was a good idea at the time.  Right. Well, and I was only looking at the good aspects.  Right. I was only looking at people's ability to choose and to to produce news themselves and the democratization, which is great.  But we all know that there are downsides to democratization.  You see them all the time and we're seeing them now.  We're seeing the the sort of dark side of that disintermediation as well.  I think I just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't have a conclusion about it, but I'm really fascinated in the way the president elect continues to use Twitter to not.  Not it's it's it's much more masterful than mere disintermediation,  but uses his Twitter account to set the daily press agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Look at the look at the ethics thing where I believe that media have missed the story that in fact, there was an immediate uprising of people phoning their representatives.  There was representatives already retreating.  But as soon as they came into it, boom, he gets all the credit, all the attention, everything else.  He is setting the agenda for media in ways exactly what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what and what do you do?  The New York Times and The Washington Post run a headline saying this happened because Trump tweeted.  I mean, that's not even if they go into the details in the story.  Eighty percent of the headlines read those details.  Right. And he's getting the headlines he wants, even if what he says is not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a long time, I've I've said, oh, you know, the media should stop paying attention to Twitter storms.  They seem to me to pay an inordinate amount of attention to to Twitter storms.  Well, you know, when Steve Martin had to pull down his tweet honoring Carrie Fisher, you know, what happened?  You know, 50 people on Twitter complain.  And suddenly that became a story.  And I said, you got to ignore what people say on Twitter.  It's not of weight.  But when the president elect says something on Twitter, it does have some weight.  Now, I noticed that a lot of executives, most of the executives have quit Twitter.  I mean, literally have left the executive team.  That's interesting. Evaporating at Twitter.  Yeah. And I'm wondering why that is.  Do they because Twitter for Donald Trump alone, Twitter has suddenly become.  I mean, this is as important as the New York Times.  This is where you find out what the president's thinking every minute.  So if Twitter went out of business tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, just suddenly. Oops.  Oops. We never figured out. Sorry.  Right. Well, that's the question.  What impact would that have on politics in America today?  Facebook doesn't have the same.  That doesn't speak to everybody at once.  OK, that's well, but Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Facebook is where it's what real people use and Twitter is what the media uses.  And so Trump knows that all he has to do is fire off a tweet at three o'clock in the morning and journalists will run after it.  And they have to, by the way. They can't ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can ignore Twitter storms about Steve Martin, but you can't ignore it.  But if the president elect tweets something. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And certainly when he's president, you will have to.  But I think it's all in how you describe it.  You can't just have a story saying Trump tweeted X or put in the headline.  You know, Trump says millions of people voted illegally.  That's why I was so upset when Gerard Baker at the Wall Street Journal said that he wants to be very careful about.  Well, if he repeats it multiple times after it's been proven not to be true, that's a lie.  Bingo, Matthew. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an easy test.  If with knowledge, whether or not with malice, with knowledge, you repeat something that is going to be wrong.  That's a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So either he's doing it.  He can't lose because he's going to get people talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't. You call it a lie. It doesn't matter.  It's the we had it was a great conversation with Tim.  Well, I keep talking about it, but he's talking about the attention merchants, his new book.  He says there are three rules, but rule number one is get the attention.  There's no such thing as bad publicity.  Get the attention. Right. Right.  And this is there.  It's as if this was invented for Donald Trump.  And it's in a way amazing that no one came upon this idea sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could argue he was he was he was sort of bred in the reality TV tank in a way as as a creature born for for this moment.  He was made for this. Yeah. Yeah.  So he was made for this. My question is.  It keeps reminding me of Bane.  You know, you you think you've discovered the darkness.  You know, I lived in the darkness like he that's that's Trump.  Like he social media basically gave birth to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so so Jerry Baker from the journal just today wrote a editorial defending his view about lies.  Yeah, I don't pay for the journal, so I can't read it.  But I do. I'll pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is it that is it that a lie say calls me a lie is a kind of a pejorative word.  He's saying it is you have to know the intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. He's saying you have to assume intent.  Saying lie assumes intent.  And and all I'm saying is if Trump repeats the same thing about Muslims in 9 11 or millions of people voting illegally after Obama's first wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really admire and I'm amazed and I kind of admire Trump's willingness to just say something that's blatantly nonfactual.  He must know it's blatantly nonfactual or not.  Of course, you know. OK, so I see.  I can't decide if he's brilliant or an idiot or a brilliant idiot.  I don't know if he's if he's Peter Sellers from being there.  Right, right. Or Machiavelli, some brilliant mastermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that is the key question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I think he's sort of halfway in.  I think so. I think he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no question he's brilliant.  There's no question he's brilliant.  Rosen's pieces, by the way, we'll talk about those in a second.  There's no question he's brilliantly using misdirection, propaganda, outright lies and half truths to shape something.  And I mean, it looks brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is brilliant. And yet it's not it's not.  I think he's sort of a lot of it is he kind of wings it.  He's got exactly instinct.  He knows that the press likes a good headline and he knows that people like a circus.  And he knows that saying something untrue has literally no downside.  So the press is bait for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's he's exactly what the press loves because Twitter was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and Twitter was made for him. But look, and this is a clickbait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a clickbait factory. Yeah. Right.  So so all the things that we've talked about related to ad tech and Google and Facebook and sort of the changing of the media, the structure of the media.  That's why I said when in an earlier post that he took advantage of effectively a broken media landscape and his strategy plays into that perfectly, because he knows that regardless of what he says, a thousand articles are going to be written about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, we're going to see after January 20th, this all lends itself very well to a campaign.  It does it lend itself well to governing is another matter.  There's no rules anymore.  But there's no no not effective governing, but if you want to cause a storm, if you think governing is consensus building and no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you think governing is getting a lot of headlines.  All you have to do is tweet about this is leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is tearing down institutions this goes back to the institutional revolution, but maybe we really tear down institutions they're failing us in so many ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's start a nuclear arms race like literally that's a tweet.  So then is that governing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Anyway, just to finish my thought, then we'll get to Jay Rosen.  Twitter leadership team, Adam Baines, CEO gone.  Katie Jacobs, Stanton VP Global Media gone.  Adam Messenger, CTO gone.  Alex Red whatever is ready.  Senior Vice President Engineering gone.  Brian Skipper VP Human Resources gone.  Look at that.  This is a tweet from Seth Figerman.  Twitter's 2016 in a nutshell.  All but three of their executive team gone.  Why are people leaving?  This is Twitter's golden age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not if you're an executive, it isn't.  I mean, if any of those people had options and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cash in.  You think it's purely financial?  There's no point staying.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of these people say I don't want to.  I don't want to assist.  I don't want to be a codependent on Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to provide him with a platform.  Oh, it's a Rockettes problem.  It's the Rockettes problem.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's probably the two combined, right?  I'm going to cash in.  And by the way, I don't want to watch this happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think it's probably been torture.  I mean, just even the last year,  a bunch of it has been consolidation of power, I think, under Anthony Nodo.  At least that's my impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the current CFO.  But he'll be running everything, right?  Pretty much running everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he isn't running, Jack runs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As well as running a completely different company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This year, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve VP level and higher people departing.  That's all.  Well, a lot of this wasn't sold, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Evan Company, by all rumors, wanted it sold.  These guys wanted to be able to cash out that way.  Well, if that doesn't happen, they say, well, that's why I was sticking around.  OK, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's always been two different things, Twitter the service and Twitter the company.  Yes.  And Twitter the service, you could argue, is amazing and incredible and has all sorts of positive things.  And Twitter the company has been a train wreck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Jay Rosen, who's your counterpart, Jeff, at NYU.  He's much smarter than I am.  I put you guys on the equal pedestal.  But tell him you said that.  Yeah.  He knows.  He knows.  I think that he writes at Pressthink.org and did a two parter on the prospects for the American press in this new era in the age of Trump, as he calls it.  It's a it's a very long two parter with many, many suggestions.  First, he says what the problem is going to be, and then he suggests how the press can handle this, saying that there's no single solution, that he doesn't have a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's here's what he's 39 steps.  Yeah, we're not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so 17 paragraphs in part one in which he says, winter is coming.  How bad is it?  Bad.  I will explain why.  Any bright signs?  A few.  And then in part two, he writes, this is book length practically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's it's an excellent, excellent piece.  And as a result, he appeared on a couple shows around the MSNBC.  And yeah, well, I left a comment just saying that I think that that this goes to your question before.  Is he is he a genius?  Is he a chance?  The garner?  I think that we in press have to have we have to test hypotheses.  Is he in it for the money?  Is he in someone's pocket?  Is he ready to kill institutions?  Is he insane, which is one of them?  Is he just right?  And half America loves it.  You know, each of these is a hypothesis that you have to test in terms of because we can't understand why all the rules are broken.  None of the old rules work.  Jay's response to me was you assume Jarvis that people are willing to throw out the way they they have been covering this.  And I said, well, I hope there and he's not so optimistic.  Yeah, I think that's that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I don't think you can take a media that that enjoys a horse race, you know, and and sort of click revenue the way the way the current media does and suddenly turn it into one that can challenge a president like Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, especially when you have a media that's economically challenged as it is.  Right.  The economic pressures are just going to simply drive.  You know, I mean, as Les Moonves says, all this is very good for the bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's terrible for the nation, but it's great for CBS.  And if you if you work at a media company, you have to think, yeah, we would love to take some time and dig into Trump's background.  But we have to publish 45 stories a day that are 200 words long with a video clip in them or we don't make any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's part of me is actually enjoying this.  I have to remind myself that there are a lot of people who will suffer.  That it's terrible.  But it's it's it is in a way the endgame of something that we've been chronicling for the last 20 years, which is the complete disruption of society by technology.  And it's accelerating.  We haven't even started to see the acceleration of automation and artificial intelligence, although we're starting to see the fault lines form.  There's a company, an insurance company, I think was in China.  Where was it? Or Japan?  Pardon me, Japan that's replacing several dozen of its employees with IBM's Watson.  Yeah, to do their insurance actuarial stuff and so forth.  You see Foxconn saying the company that makes the iPhone, among many other products, saying our endgame is to have no human employees but robots.  They fired 30,000 employees and replaced them with robots.  And this is 30,000.  That was a few months ago.  They are even contemplating building factories in the United States.  I'm sure they're they're assessing a future where there are high tariffs as there are in Brazil, for instance, very expensive to bring a cup or in India to bring phones in from another country.  So Foxconn built a Brazil plant and is building an India plant so they can make them there.  But they'll be robotic plants.  Because they don't.  So it's a very interesting.  Not only has the last 20 years been total disruption and now we're seeing the disruption of media, the disruption of politics, but we're about to see a huge disruption in the economy as a result as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the kind of people who did vote for the jobs that will disappear are the ones that were crucial.  When every truck driver, cab driver in this country is threatened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, long haul truck driver, cab driver, cashier.  You know all the jobs that you could get with sort of a high school diploma and not a lot of skills.  What happens to those people?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I talked to my kids who are in their early 20s and Michael's 14 and Michael's friends.  And I talked to them often about how to, you know, how to kind of navigate this because those jobs that you are preparing for today may not exist tomorrow.  Even if you're going to college.  And that's the thing.  I think a lot of people think, oh, I know I'm going for a profession.  I'm going to college.  I'll be protected.  They're going to have their comeuppance as well.  So Finland is trying a small experiment on basic income.  Five hundred sixty euros to two thousand Finns.  Guaranteed.  You don't have to say what you're going to do with it.  You don't have to look for work.  I just saw is it India that's looking at a basic income as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The real point of the Finnish thing, which I didn't really understand until I read the stories, is that the disincentive people had funny work because they would lose benefits.  Right. So now you will not lose this money and you can get work.  And the presumption is more people will go get work now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to the Business Insider, the Indian government set to endorse universal basic income.  This comes from Professor Standing, who founded an advocacy group called Basic Income Earth Network, BN, in 1986.  He says in this month India will release a report saying it's feasible and, quote, basically the way forward.  The idea being it's kind of super welfare.  Everybody gets a basic income.  It's a low income.  And a number of people pointed out, including the Democratic caucus, that the problem with this is it replaces all entitlements.  That's all you get.  You don't get health care.  You don't get anything.  You don't get food stamps.  You get a basic income.  But everybody gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what I was talking to somebody about this just the other day.  And I was saying it seems like a good idea.  And they said it will seem more like a good idea.  Let's say it was in the US.  If you say these are all the things you won't get if you get the sort of basic income.  Here's what you're going to get.  Right.  You're going to have to give up all these health care benefits, all these tax rebates, all these everything.  And then just do the math for sort of average person under the poverty line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scotland is apparently piloting a universal basic income scheme in Fife and Glasgow.  Every citizen a universal basic income.  I think these all are roughly the same plan.  Right.  The experiment in India, the experiment there has been quite successful.  The nutrition's improved.  Let me see if I can find this.  The pilots in Madhya Pradesh launched in 2010, six years ago.  They provided every man, woman and child across eight villages with a modest basic income for 18 months.  Welfare improved dramatically in the villages, particularly in nutrition among the children, health care, sanitation, school attendance and performance.  The most striking thing, which we hadn't actually anticipated, is that the emancipatory effect was greater than the monetary effect.  In other words, it enabled people to have a sense of control.  They pooled some of the money to pay down their debts.  They increased decisions on escaping from debt bondage.  The women developed their own capacity to make their own decision about their own lives.  The general tenor of all these communities has been remarkably positive.  Now, I should say this quote is from the guy who's been promoting this for some time.  There is a $20 million trial set to launch in California this year.  We're moving rapidly towards this idea.  This is something Mark Andreessen, the creative net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what the Valley thinks to do.  Yeah, we'll destroy the world, but here's some money.  You know, eat some cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you could argue that, let's say you could replace the things that people get who are on welfare or below the poverty line or whatever.  You could replace them with a single basic income.  You could argue that would get rid of so much bureaucracy.  I mean, just think of how simple it could be compared to what we have now.  Multiple conflicting departments, multiple conflicting.  You know, if you could kind of simplify it, you could save a lot of money for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very interesting.  We live in...  That's what I'm...  I'm just fascinated by what's happening.  And I have to remind myself there are real human consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it's also when you look at particularly Silicon Valley and you cover things like whether it's self-driving cars or whatever, you get caught up in the sort of, wow, this would be so amazing.  The kind of, you know, Star Wars or Star Trek future that could be possible.  You know, you think about Star Trek and just your cup of tea materializing.  Well, what about all the people who used to make cups of tea?  And their whole job was to, you know, work in the cafeteria.  All those people are out of work.  Where the hell are they?  Well, Star Trek doesn't tell you.  Presumably they're servicing spaceships or something.  Who knows?  But you sort of...  It's easy to get caught up in the gee whiz part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Silicon Valley's premise is that automation, artificial intelligence will make goods so cheap, virtually free, that there'll be plentitude.  I'm not sure where the money for universal basic income comes from.  I mean, all of these things are small scale trials, which aren't going to really show the real problems that a universal...  Full-fledged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It comes in the long run, Leo, when you have huge corporate profitability out of all those jobs that are eliminated.  It sounds like a perpetual motion machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the problem is that how do those companies that got rid of all those jobs make all this money when nobody can afford to buy anything from them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, our kids will find out.  I'm just glad I'm 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. What a world, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We're going to CES.  Stacey will be back from CES.  We'll talk about that in a second.  I'll tell you what to do with your money, all this money you got now.  You better invest it.  The Dow Jones is getting close to hitting 20,000.  Now, I know a lot of you are smart folks who thinks, oh, I'll just take advantage of this and do my own investing.

Let's talk about all the fun toys we'll have at the end as we're going.  I do like it that you can ask, and I haven't tried this, do you have a Google Home handy?  I do indeed.  Ask it what your New Year's resolution should be.  All right, let's go to the mic.  They did this with VentureBeat, did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Google. What should my New Year's resolutions be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take up a new hobby like bird watching or calligraphy.  What else?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's dopey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, Google. What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll have to translate, I can't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just want to ask what else I could ask it.  New Year's resolutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, this is what it told VentureBeat.  And it kept asking, so it gives you one at a time.  Ah, okay.  You could write a novel or keep a journal.  Either way, writing is good for you in many ways.  What should my New Year's resolution be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could write a novel or just keep a journal.  Either way, writing is good for you in lots of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no way to make a living, Google.  I can tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a writer, Google. That's not a hobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look how you're ruining it for us writers.  That's what all the writers are saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't tell other people to write, god damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's right. No more content, damn it.  That's terrible advice. You could write a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are you thinking?  That's terrible advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Writing is good for you?  That's okay, Google.  I don't think so.  You guys write for a living. I tried.  Try to make someone smile every day.  That's good advice.  Oh, F me.  Go ahead, ask again. See what else it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Google, what should my New Year's resolution be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My apologies. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Google, what should my New Year's resolution be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Try to make someone smile every day.  We've heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screw you, Google.  Don't you know the world's going to hell in a hand basket?  And you're a part of it. It's your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, it might be great to volunteer.  You will help your community, plus meet some kind-hearted people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you have no jobs because we took them all away.  Jeff, you could learn a new language and stop swearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should take your pills and report to your customer service center.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, a nurse is on her way.  You could pick up a new hobby.  Oh, you did that.  New man!  Ask it this one.  Okay, Google, how do I lose weight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that a hit, Leo?  No, that's for me.  Okay, Google, how do I lose weight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to WebMD, if you want to lose weight faster,  you will need to eat less and exercise more.  Screw you.  If you exercise for one hour per day, you could lose...  Stop, Google.  Stop now!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop!  I don't want to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Google, what would a good new career for me be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm not sure how to help with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could do voiceovers for automated assistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's about all that's left.  Speaking of automated assistance, Amazon's Echo everywhere at CES.  Many companies putting Echo in cars, in televisions.  Hotels.  Hotels.  She's going to be ubiquitous.  That's not the story, but I'll get to that one in a second.  She's going to be ubiquitous.  And that was kind of a surprise.  I mean, and by the way, kudos to Amazon.  Man, they have really jumped on this bandwagon with both feet  and obviously has been spending 2016 making deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read the hotel announcement.  I think it was Vegas Chain or something like that.  I missed this.  And they're going to be in every room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's one of the Wynn hotels, the Aria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes huge sense to me.  How does it know it's you?  Or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I asked and it turns out it's associated with the Wynn's account.  So, it's all...  None of the data is yours.  It's all that goes to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can turn the lights on.  You can close the curtains.  You can turn the TV on.  You can do stuff like that.  Makes sense to me.  Makes sense to me.  Yeah.  And even cast things, presumably, to the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amen 70 says the new slogan for Motel 6 is,  we'll leave the mic on for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Ben Thompson at Strathecary had a piece just today,  just this morning about Amazon and how Alexa is effectively,  they want to be the operating system of the home.  And I think that makes perfect sense.  And they're far ahead of Google, I would say, at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of every...  For that kind of connectivity, yes.  But the argument I've made in the past, Matthew,  is that Google's ahead in the technology behind natural language and...  Yeah, it could be.  ...more of your life and more things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think Amazon...  So then the question is, can Amazon scale up in that area faster  than Google can kind of cut the kind of deals that Amazon has?  Or if the question comes...  Remember, Amazon has a two-year lead on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that doesn't mean Google can't catch up, but I think this is huge.  For instance, this is where you see the two-year lead.  They were already making all these hardware deals.  Ben writes,  First, by abstracting away the hardware,  an operating system reduces the plaintiff competition for hardware providers  to merely performance.  It's not lock-in, it's performance.  In the short term, this increases competition among hardware providers,  which benefits the operating system.  In the long run, when performance becomes good enough,  hardware becomes commoditized,  which means the operating system captures the bulk of profits in the value chain.  That's very interesting.  Ben is always very insightful.  And it goes through Microsoft and Windows and so on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and the choke points, as he calls them.  And I mean, I think Amazon's got a big head start.  It'll be interesting to see if Google can catch up.  And Amazon is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that you mention it,  Amazon is following Google's Android strategy.  Yeah.  Right?  Open it up and get it everywhere.  I'm surprised Google hasn't begun to do that yet.  Ben says Google really was a platform,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was an operating system for the Internet.  For the Internet, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Close. It was close, anyway.  And benefited by that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you could argue that Amazon...  I mean, Google's probably thinking,  well, how the hell do we make money off of this thing?  Amazon's got a whole revenue generating business  that doesn't require this device.  They can make incremental revenue on you ordering things through your Alexa.  It's actually brilliant, because suddenly I can order...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to put it on appliances.  So I'm standing at a stove and I can say,  hey, Echo, I need more butter.  I mean, this is...  Even if they didn't charge license fees, this is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Dash button was a sort of interim thing, I think.  They have been slowly perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time I look at what Jeff Bezos is up to,  I am more and more impressed.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, is he smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He even is turning the Washington Post around.  Yeah, subscription's way up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I finally plunked down the 10 bucks a month.  Yeah, because of that price?  Well, you know what?  He's figured out also how to do a paywall right, I think.  You get a lot of free articles.  And just when you get to that article,  you really want to read, you get the first paragraph,  and then it says, oh...  I also think that a lot of people subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because of David Tarnholt.  I agree.  Because they did great work in this election.  They want to support it.  I mean, both the Times in the Post  benefited from Trump's election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Both of them went through the roof.  NPR did, too.  Did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As did the ACLU, the EFF,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Planned Parenthood.  They've all benefited.  In a way, that's why I love seeing...  By the way, I've read the article,  and by the way, I've never not liked getting a Republican president,  or Republican Congress,  because even though I'm a liberal,  it galvanizes the left in a way that having Obama in presidency  for eight years did not.  This is good, Phil.  The left are still fighting among themselves.  It's so liberal.  Is it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look, I'm trying to find a silver lining.  That's the way you are, yes.  You try.  I appreciate that.  I try. I'm trying.  I'm trying to galvanize the left, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hitler was the left, by the way.  Yeah, that's true.  That's the irony of all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was the left. He was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Populist movements often end up fascist.  The worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The people. They're horrible.  The worst.  The worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Trying to find more tech stuff here so we can...  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Don't want to upset the Trump cult.  By the way, I'm convinced now.  This is the best way to think of this is as a cult.  It's bigger than that, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but if...  Sorry, are we talking about Amazon now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Hyundai's going to have Google Home in its cars.  So Google does have some deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  Yep.  Well, won't they have to call it Google Car, then?  Yeah, I'm not home.  It's not really your home.  That's a little weird.  Unless you live in your car, in which case...  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very strange.  I wouldn't...  You know what?  Google is absolutely well poised for this if they get off the...  If they move fast, right?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, that's not what they're the best at.  No.  And Amazon's been there and is making the deals.  I love to see this competition, though.  That's going to be good.  I think it's interesting now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now you have Ford and Toyota ganging up to keep Apple and Google from owning the car.  That's disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not buying a Toyota because it doesn't do the real...  You wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd rather have a Ford operating system than a Google.  Who's going to say that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ford at least does now enable both Apple and Android.  Thank goodness.  Does it?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all hedging their bets.  I'm still not buying one.  But I agree with you, Jeff.  Their real goal is to make sure that they can keep hegemony in the automobile.  Yeah, they have to control that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Car is just a platform now.  Well, but here's...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, but hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on a second.  So you go to the future where you don't own a car, the car comes and picks you up.  Then the operating system has to go with you, not with the car.  You're going to get in different cars all the time.  And oops, sorry, don't send me an automated Chrysler because it doesn't have my OS.  That's not going to work.  I'm going to take my personal OS device, whatever we call a phone in the future, and it's going  to take over whatever environment I'm in.  You think?  I hope.  I hope.  That's the only thing that's good for a consumer.  Well, yeah, which means it's probably not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to have multiple competing platforms that are completely proprietary, and you'll  get in one and your phone won't work, and it won't understand your commands because  you're not using the keyword.  Hey, here's good news for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe, I don't know.  We've been wondering what's happening with the Chromebook Pixel.  Apparently, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is the next Google Chromebook.  What?  Oh, really?  Yeah, this is a CES announcement.  Samsung, we've heard rumors about the Chromebook Pro.  We've been waiting for this machine, and we thought it was going to be out of your end.  Apparently, made in partnership with, directly with Google.  Wow.  Interesting.  Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus, 12.3-inch LED touchscreen, 2400 by 1600, 4 gigs of RAM,  32-gig hard drive, 39-watt-hour battery.  That's not a huge one.  That's about 80 hours of life.  720p webcam, two USB type-C ports, much like the Pixel, one on the left, one on the right.  SD card support, again, like the Pixel.  Although, you do have this really cool flip-over thing.  Yeah, and a stylus, which is kind of nice.  And a stylus.  And what's nice about that is, if you've got the Android App Store on here, which you clearly do.  See, there's the Play Store logo.  Now, you've got a nice Android device as well.  This is not just a Chromebook Pixel replacement, but I guess this is kind of, in a way, the Pixel C replacement.  $449 starting price in February.  When's it going to market?  I'll buy it.  This looks like the one to get.  It's thin, it's light, it's powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long, how much is away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see, I don't see that anywhere.  Fake news, you just said it was light.  How do you know?  Because it looks light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It looks really light.  It looks really light.  All right, let me click a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the Asus is 2.6 pounds.  The Asus that's coming out, it looks nice too.  It's also $499.  This is all good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just means there's a lot of competition in the Chromebook space, which is great.  Which is good.  Yeah.  I don't know, but it is thin.  So, of course, Asus makes very thin stuff too.  I wonder if the Google Store is...  Oh, that's nice.  Oh, that's a good question.  Okay.  That's good.  That's light, right?  What is the Asus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  There you go.  Google, let's go to the Chromebook section of the Google Store and see if we're seeing  anything.  No, not yet.  Not yet?  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if they'll keep the Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kudos, by the way, to Google, which introduced Type C and is now one.  Yes.  It's everywhere.  It is.  It's the clear winner for ports.  And we're seeing at CES a lot of PCs, all of them with Type C. And even companies like  HP, which made a docking station, have abandoned their old docking station and replaced it  with Type C. That's really where it's all going.  Lenovo, maybe it was Lenovo, not HP.  Asus also announced a phone, a new Tango Daydream-ready phone, Zenfone AR, and a two-camera Zenfone  3 Zoom.  We kind of knew about this.  Qualcomm accidentally released this earlier.  5.7-inch display, which will fit in your Daydream visor.  Tango, I'm still, I think the jury's still out on Tango, but that is an augmented reality  technology that kind of what learns your, I don't know.  Maybe I don't understand it fully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so Leo, there's actually two Chromebooks from Samsung and Google.  Yes, the Pro and the Plus.  Plus, right.  So what's the difference between the, one is the chip.  Better chip.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's one fancier one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both are the same screen.  Okay.  I see.  I missed that.  Okay.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll order it.  Do you need a new one?  Is your, I gave Abby my Chromebook Pixel, actually.  So, assuming that there would be no-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I take on every trip now?  I take the Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there anything you could do on a Pixel C that you can't do on a Chromebook with the  Android store on it?  I guess there are some Android apps you can't put on there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Pixel C is Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the Chromebook with Android.  Oh, with Android.  With the Play Store versus the Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the Pixel 4, it's bigger than the Pixel C.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what the Pixel C and the keyboard-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's got like, yeah.  Yeah.  I would like to see a new Pixel C, actually.  Google says there are dozens of Tango enabled apps coming out in the next month using AR.  Really?  Yeah.  So, and by the way, the Zen phone has one model with 5,000 milliamp hours.  That's a giant battery.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it like two inches thick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be.  But that's really great.  That one is the Zen phone 3 Zoom, which has the two cameras.  It is a smaller display, five and a half inch HD 1080p display.  So, with that battery and that display, that thing, that should be a beast.  That should go forever.  Qualcomm also announced its newest Qualcomm processor, the Snapdragon 835.  This is a very interesting processor.  We'd heard some about it earlier.  This is a 10 nanometer FinFET design, which means they've scooped Intel in terms of the first 10 nanometer FinFET.  But it also is going to be an amazing chip.  If you're going to buy a new Android device, you're probably going to want to have it with a Snapdragon 835 in it.  It has very high end GPUs.  It's basically going to compete with Intel chips.  In fact, Qualcomm even said we anticipate it in mobile computing.  Chromebooks run fine, by the way, on ARM, on Snapdragons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also say that...  Who was it?  The gadget piece I just read said ARM is not going to be so great.  I think they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're wrong. I think Intel is very worried.  Microsoft has announced Windows on ARM already.  This 635, I think, is very close to desktop class processor, but very low power.  It's about a third the size of the 820, or 821, their previous processor.  Which means lower power, lower heat, smaller...  They see it in virtual reality and, more importantly, augmented reality visors like the Microsoft HoloLens.  25% more performance, 40% less power.  That's the kind of numbers Intel hasn't delivered in years.  It's been a long time. 25% improvement in 3D graphics performance.  Support of 60 times the colors with the Adreno 540 visual processing subsystem.  It will support 4K Ultra HD video with HDR10, 10-bit wide color gamut displays for HDR video.  This thing is a beast. Now, it's also not out.  So, if it lives up to these specs, this is a world-beater. This is significant.  And it's a big deal for Google. It means Android and Chromebooks can compete very well with desktop computers.  And servers, too.  Hey, you should tell your friends over at CNN that when they want to talk about hacking...  They probably shouldn't use screens from video games because, well, people will know and recognize it.  CNN talking about how Russians hack things used screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Russians have very old, bad computers to hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should show you the video because they slanted it.  Nobody will ever know what that is, but of course, you know how people are.  Of course.  They recognized it immediately as the little mini-game inside of Fallout 4.  Why would you even pick that? Just because it has code, I guess.  You have to hack it. So, you have to enter your password now.  Two attempts left. You have to look at the hex listing and figure out what the password is.  So, that's hacking, right?  That's hacking. Hell yeah. Video game hacking.  Of course, who found out? Reddit.  You can't get anything by Reddit.  This is actually television's big problem. You've got to have pictures.  It was always our problem on Tech TV, too. You've got to have pictures.  And when you talk about very abstract things...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the thing is, Leon, so does every court's article, so does every tweet these days.  Every website, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was looking for something to illustrate an article about digital advertising.  Good luck finding an image in an image gallery to illustrate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the motherboard article you wanted to talk about, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it was about data formats in the Star Wars movies. It's by Sarah Geong.  I love this.  Just hysterical.  And it doesn't... I don't think there's any real big spoilers about Rogue One, but...  A big part of Rogue One is they have to retrieve this data about the Death Star.  And it comes on this giant, what looks like a hard drive.  They have to access it in this secure facility with these robotic arms.  And then transmit it from a satellite dish.  But it mentions all kinds of stuff like how, you know, basically a service robot can access any port and any door on the Death Star by simply plugging in, you know...  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gizmo.  Thank God, you know, because they finally figured out how to make everything talk to everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then of course she gets the plans for the Death Star from this huge hard drive, but then they put it on a tiny disk that gets jammed into R2-D2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Somehow R2-D2 has a port for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, or something.  But then no one can read the disk because it's some ancient file format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got something jammed in here real good.  This little R2 unit. It's got something jammed in there real good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he has no clue what it is or what to do with it.  But somehow it generates a hologram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somehow he plays with it and suddenly the hologram plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is really well written though about, you know, that you can think about, well, does the Empire have its own data formats?  And if it does, then how does... like are there hackers who are hacking the Empire's data formats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about encryption? You'd think if you built a Death Star, you'd encrypt those plans pretty darn well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if they thought through whether or not you have underwear in space, but they didn't think through all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably wouldn't use ports that any service robot could access and disable all the doors in the prison section of the Death Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a children's story. The stormtroopers can't shoot straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although I put on a stormtrooper mask and I know why. You can't see a thing in it.  You can't see a thing, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that got me about the movie was because it's so long ago, they have to recreate the terrible display that everybody had back then.  So the targeting systems in the ship look like a video game from 1981.  And yet they have these floor to ceiling screens with these, you know, basically what are 8-bit kind of displays projected on them.  It must have been horrible for the special effects guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we learned in the very first Star Wars movies that the data was stored on stolen data tapes.  Okay.  See, so remember Darth Vader, your sad devotion to that ancient religion.  Right.  Or actually that's the guy talking to you.  So that explains why they had to make the hard drive look like stolen data.  Like a data tape.  They had a canonical responsibility to the original source material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so you've got that huge disk and then whatever they need fits onto a tiny, basically a tiny, what looks like a floppy.  There's the disk.  And then when it's rendered, of course, on the rebel ship, it's basically just a drawing in white of a circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have not seen Rogue One, so don't tell me anything.  But I understand that it does explain the strategic positioning of a womp rat sized exhaust port.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually that's one of the big benefits of the film.  There it is.  This is the render.  That's what you get.  That's what you get from this giant hard drive.  Oh Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sarah Jiang.  Good job.  She does a great job at Vice at Motherboard.  I really like Motherboard.  I hope Vice continues to do well with that.  According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and it mentioned the earlier movies where the Jedi's basically have what looks like a glowing marble.  Yeah.  That somehow stores data.  It's not clear.  Well, they're Jedi's.  They can do all sorts of stuff.  What data format that is exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they can do all sorts of things.  Here's little people in helmets.  They will be much safer there with my master.  Count Dooku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is.  I'm a man, high tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you...  Here is the Death Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Simplified, somewhat simplified for your approval.  All right.  Well, fortunately, it doesn't really matter, does it?  Yeah, these are the great data ports that just aren't you.  Yeah.  It just happens to have a connector.  Everything.  In fact, they work in any way you want.  Just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open the door to the cellwork.  Perfect fit.  Two seconds later.  Yeah.  No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just plug into this port right here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why on earth, as Sara Jiang, are ports standardized in the future, actually the past?  Potato storage isn't?  The ports.  Oh, we got consistency there.  Well, it all goes back to the great Zigbee Wars of 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm surprised nobody has to carry around dongles to jack into the, you know, Type C

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  port.  Really?  And cursing Apple along the way.  That's right.  Damn the Empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dongles!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dongles!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything else to talk about here?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, not very impressed, and I'm not alone on this.  Dan Guggen wrote a good piece in Ars Technica and elsewhere on the report, the JAR, the  Joint Analysis Report on Russian cyberattacks from the Department of Homeland Security and  on how the Russians hacked the DNC.  Either the Russians have the skills of a 14-year-old script kitty or this report was heavily redacted,  but this is Wordfence, which is a WordPress security company, did a really great job of  analyzing the software.  They found, for instance, that the software that the JAR report pointed to was an old,  out-of-date Ukrainian PHP exploit that had been much updated since then and that anybody  could buy on the web freely and easily.  PaaS.  How did they find that out?  They Googled it.  You can get it too.  Google PaaS 3.10.  The current version is 4.0.  Anyway, it's 4.1.1b is the most recent version, if you want to make sure you have the latest.  We are going to do a whole security now on this PaaS malware because it's actually kind  of interesting, but it doesn't seem like it's in any way a smoking gun pointing to Putin's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  involvement in this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like they're going to reveal their sources of evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do they report it all if you're just going to make crap up?  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so on a lighter note, under Google, under the rundown, the Google, what's it called?  Tilt Brush.  Have you seen this stuff?  Oh, let's show this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This video is cool.  Tilt Brush is a program that you can use with the Vive.  We've actually played with it.  A lot of our staff loves it.  It allows you to paint in a 3D space.  And actually, I've talked to people who've used which video, which should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I watched the top one.  I didn't watch the second one.  There's some cool stuff.  This is not what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What it looks like you're in a dark space.  Let me go ahead here.  Here's the Tilt Brush stuff.  This is a lot of those.  The other video I think there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's some Tilt Brush.  So he's painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what you see.  You paint a 3D space.  I've also heard that there's a really good 3D design program for Oculus Rift, which is  coming out because Oculus is finally releasing its.  Is it this one you liked?  Yeah, that's the one I watched.  There's one teaser woman is doing some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not what you see in the space.  This is kind of a hybrid of what he's seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there you go.  This is what the space looks like.  And a number of our talented staff, very good artists were able to do some really beautiful  Tilt Brush thing.  Brian Burnett, Anthony Nielsen did a lot of great things.  The thing that's interesting about Tilt Brush is you can walk around your image.  But it is still.  And be inside it.  You're in it.  Yeah.  It's a little ungainly though.  You got to hold this thing.  It's got huge potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got huge potential, I would think, for design though.  3D design.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I talked to somebody who's used the Oculus tool who says it's really remarkable way to  do 3D modeling.  So same idea.  We've got two different audio tracks going.  I apologize on that.  You could turn off the audio.  But there you go.  That's very cool.  Tilt Brush.  This is a New York Times article on Tilt Brush.  But this is something, it's funny that they're kind of doing it now because we've seen this  for some time.  We were playing with it when we first got our Vive, actually.  But I guess they're playing with it in the, at an artist in residence program at the

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Smithsonian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  All right.  Let's wrap it up.  I'll start with Matthew Ingram.  I've got to pick a tip, something you want to share with our vast viewing audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am still trying to come up with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff, stop for me and Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not trying to be in politics back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a telethon set for inauguration day as counter programming with Jane Fonda,  Jamie Lee Curtis, John Aptow, Christopher Guest, Tim Robbins and others.  What fascinates me about this is that it's going to benefit Planned Parenthood, ACLU  and Earthjustice.  What fascinates me about it is it's on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so who needs a broadcast network to stream on Facebook?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  A 23 year old entrepreneur named Alex Godin, who sold his company Dispatch to Meetup in  2013, assembled the crew of the event and says, let's have a telethon.  And then people say, hey, Judy, hey, McKee, let's put on a show.  And they put it on Facebook.  So I found that fascinating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  Do you need some more stall time, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the only thing I could think of to mention was that motherboard piece.  That was the one thing I wanted to talk about.  It's fine.  I think I encourage everybody to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess my tip isn't something you can get yet, but there is good news.  They have announced that Super Mario Run, which is the massive hit on iOS, will be available  for Android.  So you can go to the Play Store, search for Super Mario Run and give them an email address  to be notified.  But it's my guess that they're getting kind of close because they have announced it.  Super Mario Run is a really kind of cool game for phones because you can play it with one  hand.  You can play it with all of the motion and movement that traditional Mario games require.  But it's quite engaging.  I presume they will do the same thing with this as they do with the Apple version, which  is give you three free levels and then ding you for $10.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I heard a lot of criticism about that.  People who were initially excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's worth I got to say it's worth $10.  I got a game on my screen if you want to show a car.  It's worth $10.  It's really a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I got a Moto 360.  That's what I was going to mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A Moto 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm joined the smartwatch small group of people.  You took your time.  And now I think the smartwatch is dead now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, Motorola announced it's not doing anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I picked exactly the right moment just as the bandwagon was losing its wheels and heading  for the cliff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, there is news that there will be an Android Wear 2 coming from Google, an update  to their Android Wear soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say a bunch of things I like about it.  But I haven't the notification thing.  I'm trying to get it to the point where it's useful but not annoying.  Yeah, it's not really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, mine finally broke and I haven't I don't even wear a watch now, which is driving me  nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked somebody, it was like Christmas Day, I said, if you have any tips.  And someone said, wait, I'll have to get it out of the drawer where I put it like a year  ago.  And I haven't thought about it since.  Am I guessing this was a gift, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hard to buy for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I'm having fun with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love my Moto 360.  I have a metal bracelet.  It looks it's a very handsome watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it does a lot of things that are super useful.  But it also does a lot of things that are kind of annoying.  So, I'm trying to find a happy medium between those two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, relevant to that, the first Android Wear 2.0 watches were announced at CES this  week, including one from Casio.  So, somebody is going to continue to make these.  This is the WSDF20, follow up to their F10.  That's pretty ugly.  And I'm not sure what's new in the Android Wear 2.0.  It's been out, I think, in beta for a while.  So, I'm sure some people do.  But this is apparently one of the first watches that we'll ship.  It's ugly.  It's for the sporty set.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing that I used that made the biggest impression was we were taking  pictures at Christmas, you know, family photos and stuff.  And you can stand away from the camera.  Yeah.  I set the phone up and took the picture with the watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, quote Leo question.  Some people are announcing phones at CES.  Why are they doing that versus Mobile World just because to stand out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It must be timing.  You know, it's also true that most of the time PCs are not announced at CES.  They're announced later in the year.  What is the name of the Taiwan computer show, this big computer show in Taiwan in the summer,  I think.  So, but there are nevertheless been a lot of PCs announced this week.  So, I don't know.  It may be a, it might be a renaissance of CES, which has gone through some bad times.  You know, for a while it was an iPhone.  Yeah, I know people are going to it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's cooler now.  It's cooler now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there are a lot of new technologies, most unproven, but there are a lot of new technologies  like, you know, smart watches and VR and AR and smart cars.  Automation, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going personally?  No, we sent Father Robert down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's going to be giving us our coverage.  He's actually down there right now with Brian Burnett.  They're going to do some specials for us.  I feel like it's such a zoo.  I could get all the information from press releases and other people covering it.  So, yeah, I'm going to, it's a little more manageable that way.  Does Father Robert like it?  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  I like it.  It's fun to go.  It's quite, it's a scene.  Yeah.  So, like any scene, it's fascinating.  But if you've been more than 20 times, you kind of, it's like, I've seen this scene,  although I have to say this is one, this looks like one of the most, Computex, thank you,  that's the Taiwan show.  This is one of the most interesting CESs in a while.  And I think partly because of all these interesting technologies that are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't it CES way back in the day that had a video part of it and included, like there  was a porn video part of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was Comdex.  CES has been around for a long time, but Vegas also had Comdex, which was a computer show.  And Comdex had a, just like the old, remember the old VHS video stores where you'd go, there'd  be a curtain in the back room and they had the adult tapes back there.  They had a special section for adults.  Finally, they said, this is not working for us.  They separated it out to something called Adultdex, which used to be concurrent with  Comdex and then for a while was concurrent with CES.  But I think that even CES wanted more distance, even more distance.  And so I think it's moved, if it's still even around, I don't know.  I think it still exists.  Comdex isn't around, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was funny to see, I came by once and the autograph line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's what it's all about.  We went to cover CES for Tech TV, you know, many moons ago and foolishly my producer  said, hey, let's, we got a camera crew.  Let's go across the street to Adultdex.  And I should have just said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's tape somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cameras are rolling.  And I walk in the door and I, this woman, Leo!  And she's apparently a cam girl who is a huge fan of Tech TV because actually, if you think  about it in the early days, people who are using the internet for porn were Tech TV fans.  So she tries to get me to sit in her lap and I'm like, I feel like, you know, Anderson  Cooper with Kathy Griffin.  Like I'm just very uncomfortable because I know there's cameras rolling and I just, probably  not a good idea for me to sit in her lap.  So I'm just like, where do you put your hands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that was a bad idea.  I think my friends, we, on that note, it all leads to me to bring it down into the gutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us.  We do this week in Google.  And I know sometimes it's a little, it sounds like it's about politics, but it's really about the  nexus of technology and life, which these days is a lot about politics and journalism.  And I think it's meat that we should cover these subjects, especially since you have such great  people as Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY, the City University of New York, blogger  at Buzz Machine, prolific author and deep thinker, more importantly.  Right.  Another deep thinker from Fortune magazine.  It is, well, fortune.com as well.  We downplay the magazine part these days.  Matthew Ingram.  You follow him on Twitter at M-A-T-H-E-W-I.  Always a pleasure, Matthew.  Thanks for joining us.  Thanks for having me.  Oh yeah, we love it.  Stacey, you'll be back next week.  Good to see you.  I'm being laden with IOT gadgets.  And I sadly will not be here.  Oh man.  It's hard to get the whole gang together these days.  It is.  It's horrible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where are you going?  Frankfurt, and the flight back is landing too late.  No problem.  No, no.

Transcript:  So.  That's the way it is.

Transcript:  For this month.  Okay.  And it kind of dries up.  So I'll be around.  Then you're stuck with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, as I love it.  You could do it from the plane.  In-flight Wi-Fi is so reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, we flew United back East and I paid 20 bucks for the in-flight Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  And it failed halfway through.  That's that.  Yep.  No refund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.  But really as Louis CK has wanted to point out.  Yeah.  We really shouldn't be complaining about the fact that we are connected to the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on a piece of metal hurtling through the sky six miles high at 600 miles an hour.
