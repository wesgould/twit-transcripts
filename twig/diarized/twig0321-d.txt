Time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news and I should warn you anything else we want to talk about.  But that's why I love this show. It's a deep philosophical dive into technology and society starring Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism.  And Gutenberg. We taught Gutenberg.  Jeff is a professor of journalism at the CUNY City University of New York.  He is there in his office right now, blogs at BuzzMachine.com and his latest geeks bearing news about the reinventing the news business.  Gutenberg the geek. A bit of a historical deep dive into why things are the way they are.  What would Google do? Public parts. Great to have you, Jeff. He was on Twit. A great episode.

Transcript:  I love being at the grown up table. I got to have wine with the turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of fun.  Wine with the turkey. Who are you calling a turkey?  And that is Kevin Marks. KevinMarks.com at Kevin Marks on the Twitter.  A man about Silicon Valley. He's been everywhere, man. Started at the BBC.  He was hired by Apple to work on QuickTime and podcasting before he would even have a name.  He also has worked at Google, British Telecom, and he joins us regularly. Great to have you, Kevin.  In fact, I'm really glad you're here.  Jeff, you went this morning to the Google event announcing their...  Now see, this is funny because it's been kind of framed as Google's response to Facebook news and Apple news.  But it doesn't sound like that's what it is. What is AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me back up and just give a tad of history here.  I went to an event in Helsinki in May. Google News Geist with the digital news initiative in Google.  And you know about news and Google in Europe.  And it was about a week after Instant Articles was out.  And I, for one, being an obnoxious SOB walked in and said, you've been leapfrogged by a mile.  What you people should do is do a open source version of Instant Articles.  And this is not what caused me to do it. I'm not trying to say take credit for that.  But Richard Gingras, head of Google News, is also there, has also been arguing, as I have for quite some time, for this idea of portable content.  That content can travel with its brand, revenue, analytics, and links attached. And that's a good thing.  Well, lo and behold, Richard worked with Dave Besbriss, the VP of Engineering at Google, and the Digital News Initiative and others.  What they announced today was, in some sense, yes, a response to Instant Articles in that sense.  However, it's the fact that it does news first is almost coincidental because what this really, really, really does is go to Google's obsession about speeding up the web.  And they're starting with news publishers because that's a nice controlled environment of people who want quality and they can make nice with publishers and so on and so forth.  But what this is, is actually fairly straightforward.  Number one, so it's going to make it so that when you click a link from an app, from Twitter, from a web page, whatever, it's especially aimed at mobile, but this works the same on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although it's AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they care about because everybody, all they care about is mobile. But it's just the web.  All this you're hearing about is just the web.  It's nothing. So it is a standard that does a few things. When you click on it, the page will come up instantly.  How will it do that? Number one, there's a shared library of architectural functions, you know, how to do a slideshow, how to do other things that the sites that are AMP ready agree to, and they use that.  So that now, of course, when you click on a link, what has to happen is it has to open a browser.  It has to open all the crap and all the crap around the page, plus a bunch of crappy ads, which we'll get to in a second.  And then, by the way, here comes the content. And it takes friggin forever.  So a link is an invitation to wait. So now the shared library makes it simpler and easier for the page to come up quickly.  And this is an open library. It's not a template, but it's a way to call on those resources so that you don't have to reload them every time the poor user loads the page when they're the same things everybody else uses anyway.  That's one. Two, it's an open cache. So it can be cached in a number of ways. It can be cached by Google itself, which offers, but that's not mandatory.  Anybody else can set up a cache as well. And in a sense, it's also cached. It's prefetched onto your app.  So if you're in a carousel, it's starting to fetch the next page. So it'll happen quickly.  Number three, it sets certain ad standards. I think this is this is a hidden big story out of this is that anything's going to mess up the learning the page.  You know how well we all hate and best talked about this from Google is you load the page and then it goes up and down and up and down and up and down.  Well, it's trying to figure out the architecture and load in the ads. It has to have a set size to the ad has to go in.  No pop ups, no other nasty things. So it's just the bare beginning of ad standards, which I think is important.  And so it loads in such a way that the content will load instantly. The ads at the top of the page will load first.  They will load live so that you know you're paying the server.  But then as you go on, it'll load and it won't just it won't interrupt with you trying to see the page and read it immediately.  Number four, from my understanding is and this wasn't talked about at the press event, but I talked afterwards.  A few of us were asking Bez questions, including Danny Sullivan.  Oh, by the way, when Danny Sullivan's at an event, don't bother tweeting because he gets it all and he gets it right.  So number four, which I think is interesting is that Bez said that, you know, every publishers love analytics.  They all have all the analytics and all the analytics are checking every damn second to say, did he scroll? Did he scroll? Did he scroll?  And it's causing all kinds of problems.  So now there's a shared analytics gathering engine basically that can feed off and it can do Google Analytics and it can do Omniture and it can do Chartbeat and so on and parsley and so on and so forth.  But you will not have all these separate things there doing that.  So you add all that together. And what happens is that it makes the page load extremely quickly.  The page, keep in mind, is just a web page.  This is not about changing the web.  This is not about Google being an intermediary.  This is an open standard. You don't have to go through Google in any way.  They just offer their caching. A whole bunch of publishers from the New York Times to Vox to BuzzFeed to the Guardian to the Telegraph to German publishers, you know, are the first in.  There's five thousand articles a day that are that are so far going up in this format, this AMP format.  And it just simply makes it a hell of a lot faster and makes the mobile experience better.  So I'm almost done, but a few more points.  What happens then is that if you're in Twitter and such, when you click on a link, boom, the page is there.  Now, to me, this changes pretty radically the potential experience you could have in the sense that an aggregator like Nuzzle or like an aggregated app like Nuzzle or a site,  Real Clear Politics. The experience has been you click on a link and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, my weight.  Now you click on a link and bingo, it'll be there.  And so it'll be more like a web experience at those places.  And I think this has huge implications for the idea of distributed content, that less and less people will come to our sites.  More and more we will go to them. Same as incident articles on Facebook.  To make it faster, maybe it's a Trojan horse, but to make it faster, that's why people are going to put Washington Post is going to put up every single article it has on the Facebook.  There too, the publishers ask for if you can get Facebook to sell for you.  And we're going to go to where readers are, I think more and more and more.  And so that's in a nutshell, what AMP is.  What it doesn't do is bring you back data about the users beyond the analytics that you capture.  And I think that's important for the likes of Facebook.  It is different from Facebook and articles, but there's no reason that they couldn't bring those two things together into a standard.  And that when you publish something that's AMP ready, it's also as articles ready or vice versa.  You know, I think that would be a very exciting thing to happen.  I think Facebook could leapfrog Google here by giving more data back to publishers to help them be smarter about what they do.  But I think this is an incredibly important change in the architecture of how we do content.  And it makes the all Google says they want to do. Finally, to answer your question.  I think what happened here was not I think I think Dave Bezparis, like Google, is obsessed with making the web faster and faster and faster.  And it was news publishers, somebody else, you know, in a sense, who cares?  What they want is a better web experience, a faster web experience.  They want to get rid of the delays.  And so they're starting with the publishers because they also want to make nice with publishers.  But the truth is, this should be true of any web page out there eventually.  But now it's a standard. It's open. It's on it's on GitHub.  And so, yeah, it starts with news.  And, yes, I think that the impetus to get this thing going and get it done so quickly is the news initiative.  But it's also just flat out a better web initiative.  That's what I have a report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, fortunately, we have Kevin Marks here, who is a fighter for web standards, has been from day one and also, fortunately, enough of a technical expert that he can look at a GitHub repository and know what Google's proposing here.  Because that's what Jeff, what you express is what Google said.  But of course, there's what we'd like to know is what it what it really does.  What it looks to me a little bit, Kevin, like just a set of best practices.  I'm looking at band HTML, you know, no more frames, no more forms, no more embeds, no more shared resources, shared resources and caching.  Yeah. And I understand the caching and the shared resources to speed up and preloading to which is maybe not such a best practice to speed up browsing.  But so that's one part of it.  It still is HTML, but it's but it's a subset.  It's still CSS, but it's a subset.  And then it's some JavaScript from Google, too.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no JavaScript, nobody else, unless they bless it, which is the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So I mean, so part of that is, by the way, is the JavaScript from Google part of the open stuff in GitHub?  I mean, can I can I examine that JavaScript?  Yeah. OK. Yeah.  So there's nothing secret going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's a little bit of secret. I'll get to that.  So the broad goal here is laudable in that it is trying to get rid of lots of JavaScript craft.  My friend Tantec has this thing, a JSDR, which means JavaScript didn't read, which is like too long, it didn't read.  He deliberately runs his browser with JavaScript off so that all the pages that take forever to load go away.  And that, you know, so to some extent, this is, you know, taking that on board.  And additionally, I know how much of you know, you've been following Marco and the ad blocking in peace and all that stuff.  The interesting thing that Marco said in his podcast about that was that the simplest thing that you can do to speed up the web is to block third party JavaScript.  Because that's basically any JavaScript not loaded from the site that you're on is probably external ad network stuff.  And that is the stuff that is slowing down the web by loading megabytes of nonsense and all these scripts that follow every click of your mouse and every hover.  And like, you know, doing all the all the all the sort of scary ad tech stuff, which is the ad tech equivalent of junk bonds or whatever.  So that's that's so. So this does that.  This does say, OK, no JavaScript in this page.  And then it says, except special JavaScript to prove by Google.  Now, you know, Google are good at writing JavaScript. They're they're good at this stuff.  So they've they've they've done some they've done a streamlined thing there that the they're caching that JavaScript so that it runs so that you load it once.  How many sites you go to doing that kind of thing.  The some of the other things they've done.  But what it means is it won't even let you load JavaScript from your own site, which is a bit weird.  So I took one of my pages and marked it up to to to to try this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only only you could do that, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just as a sign, they give you a command that you can they give you a little JavaScript you can run to say, am I compliant and what's compliant?  I'm trying that. I can't actually tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, as I said, I was just doing this as we were getting on the air, so I'm not sure I completely got this right yet.  But I'll put the link in.  So this is this is this is my page, which was my quick reaction to AMP.  Let me let me let this. Oh, sorry.  Let me put it in the right. I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How wouldn't it be putting an IRC?  I'll put it in the same. OK.  And I'll go back then to the GitHub.  And.  Because on the first on the first blush, I don't even see the word news in this.  This is this is just really more a platform for doing better, more complete pages.  Although if you ban my JavaScript, it also means that my site's never going to work in this.  This is so I don't I mean, yes, it basically means that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trying to do you do it JavaScript freeware, but it also means that they're not you know, they get to approve what JavaScript runs.  Now that that you know that that's somewhat dracody for the new sites for the New York Times, for the people who are mired in, you know, megabytes of adjunct.  That's a good that's a good thing. But it does undermine my so this is my side.  This loaded very fast, including the Twitter embeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're allowed to use fonts, right?  But it has to be Google fonts, which is also a little bit of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just using system fonts anyway. So I don't use font face.  I just use a list of fonts that will render differently, whether in your Mac on Android or whatever, because I'm not precious about fonts.  But the I did an A&P version down the bottom and I haven't actually finished this as a version of the JavaScript removed.  The A&P version, if I click through that, you lose the Twitter embeds.  Now they've got a way of embedding tweets, which I haven't which I haven't got around to editing into it.  Just can't use the embed command.  Yeah. So until you will.  What the way Twitter works is that you use block quote to embed them.  So you get you see something there.  Right. But then it runs JavaScript to decorate them so that they look pretty again.  What I haven't what I'm not sure what I'm not sure is whether this is actually being tested properly yet.  Because I, as I say, I just started doing this half an hour before we went on the air.  So but in principle, this this should work as an A&P thing.  So maybe if we link to it from Twitter, it'll load in A&P.  But that's part of it is it's hard to tell.  And also with my pages, it's hard to tell anyway, because there's not much markup on them.  So I think the loading time difference is going to be nominal here.  It did load your page load very fast in both cases, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, importantly, it pretty much the difference on a web browser on a computer web browser is not going to be terribly noticeable.  It's about mobile. Yeah.  Because mobile is where it's more constrained, more difficult for all the reasons we know.  I mean, if you go, it might be worthwhile, Leo, to show if you go to the demo page on mobile, that's that's where you can really get a sense of what they're trying to do.  That's project.org or no, if you go to go to Kevin's.  Go on your no go on on g.co slash amp demo.  OK, on your mobile phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  G dot C. Oh, use use Chrome.  I'm using Chrome. It works on others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But then you've got to search for the right type, don't you?  Which is kind of search for Obama once you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so this is a version of Google.  Yes. In in AMP.  In AMP. So go to the news tab and search for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to the news search for search for Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just use just use just use search.  Yeah, just use search. There's no OK. Obama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And now this is an accelerated demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. If there is a carousel, that's the carousel that is AMP ready content.  So click on one of those.  And the first time it loads, it's got to load the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a little rendering error.  OK. OK. Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So go back to the first one.  Yeah.  Load that.  This is the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bing.  Yeah, that was very fast.  Now, now swipe left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't know what that is, but swipe left.  Oh, swipe left.  So you can see why news organizations might like this.  Swipe left.  Yeah.  It is preloading the carousel.  It is pre-packaging.  So it's a combination of things.  Yes.  It's it's prohibiting a lot of web stuff like forms and and embeds.  And in fact, the video and audio tag,  you have to use Google's own tags for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So that's the that's the other bit that's slightly sketchy about this is you have to replace video and audio tags with AMP.  And image tags even.  Yeah.  With image tags too.  Oh.  AMP image, AMP video, AMP audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what is what is happening when I do that?  What is going on with this video?  Is that is that so that can cache it?  Is that the purpose of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically it means that it's running JavaScript under Google's control to show that.  So presumably that means that they can cache it.  It's not it's completely clear how that works yet because I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the paranoid, the paranoid among us might say it so they could put a pre-roll in there or if they can actually gather information about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they were asked about data and said they're not gathering any more data now for this than they would otherwise.  Which is a non-answer, by the way.  I think they should have a very clear policy about that and put that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you are giving basically Google is now a third party that has access to everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well, no, not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google already crawls your entire website.  So there's not a big difference there.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The difference is they're crawling me.  I mean, I'm using I am now getting information about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Leo, no, Leo.  Google does not have to be the caching agent for this.  You do not have to go through Google's cache.  You're using Google's scripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Jeff, if I use Google's script for the video tag, it's going through Google to whoever's cache it is.  And at that point, they have access.  They're a third party that has access to every bit of information about me.  The browser knows.  Right, Jeff?  You're asking, you should ask Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's video tag doesn't mean Google's serving the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it means, though, it goes through Google.  The JavaScript comes through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does with the images.  With the images, what they are doing is they're taking the image you give them and rendering other versions.  And they said that.  I'm not sure what they said that for the video, but they definitely said it for the images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're doing the same thing with video and audio as well.  So presumably, when I see video here and I play it, I'm invoking some Google specific JavaScript.  I don't know if it's open code or not.  Some Google specific JavaScript that then loads the video.  And maybe they're doing some caching or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said that it could all come from your server directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not the JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't run JavaScript.  So basically, they're taking JavaScript away from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the script that's used to run any audio, video or images is loaded from Google's servers.  Is that correct?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait, wait, Kevin, let's be clear here.  Video isn't loaded.  The script is part of the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter, Jeff, because as soon as I load anything from Google's servers,  they're now a third party involved in this transaction.  Well, that has access to everything in my browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but I'm just asking.  There's a library of scripts once loaded from any source.  Doesn't have to be from Google.  From any source.  They're Google approved.  That doesn't mean that every time you use any one of those scripts, it calls back to Google, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because it kind of.  It's actually not clear because a lot of it's running locally.  So I have to work that out.  See, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the first time.  So it's loaded once and then running locally from then on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's how it speeds up.  Exactly.  That's the whole point.  And listen, it's less limited than Instant Articles.  Because in Instant Articles, you are serving directly from Facebook's servers and you're using Facebook's structure and Facebook gets all the data.  So it's less limited than that.  I don't know the details enough to know the answer.  These are very good and important questions.  There was a moment.  And I should make it clear.  I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is what people are going to say immediately.  In fact, my first thought about this is, well, this is Google just making sure that they get all the data they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were asked, but I don't think so.  I think they'd get in such hot water, especially after the things we're talking about in Europe in a few minutes.  But there's no way you can tell.  The problem is, the problem is this was done.  And there was a conversation afterwards with the brilliant technology head of one media company came over to Bez and said, you know, they dumbed down the presentation to what they think is a media reporter's level.  But you have people like Danny Sullivan sitting there saying, whoa, what?  Because they're speaking in kiddie language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if somebody cares, they can go to the GitHub repository and look at exactly what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were asking questions right there, but they were talking down.  And that's not what, you know, what Dave Bezbers normally does.  They should have.  They should have talked up.  They should have answered these questions in full.  So we wouldn't have the kind of questions we have right now and don't have to dig into the GitHub to get these answers.  But my understanding is, again, I'm not technical.  I don't know well enough.  It's a library that is shared.  That's the essence of this.  Now, just because it's a library that Google has approved, I do not know.  I do not know the answer to this, but I do not know whether there's any reason for any of that to ping back to Google.  Here's because it's a library that Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the bit I was talking about, Kevin Marks.  You can add a tag development equals one to the URL and then it will check your amp HTML.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tried that, but it didn't seem to do anything.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And as you mentioned, initially it mentioned SVG, but they have later included that.  That is among the allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was my first question.  I was reading through this this morning.  Sorry, got up because they did this thing some god awful hour early in the morning in New York, let alone in West Coast time.  So I was like kind of groggy and before my coffee reading, SVG is on the band list.  And I'm like, what?  How can you, you know, and since war at Google on and Twitter and to their credit, they responded very quickly saying, oh, we forgot to update.  No, we do allow.  Put that in.  So I understand the idea of OK, here's best practices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't use this, this and this.  I think they go.  I understand why they banned JavaScript.  But if you've ever tried to use the web with no script on and block JavaScript, you see that breaks everything.  So there are some things, but this was the point that the JSTR thing that Tantei was talking about is that the web should work without JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  If you're doing it right, you should have declarative stuff in HTML.  There's a no script tag.  And JavaScript enhancing it to make it more interactive.  And one of the sort of one of the anti-patterns.  It should degrade gracefully.  Well, no, it should be it should be it should enhance itself.  It should be progressive enhancement.  OK.  Degrade gracefully is framing it backwards.  You should start with something that works as pure HTML.  You should add beauty to it.  Nobody does that.  Well, no, people, you know, this is this is a separate movement that does the project.  It's quite a strand here.  Right.  Yeah.  The state of HTML is actually a lot better than it was 10 years ago because of the web standards project and what WG and the groups that have brought through HTML five and the better markup that is in there.  So you can do a lot of good stuff with declarative HTML these days.  CSS has also got better, which means that you can do good, subtle layout stuff and the voodoo you had to do is gradually being reduced as we get into continuous updating browsers and this the things roll through.  However, and so there is this this anti-pattern, which is all the new sites have sold their souls to ad tech and sold our browsers to ad tech.  Which means that for every news page we read, it downloads 10 times as much other stuff and uses up isn't that kind of what this is a response to?  So this that this is a response.  Yes.  Yeah, it's it's also a response to and it's also a response to the we can do this faster in a non web way.  And then there was a whole raft of articles that by Farhad Manjoo at New York Times and someone the version, but she was saying the mobile web is terrible.  Look at how bad our site is.  It's like, yes, look at how bad your site is.  The mobile web is just fine.  You can just stop your site being crap.  And this is Google taking that on board, but also saying, OK, we're Google.  Here's some tooling.  Here's a way to stop your site being crap.  Here's some stuff that works.  And overall, it's a great thing.  There is another anti pattern that's going on, which is the so-called single page web app worldview, where the idea is instead of actually rendering HTML pages and then adding CSS and JavaScript to enhance them, you just send JavaScript down to the to the browser, run the JavaScript and generate the HTML and CSS and everything from that.  This is a this this is a very, very interesting thing.  This is a development style that's grown up over the last few years.  And it was weird.  I think Twitter switched it for a while and backed away in horror and went back to doing it in a more sensible way.  But there's still this pattern that.  And there are the types of things that you can do with the web app.  So I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.  I think the next step is to create a web app that's going to be a little bit more sensitive to the web.  And I think that's a good thing.  And there are the things that this does make sense for the classic example being being Gmail, where that is actually an application that you're running.  It's not a series of pages.  It's loading stuff.  Try using Gmail.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're not saying that everything on the web should do this.  Like, Gmail can't be publicly cashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an app.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  They're fully aware of that.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So basically what they're saying is that for the things that should really be static pages, here's a path for doing static pages.  Exactly.  And if you do it this way, we will guide you through the path so that you can still inject certain approved ad networks and tracking things.  But we as Google will vet them for you so they're not like evil things that take over everyone's browser.  And that is something that Google has done.  You don't have to use it.  But there's two issues here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One is they were asked, Gingras was asked point blank, are you going to advantage AMP content particularly?  In the search results?  In the search results and in the carousels and such.  And well, the carousels right now, it is just AMP content.  But that's I don't know where that goes.  But what they said was, no, we will not advantage AMP content.  However, as you all know, we will not use AMP content.  However, as you all know, we do advantage faster content.  And this is a way to make all your stuff faster.  So that's that's one issue with this is that are you motivated to go to the second one is you're still going to have non AMP pages, whether because they shouldn't be up at all or because you just have them because you have them.  And one thing that they have not done yet is to get it so that when Twitter sees a link or I put a link in my blog that's a non AMP link when the AMP version exists, they want to have a link to the AMP version.  When the AMP version exists, they want to have a means to check and say, does an AMP version exist?  And if so, I will serve the AMP version to make it faster than the non AMP version.  But you will still have AMP and non AMP versions of tons of content.  You will have some content that will not be appropriate for AMP.  But as Kevin just said, there's tons and tons and tons of basically old newspaper pages that are static content that are horribly wasteful in the experience and cost you time and cost you bandwidth.  You know, it costs you data and cost you all kinds of things.  This should reduce that. That's that's the way I see it.  And to me, there are then further implications about how you can build different experiences, because once a link is fast, that fundamentally changes the idea of forcing people to go to the link that says, let the content come to the person rather than making the person go to the content.  But yes, these are issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So as soon as so OK, so if you're creating a blog or web page, should you use this technology and how would you use this technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're using WordPress, for example, there they were there today, it will.  I don't know. I don't know about, you know, old templates and how that works, but WordPress will make it so that your stuff becomes AMP ready.  And you'll be using it. And then the next question is when you link to something, you're going to want to link to the AMP version because you're going to want your reader to have a better experience, goes the argument, right?  They'll see the thing immediately and they won't be likely to say, oh, well, I was up that other side in Twitter.  Right. And so, no, I'm still here and I saw that page that was great. I saw it quickly. I read it. Thank you very much. Next, next, next, next, next.  And I think that changes the idea of how you start to develop what you develop. It changes your mind.  And what I want to see happen, too, is I want to see not just full pages done this way.  I want to see a world where there are AMP ready modules that can be loaded into things like embeddable tweets, like cards, like a vox's, a carousel.  They can be loaded in this way. Yeah, basically you're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of what they're doing in the web browser. That's right.  It's a little hard to see exactly how that's working because it's on the mobile thing and I haven't had time to talk about it yet.  But the thing they're doing, the search demo showing you the pages and you slide through them is basically there's two things going on.  One is they're requiring you to put in a bunch of markup in the front that generates the previews that show up there.  And they're being a bit restrictive about what market they'll take for that.  But we can have that argument with them later. I'm going to open that kind of worms up now.  So they're saying you need to put in this news article. It has a title. It has an image and this has your logo.  And then they show that in the result previews at the top.  And then I think they have to bless you to say, yes, you're actually a partner in this or you're you're worthy of being shown in this carousel, which is another hegemonic thing to some extent.  And then they are then using preload. So when they load those little thumbnails, they are then preloading the pages, I think, into iframes. It's not quite clear.  And then as you scrub left and right, you're getting those preloaded pages showing up quickly.  And the advantage of that is that, you know, the advantage of making them small is that those iframes don't end up like making your browser fall over and die, which can be a problem when you generate lots of little separate pages.  That was my sense of what's going on. But there's probably some more subtle stuff going on behind the scenes there.  Is this just for text heavy content? Should I amplify my pages on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not so much the home page, Leo, but yeah, I want to link directly to a page that has this episode in there.  Yeah, you want it to come up quickly on mobile and people will be able to restart watching the video immediately.  Right.  Now, what all that entails when you have so much video, I do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't. I mean, it's not going to happen because it's a Node.js website. Coding it into AMP would be a bit of a challenge.  It's more than just putting a header in there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, it's basically changing your template. So basically, you've got a template system that you generate your page with.  So you have another template that's the AMP version of each page.  Right. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  And you're using the library. You're basically using a Java.  As I understand it, Kevin, tell me if I'm wrong here, because I often am.  You're basically using a JavaScript library, a different JavaScript library that's been pre-approved and pre-fetched onto users' devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's the theory. Yeah.  You know, it's a fairly big JavaScript library, I think. I haven't actually profiled the stuff yet, but it seems to have a bit of heft to it.  And it's implementing the custom element stuff drop-ins, which means that that's only native on Chrome and has to use patches on other browsers.  So there'll be more JavaScript running in on Chrome. So there's likely to be more responsive on Chrome than it is on other browsers, I suspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this Web 3.0, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's just a nonsense name.  Thank you, Kevin.  I mean, basically, this is using some existing web technologies to try and generate better web pages.  But it is also firewalling off certain web technologies.  When you take away the image tag and the video tag and the audio tag and replace them with a proprietary version, you're losing a lot of the flexibility of them.  And that's the truth of it.  And that's the truth of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the truth of it.  Kevin, is it also true? The question is, how is this standard going to be maintained?  Will Google be open sufficiently to new things that occur and new needs around new content presentation types?  And will they be, you know, a beneficent dictator on this standard?  I asked Bez, is this something that should be added to – because I'm trying to get my head around it still – should be added to the next HTML standard?  He said, no, it's just HTML. It's just the web.  It's a subset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a execution.  Although one does wonder why you wouldn't –

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's always a subset. You always use a subset.  Always a subset. Right. So it's just an execution of it.  Yeah.  I'm trying to let this on my iPhone or my iPod and realizing that this thing is too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like this is a complete non-starter, but okay.  Really? Okay, what's the point?  Well, it'll be fine for big news organizations and Vox and people like that who have full-time engineers on staff who have apparently enough cycles to create a completely separate template for their content that is, you know, a Google standard.  And they'll be a benefit, I presume, to them because stuff will load a little bit faster.  It seems like the things you're giving up are not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay. I understand you from your perspective and you just spent a fortune on Node.js.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't do this in a million years.  Well, I don't have the resources to suddenly adopt a new standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Kevin, what would it take to just – all you're doing is having the Node.js generate a page in a different template.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not trivial coding. Well, because it's not trivial. I'd have to have an engineer do it.  You'd have to have an engineer do it, yeah.  It's not – how many days of design and coding and testing is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll let you do it when I've done it. So far I've got something –

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's easy to do what you're doing, which is to go from scratch, from a new page, and do this. I could do that. That's trivial. To take an existing site and amplify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the challenge is going to be – the basic page stuff should just go through.  The challenge is going to be how you deal with image embedding and video embedding and things like that.  And there will be an assumption that you'll have a module that will handle those for you.  It's something that Medium and BuzzFeed and so on and WordPress clearly will have the tools to help you do that.  But as an individual, you'll have to work out how to do this.  It is extra work. If your site is a custom layout, you'll basically have to have another parallel set of layouts.  So it has the side file problem that you have to generate another version of your site.  And then you have to test twice as many pages. So yeah, there is that.  In other words, it's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to – just like Facebook and all these different initiatives, this is for an elite.  And this is one of the things that kind of bugs me. An elite group of web publishers who –

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not both ends. It's also people who aren't elite who use things like WordPress and rely on them to do it for them and have the structure there.  You're in a large middle ground.  Well, in a sense, it's elite because it's WordPress that has to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If WordPress is willing to do the work, then I guess then I just get it free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then millions of sites on WordPress are able to get the benefit.  Yes.  You're in a position where you paid a fortune to build something just finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would there be limitations on things I could do on my WordPress blog if I amplify it?  In other words, are there things I'd have to be cautious about doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so for example, because it won't let you load – so I said that in my post.  It won't let me load client-side JavaScript, which means that my Fragmentions code that lets you link to a word within the page doesn't run.  And it also means that my Web Mentions code that runs client-side to fetch the people tweeting about my post doesn't run.  So it is cutting down the functionality of my site.  And those are progressive enhancements that I have on my website.  My website is mostly static, but it has these little JavaScript things that enhance it and make it more interactive.  So they are cutting that out.  And in order to get this to work, I would have to go through the process of getting those scripts approved by Google and being put into their system.  And that is the overhead part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google is now a gatekeeper in some respects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In effect, Google is becoming a gatekeeper which scripts can run.  And so they've already blessed Twitter's embeds and Vine embeds and YouTube embeds.  It just strikes me as those usual suspects here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like we're moving into this era where there's an elite set of publishers, the usual suspects.  That's a really good point.  And the rest of us are just going to go, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, we've edged our way towards this.  So we now have three competing markup formats and three competing browsers, effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's always worked well, hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the discouraging part of this.  Now, they're not completely terrible and opaque, but they are different.  So what we now know is that Facebook's is basically HTML, except that they've got some rules about which markup you should use.  And they're quite complicated rules.  There are specific things you have to do to embed maps and images and things, and there are certain class names that are required.  Google's is broader HTML, except that they ban some of the most common tags possible, including image,  and say use our special magic image tags that aren't quite image tags that have different layout structures and have different CSS rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And goes through JavaScript, but created and goes through Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but Facebook goes to Facebook, and the other one goes to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's better or worse than Facebook or Apple's.  I think they all have the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They all have the same problem, exactly.  But then the Apple one, there's Apple News format, which they have not even published yet.  So we don't know what that's going to look like.  It might be like the weird XML nonsense they came up with Apple TV.  It may not even be an HTML variant at all.  We don't know.  Currently, what they're taking is RSS2 feeds with HTML in and certain constraints on what you have to put in your RSS feeds.  So there's some ability to map stuff back and forth.  So yeah, the challenge is as a publisher, you may now have to generate four versions of your stuff.  And instead of one or there were two, they were generating a desktop version, a mobile version, and gradually they merged into one.  And now you've got to generate a Google friendly one, a Facebook friendly one, an Apple friendly one, as well as your Facebook.  Well, OK, that's the other question I asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I asked Corey Haig, who's at Washington Post, and I asked the panel who spoke.  And I said, you know, what about Facebook's instant articles?  Is there any reason they can't come together as a standard here?  So when you publish something that's AMP ready, it's also instant articles ready.  And she said, no, there's no reason that they couldn't come together.  You couldn't end up with a standard.  Basically, the other thing that's happened here is that left open to the desires of crappy publishers, we junked up the web terribly.  That's being handled now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, it's a bit. But that's the thing.  Yeah. So this is yes, the publishers have have screwed up and mostly because they will say yes to any snake or salesman who promises them more ads.  And so they end up with a lot of crap.  And so we've got three companies who are technically competent trying to patch this, but they're doing it in their own weird ways.  And so it is and they're not doing it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple, I pull out to the side.  Apple is just doing its own closed world, its fenced world around news and trying to do what Apple does there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that. Why isn't the reaction of content creators just going to be, oh, screw it, I'm going to make an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because they've already tried that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because nobody's going to download apps.  And the effort it takes to get people to download an app and remember to use it and use it, the percentage of app usage versus download is tiny.  I know that across websites.  If you're really, really devoted to app, I know from every news publisher I know those who do use the apps are platinum users.  They're wonderful. They're loyal.  But the proportion is tiny.  Right. It's a tiny conversion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So these publishers feel like the benefit to them is that the page will load so much faster that what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More people will link to them and more people will see their content.  Really? And basically the way I see it, Leo, the way I see it.  People are aware of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the speed difference?  When I put in a link, I'm going to say, gee, I'm going to put in a link because I prefer the speed of this link over that link.  Here's what I'd do. Here's what I'd do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I were like Real Clear Politics, or I know Jonathan at Nuzle is excited about this, and he's talked about it today.  But let's just say I'm Real Clear Politics, which is nothing but links, links, links, links, links.  Or if I were Drudge, right? Or Huffington Post.  Let's just say RCP.  I would do a new aggregator that was nothing but AMP content.  So the experience to my user is as if I never leave the website.  I just, new page, new page, new page, new page.  And how is that better than an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just told me nobody's downloading apps. Now I have to have a new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's on the open web. It's a link away. It's not a download.  I'm going to predict that all three of these initiatives will be dead in the water within a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't see it happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk in a year about AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. It could be WAVE. It could be WAVE.  It's not even WAVE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a...  It's a...  It could be FOSFLIP.  It's a proposal. Yeah, it's FASFLIP. Or there's a million of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you do have a host of really major publishers up on that stage today.  If you look at the list of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they're so freaking desperate. They'll do anything at this point.  They're the same publishers who said, yeah, what ad technology do you have that I can use?  It's the same people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what else I would do, Leo?  If I started a media brand today, I would basically start at Sightless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that in your post and I disagree madly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well, I'll give you my state and then an answer back.  So what I'm saying here is that if you recognize that fewer than 10%...  On major news sites apart from the New York Times, fewer than 10% of the audience in a day sees the homepage.  They don't care about our packaging. They're not coming through that.  No, they go deep links. Yeah.  And so if I could have my content, my value that I create on Facebook,  directly through Twitter, through other websites, that people can experience me everywhere,  and I don't have to have this marketing cost of constantly bringing people to me.  This is basically BuzzFeed's business model, folks.  This is in essence BuzzFeed.  BuzzFeed says we can make our crap viral and advertisers, we can make your crap viral too.  We don't care if people come to our site, really, because if they see us on Facebook  or if they see us on Instagram or they see us everywhere, hallelujah, our mission is solved.  So they're the first web property built post-web or uberweb, post site,  where yeah, if you come to BuzzFeed, fine, but you can't run anywhere.  And that's the lesson the publishers should start to learn from BuzzFeed.  Not that you should do cats, not that you should do listicles,  but that you should recognize that you go to the readers where the readers are  and build a business around that rather than still trying to operate in the old business model,  which says number one, I've got a market like crazy to get people to come to me,  and then number two, all I do is take the 30 seconds I have you at best  and throw as many ads in front of you as I can to sell them as volume as CPM until you go away.  I should encounter you wherever I can.  Now what's missing from that equation is we need more,  we still need to build a relationship with someone on knowledge, relevance, and value.  So I need data back saying, oh, that's Leo.  Leo likes this. I'll give Leo technology.  But that's where I'm going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see that role to Twitter and Facebook. You let them do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm saying it's already happened, Leo.  Horse, barn, horizon, gone.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I agree.  Gone.  So, Kevin, how about my FOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will agree with bits of that and I will disagree with bits of it.  So the nobody goes to your homepage bit is true.  I think I agree with that.  I haven't been to the homepage of the New York Times in 10 years.  And that's also why Twitter's moments thing is weird,  because that's a very much a front page of the New York Times kind of layout model.  It's a definite retrograde step, that feels.  However, the value of saying people can get to my stuff on these other sites  doesn't mean that your pages should not exist as web pages.  It just means that you make sure that they will actually show on those other sites well  and they will bring you back to the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not necessarily coming to your site to see that web page.  That web page is going to where you are.  So, yes, it doesn't kill the web page,  but the idea that you have to go to a site to get to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so then you were as far apart as you were implying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't say you were page-less.  I said you were closer to site-less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, but you have to put the page on a site.  They have to have...  So you have a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an archive and a URL generator.  But it's not the heart of your media business.  Fair.  Okay.  How much of a luck group hugs?  So where did I mess up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, well, what you said is only more like reportedly.  So what reportedly said was we don't have a website, and they don't.  They have like barely anything there still,  but they spend all their time tweeting stuff.  And that, I can see what they're trying to do, but I'm less clear that that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right there, Kevin. You're absolutely right there.  Listen, what do I do for a living? I go too far.  And so what I'm trying to do is to blow open the brains of media people  who think that we still make a product that looks like a newspaper or a magazine,  and it's called a website, and it has pages, and I'm comfortable with that.  And I'm saying, okay, you might still have pages,  but you've gone up in a drone and you've spread them, floated all over the world.  And people pick them up and go to them wherever they are,  and you've got to make a business out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So you're saying don't make a destination anymore.  Because it's not anymore. It's already not.  The destination now is owned by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Destination's a bad metaphor there, right?  It's the...  Well, it's where your users are.  But you don't start there. It's actually a starting point.  The website for new sites is no longer the starting point.  The starting point is Facebook and Twitter at all.  And now that content will appear there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's foolish to consider web technologies for making content, frankly.  No, it's not.  You should make content native to whatever...  Well, I mean, it can be a web technology as Facebook...  Well, if it's Facebook against Articles, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's Facebook against Articles, you're right.  You're not making a webpage.  You should make it native to whatever...  So your job as a content...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Facebook is not a webpage.  Your job as a content creator...  Yeah, but it's not your webpage.  Your job as a content creator is to figure out where your audience is  and go there and use whatever native tools are available to you in that place  until such time as your audience moves on, and then you chase them somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And have a relationship with them such that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And at that time, it's a good idea to have your web pages so that they're not just lost in the silent, but just dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This makes sense if you're a newspaper or a magazine.  I mean, clearly that model is disintegrating.  What about broadcast media?  What is...  Because today you still have to go to Channel 9 to watch stuff on Channel 9,  although I imagine that's going to start changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, it doesn't.  I go to YouTube to watch John Oliver.  I've got an over-the-air TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have cable.  And if I want to watch anything, I go to Amazon, Netflix, YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Leo, you're hit on exactly the right thing.  Joshua Benton, who's brilliant at Neiman Media Lab, is on Twitter right now talking about how  it's going to break all your JS you've ever published, kill your YouTube embeds,  break all your Twitter embeds.  I don't think that's necessarily true, and so on.  So what they didn't deal with this morning, which is absolutely important...  What's the cost of this to people, and how does it get done?  I think that's a huge point.  I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what I see is if you're a content creator, you have two jobs.  One is to create the content, and then you're going to spend a significant amount of time  putting that content in a form that can be consumed by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're going to spend a significant amount of time doing that now to make a beautiful site,  and have a home page, a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's actually a once-only thing that you then use as a...  Well, same thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to take this content and put it through a sieve to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but the problem is the web has been around for a while.  It's Facebook today, it's YouTube today.  Who knows what it's going to be tomorrow?  Your audience is going to move around, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to make an architecture where you republish your stuff wherever it works.  Now, you can't just do that as time.  I'm going to take the same 800-word article and put it there, right?  Buzzfeed's smarter than that.  And you're going to say, I'm going to do something different for Snapchat  than I'm going to do for here.  You've got to do appropriate to the context of the user's need at that moment.  But having said that, if you have the same 800-word article,  what you're going to do is hit a button, and it's going to go onto a web page, sure,  and it's going to go onto an AMP page, and it's going to go onto a Facebook page,  and it's going to go onto Medium, and it's going to go onto whatever else.  And what you're setting up is that structure to publish once, distribute many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  It's really no accident that when people talk about Vox,  they talk less about the content of Vox and more about the platform of Vox.  Bingo.  Well, yeah, but bingo.  But that's as a content creator, that's kind of depressing because basically...  And the same with Buzzfeed, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Buzzfeed has an author...  It's a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who cares what the content is?  The content is, frankly, the least important part of it.  It's about having the platform.  Well, I get this argument.  It's back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  This is where my friends Emily Bell and Clay Shirkey and Jay Rosen will yell at me,  and I don't want to misquote them.  But a lot of people these days say, well, you have to have your own CMS.  And I'm saying, no, we've messed that up in publishing lots and lots and lots of times.  I go back to the year 1973 when the Tribune had such a disaster and I was there.  They assigned their Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporters to investigate their own bad system.  We think we know technology.  We mess it up all the time.  No, there's something more controversial here, Leo.  In essence, what you're doing is you're seeding and saying, Facebook is my CMS.  Right.  Google AMP is my CMS.  That's scary.  But, you know, if I get if you're going to start if I were going to start a news service from absolute scratch then, Kevin, you're right.  I like reportedly I would still make pages, but I would make them in this way where I would say, good.  Yeah, I got a site, but it's more of an archive.  It's more about what the hell is this thing you made?  Oh, I can go there and see what it is.  OK.  But I really like it when I get to it on Facebook or I won't give up again on Twitter.  That's where we got to go.  And we're not prepared for that.  And when we do that, here's the hard part.  Here's what's absolutely missing from both Facebook and Google.  And this is the critical thing that I say.  We have no mechanism to have a direct relationship with you as an individual to know what your interests are, to be able to give you greater relevance and value.  And if we don't get that, then we will indeed go out of business and we see the entire value of what we do to those platforms.  But if right now, as they're trying to leapfrog each other and be our friends in publishing for this period of time, which again was caused by the Germans and caused by the publishers I've yelled about,  they brought them to the table, then what we have to negotiate for is interest data back to us in a way that respects privacy, gives users full transparency, that gives them full knowledge and control of what's what.  And we can do that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think about YouTube in this.  If you put your stuff on YouTube, you really devalue it.  Of course, that's where your audience is.  But it's very hard.  YouTube now controls not only the content but the monetization of the content.  You've devalued yourself, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could argue, Leo, that if you started this company today, what would it look like to do it?  Forgetting for a moment YouTube.  It wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can tell you right now.  And I understand John Oliver being on YouTube, but I think the goal is to push you back to the show.  Is it not?  I mean, how do they feel if the only way you can soon John Oliver is on YouTube?  I don't think HBO is happy about that.  I think they're still seeing it as a promotional vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Oliver is probably a bad example because it is subscriber supported.  But if you took Trevor Noah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ads aren't in YouTube.  They're just the clips.  I like watching Trevor Noah on YouTube, but it doesn't benefit Comedy Central.  There's ads there.  There's YouTube ads.  There's no Comedy Central.  And they got a revenue split.  Which YouTube keeps a huge share of.  In fact, it's very hard to monetize.  But at the same time, do you think the Daily Show makes as much money on YouTube as it makes on Comedy Central?  But that's the wrong question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like saying, do you still sell albums?  Do you still sell cassette tapes?  Yeah, I understand.  It's reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Then you really devalue in content intensely.  And it becomes all about the platform.  And the platform owner makes all the money.  And it's slavery for the content creators.  It's a feudal system.  This is what my argument is.  What we're doing right now is in content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we have to recognize in media is it's a relationship business.  And we don't see that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those platforms understand that.  And what I think the platforms understand is it's a feudal system.  And they own the big domains.  And they're going to let you work in the fields.  And thank you very much.  Now is our time to negotiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that's what I'm saying.  Now is our time.  How can we negotiate?  We already lost.  Because, again, they need our content.  They need our friendliness in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's always going to be somebody who'll be glad to be a surf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the other half of this is you don't know who's going to be famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.  So the other half of this is you don't know who's going to be successful and who's going to be famous.  And that is the other half of the media equation is you're never quite sure what's going to take off and what's going to crash.  And that has been amplified by the Facebookization and buzzfeedization of everything in that somebody did a very good article about this a couple of months ago where they said,  What are the most popular things on Facebook?  If you look at it from month to month, there's no pattern to it at all.  It is just like noise and some things take off and some things don't.  And the buzz feeds and so on are sitting there chasing the zeitgeist and trying to work out what it is that will get them there this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I, for one, don't want to work on Maggie's farm anymore.  We're going to take a break and change the subject.  Well, there's lots more to talk about.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's passionate about this.  As you can see.  And Kevin Marks.  And our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.

And in fact, I came in with an open mind and it was closed by the discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that.  It's good that we had Kevin here because Kevin actually knows his stuff and I don't.  Well, it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's perfect because I think you understand the issues faces publishers are facing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So let's while we're on controversial stuff, let's go back to Europe.  OK, the top European court turned out.  Oh, it's a biggie. It's a biggie.  The safe harbor data safe harbor has been killed by the European court.  So what this means is that any American technology company who is operating in Europe is going to have to store user data in Europe.  It gets worse. Oh, but wait, there's more because there is no single standard across all of Europe.  They're going to have to treat each of the 20, however many countries it is, 27, 29 differently.  So if you're in France, you're going to store the data in France in a certain way.  And if you're in Germany, you can store it in Germany in a certain way.  You've got to figure out who the heck is from where and what rules their data has.  And you're not allowed to bring it here. Thank you, NSA.  I mean, I'll blame the European court for what I think could be potentially disastrous decision.  But I certainly understand why it's there because our dear American government and the NSA spooked the world.  Literally on this. This is not appealable.  It's another one of those situations where if you're Facebook and Google and, you know, I was talking to somebody from an analytics company today.  If you look at the cashing, that's going to be done for AMP pages.  Not to go back to that. How does that get done country by country?  How do you split up your data? Part of the irony here is I'm going to have to say to you, do you live in France?  I'm going to have to cookie you so I don't cookie you because I need to cookie you to say where I store your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't store your stuff. Please check a box as to which country you are in.  Don't worry, we won't remember that the next time you come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you'll have to check the box again. This all comes from Max Schrems, who's an Austrian, I believe, who has made a big, big campaign against Facebook.  And he won. And that was Stodin said, oh, great victory from the court.  And Schrems congratulated him because it's anti NSA, but it's also anti Silicon Valley in a potentially really, really difficult way.  And just like Right to be Forgotten, there are these implications for these decisions that are just simply not thought through.  And it's uh-oh time. Any reaction, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I worry that we're going to get to this point where you just we're going backwards, where the national borders will not only stop, you know, traffic and people, but it'll stop data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what this means. All kinds of right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's yeah, the challenge here is that it's a jurisdiction issue.  It's a it's a which country's law apply to this data.  And they've had this sort of hand wave that says, oh, we you can do what you like.  We won't worry about that.  And this has come home to roost now because they had because there are very different laws in the US and the EU about how companies are supposed to handle personal identity.  So what we need is an international treaty.  Yeah, because those go so well like TPP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but that's what those things are for. Right.  Resolving differences in national laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be that would be a way to do this, a way to handle this.  And the challenge is this was a treaty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was an agreement. That was the point.  But it got rejected.  It was it was an international safe harbor because it violated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was actually was it a treaty was an agreement.  I mean, it was a member of understanding, I think.  But the point is that the just just like the US Supreme Court will occasionally say something that affects lots of businesses.  The EU Court has just done one of those here.  And so they will now have to either legislate at the EU level to try and work this out.  Or and in the meantime, there'll be a lot of chaos and noise as they try and work out what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, don't blame Snowden for this.  Blame the NSA for this.  Snowden just revealed it.  I just said I blame the NSA.  I don't know.  There are people in the chat room said, oh, Snowden, that traitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Snowden just I disagree with Snowden that this is an unalloyed victory for good sense.  Yes, it's a victory against the NSA.  Yes, it's a slap against them.  But if you see a larger picture of the world and I understand why he doesn't, then then I think it still brings issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there any way to solve this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The challenge has been that the NSA was supposed to not spy on American persons but was allowed to spy on overseas persons.  And the British and the Germans had the opposite law and a bunch of the others as well.  And so what they would then do was just spy on each other and exchange data with each other.  So this is sort of this is partly closing that loophole.  So this is this is saying, OK, the fact that America is allowed to spy on Europeans in American law.  But we've just we decided we're actually going to force the European law about this.  And probably the revelations about the NSA tapping the Greek prime minister's phone and the German prime minister's phone and those those kinds of things are part of this.  Because the European politicians and the judges are not going to be comfortable with that point of view.  And part of that is, yes, there's some anti-Americanism going on there.  But part of it is the NSA has ridiculously overstepped the bounds of what's reasonable and aggrandized all data in the world to itself.  And so this is this is the pushback against that.  And the collateral damage is that a lot of these companies that depend on tracking data are going to be up against it, too.  So in another way, this is another blow against the sort of ad tech noise.  But it's but it's also potentially more of a blow because a lot of ad tech stuff isn't actually PII, although some of it is.  And the sketchy parts of it are the this is also going to be complicated for Facebook and Google and so on because they're going to have to work out how to partition their data centers and work out what to move between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not just the data center itself.  It's also the structure of how do you the lawyers are going to be going heyday on this because how do you protect yourself from liability to say, oh, that's a French person.  And I know that's a French person, but I don't know it.  And this is how I have to behave with their data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, and again, it's a scale thing.  So Facebook and Google already have European data centers because they do it for latency reasons.  And but the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Kevin, tell me if I'm wrong.  They tend to be mirrors.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  You know, there flows freely.  There's no there's no partitioning of saying, aha, that's European data that can't come to the US.  And then what does it mean to come to the US?  You know, the other question is, so I'm a French reader of the New York Times.  So the New York Times has to worry about this, too.  It's not just Google and Facebook.  The New York Times has said, how am I going to serve that reader?  And I've got, you know, American airline advertisers.  I want to send to them.  I've got American content and I serve it for my American servers.  And now you're telling me that I got these problems.  It's it's.  We can talk about something happier now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Vladimir Putin celebrating his 63rd birthday and telling Google to act better.  Now, I wouldn't have known about it if it weren't for this fabulous new feature.  Thank you, Jack Dorsey.  It's called Twitter Moments.  It's funny because we know we knew we've talked about this for a long time.  Twitter's been working on this and then Jack Dorsey becomes CEO and boom, it comes out.  You got a feeling that maybe Jack said, what do you got?  What do you got in the closet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let that out. Maybe look at that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you didn't sound too happy about it.  I have to say it's not the Web page doesn't really bring it to life.  I think Facebook Moments is really designed for the I'm sorry.  And Twitter Moments is really designed for the the mobile experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, here's it's meh.  All right. So I already know that six thousand prisoners to be released.  I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me describe what it is.  It's a curated special tab on your Twitter client desktop or mobile that contains.  Selected by a human, not not because you follow people, it's not people you follow tweets in in a variety of areas, news, sports, entertainment, fun.  And then there's a today tab, which is, you know, there's overlap.  But this is today's news.  It very much if you're on mobile very much has that Snapchat look to it.  So when you click a story, you swipe right to see tweets and obviously this picture and video heavy Putin.  So, for instance, Italian cell phone company Caviar made a special six three thousand dollar iPhone six with the golden head of Vladimir Putin on it.  Obviously kissing up Putin celebrated with playing ice hockey against NHL stars unaccountably scoring seven straight goals.  Apparently nobody wanted to be the guy who blocked.  I think the goalie just went home.  And so this is so this is an example.  It's very Snapchat discovery.  And then when you go on, you can read other stories.  And then when you get the end, it says you cut up check later today for updates or swipe more to explore and you swipe and you get news sports entertainment fun.  It's reminds me a lot of Snapchat.  So what do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me, me, you know, the the I mean, fine.  And I understand what they're trying to do with it, but it's kind of going against Twitter.  It's creating a mass experience.  Everything the same for everybody.  Maybe they'll maybe they'll make it more relevant in the future.  But, you know, so I know that I already know most of what I see in the news tab because I'm a news guy.  And so I read lots of news.  But you're unusual.  So unusual.  That's fine.  So I go to the entertainment tab and I say, OK, there may be something there.  But, you know, one of the things there is that Homeland has its premiere.  Well, yes, that was three nights ago.  Right.  And when I look at that, I see half a dozen tweets from people I don't know.  That's kind of mean list to me that tells me that, yeah, OK, so carries back.  And I mean, what I think we have to go back to say, what's the user need for this experience?  What Twitter is saying in part is we need to get people into Twitter who will have friends on Twitter.  So we've got to give them something.  I get that.  And the log out page has now got this at the top.  Right.  What I like on Twitter is the fact that there's people I know whose wit and views I appreciate.  OK, so you're an experienced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is not probably for the experienced Twitter user.  I think I can imagine the discussion that went on on Twitter, which is how do we people use Twitter?  They sign up, they look at it, they don't understand what they're getting.  They tried to suggest a user list to help you craft a feed that has something you want in it.  People don't get Twitter.  We're not growing very fast anymore.  What if we surface the best content on Twitter in one of these tabs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is this the way I want to find out that story?  So Texas executed another person.  I look at those tweets.  It's not as good as a news story.  I mean, I say we've got to move past the article and change the article and change all this stuff.  Fine.  So I'm all open to new forms.  But if you sit back and say, is this a superior experience to find out about that news?  Well, weren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I'm mistaken.  You weren't big on Snapchat Discover either, right?  Or were you?  No, I liked it.  I liked it.  So to me, it's exactly the same thing.  A brand, not my friends.  A brand creates a Snapchat.  I think I'm going to have to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there they do a much better job producing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, OK, maybe that's just going to take a while to do it.  The brand's creative for Snapchat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the end of the day, what's the value I get out of this as a user?  In the long run, what's the essence of Twitter?  So to me, to make that bridge work, what you've got to do is to say, I know you're interested.  Here's stuff you'd be interested in and give me a relevant Twitter.  Twitter has to be relevant to me.  Any old bozo talking, I don't care about.  I want things that are somehow relevant to me because I know the topic, because I care about the topic.  But what if you're a new user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How would they know what's relevant to you as a new user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sign in through Facebook and take what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Use Facebook's signals.  So here's the Discover.  I feel like this is kind of a similar idea.  It's a little more brand focused, so a brand is going to be more likely.  And the brands, of course, create the content, so the content might be a little bit better.  Certainly the brand has an incentive to do that.  Here's another way to look at it.  But they say, by the way, Snapchat says this is hugely successful.  Yes. I hear huge traffic to publishers.  Great traffic, great engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the question, Liam.  Another way to pose the question.  Is the essence of Twitter to give me a news fact or is the essence of Twitter to give me, to link me to a person I'm going to find interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem for Twitter.  No one freaking knows.  Yeah.  So they've got to figure out a way to grow because I mean, you and I have been using, when did you start using it?  2007, probably, right?  I mean, we've had a lot of time to get, cultivate our feed.  I understand that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand it didn't grow.  And I get that.  But again, what's the essence of Twitter?  If you're going to promote what the essence is.  Well, and I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look at my Twitter feed.  It's a disjointed mess.  It looks like people are speaking in, you know, they've had strokes or they're speaking some strange language.  I don't, it's a disjointed mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made a list.  I don't even look at my main feed anymore because it's too messy to fix.  I have a list of media walks that I curate.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is almost like a completely separate, this is flipboard basically.  It's a completely separate product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rather than getting a New York Times story, I get one tweet that says, repeats five times.  The guy was killed. The guy was killed. The guy was killed.  I know.  Right.  So I'm sympathetic to what Twitter's trying to do.  But I just think you've got to pull back and say, what are we really?  Google always knows, and they started off today to say it.  We organize the world's information to make it universally accessible.  That's what we do.  Everything we do fits under that.  Facebook connects people.  So what is Twitter?  What is Twitter?  I don't think they've answered that question.  You think Jack Dorsey is the guy to answer that question?  I think it's the same problem.  Listen, how many years do we go through what is Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yahoo doesn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because again and again and again they didn't know and they still don't know.  I would say the same problem exists for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This looks like Yahoo as well, which is the other thing that's kind of scary.  That's true.  Well, it does on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's look at the web page because this is the same content.  But when you look at it on the web, the website is very, it's very much a portally kind of,  a lot of wasted space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I want to come in as a user and say, what's going on today?  Give me 15 top headlines.  Am I going to do it through this?  Or for that matter, am I going to go to old fashioned news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more engaging on mobile than it is on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm using it on mobile right now.  Now, if I go to the entertainment tab, that's a little better because it's more serendipitous.  It's also more entertaining.  Tom Hanks finds student ID.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a couple of days ago.  I mean, they're going to have to work harder to get this to be more, more up to date, I think.  I like this use of the Getty image archive.  Historic pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think, Kevin?  What is Twitter already exists?  It already is what it is.  It already does something as well and badly.  What do you believe the essential value of Twitter is?  How would you express that in a tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've written essays about this.  I'm not sure if I've done it in tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know this is hard for you, Kevin.  I know it's very hard, but I know you can do it, Guy.  I know you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The essence of it for me is mutual media.  The point is that we're each filtering the world for each other, and what we see through whom we follow is what makes sense to the world.  That's very much the core of Twitter as it has been for us.  So you agree with Jeff, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the value you get?  Is it that somebody linked you to the best version of a given story about something that you're going to care about?  Is it that you discovered a fact that you got really quickly?  Both?  In the other days, I'm glad I had Twitter today because...  How do you finish that sentence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mostly because I had a conversation about something with somebody.  That's actually the piece that...  That's hard as hell.  ...draws you back in.  I got up this morning and swore about Google's AMP, and the PM of it said,  oh, no, sorry, we've got to change something and fixed it.  That was my Twitter experience this morning.  So here's another way to look at it.  I was sitting there waiting for the kettle to boil and grumbling about Google's latest thing, and they patch it in front of me.  So that was my Twitter moment for today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So go to the celebrity world.  Instagram today released...  I don't think it's on the rundown, but released yesterday or today.  It's top users, and they're primarily celebrity women starting with, guess who, Taylor Swift.  That's another way to do it.  Here's the world through these people you might find interesting, and through them you might find some other people interesting.  So it's about people in that case.  I just don't see it's about headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's what Twitter has done before.  Twitter already does that when you try and join up.  Exactly.  Follow Lady Gaga, follow Justin Bieber.  It's like, no, stop it.  If I log into Twitter with my other account that doesn't follow anyone, it'll give me like three pages of that nonsense as well.  Why don't you follow blah, blah, blah?  I'm not sure I can do it on this one.  But it does that thing.  The other thing Twitter shipped was highlights.  Do you see that?  Or is that only going to some people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  Where is that?  Twitter Shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter highlights?  What the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let me show you the highlights.  If you go to...  They will actually pop up as notifications.  But if I go to highlights...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, actually, yes, I'm getting that on my Android device as well now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay, so that's what we're about to.  So that is more like Flipboard.  Yeah, but it's in your notifications, which is weird.  But it is also in the menu.  If you go to the top right and click it, there's a place to find it.  But what this is, is people you follow...  And it gives you a little reason at the top.  It says, two of these people follow this thing.  This is trending news in your area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This requires that they know something about you.  This requires that you are logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is trying to give you...  This is a parallel thing to the...  The other one is, here's the front page of the world.  Here's what's going on.  This is good.  Whereas this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this seems to be with a new app.  I've never seen this.  This is all right.  I like this.  So it's obvious Twitter's casting around.  Which I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm empathetic with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, so first of all, were you surprised that Jack Dorsey is the new CEO?  Somebody mentioned there's going to be a lawsuit.  There'll be a shareholder lawsuit because the board said unequivocally,  we will not hire somebody who's going to be a CEO of two companies.  Clearly pointed at Jack Dorsey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was there that kind of discussion when Jobs was heading up two companies?  What was the discussion?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because he was never CEO of Pixar at the same time.  He was chairman of the board.  Oh, okay.  That role was running again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the point being that if the board makes a material statement about the future,  like we will never hire somebody who's CEO of two companies and then does it,  that's a shareholder lawsuit because shareholders are investing based on material statements from the board.  And for whatever, I don't know if that made the stock go up or down,  but in any event, then you don't do it.  That's a big deal.  You can't do that.  That was very undisciplined to the board.  And some have speculated that it was really, I think it was Ben Thompson and Strutechery who speculated that really that was Ev Williams saying,  under no circumstances will I allow Jack Dorsey to come back.  I want to be clear about this.  Of course, Ev posted on Medium how wonderfully happy he is to have.  But Ben says this is somewhat of a lukewarm endorsement.  Why I'm glad Jack is back at Twitter.  So I don't know.  There's a lot of stuff behind the scenes here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She posted on Medium, not on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure he linked to it on Twitter.  Hello, Teddy.  We can never run an A-B test and see what Twitter would have become had Jack State, had I not fired, had Jack State in the role from 2008 or if I stayed in the role from 2010.  One good thing for Jack is that Dick Costolo is leaving the board.  So he only has one of two previous CEOs looking over his shoulder.  I, boy, Jack, I don't, you know.  What do you think?  I don't know.  I mean, didn't Jack have a chance before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Adam Bain, who's now COO, was the.  I know he's your favorite.  Yeah.  Well, people just like him a lot.  I worked with him many, many, many years ago.  Really well thought of.  He's a revenue guy.  He's a business guy.  He's sane.  He's, you know, this is part of what I went to is does the company need the founder or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The shill in the chat room saying, and I think this is right, Twitter is being held to a big tech growth standard by the stock market.  That's totally unrealistic, not sustainable.  But it's the way it is.  You know, we've talked about this before.  It's a shame that Twitter can't just be Twitter as messy.  And one of the things a lot of people have said is now that Dick Costello has gone, Twitter should reach out to the developers, the third party developers that Costello banned, threw out, trashed and say, come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need you.  That's why I mentioned that they also just killed an API and I can't find it.  Oh, yeah.  They killed an API today after Jack takes over.  I'm trying to find it.  That room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You may see that one should be reliable share count API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.  Thank you.  Boy, you're good at Google.  That Google works for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's what's what's the what's this API?  It's a public API which makes it possible for plugin developers to or just anybody who's coding in the context of a Web page to see how often that page has been shared via Twitter.  So I guess you can make a query to the API saying, hey, how many people are linking to me?  Of course, this is an article from the stack.  It's the end of a free ride after the shutdown of the ability to read back statistics from a Json endpoint.  Those wanting to continue to display vanity metrics will need to either accept the limitations of the aggregate and non comprehensive rest API.  In other words, not the fire hose or dig deep to begin to use more comprehensive statistics via canip, which has the fire hose.  I don't know what this this means, but this site says it's a bold monetizing move on the part of Twitter.  So I couldn't judge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so it's not quite clear, but it sounds like it's they want the irony is that the top of the page has like the little 70 tweet shares embedded in the page.  Right.  So it's total shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is that what the API was?  I don't know.  Let me actually read what Twitter said about it rather than the second order interpretation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good thinking.  A new design for tweet and follow buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a high contrast sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.  My better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the 40.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is that 46 inches.  Because you're a big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well also I feel like the bigger the screen the better with this stuff.  I am I am really not convinced that smart watches are worth a dime.  And I've worn I'm sure not buying another one until I see something that says it's  more clearly better than this.  I'm sure you're not buying another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure you're not buying another one until I see something that says it's more clearly  better than this.  So it's the same functionality.  It's the same upper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah the Moto 360 is fine.  The early one is fine.  This is just you know what's different on this.  It's basically the same.  They have a better processor but it's different bands and designs.  That's all.  And I think route is great.  I really.  This looks like I'm wearing a wristwatch right.  Here's the Huawei which actually that's the original the original 360.  So it's a little bit bigger.  You're not wearing the Huawei Jason.  I'm surprised.  The Huawei looks a lot like the 360.  It's round.  It's thick.  It's ugly.  And they all do the same kind of useless things.  Here comes the Huawei.  Jason is now running around.  I'm going to have three watches before this day is done.  And then the sport is coming sometime at some point.  Oh we got the box of the Huawei in the box.  See if I can.  I don't know.  I just I feel like this whole category is just nothing.  It's a flop.  It reminds me of Google Glass.  Doesn't that look exactly the same.  It's got a leather band but you can get a leather band on watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the thing.  Yeah.  And well there was already use of the differentiation and making them out of gold and so on.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and Hermes bands and stuff.  So anyway I thought I'd mention that Marshmello is here.  Are you excited.  I have Marshmello.  You do.  No not officially.  I do because Jason Howell is the man.  And they talked about this last night and all about Android.  He took a Nexus 7 and a side loaded it with just flashed the image that they posted.  But you have a Nexus 6 right Jeff.  That's what you're using.  That'll get the updates.  I keep pressing update update update update.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean this is a this is a step up to the next version.  So my thought was why not start from scratch.  So if I flash it wiped it started clean that way I know for sure.  You know I'm not bringing I'm not carrying over any cruft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do the now tap tap.  What is it called now.  Now on tap now on tap.  Yeah.  And continue.  So if.  So hello Leo La Demo.  I love it.  Let's go to G.C.O.  Oh it's I have to do it in an app.  You can do it in anything.  I could do it in the in Chrome's an app obviously.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anything that has any text on it.  Grab contextual show you how fast and loads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then I search for Obama.  Whoops.  Dot net framework.  You could talk to it.  Oh you're so fancy.  We don't talk to the talking better on the marshmallow.  I don't think so.  No.  So Obama apologizes to everybody it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the am thing didn't show up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Interesting huh.  So I just tap what I press.  You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your home button just press and hold it.  Press and hold the home button and it'll go.  Google now on tap and you can let go now and it'll analyze and give you.  Cards related stuff that are related to the stuff it finds on the page.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it will do this with apps if apps support it.  That has to specifically support it.  So I looked up Hillary Clinton it says maybe you'd be interested in Bernie Sanders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to influence the election.  You see you see what else is new Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see the this looks very similar.  I understand that they have a simpler system of notifications.  Oh yeah that's a lot.  I kind of like the priority thing with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's funny I was actually just reading on that a little bit earlier.  So what you get now is the hold down volume all the way down and it'll go to complete silence eventually which you didn't have in Lollipop you know.  Steps right.  So you get that great.  And now I can do this.  If you still want to do do not disturb slash priority mode which by the way you can set up multiple different aspects to that.  So like weeknights versus weekends versus you know all this kind of stuff.  You have to go into your your settings pull down.  So go do the double double finger swipe down from the top and I'll give you your settings pull down.  And then there's a little do not disturb.  I'm sure there are tap that and then that'll bring you through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's kind of the same thing but it's in a different spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It takes a little bit more to get to.  So if that's the thing you really like it requires a little more effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think this they wanted to give you more information about what the do not disturb was.  Yeah there was a lot of confusion around around that.  And then here's the here's the set.  This looks very similar doesn't it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have very from from a visual standpoint it's very similar to the only pop.  You know some of the bigger things that you're going to see are going to happen behind the scenes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those in particular which is now it's too early to know if we're getting better battery life I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I've noticed pretty consistently on my Nexus 6.  I've been running the developer previews you know since they've been doing them.  And I absolutely noticed a big difference with those.  If you're working if you're working you set your device down or you leave it unplugged overnight.  The battery loss is significantly lower than it was before Marshmallow.  It's Flappy Bird.  They did change it.  It can be multiplayer by the way.  So when you first fire it up it'll have the number up at the top and you can increase players.  So if you have a large tablet all of you can gather around the tablet and play this impossible game.  I hate this game so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah it's pretty bad.  So you're flying through Marshmallow.  Yeah.  Every time I get stuck on Marshmallow.  So there you have it.  Yeah.  It really could have been 5.2 I guess.  Maybe there's a lot more inside.  There's actually some security stuff that is that is probably significant.  Although guess what?  Stage fright is back and it still affects Marshmallow.  No.  It's a new one though.  You have to download or play a malformed MP3 file or MP4 pile.  Actually the state this Imperium discovered it again but they don't have yet stage fright detector.  I don't think for the new one let me just download and install this and see.  I think this stage fright detector which is the one we recommend.  What?  I don't want that.  I want this.  Begin analysis.  Oh I just tapped the wrong thing.  I thought I was trying to trick you into installing.  These are all the old stage fright.  So at least Marshmallow is safe from that.  You don't have to turn off MMS reception on Hangouts.  But there's a new one and you have to be a little bit careful about what MP3s and MP4s.  Even Preview will infect you if it's a malcrafted MP3 MP4.  Kind of a big issue I think for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be a persistent issue until they address it underneath.  Maybe with the next version of Android they kind of move away from the stage fright way of handling media at its core and do something different.  Or hey they should improve the way that they roll out updates so everybody gets them regardless of anyone else's interruption.  That's an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now on tap doesn't require cooperation of the app so I can press and hold the home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will analyze pretty much anything on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I want to know more about stage fright, it's kind of a scant amount of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say one thing that I'm really liking is how Marshmallow is handling permissions, just app permissions.  So launching an app for the first time, it wants to access the camera.  It will pop up a nice looking little toast message that says do you want to grant access to the camera.  And then from that point on the app has access to the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's more granular. You can say no and the app will still work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And hopefully the developers have worked in a way to make that Marshmallow ready so that it kind of degrades gracefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never seen so long a list of things Facebook needs to access.  Welcome to Facebook. It wants everything.  It wants everything.  So even though it asked for and I gave it permission to do all those things, it's still going to ask some explicit permissions as the app happens.  That's what of course iOS does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the way that my opinion and the way that it should have been all along.  I think it makes the most sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Marshmallow Moto 360 still waiting for my five.  I mean, I think I'm gonna get the six P not the five X.  I'm gonna get this go for the six P.  Jeff, did you decide what you want to do on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I already ordered. I did.  The P. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So I so if I get the Pixel C.  I'm now thinking I should have gotten a 128 gig.  No, because because I use my Nexus seven to watch movies and shows on planes and stuff.  If I use my if I use my Nexus six P, then I might want more space for it.  But it's too late. I've already ordered it.  That's that. It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think 64. You probably got 64.  Right. I think that's I did.  Yeah, I mean, how a movie is a gigabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many movies do you need?  I feel this well because I have like like, you know, five episodes of Good Wife and I have four of humans and I have three of I like and she more of that.  I want a little variety.  You know, you know, I'm gone in weird places and, you know, watch watch shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you weren't scared of Google, maybe you will be now.  They're working on a general purpose robot.  And according to Bloomberg Biggest Business, they are making strides.  So to speak, great strides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I just don't want that nurse that what's his name has.  She's harsh. Yes. Yes.  But at least she does. I do so many bad things.  You know, you must you must eat your broth.  She took away a sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He made himself a nice grilled cheese.  She said no.  But at least she doesn't leak blue fluid out of her nose like that old one.  That'll ruin your day.  All right. What are there what are their stories here?  Google and Israel are going to the moon.  Not a big deal. Just that contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's all Alphabet's new motto or I don't know what it is.  It's not evil.

Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Motorola, I was a little disappointed on the Moto X.  I'm now glad that I didn't stick with the Moto X has decided that when they do the Marshmallow  upgrade, they're going to take out all the things that Motorola made the Moto X so great.  Assist.  You're kidding me.  They're going to take out all the enhancements.  Say, oh, we don't need to do it anymore because Marshmallow does it all so well.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Motorola is kind of backsliding a little bit right now is what everybody's saying.  Also, they announced their update schedule for Marshmallow and of all the devices that  they are updating, they are not updating this year's Moto E.  This year's Moto E is not updating to Marshmallow.  It's not included on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think they know something about performance?  It's not the point of Moto E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Moto E is supposed to be like two years ago as a model, so it's really cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they posted on their site a few months ago.  Man, I have to pull up the All About Android doc to find it.  They posted something about never having to worry, like this is going to be updated, blah, blah, blah.  I'll have to find the exact...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you still have your Mattel Viewmaster here?  We got the new Viewmaster.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You got the new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got it already?  The new one?  I was going to go to the store tonight.  Yeah, Jason Plathis bought it.  Nice.  This is the cardboard thing?  This is cardboard.  It's cheap, 29 bucks.  And thank you, Jason.  Jason loves VR.  Comes with a little AR thing too.  Yeah, it does.  So it's kind of cool looking.  I can see kids being into this.  You have to hold it, of course, because it's a Viewmaster.  And then what do you do, Jason?  You show it the disc, you take a picture of the disc.  So here's a disc.  This is very strange.  You would expect it to somehow...  Remember, Viewmasters, they have these little discs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because you stick it in the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, no, not anymore.  Now you just look at it.  What do you do?  You just look at it?  Put it on the table and then point at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you load the app...  Oh, I got to put my phone in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not standalone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't sure.  I was like, maybe Jason had one loaded in there when he had it into the oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a cardboard without the actual straps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, cardboard didn't have straps either, right?  So will it fit any size phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, cardboard had no straps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do I put it?  Oh, in here.  Oh, okay.  So this is good.  It has kind of some sort of mechanism to hold...  Let's see.  This is the biggest phone you'd ever try to get in here, right?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to fit the 6.  It might not fit the big one.  It might not fit the 6.  The Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It said the 6 is hard to get in.  You just load a case over it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get it in.  There you go.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I have to do anything?  So you have to download an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I have to have an app on here.  My God.  What's next?  Is it the cardboard app?  You have a little QR code here I could probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Mattel zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Search for Mattel.  Search for Mattel?  All right.  I can use my phone.  No, no, no.  Look.  What's the point if we don't do it all from scratch, right?

I think the kids would love this.  In-app purchases.  Proceed.  I don't care if it's...  I think I'm on Wi-Fi anyway.  I don't know why they ask you that if you're on Wi-Fi.  You should just say, okay.  So this is 279 megabytes of animal pictures.  Wow.  So what do I point at the disk for if I'm downloading the software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you have to either pay for the content...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you have to pay for the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...or use the demo reel to activate limited content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you either pay for the content because you see it says in-app purchases.  Right.  Or you can use the demo reel, the little disk, and that gives you a demo of it.  That's really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Quite the same magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how much in-app is it going to be, does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the paid for is like 15 bucks.  What?  Per content.  Per slide.  This is only 27 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you want to do anything with it, you've got to buy another $15 program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can use any cardboard app with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just works with cardboard.  Okay.  So yeah, so there's a lot of cardboard stuff out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's content on YouTube you can view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and this would do the YouTube 3D stuff, or the 360 stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see the yellow full-time slider on the back by your eyes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The yellow slider here?  Yeah, what does that do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like the magnet in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's your button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ...so it activates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the build of it.  You know, it's good.  I like it.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because cardboard as a cardboard piece of hardware is great because it's inexpensive,  but it's not awesome if you use it.  Four head-drakes.  Yes, that happens, and it's just not durable over time, especially if you have kids.  We have a lot of these just for students to use in our new class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cardboard.  Not these, but yeah, cardboard.  So I'm going to get these like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  A little 3D world should pop up above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says, look at a reel.  Oh, oh, there's little aminals on my reel.  Oh, I wish you could see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we had a Chromecast set up, you could cast to it.  It's augmented reality.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Rotate the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's augmented reality.  Oh, the reel.  Oh, hi, little kangaroo.  Now what do I do?  I look at a dot and press a lever?  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw the video of it.  You can open it and it'll still play if you want to show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I?  Yeah.  It's just a piece of scrap.  It'll stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now how do I get back to the reel?  Oh, now what's going on?  Okay.  Back.  Back, back, back, back.  Okay, so now press play and it's going to look at a reel.  Okay, I have a, this is actually a very cool effect.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, just lift it up like it's in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like make it go horizontal.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pull lever to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to go.  Okay, now start real quick.  This is cool.  Where do you see this?  See, there's the reel.  Yeah.  Now watch.  There's little aminals on it.  And then I can rotate that.  So this is augmented reality.  See, I hit it with my finger.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll adjust to the angle of the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I can pick up the disc?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that is sweet.  That's very sweet.  That is pretty cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you pick a different animal and you click on the little icon, the yellow.  Okay.  Let's wrap it up.  On a viewmaster.  One more ad and then I'll let you run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, can you stay here for a minute?  Yes, I can.  Because I want to get your number.  Okay.  All right, our show today brought to you by Braintree.  We love Braintree.  Braintree.  All mobile app developers should love Braintree.  This is a solution you've been looking for.  A way to integrate a payment solution into your mobile app or your website.  Simple 10 lines of code.  Works with everything.  Yeah, they love JavaScript.  Node.js.  Perl.  Python.  Ruby.  All of it.  Look at the v.0 SDK at braintreepayments.com slash twig and you will be impressed.  And as soon as you've integrated it, or by the way, you can do this in the sandbox to get a sense of it.  You'll be ready to accept Apple Pay and PayPal and Venmo and credit cards and Bitcoin.  And you know what?  When the new payment system comes along, like let's say Android Pay, you just check a box in the config and boom, it's there.  It's really critical.  And these days any online business has to add this capability.  You got to make payments.  If you've got payments, you got to make it easy.  That's what Uber does.  That's what Lyft does.  Airbnb.  A couple of days ago, I talked to Ankur Arya.  He's the general manager for Braintree Mobile about how standards have evolved in mobile payments.  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buying on mobile is now becoming table stakes, right?  I always give the example of the average mobile user may have 50 apps on their phone.  Ten of those apps have to do with some sort of commerce.  Five or six of them work as seamlessly as Uber and Munchery and Airbnb and Lyft.  The consumer is going to have that same expectation from kind of all of their buying experiences on that device.  And so I think that's kind of the macro trend that we're seeing is seamless buying on a mobile device is becoming sort of the key to converting users and keeping your mobile users happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, they just acquired Harper Reads Company.  And that's exactly what Harper Reads Company, I can't remember the name of it, does is kind of well, the buyable pins on Pinterest are an example.  This kind of seamless experience wherever you go.  Braintree is amazing.  The payouts to you are fast.  Support to you is continuous.  You'll always be ready.  And they are ready to handle you from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.  That's look at their client list.  You'll see fewer abandoned carts.  You'll see more sales with Braintree's best in class mobile checkout experience.  If you have any questions, you'd like to try the sandbox, go to BraintreePayments.com slash twig.  BraintreePayments.com slash twig.  Tell the boss.  Tell your colleagues.  If you're the decider, tell yourself.  Oh, and I should tell you something else.  Fifty thousand dollars your first fifty thousand dollars in transactions fee free BraintreePayments.com slash twig.  Now, let's let Jeff Jarvis give us his number of the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Decamp Google finds out that 30 percent in San Francisco, 30 percent of 911 calls are accidental, but dials.  How does Google know that?  Because it was a 20 percent project because the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management wanted to know why the hell between 2011 and 2014 the number of calls had gone up 28 percent.  More but dials.  But dials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, because it's the only button on the front page of the phone.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And even if it's not a locked phone, right, it says.  Even if there's no SIM card in it, you can always make an emergency card.  And I've almost done it.  I guess what happens is the poor, you know, is awful because it takes resource.  You have to call and make sure that it was.  They don't know if it's accidental.  Somebody called.  I once called 911 when I was having a difficulty with a contractor and I hung up because he left.  And then by God, they called me back immediately.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They should call you back.  They should.  Right.  So they have to call.  They have to devote a certain amount of time with every call to find out that, oh, I'm sorry.  It's a but dial.  So something has to be done.  I don't know what.  But that was the first piece of data that showed that.  So I thought it was music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think it's more in San Francisco than is there more but dialing going on?  I stop.  I stop right now.  Stop.  Stop right there.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just can't believe I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going off to see a movie.  Oh, you're going to see Jobs.  Let us know how you like it.  Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I got to make the screen.  Thanks, Jeff Jarvis.  BuzzMachine.com.  Have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Buy his books.  See you guys.  See you next Wednesday.  Kevin Marks, anything you want to share with us as long as you're still here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got, well, I got a couple of things.  One which I may have mentioned before, I'm not sure, which was the InstaWeather watch  face.  You were talking about watches earlier.  And this, I've made this my watch face a while ago and I still love it.  I saw your raindrops.  And that was obviously to show you the raindrops.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it shows you the current weather where you are.  I just put the link in the...  Yeah, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see.  So basically InstaWeather watch face is you put it on your phone and it gives you a really  nice graph of what the weather's doing now and what it's going to do soon and lets you  click between different things.  And then one of the options in the background is to give you like a nice picture of what  the weather's like, which here is usually blue skies.  That's just what you get because I'm in San Jose.  And last Wednesday there were raindrops on my watch because it was actually raining outside.  Something you hadn't seen in a long time.  So the one I like is the one with the graphs on.  Not that one.  Next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a video.  We don't have any choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's a video.  Okay, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But fortunately they like it too.  I thought you were doing on yours.  No, I'm installing it right now.  I use a different one called Weather Face, but I'm going to install this InstaWeather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing I like about it is the...  I'll see if I can get it in a state where I can show it to you on my wrist.  Hold on.  Look at that.  I can take it off my wrist so I can show it.  Otherwise I'm going to break my arm.  So you get...  Too much light again.  Can you see that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tilt it.  Yeah, other way.  Yeah, there you go.  And then move that way.  Yeah, and now go the other way.  Now it's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a problem taking a photo of it as well.  First world issues.  A little graph of the temperature coming up and down.  And then you can switch that between temperature and precipitation, wind and cloud cover, and dew point and humidity.  Nice.  What I found is that it's really glanceable and it's nice that it does that.  But the other thing is it puts this little picture in the background of like current conditions.  And what I discovered for the first time in three months is that it shows raindrops when it's raining.  So that was quite cute.  But also it's very boasting about San Jose weather thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have weather time which will do the same thing, but this one looks even more complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is nice.  It also has a radar version and all kinds of other stuff as well.  Oh, nice.  This particular one is pretty good.  Do I have to buy a...  You were saying what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do I have to get like the...  Does it require an extra thing to do it or does it stand alone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The basic faces are free and then certain complications cost more.  Oh, look.  Yeah, so they've got some suave looking ones.  Oh, I like the radar one. That's cool.  Yeah, so it's a pretty...  It's like someone's done a really nice graphic design job on good weather data.  I think it's weather underground data. I'm not sure, but it comes up and looks nice.  It's a satellite map. Neat.  Yeah, so you can actually see where the rain's coming.  As I say, as you said, the watch thing isn't life changing,  but it's interesting enough that I do bother to charge it every day.  And the thing I charge it for is...  Weather map on your watch.  The little weather upcoming, the turn by turn directions when I'm cycling,  and shouting at my wrist when I'm in the car to change the music.  So how do I get it to do something different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how do I get it to do something different? It's just...  Oh, I see. I can add complications. I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can do more configuration on the phone.  There's like a big checklist UI on the phone.  Thank you. Good pick. I like it. I'm going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that.  And you wanted to talk about comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this was a conversation that happened this week was that Motherboard,  which is part of Vice that does good investigative journalism,  announced that they were giving up on commenting.  And they said basically...  Everybody is, aren't they?  Comments nightmare.  And so what I was trying to do was get them to understand the sort of the  indie web point of view on it.  But I had a very nice conversation with them.  They're basically saying, no, we have no development resources at all.  We can't even add two little bits of JavaScript to the top bottom of our page to do this.  And they basically already decided they weren't going to do it.  So that was kind of sad.  But I wrote a little note about thinking about it.  Because that's part of the piece of the indie web stuff that's actually working well is this ability to have the web mentions work between sites.  And if it's just works between the indie websites, then that's interesting.  And you tend to get high quality comments.  But we've also got bridges that go through other social networks and bring the tweets and things in as well.  So that's sort of where we're at with this stuff.  And it's at the point now where you could install it on a website and get something useful out of it.  So that was my sort of...  There's a bunch of interesting stuff to be done there.  And if Jeff has some news people are interested, then send them my way and I'll talk to them about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very nice.  Kevin, I want to thank you for being here.  I don't think we could have had an intelligent discussion about AMP without your input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope that was helpful.  I'll go back and play with it and see if I can work out whether I validated it correctly or not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I want to take a look at it.  But I have to say, it feels like just a burden instead of a blessing.  Just one more thing I have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Now, I mean, that is the drawback of a lot of these things.  I mean, I think it's less that you have to do than the other ones perhaps.  Right.  Well, we don't know about Apple yet.  But in some ways, it's more than what you have to do with Facebook's one,  because at least Facebook uses the actual image and video links that you already have.  Whereas this one, you've got to turn them into something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, I want to thank you and Jeff for giving me at least some empathy  into what the record industry felt like for many years.  I now understand.  We always said, why doesn't the record industry get it?  Why don't they just understand they're in a new era?  I suddenly feel like one of those guys.  Oh, I'm screwed.  Nothing I can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your stuff makes sense in its own right. That's the thing.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I hope my community will continue to partake of our programming.  We're making the best stuff we can by visiting the website or downloading.  You know, we actually are in a lot of different venues.  Yeah.  We don't have to. I mean, that's thank you to Dave Weiner and Adam Curry and the guys  and you for creating this whole notion of podcasting of an RSS feed with binary  attachments that you could subscribe to and download.  I really owe you a great debt of gratitude, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did a small part of that.  But I think the point is that that took a long time to actually start making sense.  Because at the time, I still had to plug the iPod in and sync it every day.  Now it's easy.  And it only started making more sense once you've got it in your phone and available in other places.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's pretty it's actually maybe I'm not so out of style after all.  Yeah.  Kevin, Marks, thank you so much for being here.  Of course, Indie Webcamp.  I know you always like to give a little plug, a little shout out to Indie Webcamp.  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, yes.  Tonight there's Homebrew Website Club in San Francisco at Mozilla at 530.  Quite writing our 630 meeting.  I think there's one in Portland as well tonight.  And there was there was one in Edinburgh and in Malmo in Sweden yesterday.  How cool.  So we're starting to spread out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want to find out more, go to IndieWebcamp.com and scroll down to the Homebrew Website Club.  Yes.  What a great idea.  That is awesome.  And you'll see there's lots of meetings.  Malmo, Edinburgh, Portland and San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's every it's normally every two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a great that's a great picture.
