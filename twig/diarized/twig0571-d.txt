Ant Pruitt is here in his barn apparently.  Hi Ant.  Good to see you.  Welcome.  Where's Mr. Ed?  Hello.  Hello Ant.  That is a good look.  I tell you I like that better than the white background.  That's nice.  I don't think so.  Did you build that yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I figured since this is now where my roots are going to be set,  I might as well just start chopping wood and putting stuff together.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Build that up.  Get the boys in there.  The hard heads can hammer with their heads.  That's right.  That's Jeff Jarvis.  He is the 10 out of 10 award winning, rate my Skype room professor.  Also we must say the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation.  At the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  I should have done that in my David Attenborough voice from last week.  That would have been good.  Next time I'll do that.  And all the way from the beautiful Pacific Northwest,  where she still has power even though Jeff doesn't,  it's Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello Stacey.  Well Jeff you don't have power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It's going to come back in five years unless people complain.  ISAIAS.  So you said you had breaking news as we come on the air?  That you're not breaking wind anymore?

Yeah and they you can it's actually online at abrasossanmiguel.com  and they make these.  I have many of these shirts thanks to our listener Winton Churchill who sends me these from time to time.  He also sent me a matching avocado mask.  Wow.  Look at you.  Look at you.  This confirms what I have been thinking all along which is that in the new world masks will be a  fashion statement and you will have a mask that matches your culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nancy Pelosi already does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I noticed yeah.  So that's pretty nice.  Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sent Kirsten the matching bow tie and mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're seeing a lot of clever mask designs.  Might as well if you're going to wear them might as well have them look good right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a mask prize.  There's an X prize for designing the best mask a million dollars.  This was recently announced like an hour ago.  X prize.  Did you all see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think our Jammer B our UV mask that we just bought on Kickstarter for ridiculous amount of money  should definitely win the Xbox.  Xbox.  X prize.  Look at that.  They've raised 2.3 million dollars.  Wow.  Still nine days to go.  It's not too late.  This has inside.  Meet UV mask.  The next generation reusable mask with powerful UVC purification technology.  It's like you got oats in there but no it's actually got a little vortex  that the air goes in and out through and it's lit by UV light so it's actually getting sterilized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How well there's you have to have a certain amount of coverage and length of time.  That's why it's a vortex.  How heavy is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No we won't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much did it cost you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A hundred bucks.  A hundred smackers.  It has a lithium ion battery in it because it's active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it make noise like a laptop?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know but I am John and John bought this first and I said John you can't have it if I can't  have it so I bought one too.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm with Mrs. Stacey though.  How much does it weigh?  That's what I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well so it's Kickstarter so you're going to get it after we have the vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah they say October 2020.  No we're not going to get it for years.  But you know what I think it'll be kind of like something for the Smithsonian right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Along with your cute hat maybe.  It is indicative of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is indicative of the time.  So anyway that's going to be that's going to that should win the X prize don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forget foggy glasses.  Yeah because it's like a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's going to weigh too I mean like anything on my face or my head can trigger migraines so I'm  like yeah you can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact you probably do you hate masks in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know I mean they're very useful.  They can't be tight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't be tight on you probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They they're they're right I mean they do what they do.  I don't wear them for that long because I'm never you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to the local bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I went crazy with the mask of the CPAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's like that.  I wish they said what the weight was.  Has two 1800 milliamp hour batteries so that by itself that's half a pound right there I think.  It's going to weigh something.  You're going to feel it.  You're going to know you're wearing a mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a light and a fan in it.  Yeah there's a lot of luck going on in there.  There's a lot going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've got I just had an idea for Carson.  I'm going to make him famous.  Yeah.  Since he's in a mask instead of rape my Skype room you could have  he could have a site to rate my COVID mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we are doing Carson's mask of the week you know that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no he could do a whole site.  He could he everybody who's on TV can get a screenshot.  He can be called the mask man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rate my mask man I get on Twitter.  Hey did you get a strange security message on your Twitter today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sure did sir.  Don't know why.  Who else got it.  I was on my desktop like I normally am when I'm checking out Twitter.  I just.  I was on my desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We recently got a security issue an Android OS 8 or 9.  Can you show this.  That could have impacted your understanding is 96 percent of people using Twitter for Android  already have an Android security patch installed that protects them from this vulnerability.  Since you are no law I'm not even I'm on Linux since you are no longer using a  vulnerable version of Twitter for Android on this device.  You don't need to do anything we felt was important to let you know.  Scare the pants off of you.  You know what.  You launched Twitter on my Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't get anything on my phone.  That's what I was going to say is I use it on my phone from time to time and I didn't get a thing  on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did.  It says I'm not but are you using to use the Twitter official Twitter app.  Yes sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So bizarre right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway I guess that's a word of warning for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need to go question the teenagers in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  My question is what exactly happened.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter ain't going to tell you that.  Maybe you see it's an old test next week.  Yeah I think there aren't there laws now disclosure laws.  I know there are for privacy breaches for security breaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't have to tell you.  I mean they don't.  They just have to say.  Well they do actually have to tell you what data was breached if they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's go to the privacy dot Twitter dot com website.  Twitter for Android security vulnerability.  We don't have evidence this vulnerability was exploited by hackers.  They're just going to be careful as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No it's actually they're pointing at Android.  They're saying it affects Android 8 and 9.  It's an underlying Android OS security issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know you've used Android because right now you're on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah that's interesting.  They must know I have used it or they're just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they know who you are.  I mean they know you're logging in from your account on whatever device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wasn't I wasn't having a moral panic.  Don't worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh I was like just Jeff it makes sense.  This time this is from where's it.  I need to high five you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  October October 2018 Android security vulnerability in the framework that could  enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within  the context of a privileged process.  That's about as bad as you could get.  That means they could essentially take over your.  But that was like.  That's 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that's two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or two years ago.  Yeah.  That's why it's eight and nine.  Okay well critical vulnerability but you've updated by now surely.  Yes surely.  And that's what Twitter is saying.  You know you have to wonder if this is a little bit of security theater.  They just want to say look we're on top of everything now.  We're doing our best.  After Kirk we were not taking any chances.  We were wondering why the by the way the kid who perpetrated this crime.  Did we mention this yet.  No I think not.  I think this happened since last week.  Seventeen year old just graduated high school from Tampa Florida.  I don't want to say his name because he is a minor even though he will be tried as an adult  for 30 count them 30 felonies for the Twitter hack.  He had two accomplices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's a troubled kid.  I mean it's it's a tragic story really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Twitter social engineering that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah the social engineering.  And we also I think from the indictment have a better idea of what happened.  Remember we said that he was able to get the slack credentials rather the Twitter God mode  credentials from slack which he got into we don't know how but it had two factor on it.  Good on you Twitter.  So he called he called Twitter employees posing as Twitter security.  I can imagine the call going something like hello.  This is Twitter security.  We seem to be having a problem with our authentication servers.  I just want to verify.  Could you could you open your two factor for your God mode app and are you getting the ID 602 134.  No I'm not.  What are you what are you getting.  One eight three six four two.  Oh crap.  OK well we're going to go fix that.  Bye.  OK well we're going to go fix that.  Bye.  Something like that.  That's a that's a dramatization.  Thanks for the fish.  Yeah.  He had two accomplices one in the UK another one who was from California but is in was in  Florida at the moment.  One is 22 another one was I think 17 or 18.  It's yeah you know a lot of us a lot of the people I've talked to  I won't name names somewhat privately mostly but people in my business geeks hackers they go yeah  when I did things like that when I was a kid maybe not quite so  publicism and brazen but it's not unusual for teenagers to try to push the boundaries.  And then the New York Times had a story on him and how he was mean.  He was mean to other kids.  And apparently always trying to scam him out of small amounts of money and stuff like that.  So I feel bad.  I know I'm not going to name his name because A it's just an indictment it's alleged he hasn't  been convicted and B he's a minor and I don't you know although it wouldn't be hard to find  his name it was every he was always everywhere which I agree I think that's good of you.  Isn't that the kind of the journalistic thing is you don't say the name of minors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When all of this started when all of this came came down one of the hard heads comes running  downstairs he's like you were talking about the Twitter hack on our group chat and it was a  teenager and I tried to explain to him that that it was social engineering and this is why all of  these previous years when we're out in public together as a family and people are asking us  questions I lie I lie through my teeth.  There you go.  There you go.  And they always look at my kids but always look me in the face like that's not right dad you know  just I'm like no I'm lying through my teeth on purpose because people can just skim  information you know over time and use it against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay let's try this let's try this.  Sir where were you born?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was born in Johannesburg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need an accent for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No no no he has one just the wrong one and your mother's maiden name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Edwan Shroudloo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Edwan Shroudloo there you go good article in I think ZDNet had the most Caitlin  Sempenow from Zero Day on ZDNet had the very best kind of breakdown of the hack with all  of the information and all of the you know these are the the discourse I'm sorry the  discord conversations Kirk who is the 17 year old saying I work for Twitter I can claim any  at for you let me know don't tell anyone and then one of the accomplices code named Rolex  LOL prove it give me your Twitter at I'll pull it up.  What's yours?  ViennaCat921.  That's yours?  Yeah and of course he then proves he has god mode because he does something changes or tweets  changes a password or tweets in his name so Rolex said oh dude let me introduce you to ever so  anxious. Kirk puts the bitcoin address that we all know and love so very much yeah in and says send  your bitcoin to this address 5k I'll give you three og user names guy wants ant at vampire at xx  and at dark but earlier you could tell he's a kid because Kirk says Rolex says I'm going to say  $1,000 minimum cool yeah and then he puts a link up on ogusers.com which is where people trade these  names I put 1k minimum let's say that for non og how about 2.5 $22500 for og oh no $1,000 for all  is fine. So little opsec problem though here all along for one thing they shared the user names  in various places on the ogusers account by the way that was breached a couple of years ago so  the FBI had a data dump of all the accounts on ogusers including IP addresses so they were able  to cross reference that with the discourse handle same handle but the real mistake was  when he registered that bitcoin address he did a coinbase which requires a picture of your driver's  license which he used yeah to small detail little thing so this is teenagers they never  think anything through they're just yeah dumb yeah it shows he's not a mass a criminal mastermind

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah so he should I mean honestly what the hell's going on here and dumb kids should not be tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like adults a spark o cam whatever that is is taken over doesn't sound real I wouldn't give it your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  home address so is twitter all the more humiliated that they got they got owned by a dumb teenager

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not by a state actor well they're not nobody everybody's saying oh this guy was a mastermind  brilliant uh criminal uh you know we got good we nabbed him but all of them use their uh their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  real world driver's licenses to verify their twitter has to be embarrassed even more I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think I would I mean this is this is just this happens I don't know I don't think they'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah I know but you know North Korea uses all its resources against you it's a little cooler

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  than a pimply faced kid in Florida yeah yeah it was a nation state 17 year old nation state from  Florida so anyway uh busted and I think honestly yeah the fact that he had such poor operational  security I mean using your real driver's license to register the bitcoin address  it's pretty much saying catch me right yeah pure ignorance on it all or ignorance or whatever  yeah he just doesn't know 19 year old in UK 22 year old in Orlando also uh charged uh obviously  the all of these will be plea deals uh I don't know whether they'll do time they are trying  the 17 year old Kirk as an adult what's what's what's a just outcome here you know what often  happens with these guys I think of people like Kevin Mitnick Kevin Poulsen Adrian Lamo they  almost always do some time I don't think that's a good idea because that's honestly the best way  to learn criminal practices is to do yeah you can actually use it to steal a lot of money yeah  but they often do serve some small amount of time and then in the case of Kevin Mitnick  they get a movie yeah he was first he was forbidden from using the internet for a period  of time after his release I don't remember how long Kevin did it was I feel like it was a year  and a half I know he lived on tuna fish uh he did the time he was a young guy uh crimes not you know  roughly the same as these very similar uh he scammed radio station contests then he got out  then he got a job in security which is often what happens with these guys Kevin Poulsen is now a  journalist but often what happens is uh is they get offered a job and I think sometimes that's  by the way not unusual that that's the hope of these young guys is oh you know look I'll show  how sharp I am poor Adrian Lamo who I you know honestly don't think he had a mean bone in his  body he was never tried to make money on his hacks he I think he was honestly just trying to get a  job as a pen tester but he got the book thrown at him so um you know I mean I don't think hacking  twitter is a great thing but there's a little bit of culpability on twitter's part they that should  not have been easy in fact former twitter employees have said that there's many as a thousand people  had access to that god mode administrative tool that's way too many that's a lot of people that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doesn't make me feel great I mean I don't send information via dms anyway I'm like hey let's use  signal let's go to voice let's do anything that is not you know yeah actually I'm now reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  also uh by cattlin at chimpano from zero day that that twitter exploit you and I just saw  the upshot of is it grants access to dms oh so but please don't use dms on twitter for anything  you wouldn't want the world to see that that's just nuts kirk did download now twitter's saying  initially remember I said eight d d dms from eight accounts I think you ended up being 36  something like that a lot much larger number but I don't think he was you know so I have a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for you um on signal I get messages that oh your friend stacy's on signal now yeah I don't like  that I'm yeah I mentioned my wife and she was appalled for something that's supposed to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  heavy insecurity so how does that work the thing that happens with signal is you are connected to  it through your phone number which a lot of people think is a bad idea because that's a real world  connection to a real person a lot of people use burner numbers to get around this but you ultimately  it needs to be a number that you can get a text message on and that's that's problem one but  problem two and you wouldn't you you had to give permission I believe when you first installed  signal is it will then do what every other app does which is download your contact list

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  check your contacts yeah but just say no I mean like I said you won't get those notices yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah so I think it's a big mistake to for signal to do that signal has been talking about replacing  the phone number with another system with a pin but does have to be a unique identifier so that's  the that's the trick right yeah it's kind of off brand for signal it is off brand but so that's  an interesting question is you know and there's always a trade-off between security and convenience  and in this case signal said well there's some people want this we want to be more like a  messaging program we want people to use it  let's take a break and then we'll talk about the Samsung already already I have so many commercials

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  today oh that's such good news oh and I'm so excited to talk about Samsung yes okay oh good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh good I already put my order in I'm curious did you put an order in don't say what no okay sorry  you could just say whether you did or not but I will talk about it in just a second  it was a weird event Jason Howell and I got up very early 7 a.m pacific time this morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to cover it early for me it is have you seen this guy get started in the week  is he grumpy is he really grumpy it's not grumpy it's definitely not motivated either

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I had to get up even earlier than that because I had to set up the lights and the  cameras and all that stuff so I you know I got up at 6 15 that's pretty early for me  actually on Wednesdays I have a Pilates class at 6 15 every week so it isn't early at all  but I like to play it off our show today brought to you by zip recruiter yeah there are people  hiring there are and I think that's a good thing I want to encourage you and I want to also make  sure that if you are hiring you use the best tool in the world the one we use zip recruiter  hiring is hard because you're hiring you're you're building your company those the people  of the company are the building blocks that can make or break your company so you're doing  probably the most important job which is hiring people you got new difficulties these days right  but zip recruiter is kind of was kind of made for quarantine because it's all done online  in fact it's amazing you submit your opening to zip recruiter they have some really sophisticated  matching technology that will look at they have millions of resumes on file current resumes  they'll look at what they've got on file and they'll match them up and they'll tell the person hey  we've got an opening over here you might be qualified for you might be interested in they  apply and and by the way when you get applicants at zip recruiter they don't go in they don't call  you they don't go in your email they all go it all goes into the zip recruiter interface they format  the resume so they're easy to scan you can have screening questions it makes it really easy to  load up a lot of applicants to get all the people in there screen out the applicants that just aren't  right narrow it down they'll even highlight the best applicants automatically for you so you could  find the right person fast perfect example housing wire you'll like this jeff because  housing wire was looking for a reporter to cover news stories in the u.s housing markets  hard thing to do right now you know you're not gonna put an ad in the paper and have people come  to the office what's a paper what's a paper what's a word yeah really what yeah good point so you go  to zip recruiter right that's what they did and that's how they found it's a nice story alexander  roja she figured i'm not going to get a reporter job i'm just gonna have to wait till covid is over  nope but she did do the right thing and in fact i told my daughter and my son both  she created a profile on zip recruiter zip recruiters automatic matching looked at alexandra's  degree and her writing skills looked at housing wires reporter job and they said alexandra  you should apply housing wire got her application four hours after they posted the job and as often  happens they looked at it and a few weeks later alexander is working at housing wire i'm i'm making  a note right now for my son yeah oh i made sure that's the first thing i did as i made sure my  kids were on there let zip recruiter help you hire we we have done it ourselves many times we've  hired from zip recruiter i'll never forget lisa going oh you know somebody quit in the first thing  in the morning she's going now i gotta oh man i said look zip recruiter breakfast we're sitting  at breakfast she puts the how early how early was breakfast 6 15 a.m. no it was probably around eight  we're having breakfast she says she puts it in within an hour or two she starts getting out she  says this person's good she starts getting applicants but lunch at three or four really  qualified people we filled that job fast that's why we love zip recruiter four out of five  employers who post on zip recruiter you get quality candidates within the first day try it now  free zip recruiter.com slash twig zip recruiter.com slash twig no wonder they call zip recruiter the  smartest way to hire and i like it that my avocado shirt matches the zip recruiter logo  i am zip recruiter zip recruiter.com slash twig thank you zip recruiter for your support  support during this tough time thank you dear listener for supporting us. I think that is a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wonderful sign for the economy that they're advertising right now absolutely that means  that people need to hire jobs are happening too yeah that's a good leading indicator

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they i mean we've talked about this ever since by the way 141 days since we went into shelter  in place here in california since march 17th uh we from that day forward started talking about what  is this going to look like when we come out of this how is the world going to change and you're  really uh starting to see some big changes didn't duncan just announce that 800 stores 800 and i  was okay are those closed for good i think so eight percent of its u.s locations that sounds  not so bad but 800 sounds like a lot of people my bank of america is all around us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not even my appointment are they open and so i'm guessing that they're trying to figure out whether  they can close a whole mess of offices that's a guess and when you see duncan doing this what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're seeing is them trying to belt tighten you know they've been keeping up with rents but you  know you're paying rent for something you keep doesn't generate any revenue they're belt tightening  so that they can survive and you know i think part of what's happening is this is we saw this  last week when ces finally said yeah you know we're not going to do ce yes it takes a while  it's taking a while for people to get this isn't going to be over in a month or two

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right people well you know nobody wants to admit things like this right you don't want to be like  oh we're going to be here for the next year and a half but we're finally having to accept that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it sucks i got a question for you leo do you because this is now zanab to basically written  about this in the atlantic it's it's the next you know after test trace isolate the next important  thing is ventilate ventilate ventilate do you have any control over the outside air into your  studio and offices is that something you have to adjust or something it does worry me um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is a big unknown i haven't read what zanab wrote but this is a big unknown because  we do know that air conditioning spread it in at least one case of china right  so but and i and i've been trying to figure out what kind what are the filters what are the what  is it the herb scale what are the herb like not herb but something like that yes merve merve  my dear boy mervin the merve scale what what is the minimum that you would need and nobody will say  uh well they don't know yet because we don't know so like it's not like they're being rude if they're  just they don't know one of the things we're doing is we're really reducing the number of people who  are in studio there are very few people who actually can come in here and you needed a piece  of equipment uh we put it off the front door so that you could come pick it up without coming in  so that's one way we're doing that is just really reducing the number of people in here we also have  these molecules in here which do some you know an air purifier will get some of it um i it's just  unknown i don't know and you know we're keeping social distance wearing i wear masks everywhere  but in my studio and here it's very difficult it really is i just put a link up to the independent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that says that air conditioning units that recirculate air in rooms and offices should be  turned off or used only with open windows okay but is who's that filters uh the independent it's on  it's on the rundown it was linked to by one of my favorite experts among my many experts  devy shreedar who's the expert who made scotland work while the uk didn't so i trust if she linked  to it the who the who said coronavirus can spread through tiny droplets with the air closed spaces  yeah we knew that okay uh the uk health and safety executive says the risk of air conditioning  spreading coronavirus in the workplace is extremely low as long as there is an adequate supply of  fresh air and ventilations but adds if you use a centralized ventilation system that removes and  circulates air to different rooms it is recommended you turn off recirculation and use a fresh air

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  supply if you have that oh i see i see i don't think this is you can spread it around i don't  think this is research i think we're getting it i don't know i don't know my school too yeah we're  yeah opening a window is the best thing you can do but we uh we're like many offices we're sealed  yep you know so i yeah and i also i don't want to jump the gun because we've gotten all sorts of  conflicting advice like look at all the schools that are you know taking a day to deep sanitize  everything before the next class comes in and now there's some concern i just saw a piece in the  atlantic saying this is just security theater or anti-virus theater that uh it doesn't look  like surfaces are really the problem it's air so i just don't know i just don't nobody knows  yikes yikes yikes we'll just do our best to stay healthy right you were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ces being canceled i'm curious about the contracts with the likes of ces and all of the  uh oh must have relationships they had with the different hotels yeah don't they buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wimbledon hotel rooms i think so wimbledon was the only tennis tournament that had  insurance that covered a pandemic okay but for them um yeah exactly but the others didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting the atlantic today they've been doing great coverage i love the atlantic i'll  pay for it because i love them immunology same here same here immunology is where intuition goes  to die this is a ed yong who's great i love his stuff he's brilliant um this is his this is his  lead he says there's a joke about immunology which jessica metcalf of princeton recently told me an  immunologist and a cardiologist are kidnapped the kidnappers threatened to shoot one of them but  promised to spare whoever has made the greater contribution to humanity the cardiologist says  well i've identified drugs that have saved the lives of millions of people impressed the  kidnappers turned to the immunologist what have you done they asked the immunologist says the  thing is the immune system is very complicated and the cardiologist says just shoot me now  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ed ed yong's tweet uh promoting that story was the origin of the story is one of my colleagues  asked for an immunity explainer and i said god no have you any idea how complicated immunology is  that would kill me but then i realized i'm already dead inside and i wrote the piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i just want to say that ed yong wrote probably the most important piece i've read to date yes yes on  uh are are you handling in the united states of the of the covet crisis it's kind of amazing  that a couple of days after he releases this i don't know 10 000 word piece he's got another  article already the guy is insane he's amazing but this is the one uh i actually don't recommend  i've not passed it around it's too damn depressing how the pandemic defeated america but it is very  well written very well 100 interviews he did a brilliant guy this is perhaps the most important  article not about the pandemic in general but about our handling of it here in the  united states policy failures yep and the cracks that it exposed in our society um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  anyway samsung galaxy unpacked i was like i thought we were talking about gadgets and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bringing us all down again that's why i don't send that link around because it's depressing  so this morning early morning got up very excited i did it from the house because i thought it'd be  easier i wouldn't have to put on pants jason howell joined me from his house um they were a  little late part of it was live as best we could tell a lot of it was pre-recorded the biggest  takeaway from for me and i'm curious what you thought stacy because sound like you are more  uh excited about this was how little technical detail they never once measured mentioned the  processor they barely mentioned the size of the batteries they didn't talk about the cameras the  megapixels they left almost all the technical specs out they announced two new galaxy note phones the  note 20 and note 20 ultra they announced a new galaxy watch they announced new galaxy buds  they announced a new note tab a galaxy tab they announced the new folding phone  but left out all the details i maybe because it all had been leaked or they knew that the  embargoed reviews would be out right after the event it was disappointing to me because it was  and maybe this is a covid thing because obviously this would have reporters would have been there  in years gone by this was just a big ad with a lot of soft mushy marketing terms  for how wonderful the life would be using their stuff i felt like we have apple pioneered this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with like tech reporters going to their lunches and i feel like this is just the end of that  covid has pushed that i think it's probably right to do so because for years these events have been  for two purposes one reporters to get all like you know get our coverage but also to get pretty  pictures and live blogs and page views and whatever right it was feeding the machine  and then your diehard fans and developers would also check in but they weren't necessarily there  to talk about like processing power or megapixels or what i think maybe they aired too far in the  giant ad side but i think this is where we had been heading and covid has changed the audience  for these two normal people not just reporters that's exactly what i was thinking that samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has done an amazing job of cornering the market of the regular person number two manufacturer in the  world after wale and ahead of apple you grab a regular person on on the street that has a  samsung device they could care less what the soc is they just want to make sure that camera  makes them look really good when in the club sit of course i always look really good in the club

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh me too yeah but uh in your avocado shirt i haven't been in the club in 40 years probably  but okay uh i think also it reflects the fact that we're at peak phone that we are now every  technology gets to this point where speeds and feeds just don't matter anymore right you assume  it's going to have a great camera it's going to have a great screen uh it's a note so it's going  to have a stylus you don't you don't sweat the details in fact they spent more time talking about  the color mystic bronze because that's what sells yeah that's what people want so that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i want to buy i want that beautiful rose gold beans there's just so adorable oh you're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about the new uh uh earbuds so i want to get i'm gonna get everything in bronze i'm gonna bronze  all the things it's just so pretty so here's what i don't so are you gonna order one of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  no no i don't i i'm not fancy although the flip phone i gotta say you want to be fancy  yeah i know they have a new one i'm like i would i would totally that is like give it to me and  now it's in mr bronze 799.99 and now in 5g i feel like my next phone even though i'm  ride or die for you know pixel i'm looking at that and i'm like yeah yeah baby yeah baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah it folds in half so it's nice and compact i really love this hinge idea where you got a  little it's like a little mini laptop you've got a screen on one half of it and you remember the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i uh ipods yeah the little screen but you can watch it's like that size i know so it's i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's neat they're doing that by the way with the new galaxy fold as well they said that this hinge  will also have an infinite angle so that you can do the same thing so the fold by the way is going  to be a very pricey phone starting at 1200 bucks um i here's what i've after thinking about 1200  yeah i think right here's after i thought the fold was more than that well it goes up 1400

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or maybe it's i don't know let me learn more i gotta look again because yeah some reason i thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reserved it already so here's what i yeah i know i don't care about the price because it's for work  right because i want to do something as an experiment one of the things they really were  pitching is the is the samsung ecosystem everything works better this is what apple says has been  saying for years everything works better if you're all samsung all the time so get the fold get the  earbuds get the watch so i think to do it uh justice i'm gonna have to go all in so i and i  thought well we haven't really tried any of these folding phones yet this is their second and a half  generation i'm glad the advertising is coming back in i don't know it's going to be a lot of money i  know uh as much as a real computer but i i think i'm gonna get and i'm gonna get it all in mystic  bronze because then it'll all match i'll get the bean shaped earbuds those are hysterical let me see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if i can show you those those are so i want to talk about those because i can't imagine them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  staying in my ear well you don't have a bean shaped ear more than likely they also come with  some additional uh wings does it doesn't have no no wings look at her she's either in great pain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or having a good time yeah can't tell does it have the rubber tip or not that's like a young

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lindsey lohan look at that a lot of freckles yeah yeah it's got a little rubber tip but a lot of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  true wireless buds that you see on the market uh the ad never shows the additional tips that comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with them uh these will have tips but look at the size of them oh yeah that tip is so is so it's  wide it's got two drivers in it it looks like wow two drivers is pretty cool yeah so this this is  going to be interesting uh they have not announced i don't think they've announced a price for these  the watch which is pricey i think it's 400 bucks is not android wear and i think this is where samsung  starting to see some benefits of creating ties in its own operating system i feel like you know they  they mentioned but then had to say a little caveat not available till we get fda approval  but their new watch will presuming it gets approved by the fda have blood pressure have  oxygen level it'd be an oximeter oh and an electrocardiogram uh of those three  uh i think the only one they got fda approval for was i can't it was it was only one it would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  probably be the ekg because i think the ekg is pretty established tech yeah yeah the the i can't  imagine how it's going to do blood pressure but you know something your watch is going to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no no no no no no it's just watching your blood flow it's it's probably using the green leds right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah and then just running an algorithm that's i mean it's probably not very accurate either  right yeah those are only as good as their algorithm right i was looking at my jobras and  i think what it is is you have to you'll do the twist when you put it in right yeah yeah and the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bean shape they say is because that's your ear canal shape is kind of being like i just have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  weird ears i can't i cannot wear any of the apple things they just fall straight out yeah well this  may not be for you anyway i thought i'm still waiting for google to fix theirs i thought i

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  would get all of the above kevin is watching and he sent me a footnote on the samsung phone prices  he said those prices include a phone trade-in so you pay 200 to 400 dollars more over the listed  price without the whoa so if you have an old note there is a you can trade it in for the new one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and and one of the things they do offer price are they presuming the trade-in no i don't know  i got a quote that didn't say you have to trade it in you can you can if you want  the other thing they say is you get a 50 return if you return it anytime in the first two years  in good shape so you could in two years buy a new one and get a 50 back so they really they're  pushing this ecosystem they want people to live in samsung land the same way people live in the  apple world yeah exactly yeah one of the ways they're doing that is they're really promoting  this dex thing remember dex was a little thing where you dock your phone or uh and you'd do a  keyboard mouse and monitor and you'd get kind of desktop applications they're doing that again  they're doing it wirelessly this time and they're doing it with microsoft and the your phone app on  windows 10 so you can get some integration you know some sort of desktop integration  using dex and using your phone on windows 10 it's interesting you know samsung is doing the  best it can given that they're not apple and they're not google the the problem that i have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that would keep me from buying like the uh is it the tab is what they call the tablet galaxy seven  yeah that thing looks really really good from a spec sheet standpoint um ipad pro competitor  ish set this a lot cheaper right but the ecosystem the apps the where ipad pro wins is there's so many  great apps on there for everybody not just the productivity people but also the creators too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you look at this s7 and s7 plus it actually looks a lot more like a surface pro it's got a  kickstand it has a keyboard with a trackpad surface yeah yeah they didn't they didn't talk  about price but i think this is not going to be much less than an ipad ipad pro starts at a thousand  bucks so is this seven inches or they're closing there's a seven and they're rather 11 and a 12.4  oh i love it i love an inches $649 when it goes on sale the s7 plus $849 those are pretty close to ipad  pro prices i love my nexus 7 android tablets are a non-starter in fact that's one of the reasons  they're pushing decks they're pushing windows uh you know interface interface with your phone  i just yeah i don't see a i don't really see a market particularly you know  jeff is the market no no he doesn't want an android tablet do you really oh no i love  a seven inch yeah samsung makes i'm sure they make a seven inch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so i think the lowest one is an eight i think is it i don't know i could be wrong somebody  why seven versus eight is it pocketability it just fit my pockets it was it was good hand size  it was it was large enough to watch something on an airplane i remember those  but small enough to carry around really easily it was a perfect size you know didn't get mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at this event mr bixby bixby north part things and in fact adam chair who was the creator of  siri and then went on to join samsung and do bixby has now left samsung so i think bixby might he had

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a startup called viv that samsung bought yeah but viv was not really a digital assistant for voice  it was using a voice interface to program web services right and that's kind of what bixby

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  became is a way to interface with apps on the phone and kind of automate that and i didn't  find it very useful the bixby button's long gone i think bixby is not long for this world i still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can't quite wrap my head around decks and do you use case for that well that's what's changed a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  little bit because in the early days the idea was well you're carrying this powerful processor  with all your stuff on it we got a lot of storage remember they used to say on the one of the galaxy  s8 i guess and i bought one that had a terabyte of storage and then you would dock it on the  dex doc and then you'd have a keyboard mouse and monitor and suddenly you know with you still have  all your stuff but now you're running desktop quality applications except they never really  were desktop quality applications now you're seeing microsoft outlook in there you're seeing  other microsoft apps in there i think maybe the idea is dex gives more desktop like experience  to the tablet that's more what dex has become than your one computer that you carry with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everywhere that's my guess yeah makes more sense with the whole office 365 package there's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  reason bixby might be saying bye bye because according to the verge google has been pushing  samsung to push google assistant over bixby it doesn't like the fact that samsung phones come  actually this is from bloomberg come with two different voice assistants yeah but didn't samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  deny these these so-called allegations or conversations i don't know yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i think it's pretty clear bixby is no longer a player don't you if you do you use the samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and no you use we all use i would try them now i would try the samsung nowadays because they've  gotten much better with their software and and not as much bloat on top of android as it used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but just not really not really interested in it by the way according to this story in bloomberg  this wouldn't be for free google would pay samsung billions of dollars perhaps to  to use the assistant instead of bixby i think with bixby is not long for this world  i honestly do i don't think anybody used to bye bye bixby bye bixby in a related story cartana  also not long for this world it's down to echo google's voice and siri siri way way behind at

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this point so what do you think you know siri could get better fast though if apple just like  apple's you know i i feel like apple's the kind of company that will one day just be like oh by  the way we're giving you an update and now siri actually understands what you want if it comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from anybody be apple would it yeah yeah more than google well you don't you don't see apple make

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the incremental steps they just suddenly are like boom we're here whereas google will take you through

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all the the steps here's the reason i agree with you apple is clearly working really hard on an  augmented reality uh spectacles and that's going to be 2022 probably that's where you would really

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  want a good assistant yeah good voice interaction with somebody who actually understands you because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  otherwise i mean you don't have a keyboard you don't have a mouse you just have you can look in  your voice that's all you have so that's yeah right if they're going to do that that's when they do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they could be optimizing so like amazon and google both optimized for voice only for a while then  google added displays and or amazon i can't remember the order but like if apple's thinking  well we're going to do voice and a heads-up display together then that changes how you design it and  what you optimize for because you're also going to have to be able to give the computer context  clues about when you deliver display versus a audio response so that could they're basically  trying to do two things in parallel and you know how like when kids they grow up to a language they  learn to spell and and read a little bit later because their brains are still learning two  different tasks two different languages maybe apple's kind of in that i could tell you from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  experience because all of apple's siri devices have a screen except for one which is the home pod  and unfortunately we have a home pod in our living room and it often picks up siri commands  and its response is more often than not i can't do that because i'm a i don't have a screen  can't help you there ask your phone because i'm i got no i got nothing i got nothing i got nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i got a speaker yeah i think thinking about the samsung phones and just that whole marketing  spiel that they sort of presented today it reminded me of some conversations that i've  had with a couple of hands-on photography listeners that's getting these new phones and  they're wanting to know about what app should i get to make the camera better and make the camera  do this and do that and i had to tell them i said you know nowadays we're pretty much like you said  mr laporte we're at peak phone pretty much at peak camera too when it comes to the smartphone  camera because of all of the ai a lot of that stuff is just happening right out the bat as soon  as you get the shutter it's not much help needed from another third-party app nowadays it's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you should say that because we were talking about that just yesterday on ios today as well  we were talking about what other non-default apps do you use on your iphone and camera of course is  one of them and almost every phone i've ever tried samsung google or apple the best app is always  going to be the one from the manufacturer the stock yeah because the stock app is most closely  tied to the hardware but we also mentioned there are there are fun and certainly on the iphone  there are really interesting and fun third-party apps that you would want as for a change of pace  or a different effect but but both both mike and i go right to the stock app except mike did mention  that i wasn't his his mom and his sister i think both we thought this was weird  both use the snapchat camera as their default camera on their iphones oh boy  i guess that's just a measure of how how all in on the snapchat there wow i do not see a lot of  snapchat users lately that's well we're all moving to tiktok don't you know uh and you all are  are we going to talk about that yeah let's take a break and we should talk about that let me just  anything else to wrap up with samsung as i said when the the uh it will be september 1 you can  order the fold it'll be available i bet september 15th because that's when microsoft's x cloud  gaming cloud gaming platform rolls out on the uh not on ios only on android and it was they're  going to have a special early partnership with samsung i'm going to bet you that's not just the  note ultra that or note plus or whatever they're calling it but it will also be called yeah that  will also be on the fold uh because imagine that 7.6 inch screen gaming on the microsoft x cloud so  i'm thinking september 15th i will uh tomorrow i can order the watch and the buds i'll order those  well we were going to get all of them in fact there's some google news too because the pixel  4a came out on monday and jason gets his tomorrow so we knew this would be a kind of crowded  now we're going to get a lot of new phones the 4a looks really good requested a review unit of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the smartwatch for samsung because i'd like to try it out for it looks pretty good for wellness

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah it looks pretty good i was a little disappointed after they touted all these heart features to say  well but none of them will be available uh on ship you gotta wait till we get approval and all that  stuff but you know what for covid having uh oxygen and oxy blood oximeter yeah for me a  blood pressure i gotta monitor my blood pressure uh for others with afib uh an ecg that's one of the  the acg is the only one that's on the apple watch that's a really useful thing it looks like samsung  hit all of the key elements that an apple watch gives you so i can't wait to try it it also has a  round and a round face and a twisty bezel which i like so i'm gonna you're gonna see me i'll be  mystic bronze for a while you're gonna be mystic bronze are you gonna get a mask a mystic bronze

Transcript:  stand there i'm thinking i would love a hair helmet you know shiny bronze hair helmet yeah yeah  i don't know i don't know how they fit you for it though it doesn't sound too much fun  um yes a the uh the uh we will i'm sure on all about android i'm thinking next tuesday  jason will for sure have a 4a review there are 4a reviews out already very positive it looks  like in fact weren't you thinking about that jeff no no no no no no i think i'm waiting for  five thinking about one for queen pruett actually that was so weird that google announced the 4a  and the five at the same at the same time it was kind of what the hell the one's delayed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right who do you think you are your secret pixel club and i don't have the handshake the pixel  handshake and i am pissed by the way all of these samsung phones have 5g maybe 5g is bigger in south  korea than it is here it is because they're ahead of us this was good because they do at least  explain the two different kinds of 5g the millimeter wave and then the sub six wave which  is the one the only one really that's from widespread use in the u.s that's t-mobile's  using the 600 megahertz band millimeter wave is a very limited use in some areas by verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in the u.s but that's got the the super wide channels which gives you the amazing bandwidth  yeah yeah that i don't know there's actually there's more 5g coming out in july early july  the 3gpp approved a different form of 5g for industrial and then next year well 18 months  from now there will be 5g let's see this is 5g nr light new radio light and that will be a  industrial focused one with 100 gigabits per second so i called it goldilocks 5g because  it'll be in between the super high data rates and the like super low nb iot data rates don't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  love this video though that samsung did i this is so much clearer than anything the carriers want  you to know yes the millimeter wave bounces off everything so it only goes a little ways  so that's the 5g millimeter wave but it's super fast then there's the 5g sub 6 the 600 megahertz  that t-mobile's using that at least goes through buildings because of its low frequency but it  doesn't go very far not as far as lte which goes even farther so the point being your phone your  new phone will do all three and you'll get the good bandwidth if you're in the right spot the  better bandwidth if you're in the right spot and if you aren't you'll get the 4g lte i thought that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  was a good explainer i have explained this to y'all many times yeah but i don't understand your talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you don't have pretty colored lines no i knew this i knew it because you explained it but i  just thought this i actually commend samsung i didn't i didn't even use the word attenuate  when i tried to explain it either i just commend samsung because most manufacturers and carriers  when you say 5g they just do a lot of hand waving and say don't worry about it don't worry your  little pretty little head about it and so it's nice that samsung at least says look there's  different technologies they're not all going to work they're not all going to be available

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  super bougie man it is the bougiest there was an article in new yorker about rancho gordo two  years ago that's actually what made it impossible to get into the club but what's cool is this guy  goes down to mexico and convinces the farmers not to plant the industrialized beans that big ag has  been talking them into but to go back and and plant the beans their fathers and grandfathers  before them grew and so they have such exotic and weird and interesting beans  some of the and they're delicious and everything is sold out yeah they're very popular but i did  order a bunch of beans i think i ordered the cranberry bean and the ayokote morado it's a  runner so it's very big and starchy but uh yeah i don't know why i like beans but i do at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know why lisa hates them i respect that i like these yeah beans are good you don't like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh no he loves bean guy he does oh how do you feel about avocados no no what you don't like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we talk about google a.t google a.n.t that's i you had a really good report stacy that explained

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it to me it was very oh yeah so a.d.t which is a very well known security company uh is doing a  deal with google it obviously wall street liked it their stock went up 600 65 i'm sorry 65 hey that's  a big job still a big jump it was 100 the day of right yeah it was a huge jump uh because google's  putting in 450 million dollars in exchange for a new class of common stock they can't vote on the  election appointment or removal of directors but everything else so what does it mean stacy are  is it is it's not google buying a.d.t it's buying no no no it's basically buying uh i look at it as

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  buying the a.d.t installers giving google an install base it's also buying smart you're right  yeah it's buying a way to get into the home that isn't like selling through you know their typical  google store and the retail channels and they have tried with nest you know they have had  partnerships they actually had individual partnerships and then they switched to one  big company nationwide to install nest thermostats but really this is like hey if we're going to get  it in on the smart home it is freaking hard to put all this stuff together to make it work  a.d.t and for a.d.t you know they have had a modernize they get yeah it helps them modernize  a.d.t actually has a deal with amazon but a.d.t gets money they get the cache of being with rubbing  up with google and it helps them get in on the smart home without cannibalizing their core business  and i assume hopefully if they did this well they'll have you know access to some data that  could help them you know get with the today's world so i think that's for those two companies  what's compelling yeah i also think it signals a whole new shift in the smart home but do you want  to interrupt me and then i'll talk about that afterwards well i don't know if you all take one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of the challenges to a.d.t was companies like simply safe uh our sponsor we're starting to  eat their lunch because a.d.t didn't speak to younger people it was from people my age  wanted home security younger people they're moving around more they didn't like the idea  of an installer they're a little more tech savvy they like to they want a smarter home  and so other companies were coming along and a.d.t was starting to look a little long in the tooth  but i didn't think about that yeah i think you nailed it the partnership and this is from the  google blog post the partnership pairs more than 20 000 a.d.t professionals those are the installers  and the and the consultants who come into your home with nests portfolio of home devices they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just added a 20 000 person sales force to nest which you made a point about stacy in terms of  of the pricing in your post the pricing of of the a.d.t hardware versus the nest hardware talk about  that for a second how is this how is the staff motivated well so that i don't know exactly how

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because i'm not privy to the inside details of this but a.d.t's a.d.t's pricing their model is  you get all the hardware up front and then you pay it out over the life of the contract right  google actually sells a pretty their their gear is pretty expensive so i don't think it's going to  derail the commissions of too many of the a.d.t people which is really good because otherwise  they wouldn't want to sell it so that i think that's the point i mean was that the point i made

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well yeah there's two questions there so one is that the google stuff is expensive enough that  they'll be motivated to sell it then the second question is will they do this lend lease model  with google hardware too you think or oh yeah i don't know i that's that is a way to get more

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  people to buy the google stuff and i don't i kind of doubt it because you do that with a contract  and i that's something to look for and if you notice so far they told reuters that they were  only going to do the wi-fi the thermostat in one other device i can't recall at the moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so it doesn't compete with their existing portfolio it broadens it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a.d.t's it does broaden it eventually it will compete now a.d.t is the monitoring service behind  that's the real money well that's the monitoring service between behind amazon's echo guard oh i  yeah that's an option for you if you turn on echo guard or madame's guard service that's not cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i think it's 45 a month the last time i checked so i think that's where a.d.t probably makes most of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  its money right yeah their monitoring service is expensive and they used to have two versions of  it they had like a cheaper version for people like me and then they had the old people version for  people like you i'm just telling i mean that's that's the market so yeah oh she's she's cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  isn't she she says oh no i know that it's it's just true she's so cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  google posts its first loss really alphabet its first cold heart of youth first loss  in history search revenue dropping for the first time ever in its quarterly results we continue  to navigate through a difficult global environment says ruth porat wow total revenue for the quarter  yeah it's temporary it's covid right 38.3 billion actually i'm not going to say it's covid it could  not it could very well not be covid but a longer term trend with people moving to facebook and  other places facebook i mean facebook ads have to be pretty competitive with google ads don't you  think revenue for the quarter was a little more than expected but a two percent decline from  q2 2019 net income profit dropped from 9.9 billion years dollars a year ago to 6.9  search revenue down from 23 to 21 billion dollars so tough times now youtube did a lot better as  you'd expect advertising revenue on youtube was up about 200 million dollars google cloud also up  about 50 from 2.1 to 3.01 billion so there are some bright spots in google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sundar pacheis i was going to ask the youtube angle and it makes sense that it's up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh sure considering these times oh well see this is the thing because i'd heard also  youtube ad revenue was down for a lot of creators right you're getting more viewers  but advertisers aren't buying this is the problem we had early in covid as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well this is why the maybe go to this one the tick tock announcements of 300 million  for european creators 200 million for u.s creators is really interesting to me that's a special fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they're gonna put together yeah before we get to tick tock because that's going to generate  a little bit of conversation i'm guessing i'm guessing i jumped the gun other bets which includes  x lab waymo verily revenue 148 million down from 162 million year over year operating loss of  1.12 billion dollars yikes play store non-advertising youtube revenues up from four to four five point  one two billion dollars and sundar pacheis said youtube and google play subscriptions saw good  traction in the quarter with app and game downloads rising 35 percent that that kind  of mirrors apple's big increase as well uh due to quarantine so where were they most sensitive was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was it just google advertising search search advertising yeah but we knew that was going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  happen i mean not just for covid but we knew that search was always i mean that's what google's been  trying to do is come up with stuff that helps with search because search is going to naturally  decrease as our as a lot of things change about our world the real concern is is it a trend  or is it just covid no i mean we're going to be searching more on things like our echo devices  you're i mean so they've seen this coming for years yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh by the way the acquisition of fitbit uh is a little bit stalled europe is saying well  hold on there google what are you going to do with all that good data yeah google's like uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we won't use it for advertising because that's what we say to everything and that was yesterday's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  concern yeah eu has opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed acquisition of fitbit by  google under the eu merger regulation uh that that could stymie the whole deal it's kind of this  seems like they announced this deal a long time ago yeah this last year but it also every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  anyone writes about it they write about it like it's a fea complete that's right that's exactly  and i don't understand why you had a fit about that last week yes yeah it's not done oh yeah i

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  did nothing's happened about it i love it well we you know i think it's uh not unusual we read  about the deals and we go oh they bought they bought fitbit and that's how we say it they bought  fitbit uh but it hasn't closed and won't close for a long time so they didn't get it yet you clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have not had an editor at a business publication who is like this is an announced deal not an

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actual acquisition so what would you what what should i say what's the headline uh google to buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you always have to have to buy fitbit or x amount okay and then eventually you have to come through  when it's done and say the deal is now done got it so i'll say that from now on yeah i used to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get confused with announce versus launched when i was writing yeah yeah i personally think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  should never use the phrase announced because it's very rare that real people announce things  right so i always just i'm like can we say say here yes you'd be such a good editor to work for  i think i would be a little cranky i mean i've edited yeah that's why you'd be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's why you'd be good hey do you did you use google plus i did according to the usa today you  maybe owed some money from a class action privacy settlement told you would pay to use google plus  7.5 million dollar settlement uh i don't even think you're going to get the five to twelve dollars  the usa today is uh is figuring it's not gonna be worth doing whatever they're gonna make you do  truth is if i wanted to get money i wouldn't be telling everybody listening to go to google plus  data litigation.com and filling out the forum there so you get your money  honey uh but you know i we've all been through these class action suits the only people make

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  money are the lawyers that's right that's another thing the hard head came running down the stairs  to announce to me i'm rich i just said announce see hard has announced he comes down and he's like  hey what is this about class auction action lawsuit what do i need to do to get money  what are you talking about and i asked him if he knew what google plus was and he said no  so i'm like so sit down just sit down teenagers man

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i'm rich daddy i'm rich teenagers wow korey levandowski not korey levandowski  i always call him korey i know i was looking at the same thing how many levandowskis are there in the  world so anthony might get a cell next korey he's getting 18 months in prison for stealing google's  self-driving car files i didn't who knew industrial espionage was such a big crime a u.s judge  yesterday sentenced anthony levandowski to prison remember he was at google doing in their self  driving unit left joined uber's actually was auto at the time right the truck unit and uber  eventually acquired them uber sued i think was 20 000 documents i can't remember but i remember  from the it was a lot of a lot of stuff and the very famous judge william alsop you may remember  from the microsoft doj case has sentenced him to a year and a half in prison prosecutors want a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  little bit more time oh yeah absolutely he was yeah this this was part of this whole uber cadre  of let's not be ethical about anything and i'm kind of like honestly although i will say compared  to the twitter sentence for this poor person i'm kind of like those are very different so we'll see  what happens i mean obviously there's not sentencing yet remember he was fined a huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  amount 179 million dollars yeah and he couldn't pay it filed for bankruptcy yeah and the bankruptcy  judge is ruling google asked him asked him to reject uber's argument that it's not responsible  for the money levandowski now runs a self-driving truck company called pronto pronto he apologized  to google said he plans to share his story of regret with others in the tech industry boy does  he regret it man he you know they won't have to go to prison till after covet 19 it's too too  dangerous so he will oh that's interesting yeah that's interesting yeah they don't want they don't  want you to go in there all right are you ready for what for it's time to tick tock  i have been thinking long and hard about this whole story i am now of the strong opinion that  there is nothing wrong with tick tock it is i think one of the most creative interesting  social networks out there people are using it very cleverly very interestingly god bless them  uh i am real yes i'm not in the least bit concerned about china spying on anybody's  ticktocks in fact i looked at the iphone permissions if unless you grant it permissions  use the microphone and camera tick tock has no permissions including location now of course  because you're on a cell network tick tock could see what cell network you're on so as anybody  on a smartphone can see that much how much use that kind of location that kind of you know not  granular location uh information is used of use to the chinese government i don't know i don't  think it's a i don't actually think it's a security concern at all i think the president  is mad at tick tock a because he's mad at china in general and b which is a distraction from  russia but keep going exactly there's all sorts of reasons why he might be calling it the china  virus and all that stuff b i think he's still pissed off at tick tock because a bunch of tick  tock users and by the way k-pop stans uh managed to undermine his tulsa rally by all signing up for  tickets and not showing up and uh i honestly think he's a little butthurt and so as a result  tick tock the the president has been saying in fact the whole administration mike pompeo  peter navarro have all been saying we're gonna ban tick tock despite pretty strong questions  about whether they could even do that sephias probably could the committee on foreign investment  in the united states but sephias is not saying anything yet they're just investigating  uh then was it musically a u.s company yes so they could and they were bought by by dance that's  what sephias could intervene in basically okay uh yeah that's what they're there for committee  for foreign investment in the united states uh bite dance has been a great pains to create a  u.s ceo puppet according to president trump uh they say we're gonna hire 10 000 u.s people  the data for u.s users is stored in the u.s and singapore not in china  and it's not i mean what is the data anyway now there's lots of other things to say about tick  tock you know for a while their algorithm seemed to ban fat people uh there's a lot of there's a  lot of you know there's there's cultural appropriation going on there was actually  a really good piece uh by a black creator on tick tock saying tick tock seems to be  banning black creators but they also promote the white creators use of black music and black  culture um and so that's a little bit you know that sketch you can't mention the weavers on tick  tock you can't talk about hong kong on tick tock so i'm not saying tick tock's perfect but i'm not  but i also don't think it's a massive security threat to the united states on friday the president  said we're gonna ban tick tock as soon as saturday didn't do it and much to the chagrin of  microsoft nobody gets to buy it apparently microsoft we found out then had been negotiating  with tick tock to buy the u.s australian and new zealand assets to create a tick tock us not sure  why microsoft wanted to take that on but maybe they thought it was a good deal some say it's  the next youtube so maybe microsoft said hey we missed out on youtube here's our chance minecraft  does pretty well for us a great way to get the youngs in the microsoft fold early on uh that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what i was i was like tick tock is like minecraft for them yeah then ortona works so well for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know they always when they copy something it works really well for them but minecraft

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  has done you know what they haven't touched minecraft they've done i presume they do the  same thing with tick tock which is hands off yeah uh just give them money and keep keep it going

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because we like that leave it alone and collect the so when the president said we're not going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  let anybody buy it satya nadella said whoa okay well we're going to hold off on those negotiations  we've been working on then the next day nadella and mike and trump have a conversation and it's  back on boys but the donald says i want a cut as i say there's a cat just unbelievable this is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is like just idiotic i mean my husband who is not who is a actual republican not a trump republican  but is is fiscally very conservative very business-minded right many things that donald trump  does drive him absolutely bonkers like he just but he also kind of is like he's not as upset as  i am about it like in the sense like he doesn't take it to heart and feel like he's our country  is being betrayed whereas this he just he he was like expletive expletive it's like tony sabrano

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying yeah i want to cut now it goes to the treasury department it's not like going into

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  donald's pocket but nevertheless this guy thinks he's the deal maker in chief he doesn't want to  do his real job he just wants to have this weird fake that's not even his role it's like he didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  understand what president actually does by saying that now i think it's my opinion we talked about  this on windows weekly that this has tarnished the deal greatly for microsoft as much as they'd  like to have tiktok now it looks like it was some strong arm operation on the part of the  united states to get china a chinese company to give microsoft the company and give a chunk of  change to the treasury department it looks like highway robbery it looks like it looks like  mafioso behavior and if i were microsoft at this point i would say yeah no we don't that's because  that's gonna a it's gonna make a big enemy of the chinese government probably not what microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  would like to do and media there are now saying this is all a trick to steal tiktok from them  it is so the chinese government is against it yes they're right they're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's just it's appalling he just he just is he ruins everything he touches yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh i it's i don't know if it's impeachable it just seems bad bad bad bad and i do feel bad  for uh microsoft which i think thought that they were going to be you know a hero in all this  helping keep tiktok alive making an american company now they look like they're just a part  of the kleptocracy so my prediction is that we will hear an announcement soon from microsoft the  next few days where they say never mind this this has turned sour um and i only were going to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was english language markets right they weren't going to get right the core business i also think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is probably fine in their in their perspective too just just you guys do your thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know i i honestly also think the president is not going to ban tiktok this is just more  saber rattling from the saber rattler and change grandstanding yeah yeah and now that jeff jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for me it was noisy i kept getting a bunch of notifications for things i did not care about i  think it was trying to figure me out from a you know the platform perspective like what exactly  does this guy like you know so it just kept sending me notifications and i'm like i don't care about  that and i think i followed maybe three people i finally turned all the notifications off do your  kids use tiktok they they started it but they don't anymore they're still still they're still

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  stuck on the snapchat side of things well that's the thing i i don't think tiktok's anymore harmful  than snapchat or instagram you know i i think that this this is i don't know i i have problems  even with the huawei thing you could perhaps make the case that you shouldn't let them  uh power national infrastructure like the 5g network okay fine but they should be allowed  to sell phones the united states for crying out loud so i just it's a shame i just think it's a  shame it does and it does not reflect well on microsoft that's why i think if they were if they  can think of a way out there is a face saving move that they could make probably that which is um  if microsoft which is of course a big cloud company said look we'll take a stake small stake  in tiktok and return we will host all the tiktok data for american users in our microsoft servers  and we won't give access to the chinese and you know they can't ask for it that's ours  okay uh and then the president could come out saying look see i'm yeah i made a deal well this  is good uh microsoft would get out of this kind of untenable position there and looking like  they're extorting a chinese company and the chinese uh would get to continue to own it  i think that would be a sensible plan i i just i just can't imagine first of all i don't know  what legal basis he'd have for banning he doesn't he just assumes he does he doesn't but he doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  need a legal basis for anything i mean this man tweets random stuff about delaying the election  this is not a man who's concerned about legal things he's an emperor yeah so but he what he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would do is he would issue an executive order it would have some effect chiefly the court  courthouse would get very busy and then we just sit there in limbo for ages and ages it would not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  be good it would not be well we'd sit in limbo but we'd also i mean it's not like there'd be a um  nothing would happen right what is what is the word when they stop why can't i think an injunction  thank you yeah yes an injunction it's not going to be an injunction so uh the other thing that i

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think tick tock that is beneficial to all this is tick tock now is bending over backwards to be a  good citizen in fact what they one of the things they said which i thought was really good is they  will publish our algorithm wow you want and and we call and i honestly think algorithm is one of  the biggest problems we face right now with facebook youtube all of these if we call on  facebook and youtube to do the same publish the algorithm let us see what the recommendation engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does to highlight what does it mean to publish the everybody's gonna understand what the algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  says it depends on the data it depends on lots of things matt cuts was on twit on sunday he is still  administrator of the united states digital service awesome guy early googler knows a lot about  algorithm he was he knows how the google search algorithm works he said you know it's a trivial  algorithm he said compared to the google algorithm what tick tock's doing is very very simple you  look at which videos get the most engagement then you then you push those push them up it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  straightforward so they're not giving away there's no topicality or anything the way that is on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  facebook and google i don't think so and i think that's actually one of the charming things about  tick tock it's just this is all they had to do make an app that was fun to use that had the tools  the people who would make videos wanted so make it accessible desirable because they need to create  get people to create millions of videos and then have an algorithm that surfaces the ones that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people like step three profit that's right i just wish those algorithms were tailored more towards  me but then again it's probably not tailored towards me because i'm not feeding it that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right they yeah you could if you started participating more i think you'd it's interesting  the range of stuff there's a lot of stuff like jeff just did that's political yeah there's a  lot of very funny stuff sarah cooper we've showed her sarah cooper is just the genius of it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a joy to see what people are coming up with right now and uh to try to get away from what's  really happening outside i agree it's really refreshing some of it is pretty funny some of  it is is i'm tired of seeing it i'm tired of seeing the lip syncing of a song what's most

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  always interesting to me and i know it is to you guys too is how you you think of like twitter is  a perfect example it's going to be text messaging you think of it you create it you put it out there  and then you let people do it and it changes and now it's something completely different that was  created by its users i think that's one of the best things that happens in tech for instance big  story on axios this week instagram i had no idea there are a lot of companies posting long text  pieces on instagram that's not new uh pro pro publica does it um it no it's not news but new  but it's growing it's a it's their their headline is instagram morphs into an information powerhouse  i think that's interesting because it means instagram is now a source of news for a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um right i've always sort of tinkered around on my my instagram account and to underscore  prove it just in case you're interested uh just to see what engages people and a couple things  always come to mind people love selfies as much as i hate selfies people love selfies there's always  engagement there and i would write captions based on the images or just something that was on my  mind and i start to wonder are people even reading this stuff so every now and then in those  captions i would say something totally off the cuff just to see if people were reading it and  holy crap people read those things regardless of how long those captions are can i tell a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah quick old so when i went when i was a claramont what was then a claramont men's college my first  year in college and there was professor rude who was an odd political science professor and he would  he loved long papers so the longer the paper the higher the grade but he will he never graded them  until the end of the term and people never handed them into the end of the term so he would  he would be the last day of the term with a huge stack of papers and they would always come back  with a grade and no comment and the rumor was he just weighed them um but one time in a 60 page  paper in the middle of nowhere somebody just put parenthesis rude sucks and parenthesis the only  comment on the paper was source

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people read and surprise you that's funny here's an account called slacktivists  the slacktivists on instagram is no pictures at all it's news stories it's text news stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah lots of hashtags i mean people yeah i mean think about it when you're on your phone you go  into an app you want to spend the time in that app you don't want to be like if you're  waiting somewhere you're just going to be like okay i'm going to open this and i'm going to look  at this this and this you know but you're all in the same place so you want to get everything  you can in that place it makes sense to optimize for that educators for justice diversify your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  narrative generous pro publica is doing it it's really interesting  it's really interesting  so i the bottom line is i like seeing what creators do with the platform once they get  you know full access to it and i think that's what's happening on tiktok it's where we're at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the very beginning of a process very beginning process of figuring out what they can people  figure out what they can do with the internet yeah that's exactly right we forget guess what  guess what i'm gonna do i'm gonna raise moral panic goodenberg no goodenberg goodenberg  this is a good thing i was texting i had to think so it took a hundred i've said this before the  show it took 150 years before anyone invented the regularly published newspaper but i realized it  took the same amount of time to invent essays and the modern novel right i think you talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too bad google's gotten better at that but it's it's not as bad as people would assume

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's gotten better it's gotten better it used to be awful was community captioning a place for  people to to sneak in bad things maybe it was a spam thing google youtube says it which wasn't  widely used zach says he has made friends around the globe through his live streaming channel he  won't be able to watch his friends youtube channel it's in finnish and it was the community  captioning that made it accessible does he does he speak finnish no that's the point oh he wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh they say uh they can't just take away like had problems with spam and abuse it will focus  on other creator tools they're literally just taking the captions off you could still use  your own captions automatic captions and third-party tools and services there you go  so you still have options yeah but the community captioning that was nice but it's hard you got to  police it right and that's probably expensive and google didn't want to do it they've turned on nearby  share yay this is a copy of apple's airdrop capability samsung talked about it today on  their event they mentioned uwb ultra wideband which is the chip that apple puts in its iphone  so that you can point at somebody and share content uh if you have a pixel phone you'll get it  i think now android 6 plus is required samsung says they're going to have it it's kind of interesting  because it uses bluetooth and then it will choose the faster wi-fi or web rtc  if if it's available so it can do the handshake and then choose a faster way to stream for high  quality data you'll find it in your settings turn on device visibility  and soon it'll work with chromebooks so you'll be able to share i use airdrop all the time it's one  reason to be in the apple ecosystem is very easy to send a picture from your phone to your computer  or to another person uh to an ipad it's a really nice feature i'm glad that they are adding this  select google pixel and samsung devices will be the first to receive pretty good share have you
