Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Esteemed might be pushing it. Esteemed news director. I'll take whatever I can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm all steamed up. Great to have you Mike. And Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land  and Marketing Land. It's great to have you back. Welcome.  Great to be back. Good to see you. I always say, can we get Danny on?  Can we get Danny on? I like Danny. Yeah.  There's nobody. How long have you been doing Search Engine Land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Search Engine Land I've been doing since 2000, end of 2006.  And then I had done the Search Engine Watch site since like 1996.  So your 10th anniversary is coming up. Ten and 20 next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. That's a long. 96. There hardly were any websites in 96.  Alta Vista, man. Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a great thing I put on Instagram that did really well.  It was, if you ever watch Veep, there's the chief of staff in there  and they find something on Google and he's like, oh man, I hate the internet.  I liked it better when it was just Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Veep. Oh, get me started on Veep.  I'm sad. No game. What am I going to do Sunday nights?  No Game of Thrones, no Silicon Valley, no Veep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't watch Sense8. It's terrible. Is it?  It's terrible. Really? Yeah.  I've come to the conclusion that it's terrible.  I liked it at first and then I...  Minor spoiler, it's kind of like Lost.  Oh, that's not what I need.  It's kind of weird and you're kind of like, oh, that's weird.  And then but I just think they're not going to...  I think it's going to end up being a dream the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody said Game of Thrones, everybody's going to die  and end up on the island and Lost and then go on with Lost.  That would be great. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big reveal. It's the same show. It's the same show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can catch up on Orphan Black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love Orphan Black. Although somebody told me the new season is not as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been different. I've enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Just the acting of the lead character is so good  that it's like it makes up for any faults it might have.  She is so good. She does. She really is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every imaginable character. She really is good.  How are we talking about TV? I don't know how that happened.  But as geeks, we like to watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we got Under the Dome coming back.  So there we can... Oh, no.  We can know. Under the Dome is great.  I know where it's the Google show, but you have to watch Under the Dome  because you have never seen Microsoft product placement  like you will see in that show.  They set off bombs with their Windows phone.  Microsoft Surfaces everywhere.  I'm interested to see if they manage to get the Surface Pro 3  through the dome finally, because they're still on old Surface 2s.  That's so funny.  But it's funny because I like the ads too, because you get all that stuff.  And then even Google occasionally will buy an ad.  And sometimes... Some counter programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Does Google do product placement?  I don't think I've ever seen an Android...  like intentional product placement.  Look at my fine Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should. No, they shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't recall a lot of that.  No.  It doesn't come to mind.  It's kind of like with Apple too, where supposedly they don't do product placement.  They say they won't pay for it.  They make the devices available for people who want it.  Their partners do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't pay for it.  Well, Apple says they just give everybody...  If you give me 100 MacBooks, that's paying for it.  One Apple product is a lot of money.  But yeah, Samsung does it.  A bunch of companies. Nokia used to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Nokia. Remember in the first Star Trek reboot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Google did have one notable product placement.  And that would be the movie The Internship.  That's an excellent point.  But other than that, I don't know.  I haven't seen that movie, by the way.  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worth seeing.  I don't know if hilarious is the word I'd use.  You liked it?  I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a sucker for that.  It's worth seeing.  I liked it.  It's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's exactly what you'd expect to get from it.  You've seen that kind of movie before with Vince Vaughn or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vince Hangover in Google.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is interesting, though, is I've never seen...  This will get back to Google, but I'll shut up.  But they have never spent as much money on commercials,  especially for search, as I have seen them do over this past year.  And a lot of that really feels like it is that run up to  we don't know what's going to happen with Apple.  We really want to make sure you're using the Google search app  because we want to keep you locked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about that, because it's pretty obvious now that Apple is  running as fast as it can away from Google.  Was it you who wrote that article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was me. It was me who wrote that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's so synopsized?  You say the end is near.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two factors that are causing us to the world to change in such a way  that people like me, who loves running Google stuff on Apple hardware,  are numbered.  So basically what's happening is, number one,  we are becoming increasingly reliant and falling increasingly in love with  our virtual assistants, Google Now and Siri.  Increasingly, those are becoming more powerful by using more products  from the company that makes it.  So, for example, with Google Now, they just launched now on Tap,  which is only for Android.  So suddenly, it already required Google Calendar, Gmail,  other Google products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a difference.  I think Google would have it available on Apple.  It's just the way Apple constructs iOS.  You can't do that kind of thing.  But I think Google would love it.  I mean, it's clear, unlike Windows Phone, Google wants to be on Apple.  They realize they need to be.  That's true.  Although, if you read that great book about Google, Dogfight,  they talk about how there was a debate.  Andy Rubin did not want to make it.  He was very upset when he heard they were making apps for Apple.  He said, no, no, you should only make apps for Android.  But in fact, some of the best Apple apps were Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some of the most lucrative advertising opportunities are on iOS devices.  Right.  Because those are the people who spend more on average.  The other factor, of course, is that, and I address that very point in the column,  is that Apple is deliberately trying to replace Google.  If you look at the new Spotlight features, this stuff is designed for  you just never have to use Google.  You just run your search in Spotlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It uses Bing if it has to do a web search.  Absolutely.  The real question is, at what point does Safari stop defaulting to Google?  Is that the last place app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a certainty that that's going to happen at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is that what you, see, to me, that puts the lie to what Apple says,  which is we put users first.  Really, users want Google, don't they?  They don't want Bing.  I don't hear anybody clamoring, please make the default search be Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple just doesn't trust anyone, and they think that in the future,  if they don't control every aspect, they're digging up their own iron ore to  make their devices and stuff.  They don't trust anybody, and they constantly eliminate partners.  I think the most extreme example, though, of Apple trying to replace Google is now  they have Street View cars driving around, taking pictures in the UK and  in 13 states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Apple Maps is another example of where they didn't do the best thing for  the consumer, which would be not do their own weak version of Maps, but  let consumers continue to use Google Maps, which they like.  Of course, they haven't blocked Google's apps.  I mean, that would be the final draconian step is to say, no,  you can't use Google's apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, part of it is Apple just doesn't like the whole API concept.  In order for them to sort of get away from Google altogether,  they've got these hooks from Siri directly into Apple Maps,  from the Apple Watch into Apple Maps and so on.  In order for that to be an open API that other companies could use,  that would run counter to what Apple likes to do.  They want all that to happen behind the scenes, invisibly, and  that's how they define the user experience.  We control everything, we make sure everything works perfectly and  flawlessly without you having to configure anything.  And that means we have to build everything from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they somewhat misrepresent the case saying, well,  we're doing this to protect your privacy.  Yeah, protect your privacy from Google, but Apple sells ads.  Apple, in order to do news, has to collect information about what you're reading,  despite what they say.  But you make, at the end, kind of the ultimate point,  which is we're all going to have to choose.  There will be the left-hand path and the right-hand path.  If you want Google, you're going to have to go Android.  If you want Apple, you're going to have to go iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As somebody who used an Android device for a long time,  then switched to iPhone when the iPhone 6 came out,  I was struggling with the concept of using Google now on iPhone already.  You have to open the app.  It's pretty good, but it's not quite there.  And now, with the major changes that both Apple has done with its preemptive search  and all that kind of stuff, and the things that Google has done with Now on Tap,  I'm going to get, if I try to use Google Now on iPhone,  it's going to be such an inferior experience compared to Siri on iPhone or  compared to Google Now on Android, that I'm not going to make that choice.  I'm going to choose one phone or the other, and I'm going to go with the virtual  assistant that's made by the same people who made the operating system.  Okay, so using an iPhone now, you're going to go, you're going to stick with the iPhone?  No, I may go all the way, I may go all the way Google.  I love Google now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Danny, do you feel like Google now is living up to its potential, though?  It feels like it could do so much more, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think it's far ahead of any of the competitors.  I think there is more it can do, and I think that they will continue to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they worried about going too far, crossing the creepy line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's part of it.  When I've talked with them, one of the things that they've also said is that it's  not so much that they want to go far, it's that it's easy to try to do things that  people don't actually want or use, and now I can't think of good examples of that.  But you know, that they can try to, there's all sorts of things people think  their assistant should do, and then there are some of the things that they wouldn't  actually use that much, there are some things that they might think, oh, that's a bit  too eerie, and then there's sort of the just right area, and that's what they're  trying to get to.  And you know, I think they've been very good on doing the just right stuff.  But you know, sometimes you can see it go a little out of control, like, you know,  one of the powerful things is that it's understanding things you search for.  So it will suggest articles that you've looked for.  But then sometimes I can feel a bit overwhelmed, like, wow, I don't need all  these articles you're giving me, like, way too many, that sort of thing.  But in other things, it does it does really well.  So, you know, I think they're on the right path.  And I think, you know, for me, this has been one of the most exciting things,  actually, is watching this development of predictive search.  And and even with the stuff that Apple rolled out last week, it doesn't really  come close to touching what Google now does because they don't have the search  history and they don't have the access into your your email.  And that's the trade off you're getting.  You know, if you want an assistant, whether it's a human assistant or a virtual  assistant that is effective, they're going to be more effective the more they  know about you. So it's a matter of what you trust.  And at some point, maybe Apple will try to go through and do more of the, OK,  we will go ahead and start reading your email and all this other stuff and hope  the fact that they're not trying to necessarily target ads specifically around.  It may may help people make that kind of a choice.  But there's still a lot of learning that they need to do.  And they just don't have that kind of learning that Google's established so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We often argue on other shows and this show, too, about privacy, about Google,  about whether Google knows too much, whether people should worry.  Nobody debates, I think, the the right of anybody to say, I want to be more private.  Yeah. But some of us say, don't push that too far, because I would, you know,  if you're concerned, you have the right to be private.  Don't tell me I have to be private.  I'd like to give Google those signals because I like what I get from Google.  And I find that valuable. Right.  And if I do that, that's to my detriment.  But I don't know what I'm afraid of is that technophobes or people  are worried about protecting their privacy will shut down a lot of great stuff  because they think, well, nobody should be allowed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the problems is that the public isn't isn't equipped  technologically or intellectually to really fully grapple  with what's happening with their data in the world in general.  It's very complicated.  Part of the reason is that that information is not public  or available to anyone because the these are trade secrets to a very large extent.  But there's another element to this that I think is is a good thing  to introduce in the conversation, which is that, you know, Danny was talking  about the advertising that Google's been doing.  You know, it's an old cliche that you are the product if it's advertisers supported.  And I don't really that's not really accurate.  Like, I don't really believe that's fully accurate, even though I've said it  in a column long ago.  But it is true that one of the things that they are doing  to make a better product is to make a better user.  In other words, companies like Facebook and Google  succeed to the extent that they can convince the public to go along with  and accept and enjoy the changes that they're affecting in people's lives  in terms of privacy and other things.  So the quicker Google or Facebook or some other company  can get you to accept the data harvesting that they're doing.  The more successful they're going to be financially.  And and Apple has its own way of doing things.  Apple has done things in the past that are just blatantly designed  to train users like lab rats.  I mean, for example, one of my favorite examples is when the iPhone came out,  the radical thing about it, which everybody whined about,  was the lack of a keyboard.  Oh, I can't type on this on screen keyboard.  This is terrible. I'm never going to accept this.  And Apple not only refused to make a physical keyboard to go with it,  they refused to let anyone else do it either.  They they forced us three years in the wilderness or something like that  with zero keyboard except the on screen keyboard.  When we all accepted it and they said, OK, other keyboards can  can come out that support this.  They trained us to use on screen keyboards.  Nobody else could have done it. They did it.  They made a better user.  And that's one of the reasons why they're a leader in multi  multi touch interfaces, because they made users become  more adaptable to the things that they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I agree on that.  I think that's a great observation on the whole the whole keyboard thing.  And it's one of the advantages that Apple has and that they control  the entire thing because it's a closed system.  So we have both.  You're going to do what you want.  And, you know, at the same time, you had Android.  And if you did want the keyboard and you didn't want to change over,  you could you could go with it from there.  I think that is the downside, though.  Sometimes people don't want to be trained to do something different  and they're happy with what they're doing.  So it's nice that you have those alternatives.  And I think that goes to the whole idea of, well, will we be choosing,  you know, based off of what I can get from Apple's crowd  and what they do for their assistant versus Google?  I guess I'm more optimistic  or that I don't know that people are necessarily choosing their phones  for the data that's behind them.  I think people are still stuck in the mindset of  I'm buying the iPhone because it has some apps I like  or I'm used to the interface or I just like Apple products  and it syncs with a few things there or I'm buying Apple for this other reason.  I thought the takeaway that some people are really deeply embedded  in the ecosystems, but I just don't know that people right now  are going to consciously think, well, I would want to get  Android because Google now is so much better on that.  I think that's a real minority of the people that are there.  Maybe it'll change.  What I think is going to happen, and this is a piece I've been  noodling for some time, is sort of like, you know, it's talking about  the Google search phone and that what you're seeing happen,  especially on Android, but even with Google's products on any of the devices,  is that they are leveraging their search to turn these into search phones,  not smartphones, that they have the ability to let you search  and locate information in a way that, you know, takes the virtual search box  that we're used to on Google itself and puts it into your hand  and allows you to go around.  And one of the interesting things they demonstrated last week was this idea  that, you know, if you're standing in front of it, they did this in Paris  and I tried it out myself where I was, you know, you stand in front of the Eiffel Tower  and you just tell your phone how tall is it and you can do this on iPhone.  Does that work?  Yeah. And it came back and said it's, you know, 178 meters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say how tall is it?  And if you're in proximity to the Eiffel Tower, it says, oh, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you say how big is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do some of that stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we had we I didn't know it did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason Howell is going, you know, no, we talked about it  a little bit on last week's show, right?  The location, the proximity sensor, you know, knows where you are via GPS  and it can add context as a result.  Yeah. Like what's the phone number of this place?  And it would pull back the phone number of Twitter.  That makes sense. Oh, that's right. We did talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Apple can try to do some of that stuff as well.  But I think that, you know, it really it's really powerful  in the sense that you think, oh, that makes sense.  And it seems very natural.  And yet that would be an incredibly hard thing for a surgeon to have done  until we tied it to a mobile device and until you can tie it  into a whole database of information.  And that's what Google has.  They've got their knowledge graph, their knowledge vault.  They've got all this search data that they've picked up.  And so when we talk about what Apple may do,  you know, two years ago, I wrote about how they wouldn't go  thermal nuclear on Google.  What they would do is they build out something, maybe like the Siri search  engine, and over time you would see that disappear.  And I think and I think that Jason nailed it very well.  Cala Connison, his piece where he said it's spotlight and that, you know,  they didn't call it the Siri search engine, but that's what spotlight has happened.  It has turned into this replacement.  And I think that you will see them, you know, if they just, you know,  the Google deal should have been up by now.  So as best we can tell, because they said they're still talking,  it's probably been extended for a few months.  But, yeah, I think that they could turn Google off  and a lot of people wouldn't notice because a lot of the general searching  you do tends to be, you know, well, it's not that much of a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spotlight doesn't say here's a Google search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't. And that's that's so you don't even know.  You get away from users thinking you drop Google because you didn't drop Google.  You added spotlight. Right.  And you've been adding spotlight over the past couple of years,  you know, you over the past two years, you've built out the spotlight search engine.  So if Apple does it and they announce new spotlight search  and Safari is powered by spotlight search or has spotlight search night,  they may even be calling it that already.  You don't think they've switched off Google.  You don't think I'm not getting Google.  And the Bing results when you get into the web search results  are probably good enough for a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just tricking people, basically. That's like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's kind of the Apple way.  I mean, you know, Google's approach to search is search.  This is search. We are doing search.  Are you feeling lucky?  And then Apple's way is like, you can find things.  Right. It's like not even done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that is how people think of search.  That's what people want search to be. Right. They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what will happen is Apple will successfully get you off  of using Google search and Safari over to spotlight search.  But all they've done is made you start using a Google clone from 2008.  Yeah. Over on Google, they're doing Google 2015,  which has the direct answers, which has the predictive searches,  which has all this other stuff that's going on with it from there that ties you in.  And that is the harder thing for them to try to replicate.  And that maybe will be the thing that causes people to come into it.  If not, switching off from their Android device,  just switching over to the Google search app, because maybe they get used  to having all this stuff at hand and it's and it's nice for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you played with the Soundhounds new search?  Natural language search is called Hound.  I haven't. They said they were going to send me an invitation.  I never got it. You've heard about it, though.  You've seen the demos, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, vaguely.  I it sounds somewhat familiar, but there's so many different people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. And I first poo pooed it.  Oh, good. Here's my invite.  Don't show my activation code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope. Yeah, I was going to send you an invite, actually.  I have one. Have you played with it?  I haven't. The few times that I have, I didn't have very good results.  So I just haven't. Right.  I found the time to go back and really silly things to try to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  beat Google at their own game. Right.  That's a tall order.  And yet I'd seen some stuff that people talking about it.  Maybe that's just good marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think what people have said about it is that it makes for a good demo,  like when you watch the videos. Right.  But then when you really try and kind of go off,  go off on your own and come up with, you know, try and stump it.  It's pretty easy to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But how's kind of like spotlight in that way?  And I think that that actually is what people want.  People don't want to do search.  They just want the answers to things that they're looking for available  when they need them. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm looking over the tech crunch thing that they did on SoundHound.  Yeah. And they're like saying, hey, look, you can do a bunch of searches  in rapid succession.  Let me tell you, the director of conversational search from Google  did this. Right.  I mean, it's not we're not talking.  I've got a startup or I've got a thing that maybe I can use  if I get the invite and we'll see how it happens.  He sat there, stood there live in front of an audience  and probably went through 40 different queries and would do things like,  you know, who is LeBron James?  What team does he play for?  What was his score?  You know, not even full sentences,  but understanding the previous question that you had said, you know,  in the way that I guess Hound can do that sort of thing as well.  And it was working near flawlessly.  You know, and then coupled with that, I mean, he just he he went  through the stuff that a couple of years ago, you would have thought was amazing  that it could just give you answers like that with him just speaking.  But then, you know, he would do things like and this goes back  to the location thing where he's like, you know, call the conference center.  I'm in. And it knew the conference center he was in.  It found the phone number, dialed it up and, you know, it was like, whoa.  You know, so it's yeah, I guess these things could come along.  But Google's already got it.  And Google has it so much that we either don't realize that it's there  or we just take it for granted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, so how it has the same problem that Google does on Apple.  You have to launch the hand app for it to write and then say, OK, Hound,  how many calories are in three eggs, 200 grams of spinach  and a pound of hamburger?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There are 1387 calories in three medium raw whole eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty fast. That's good. That's really good.  What did you ask it?  I asked it a compound search, which was how many calories are in  three raw whole eggs, 200 grams of spinach and a pound of hamburger.  But it did that within less calories are in three, three eggs.  So try that with Google.  Should we try that with Google?  You know, I'll do the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I can't.  I can't remember all the different things you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, let's let's see.  I'll do this with Google.  Let's go to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one of the things, first of all, the search you just did  and the result was a glimpse of the future.  We're not going to be pondering over results.  We're going to just get the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a very nice answer, too, because they give me all the nutrition facts.  And although OK, Google, I got to enable it.  Oh, and I shouldn't say it because everybody I'm sorry, everybody.  How many calories are in three whole eggs, a pound of hamburger  and 200 grams of broccoli?  It's already slower.  Didn't give me a very good result, and it didn't do it very fast.  No. So there's one thing it does better.  Not that I'm going to launch Hound to do that,  but it also does so it does compound searching, which is kind of interesting.  You can say, give me here.  Let's try it. OK, how give me all the bed and breakfasts  in San Francisco that are four stars or more and less than 200 bucks a night?  I got a little extra garbage in there.  Whoops, and it's still going.  Something about Carcassonne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and and it has a little bit of extra garbage. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me all the bed and breakfasts in San Francisco  that are three stars or better and less than 200 bucks a night.  So doesn't like 200 bucks.  Oh, my God. Oh, shoot.  Stop talking.  Let's see. Let's see if it makes any sense out of that compound

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  showing search results for all the bed and breakfasts in San Francisco  that are three stars or better and less than 200 bucks a night and like 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It actually at least it made an effort.  Yeah. By the way, it also has an ad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the results like, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, mostly it's just search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's well, I think it's good that it wasn't thrown by your colloquialism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever I was saying there, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you go back to the results, so yeah, it interpreted what you search.  But it didn't actually give you an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it didn't give me the answer as I expected it to.  Just checking through.  I don't know. It's an interesting idea anyway.  That's Hound.  And it's from the Sound Hound folks, which is kind of interesting.  I guess my my surprise is I wouldn't expect anybody to attempt to enter this space.  You've already got. Yeah.  Cortana, Google and Siri. Yeah.  But that's amazing.  And by the way, Amazon, which does a pretty decent job with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is fast. And so is Echo, by the way. Yeah.  It goes really fast. Yeah.  Come to think of it, Google's a laggard.  What are they? What's going on with the Google?  Think they can compete. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We come back.  You probably covered this at all about Android last night.  Six hundred thousand Samsung phones vulnerable.  No, we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To a keyboard.  We didn't make it into the show last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, we'll talk about it.  It was overlooked. Keyboard flaw.  That SwiftKey says it's not our fault.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.  So many people.  So many reasons why smart business people trust LegalZoom, including me.  We used them to form an LLC ten years ago.  You could do the same, incorporate, form a nonprofit, register your trademark,  apply for a patent.  More than a million people over the last 10 years have used LegalZoom  to kind of make their dreams come true.  It's also your first stop when you need advice from an attorney.  Now, see, this is why it gets a look up.  They're not a law firm.  And there are no attorneys, you know, to answer your calls at LegalZoom.  But they have built a network of independent attorneys in most states  to provide legal advice and other useful services to help you run your business.  That's the pre-negotiated LegalZoom legal plan, which is great.  Whether you need a contract reviewed or advice on whether you should incorporate  or form an LLC or as I wondered, what state my LLC should be in LegalZoom.com.  Complete transparency, upfront pricing, customer reviews  and a 100% guarantee on your satisfaction.  What state did you choose, by the way?  I chose Delaware, but that's because this was before LegalZoom had the attorney thing.  And I would have loved that because I would have because there are pros  and cons on California versus Delaware.  I just I don't know. I randomly chose Delaware.  Delaware is cheaper and apparently less encumbering and the main reason I did  is sometimes I seem stupid.  I think it was Kevin probably who told me venture capitalists prefer Delaware.  Because I guess because of the less owners legal requires.  But there are advantages to California, for instance, we pay extra business tax  because we have to pay Delaware as well as California.  Right.  Thanks. See, these are the kinds of things LegalZoom can help you with.  And it's great. And wills and trusts and all that stuff to LegalZoom.com  for a special offer.  Ten dollars off. Use the promo code Twig at checkout.  And that's going to let them know you heard about it here.  LegalZoom, we love it.  Dotcom, you give it a try.  Samsung, I have a Samsung Galaxy S6, one of the vulnerable phones.  A statement by a company called Now Secure.  In the Wall Street Journal says, even though we told Samsung.  In 2012, this bug persists.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. November 2014.  This bug persists that is with the Samsung keyboard.  Now, the Samsung keyboard is SwiftKey, but it is not SwiftKey's fault.  In fact, SwiftKey says, if you install the SwiftKey keyboard  and use that from the app store, it is not you will not have this flaw.  Last week, two researchers from Now Secure to see.  Samsung said, OK, OK, wait three months and we'll fix it.  Three months are up.  They bought two Galaxy S6s, found that both were still vulnerable  to the security hole, which involves how the phone accepts data  when updating keyboard software, particularly the themes.  So the themes can come from a  they're they come from a non secure server and that server can be spoofed.  So you can install a theme on your keyboard and it may, in fact,  put a keystroke logger on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TechCrunch had a few sources that said that it was entirely Samsung's  implementation screw up that caused it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the chief the chief source of that would probably be SwiftKey,  which is anxious to let you know that this is not a vulnerability  that belongs to SwiftKey.  Yeah, we said they wrote we supply Samsung with the core technology  that powers the word predictions in their keyboard.  It appears that this the way this technology is integrated on Samsung devices  introduced the security vulnerability.  We're doing everything we can to support a longtime partner  in their efforts to resolve the Samsung says  Knox, their security platform, has the capability to update  the security policy of the phones over the air.  And I think invisibly to invalidate any vulnerabilities  they say these security policy updates will roll out in a few days.  So you're looking on the screen, those of you watching at the proof of concept  from the security researchers now secure who displace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that's their video, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. See what happens here.  I was so impressed that you guys have managed to set this up.  I have set up an incredible demonstration.  I'm horrified it was so easy for you to see something.  No, this is their video. Absolutely.  For clarity, SwiftKey wants to assure everyone  this issue does not affect SwiftKey's consumer keyboard applications  on Google Play or the Apple Store, for that matter.  And we're absolutely committed, blah, blah, blah.  So this is a Samsung problem.  But something I guess you should be aware about.  So Nest had an event on the yesterday right on the 15th or the 16th.  Or is it today? It was today.  Today, today. Yeah, it was during TNT.  They announced a new smoke detector.  They had pulled the old one off the market  because apparently if you wave if you waved at it too vigorously,  it's a OK, I guess, you know, for example, if there's a fire,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to know. We don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No problem. I won't bother you again.  So the second generation smoke detector, also called the Nest Protect,  detects smoke to, in fact, split spectrum sensors.  It says it can read shorter wavelengths  because modern materials burn faster.  It also lets you silence the smoke alarm, but not by waving your arms.  You have to use your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better charge your phone.  It's also 11 percent smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the thinnest smoke detector we've ever made.  There's a new smoke chamber to keep dusts and insects out of it.  OK, didn't know that was a problem.  Ninety nine bucks.  Now, how much is a first alert?  Like the cheapo smoke detectors like $15.  Yeah, yeah. Can't wave at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll pay anything so that at two o'clock in the morning  and I'll have to go trying to figure out which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true. I hate that. I hate that.  The new Protect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, like we because, you know, I said they're doing our house.  So it was like clear everything out of that house.  And I have a box of smoke detectors and carbon dioxide  detect monoxide detectors.  And I I looked at this box, right, because there's like one by every bedroom  and everything like that.  And I thought, God, if I had to replace all that with Nest,  that's a huge investment.  And then when it dies, but, you know.  That's true. But it's convenient, you know,  if you see something happening at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does your smoke detector constantly test itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this. I love this.  It actually makes an audible alert at night and then it listens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It listens. Do I hear it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it doesn't constantly detect itself, right?  But I could hang two of them up next to each other for twenty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now I double the protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but seriously, it's like I don't have just one smoke  detector in the house, right? I have five of them.  I think I had at least five.  So, you know, for the carbon monoxide testing, I mean,  I'm absolutely paranoid about that because you hear these horror stories  of people who just don't realize it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but where you yeah, you should have both smoke and carbon  monoxide detectors. Absolutely.  Yeah. But will your carbon monoxide protector talk to the Nest thermostat  and say, turn the heat off? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a fire. There's no need for additional heat.  Yeah, no, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the best thing was, what was it?  That's right. See if we can blow it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's warm in here. Maybe you should turn the heat down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was marketing tunes or whatever.  It was like, I keep getting, you know, I keep getting ads from Google  about fire in my house. I think that it's trying to tell me something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We notice you don't have a smoke detector.  No, if if the carbon monoxide detector goes off, usually carbon monoxide  is a is a cracked exchange plate in the heater or something like that.  This is so they turn off the heater  and it'll also alert you on your phone.  There's a new safety temperature feature.  If your home gets too hot or too cold,  you'll get a notification.  Jesus, it's hot in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You must be very uncomfortable.  You must be freezing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's actually good for pets.  It's too hot for pets or if it's too cold and the pipes might burst.  And there's a new drop cam. That's right.  I'm actually more interested in, frankly, in the new drop cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the drop cam actually has a feature that they didn't announce,  but it was in the fine print in the press release and so on.  And that is that they are going to be working with a few select  content creators to do live streaming to YouTube  from this what's called a Nest Cam.  They drop they dropped the drop in the drop.  It's a Nest Cam. Nest Cam.  And so some people are going to be using it for sort of like streaming video.  Streaming video. Watch me. Watch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a recode discovered this that  and it's using it's using Brillo. Yeah.  Nest revealed it is leaning on Google, the device company  partnering with two Google divisions, a promotional program for its thermostat  for customers of Google Fiber.  Well, that leaves me out.  Austin, Kansas City and Provo. Good news.  You get a 50 buck. Yeah. Big deal.  And by the way, Fiber will expand to 18 additional metropolitan areas in January.  But it's not a business.  We're just, you know, we're just fooling around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Nest Cam, you have to because I'm looking at on now.  You have to subscribe it with it to have it keep the video like.  Yeah, that's always if you don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Drop cams always been like that if you want.  But because you can always check the drop cam live,  even if you don't subscribe.  But what the subscription does is give you a DVR, an offsite cloud DVR.  So you can go back in time.  We were doing that. We had the drop cams watch the studio while we were building it.  And that's how we got the famous butt crack video.  I don't need to say much more about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you don't have the subscription, though, you don't get  like you get the live video and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah. Wow.  Well, what do you want for nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rubber Biscuit. It's like a $200 camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want I'll tell you what I want.  I want them to email me.  Computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Nest Cam is pretty good.  1080p. Are we going to we don't put we don't use drop cams anymore, but  I like now they say select YouTube partners.  So not just anybody can do this right.  Sorry, I got a big take over here.  I got I don't know.  I think they're very attractive.  Yeah, 200 bucks is not horrible.  It's a basically a drop cam pro 1080p video,  130 degree field of view, infrared night vision.  It has a microphone  and it also has a speaker. Right, John?  You could talk to it, but you sound like you're  hey, can you hear me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you doing about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like ordering a burger.  So, I mean, actually, the cloud storage is pretty expensive.  Ten day video history.  So it goes back ten days.  One hundred dollars a year.  A 30 day video history is three hundred dollars a year.  Yeah, it's a little pricey.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think of our ring doorbell, which is 30 bucks a year. Yeah.  But the difference is the drop cam saving everything all the time.  The ring only saves when there's motion. Right. Yeah.  So the drop. So it's saving a lot of it's a lot of video.  It's saving. Right.  But I feel like this is an opportunity for somebody else to come along and say,  we're going to give you a better deal on the on the storage.  Uh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google. I mean, imagine Google.  They have all that storage and they seem like they own Nest. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not giving it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you know what? I mean, it is kind of weird, right?  You would think that if you have a Google account, this is this is actually a case  where you would think it would be nice of Nest and Google talk to each other.  Yeah. Right. You know, I suppose one hundred dollars a year for ten days.  But that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But ten days is enough, by the way. You don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But if you get, you know,  I was looking at some of these other home security things like made TNT or  whatever, they drop everything everywhere and they have monthly subscriptions.  And you might actually get more, more things. But anyway, I don't know.  I know what you mean, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got three quarters of a terabyte sitting there unused. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we use local storage for our cameras.  We use Synology as a security camera solution.  And it records. Oh, by the way, you've got to search for this for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really funny. Search for market to Nest.  So it's market, the word market.  And then NIST and then Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, NIST and Nest.  All in Word. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you might find it anyway. Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how to use Google, Danny.  So thank you for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put that market to this. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Internet of Things cartoon. Yeah.  Tom Fishburne.  I think my Nest smoke alarm is going off.  Google AdWords just pitched me a fire extinguisher and an offer for temporary  housing. That's ultimately why we want to share this information with Google.  Right there. That's a convenience.  That's a convenience.  OK, OK.  Let's see. OnePlus is slowly leaking out details of the next version of their phone,  the OnePlus 2.  They're they're they're really up to their same old marketing tricks, aren't they,  Jason Howell? The one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think they believe that it works for them.  It does. I mean, it does.  When you take a look at kind of what a unknown, previously unknown hardware  manufacturer was able to do with the OnePlus one, they had their hiccups  along the way, but they still generated a lot of excitement for the device,  even with all those marketing blunders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not much of a surprise.  They're saying it'll run the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon, the 810,  although Samsung has chewed the 810 for the Exynos saying it's too hot.  And by the way, I got to tell you, as an owner of Galaxy,  as much as I love this phone, it has two processors.  It swaps back and forth.  It gets pretty dang hot.  So much so that when I watch the gear,  V with watch virtual reality in the gear VR after about 15 minutes,  the gear VR says we're stopping now because you're too hot.  So wow, wow, wow.  OnePlus plans to use both thermal gel and graphite to diffuse heat  from the Snapdragon 810.  So it's like they kind of know it is is very hot.  The way HTC solved it,  they basically throttled the speed way down, making a very sluggish phone,  which really begs the question, why put a super fast processor in  if you can't use the speed? Right.  That's all we know, though.  That's all they're saying.  There's no official release date.  And what they're going to do is release specs a little bit at a time  just to guarantee that they'll stay in the news cycle  and we'll talk about it every week.  So I want to tell you right now,  that's the last you're going to hear about that phone  until we know everything there is to know.  I'm not falling for it.  Jason, will you make that pledge on all about Android 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to talk about OnePlus 2 until there's an actual device to look at.  I'm not going to fall for it.  That's not a bad pledge.  However, I reserve the right.  Oh, man.  Because sometimes, you know, they might announce something revolutionary.  Right. In which case.  That would be a story. Yeah.  But if it's just little bits of details here and there,  I think that's not a bad pledge at all.  Well, I just don't want to fall for it.  Yeah, no, it's true. Sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  Each week, we'll release another part and you'll do another story.  Yeah. Not that it matters because everybody else is nobody else is taking  to take that pledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's so many companies doing that kind of thing these days.  Just Amazon is amazing.  They just are always trickling out a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not hard to game this crap system  that we call the tech blogosphere.  Yes. Everybody's desperate to find clicks.  Not that you're a part of that, Danny Sullivan.  Not that you would ever fall for that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm not going to fall for any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're you know, that's one of the things I appreciate about you,  maybe because you've been doing this for so long.  But the search engine land does not do link bait, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you don't fall for that.  You know, we well, there is the story of the Egyptian repair  man who outranked Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that wasn't us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. A search engine watch.  Oh, that's a different one.  That's the copycat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, that's just a copy of the original article that was put up there.  It was an interesting to see the guy who wrote it, Ied Noor.  We actually looked at the article when that first appeared,  where I think he put it out on his personal page or on LinkedIn.  And then we actually were trying to find out what happened.  And we could never get a straight answer from Google on it.  And then by the time they finally got back to us, it was kind of over and done with.  So it was a joke or it's serious.  No, I think there was some kind of a weird glitch that happened  where he was number one for Google on Google.  But but no one knows why it happened.  And there was speculation.  Well, maybe it's the Google Plus link and it wasn't the Google Plus link.  We don't know why it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's an Egyptian HVAC technician.  And in fact, the guy wrote the blog post, called him up.  Yeah. And said, hi, this is Ied Noor.  We work in the field of digital marketing.  I noticed your ranking number one on Google.  Did you know this?  And the fellow said, yeah, a lot of people call me and told me  that Google made a website about me.  No, no, no. I mean, I mean, Google search.  When people search for the word Google, you come up first.  Did you know that?  No, no, I just find people calling me and telling me they saw my Google.  So you never did anything to promote your page. What page?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your page on Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just published it using my email back in 2009.  That's why I get a lot of people visiting my profile  because I have an old email there.  Actually, I think it takes more than that.  Apparently, they so they never found out why or how this guy got to be  number one on Google search for the word Google.  It only happened in Egypt.  Yes, it was incognito pages and everything.  It wasn't based on.  I mean, what that tells you is that Google doesn't pay very close attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to some countries.  They weren't paying attention with what's happening in the Egypt research results.  No one on Google is searching for Google, apparently.  But, you know, that's what's going on there.  Anyway, Google fixed the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Mr. Sabre no longer ranks number one when you search for the word Google.  Number one, when you search for Google.  In fact, they took the website field out.  See, I think that might have had something to do with it.  His website was Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  E.G. Yeah, and it shouldn't.  I mean, it shouldn't have. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The links. Well, but the links are no follow.  And so it shouldn't have had an impact on that.  Right. It's not supposed to pass credit, but there might have been just some bug  where he did pick it up and because it's from a Google domain, because otherwise  anybody could just add Google to their Google Plus profile and we'd all be ranking  for Google. And that clearly doesn't happen.  Right. So, you know, it's it may be that fed into some other bug that that made it happen.  But that that person has nothing to teach you in terms of ranking.  Well, well, unless you can manage to get the same kind of bug to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Sabre noticed that his search results were going down.  So he put Google.com.  E.G. back on his profile and he was back number one.  Wow. So happening again.  Yeah. Well, apparently this is a follow up over the weekend.  I noticed Mr. Sabre is back at the top when searching for Google's brand name keywords.  I checked his Google Plus profile, found that a Google.com.  E.G. URL is back in the website field.  I called him. He confirmed he noticed that Google changed his website URL.  So he put it back.  And he is the king of SEO, ladies and gentlemen.  If you've got any SEO questions, call the HVAC technician in Cairo.  Just search for Google and you'll find him.  It's pretty funny. But a bug, right?  Believe me, I know about website bugs. I know all about website bugs.  Chrome Bookmark Manager. What happened there?  That didn't work out so well for Google.  We actually talked about it, I think, when they released the new Bookmark Manager.  They've gone back to the previous version.  Apparently not as responsive.  Or maybe people just said, we don't like this.  Is that what I have now?  I think I said it was confusing.  Yeah. Showing thumbnails and so forth.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's another one of those things that Google would do that Apple would never do.  Well, maybe try stuff.  Yeah, try stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could have been an AAB test.  See if I do this. If I go to my Bookmark Manager, do I get the...  No, isn't that the new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also keep the new one by installing a specific Bookmark Manager extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's probably the right way to do it.  Maybe I did that. I don't know.  I think I'm getting the new one. Is that it?  I think so. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows what extensions you might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knows what's going on.  Impossible to predict.  Certainly I don't.  All right, we're going to move along here and talk a little bit about Google's new site  to help you choose your phone.  Surprise, surprise. They choose all the most expensive phones.  That's right.  They're best partners.  I got my 511 update on my S6, by the way.  I have a T-Mobile Galaxy S6.  And it does seem to have fixed a few things.  Maybe that memory leak, that was the question.  We'll talk about the new Twitch killer from Google.  And a lot more.  Oh, and the change at the top in Twitter.  But our show first before we do that is brought to you by our friends at Squarespace.  The place to make your next website, making the web beautiful.  One site at a time.  It's the best hosting combined with the best software.  Beautiful responsive pages that fit your business, your style, whether you're a photographer,  a blogger, an online store, a musician.

I don't know if that's the way to win.  I don't know what you do if you're Blackberry at this point.  How about Sidewalk Labs?  Google made a big deal announcing this.  This is kind of like a pro bono thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's they're investing in it.  And basically they want to fix cities using the miracle of technology.  One of the things that they want to do, which really jumped out at me, was that  they want to make cities more affordable.  And of course, they're under a lot of pressure.  Just as they've done in San Francisco.  Exactly.  But I think this clearly, this seems to me to be a way to sort of dissipate the  focus on Google as a cause for rising prices in big cities like New York and San  Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not our fault.  We've got a site devoted to it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a really interesting initiative.  They're basically just investing a lot.  And Sidewalk Labs is a New York based venture.  And it's headed by Dr.  Doctoroff, who is the former deputy mayor of economic development for the city of New  York.  And the technology is going to fall.  They've already decided what the categories are.  And the categories are really, really interesting.  One is insulation.  They're going to figure out how to insulate buildings better to save a ton of energy.  They want to make cities have lots of electric car charging opportunities.  They want green roofs like Facebook, you know, with a park on the top with trees.  That's a good idea.  They want to have better use of data for dealing with traffic and how people move around the  city.  They want incentives for sustainability.  They want to have lots of services, city services in the cloud.  Here's the one that really blew my mind.  They want to focus on the gut microbes in people who live in cities and figure out how  cities can be teeming with bacteria and microbes so that people have healthy guts.  Nice.  How amazing is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really cool.  If you like bacteria.  This website is about the scantest thing I've ever seen.  There's basically a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just keep reading it as Sidewalk Abs.  I can't see the L.  I would like Sidewalk Abs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could use some Sidewalk Abs.  Basically, there's a press release, a couple of email addresses.  That's it.  It's a one pager.  Or is it a Larry pager?  I feel like I could do this.  I could announce podcast labs.  Yes, yes.  An attempt to create eco safe podcasts and I could put a site up and it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's been $10 or $20 or $100 million of your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what Larry said.  It wasn't that expensive.  For him, that's $10 or $20 million.  That's cigarette money for Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Google equivalent of a politician saying, well, we need a committee to look  at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a committee.  I'm all for it.  I'm all for it.  Improve city life.  Just give everybody a segue.  That's what I say.  Remember when the segue came out, Bill Gates and others said, I think Steve Jobs said this  is going to redefine how cities are built.  They will redesign cities just for the segue.  I wish they would.  Can they get on that now that I have a segue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, be realistic.  They're struggling enough redesigning cities for bicycles, which are 100 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, it's happening and people are starting to make some of those changes.  So it really is dramatic how cities did get redesigned for automobiles and cars.  But maybe some of these things will speed some of this stuff along.  Well, we've got that Hyperloop test track that's being built, so that'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just one.  There's several.  Calacanis has one that he's doing.  There's one in the desert somewhere.  Calacanis wants to focus on using the Hyperloop to deliver cargo under the sea to replace  those big super car container ships and just kind of pneumatically thrust products under the sea.  That sounds weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ships are cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're cheap, but they use a huge amount of oil.  A lot of the oil being used right now is container ships.  Go back to sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem with the Hyperloop is that, and especially the problem with the Hyperloop in California,  is that I'm sure you can solve all of the technical problems.  What you can't do is get the land use.  You can't have any turns or corners.  That's why they do it under the ocean.  Who owns that?  All that plastic?  It's all straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just aim straight for Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's not the plan.  That's Calacanis' plan.  But the one that's actually underway, the Elon Musk version...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he said he wants to do it LA to San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No way it's going to happen.  There's no way you can get the right to do it.  They'll get it all except for like one tract.  They'll have to launch this thing through the air to land in a hole on the other side.  I don't know how they're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this Cade Metz article in Wired, an April Fool's joke, a little late?  Revealed the secret gear connecting Google's online empire.  Did you read this, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  The Pluto switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Pluto switch.  Good old Pluto switch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  What I'm saying is that Google makes its own networking switches.  Yeah.  And one was accidentally shipped to the wrong place.  And that's how they just send...  They posted pictures and stuff.  And then people have been analyzing.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does it work?  Well, it does make sense that Google would make its own switch.  I mean, sorry Google.  I mean, sorry that Google woke up when I said that.  So did mine.  Did it?  Yeah.  These guys are touchy.  We're going to have to do something about this.  We couldn't buy the hardware.  We needed to build a network of the size and speed we needed to build, said a Google spokesman.  It didn't exist, so we built our own the Pluto switch.  It's not really a switch.  It's a good story.  I like it.  Yeah.  Does Google open source like...  Is Facebook open source?  Facebook does.  It's hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's how we do it.  Facebook open sourced its entire thing that it's going on for four years.  And they got Intel bought into it.  They've got all kinds of industry buy in.  They're really changing how data centers operate because, of course, Facebook doesn't...  That's not really their business.  Their business is taking your personal information and selling ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's a Google, Google, Google.  Here's a Google Jupiter super block.  Google is revealing a little bit more about how its servers talk to each other.  It's the Jupiter networking setup, the fifth generation of the company's efforts.  It offers 100 times the capacity of its first in-house data center network, one petabyte per second of something called bisection bandwidth.  That's the bandwidth between two different parts of the network.  A petabyte per second.  That's enough for 100,000 servers to talk at 10 gigabytes per second each.  Wow.  That's like unbelievable.  So this is apparently part of...  This is another...  This is part of the Pluto switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently this initiative began 11 years ago.  Google engineers started building their own gear.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Using a closed network, a multi-stage circuit switching network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not sure if you remember, Leo, a guest.  He's been here a couple of times.  Richard Hay from Google.  He's visited...  Actually, pretty recently he was here.  Really?  He's worked on this project for the last...  No kidding.  Yeah, that's how I saw the article initially on Google+.  Is that the guy I met in Australia who finally...  No, no, that's somebody else.  Yeah, no.  He was here, I don't know, a couple of months ago.  He's always wearing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So look at these people coming in and they...  They're like big shots and they don't even announce themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's been working on this for years and he's like, finally, I can show off what I've been working on.  I can talk about Jupiter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of neat.  Yeah, all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a home Pluto switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a petabyte per second.  We need a petabyte here.  Did you...  Now, I kind of skimmed over that, but I should probably reiterate that, that according to Google, they're going to put Google Fiber in...  What did they say?  A hundred more cities?  Yeah.  I think that's right.  Petaluma.  A Petaluma should be in there, right?  Man, I'd love some Google...  Give me some Google Fiber.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a petabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a petabyte or petibit or whatever it is.  What's the difference?  When it gets to PETA, it doesn't matter if it's a bit or a bite.  It's PETA.  That's what matters.  So Google says we're going to build a Twitch.  Remember that Twitch, the gaming service Twitch.TV that was created by Justin.TV and was wildly successful, was purchased by Amazon.  Apparently a bit of a bidding war between Google and Amazon and others, I imagine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google lost, but no problem.  They're going to build their own.  And Friday, YouTube demonstrated at the YouTube Space in Manhattan their YouTube gaming service, which will launch this summer.  And these are pictures from Ars Technica.  Ronam Audio went to take a look at the service.  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to do this.  You know, this is pretty awesome.  And Jason, I don't know.  I waited till you take a drink before I throw to you.  But like, do you know if this is something, if you can stream from mobile, from a mobile device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I actually don't know that for sure.  Because if you can...  I mean, there will be an app, obviously, but I don't know if there's direct streaming from a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's doing a Let's Play videos with mobile devices or anything.  That would be cool.  No, nobody's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My son wanted one of...  I mean, he wanted a real challenge.  He wanted this expensive thing for his Nintendo DS to stream off of that.  I was like, I can't call it on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he 12?  Close enough.  That's the thing.  Everybody...  I talk to 12 year olds all the time.  The one...  Used to be when I was a kid, they all wanted to be, you know, Michael Jordan.  They all wanted to be, you know, the quarterback, the sports star.  Now they all want to do Let's Play videos with Minecraft.  Like every 12 year old you meet.  Yeah, I've got my YouTube channel.  I'm putting Minecraft videos up there.  Well, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's in the other room on Twitch right now.  Yeah, of course he is.  It used to be I'd be like, you guys have to be quiet.  I'm going to be doing a podcast.  And now it's like, you got to be quiet.  I'm live streaming my game.  Like, oh, excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the other hand...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm broadcasting, Dad.  ...retirement age approaches.  So...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Chad Johnson, who used to do our OMG craft show, used to produce this show,  good friend, moved to LA to pursue stardom.  And he has been doing a lot of Let's Play on YouTube.  He makes good money.  He says it's the most lucrative thing he does.  He's doing well on Patreon and other places.  But he said, what you do, the trick on Let's Play videos on Twitch is to interact with  the chat room, which is very much the trick with Periscope and Meerkat, right?  It's all about talking to the fans.  And he has some deep pocketed fans who just laid the money into his pockets.  Yeah.  I missed the boat here somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I blew it.  I used to publish a newsletter and it was a...  It was casually, you know, voluntarily tip jar type of thing.  Yeah.  And there was one guy who would send me like a hundred bucks a month or something.  He really liked it.  Yeah.  And I think if you have enough fans, you can always find somebody with more money than  cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need a sugar mama.  Any volunteers?  No.  I was thinking, I think I want to try this, like at home.  I get home, instead of ham radio, knitting, I want a hobby.  I'll just sit down in front of the Xbox and I'll play Fallout 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And stream it.  And stream it.  Because you're not streaming enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to go home and stream it.  I see.  YouTube certainly has the back end.  They have the record for the most stream views at a single time.  Eight million people watched Felix Baumgartner jump out of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I believe that couldn't be possible because, you know, watching Silicon Valley's finale  this week, even the best, best technology you have out there...  Catches on fire.  ... middle out, like nobody's ever seen.  Even if you have middle out and the middle out is working in a way that people can't  even anticipate, you're going to like set something on fire if you get to around 400,000  people unless people instantly pull on special gloves and code the middle of it.  It was so funny.  I love it.  It was good.  It was good though.  I always wanted to write a thing like, why nothing on Silicon Valley makes no sense,  doesn't matter anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's close.  It's kind of that weird thing.  And this is television.  This is television in a nutshell.  It feels real, but it's not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I loved about that episode is this guy was dying.  That was the content.  Right.  And they said, great luck.  He's dying.  Yeah.  Nobody cared at all about his life.  They were all like, wow, this is really good latency.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of casualties, Dick Costello is stepping down as CEO of Twitter End of the Month.  Wall Street had been slowly chopping off limbs at Twitter, killing people, working their way  up to the CEO.  They finally got to a Dick and they're cutting off Dick.  I mean, he's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, his first name is embattled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Embattled.  The embattled Dick.  You know what?  Everybody that I talk to at Twitter loves him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's very popular within the company, but he's offered his resignation several times.  So he said, I think I should step down.  They said, no.  And then he said, I think I should step down.  This time they said, OK.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try that.  We've tried everything else.  The stock market soared on the news and then plummeted the next day.  Right back to where they were.  They are so fickle on Wall Street.  I feel kind of bad for Dick.  But on the other hand, I don't really feel that bad.  Jack Dorsey is current interim CEO.  He's back.  He probably will end up being the CEO.  Twitter has been such a soap opera.  If you haven't read Nick Bilton's book on Twitter, read that.  And this is just the obvious continuation of just the company that won everything, but  couldn't manage to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their fatal flaw is that they aren't Facebook.  Or something.  You know, because it's like they...  And what do you do?  If you become more like Facebook, as they have tried to do, you alienate the people  who love the old Twitter.  And if you remain the old Twitter, then you don't get new users.  And so they can't win.  Because they're not Facebook.  Facebook is just killing everybody.  They have 1.4 billion users for Facebook.  They have now 800 million, I think is the latest number for Facebook Messenger.  700, 800.  I think it's 700.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  300 million for Instagram.  300 million for Instagram.  It's bigger than Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  800 million for WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's just ridiculous how many users they have.  And so Twitter comes along with its 300 million or whatever it is, active users.  And it's just how do you compete with a monopoly on everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would you do to turn around Twitter, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I wish I knew.  I feel at times they could use a better product vision.  I mean, one of the things...  You know, they talk about we're the future communication platforms and communications  are a thing or whatever.  But by and large, it just still looks like you get your tweets.  And I think there's a great business there.  And I think that Twitter has established such a stronghold in a lot of people's lives  and a lot of media companies that you watch where you kind of wonder how you could have  a TV show these days without having Twitter being alongside of it.  So the idea is I think some people have sparked that they could do more around live events  and so on, potentially.  And potentially there's a lot more monetization that you can do with it from there.  Maybe reopening some things up with their APIs where people could tap into it in the  way that people got burned on it before, where they said basically, you know, we're not going  to let everybody do everything.  But, you know, that's a tough one.  Honestly, I would try to sell the company to Google.  If it were me, I think that Google's future is part of something bigger.  I think that on their own, they're kind of squeezed in among different things.  But I think as part of, you know, potentially an Apple, but really more like a Google, they  might have a better home, a better fit with other kinds of products or just where maybe the  pressure of them having to try to be more than what they're good at doing.  It's kind of like saying, well, what would you do with YouTube?  Right. I mean, YouTube is profitable, right?  Yeah, but it took a really long time and they still come under pressure of you're not making  as much money or you could be doing more.  Now you've got Facebook coming at them and, you know, how come Facebook's stuff isn't doing  as well with it?  But as something that's within Google, you know, it has less pressure than maybe if it was  sitting out there on its own.  So I think there's a lot of good stuff with Twitter.  I just suspect it's just maybe too hard for it to be successful on its own as a public  company.  That's the thing.  If it were a private company and it was making money and, you know, the investors were happy  with it, but now you go public and then everybody wants the bigger returns.  It's really true.  And I think Mike said it well that, you know, they're going to get compared to Facebook  regardless of whether or not that's the right thing to compare them to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they made one smart recent move, which is that they released the 140 character  limitation on direct messages.  So if you send a DM to somebody, it can be, you know, it can be a...  Why is that smart?  It just feels like email.  Because, well, simply because there's no reason to limit that to 140 characters.  The reason, their secret sauce is the limit for public messages.  So you can have a stream as we both have sitting here going.  And it's not going to be like Google+.  We get these massive messages that you have to slog through.  They're nice, light little things that you breeze by and they're easy to take.  Whereas with direct messages, that's, you know, you can actually communicate significantly  and it's not going to invade anybody's mental space in an obnoxious and unwanted way.  You can control it.  It's from people you know.  And I think really that's a secret.  The bottom line is that strangers don't scale.  The only thing that is going to get you those big Facebook numbers is when everybody's  interacting with people they already know.  So Twitter is mostly a play to get content from people you don't know.  Google Plus is almost entirely a place to get content from strangers.  Facebook wins and WhatsApp wins and it's people you know.  And that's what scales for some reason.  So they need to make Twitter something that's great for communicating with people you already know  and not just a place to follow Danny Sullivan and the Jeff Jarvis's of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who benefits quite a bit from Twitter are the live TV shows like American Idol.  And they really use it.  As you said, every TV show has a Twitter hashtag.  And they really use it.  I wonder, it's in their interest to keep Twitter alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you think so, right?  And that's part of what I look at it.  And I think, well, there's no way you can lose Twitter because they're just so tied into this stuff  and you can't imagine it.  And then you can go back and think, but remember when all the TV shows had AOL keywords, right?  I mean, it's not the same thing, but on the one hand, it is a strength that is so used.  And you can look at some of these shows where when they're broadcasting, the cast members are on there.  And in fact, there's been a number of articles where it's just kind of required of what you need to do,  especially when you've got a generation of millennials and sub-millennials and whatever that, you know,  expect to be doing two screens side by side.  And maybe there's better things they can do.  I mean, I still haven't seen a good application where I can watch a TV show and I can have the tweets alongside, right?  You know, maybe I need a Twitter TV. I don't know.  Maybe that's my computer, right?  Anyway, what's the TV? What's the Apple TV? It's my computer anyway.  But yeah, you would think that they'd have a big stake in it.  And potentially you would think that maybe that's somebody who should buy it as well as like a media company.  But then it suddenly becomes very niche, right?  Because what do you do if a big television network buys it?  Does all the other networks don't want to use it or come up with their own?  But yeah, I think that there's stuff that can be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be one of the things that Google could do if they acquired it.  They could build it into Chrome. They could build it into Android TV.  You know, they could, you know, not that everybody has those products, but they could do that.  And that would be really compelling. I agree with you.  I think that tweeting while watching event television is one of the greatest things that Twitter can offer to the world.  Google should buy them.  They should. Absolutely should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe they will now, though. You know, I they, you know, put in the offer, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like Google would buy them, then they would slowly disappear as Google has done with so many others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Potentially or potentially to survive like YouTube.  I mean, YouTube is a great example of something that's kind of stood out there.  And Google could try to pull the same kind of nest type of thing they've done before.  So we're acquiring Twitter and we're not going to, you know, mess with what they're going to do.  But we are going to have some synergies between them and the you know, the Google Twitter deal was sort of a I can pronounce it right.  But they were approached Maunder, whatever, where, you know, Google was really burned in their view by Twitter.  And it's not clear who burned who or whatever happened in the end of it.  But Google wired the entire real time search service to Twitter's data in an unprecedented way to rely on a third party.  And I can remember going I still have a T-shirt from it or whatever, going out to the event that they did where they launched Google real time search.  And it was at the San Jose Computer Museum.  And, you know, they it's like a big huge thing.  And then to literally have that fire hose pulled, plug pulled, it they had to, you know, they had to close a product.  Google had to shut down an entire product that they had built around Twitter's information.  And, you know, there's a lot of bad blood with that.  Yeah, there's a lot of we're never going to do it again.  So the fact that they actually decided to partner again with Twitter, like, wow.  OK, you know, so maybe maybe that'll be the start of something bigger.  Maybe the whole CEO stuff will, you know, change it around and make it something more receptive to it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if this redesign of Google trends ties in because this is all about real time trends, which is, of course, in a way what Twitter is all about, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it certainly can be mined for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, they're putting data sets on GitHub, which I think is very geeky and very cool if you're a data scientist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The difficulty with trends is like who goes there?  Like if you're a journalist, you go there because you want to think, OK, this is what's hot and going with it.  But I don't think typical people go to Google Trends to see what's hot and happening in the way that they might hit the Twitter Discover tab or the way that it's integrated with Facebook.  And when you search on Google, it's not like they say here's the trendy stuff that happens in the way that say Yahoo and sometimes Bing does.  So I think Google is looking at, wow, there's great interest in trends.  People are wanting to see what's happening.  They, you know, potentially this is a we've got rich data around it, but no one knows.  Right.  And no one nobody sort of seeks it out.  So, you know, and they can tweet it or whatever and they could share it, I guess, on Google Plus.  But maybe it was something else that they could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is something because Google's full of data scientists.  This is something that they like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do it. Do a search like go on topics and search for Nest.  Right. OK. And then hit search.  And then now you can go over after searches, hit the drop down from 2004 to present.  Your second drop down.  Switch it over to past four hours.  This is the new part. Right.  You could never do this before.  Look at an hourly base.  Sorry. My hands in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want so badly to touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, go back a bit more.  Go back. Go back up and switch it back to the past day.  All right. OK.  So now you'll see this spike.  The spike in interest.  Starting around Trump, you can see sort of the same sort of thing.  You see this big huge spike that comes up with it from there and then it drops down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that, Donald.  So this is the thing.  In some ways, people really value about Twitter, right?  But to do this, you have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, to find this, you're having to go do that, right?  And yes, you could go search for or trends will surface of stuff up there.  If you remember that you should go to Google Trends as part of your daily cruise or whatever.  But what people do the most at Google every day is use Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, look, April 2011, something happened with Donald Trump's hair.  And then December 2011, November 2012, January 2015, and of course, May 2015.  He had a good run there for a while.  Yeah. And then nothing.  Nothing in June.  And then, of course, regional interest is mostly US and Alaska.  That's Donald Trump's hair.  You see the fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then now we know Donald Trump's hair care secrets.  Yes.  That's what it was all about.  Yes.  In Time magazine, the secret to Donald Trump's hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that? Oh, you found the story.  Yeah. There's a bunch of them all about it.  Geez, Louise.  Amazing, isn't it?  I love it that Google shares this kind of stuff, but you're right.  I don't know what you do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a classic Google thing, though.  They build these awesome things and then they just fail to communicate.  Nobody knows it exists.  And they just watch the show you do.  Yeah, but it's like, you know, for the general public, I mean, this is again,  you know, to contrast them with Apple, Apple will hold the world's attention  and take them through things like this.  Apple owned this.  The Apple fanboys would be using it 10 times a day.  And it's like they just they have to figure out they have all these great data scientists.  But what they really need is more marketing people or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what the interest in the Swift programming language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me give you an example of this.  Go to the Google homepage.  OK.  All right.  And what do you see on the Google homepage?  And I'm not going to go to the Google homepage, but it's a good point of the attitudes that they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't show that at all.  They can have a thing that says trending, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now go to Yahoo's homepage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I know, but go to Yahoo's homepage and look in the right corner.  Yeah.  Trending now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trending now.  Now go to Bing's homepage.  And at Bing's homepage, you see what Google potentially could do and they don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  These are the trends down here.  They've got different trending things.  Which would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're putting it there with it from that.  And so, you know, if you do that, because no one's thinking about it as different teams.  You've got a team that's doing trends.  You've got a team that's doing search and no one's thought that we should put the trending stuff into search.  And also, you know, to some degree, the team that does search is going to be very protective.  Like we don't want things on the search page unless, you know, they make a lot of sense to be there.  Right.  So just putting trending stuff up there on the search page, they might not think that they need to do it.  But potentially you could.  You know, why not if you're searching, not have a little thing saying other things that are trending?  Or ideally, if you've done a search for one thing, you might suggest related trending topics that are going on there as well.  You could do that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was this going to be the place that they would put that Google Plus?  Because they do have a trending thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's stuff that's trending on Google Plus.  Right.  Right. But yes, you could put it into Google Plus as well.  But I, you know, it's tough.  It goes back to, I think, one of Google's challenges.  It's just not having a strong sense of what goes on in terms of social.  They don't have a strong social product.  You know, they've got Google Plus and everything, and I know.  But it's not the volume and it's not to the degree that people would say turn to Facebook or Twitter.  And, you know, for whatever reason, if something trends on Twitter, people talk about it.  It's not uncommon for me to see tweets from even just, you know, ordinary users, whatever.  It was like, wow, this is trending.  Right. So people are finding that the trending stuff is happening on Twitter.  People are finding that trending stuff seems to happen on Facebook, although I don't hear people remark about it so much.  And I think Facebook has been kind of belatedly trying to do that.  So I get a sense that people have gotten used to kind of turning to Facebook, to Twitter to understand, oh, wow, what's a hot topic?  What are people talking about?  Because it's a conversational place.  What are people talking about on Twitter?  I'll hit trends.  I'll see, like, wow, this is really going on.  Facebook has tried to catch into that by having their own little trending box, even though I find Facebook to be less conversational.  There's more sharing that's going on there.  And then Google Plus, you know, it's more seems group oriented sometime.  And it's not, you know, just maybe it's just not a fit there for this.  What are people talking about or whatever?  Twitter. And then and then but then if you go to Google search, it's not what people are talking about, but what people are interested in.  That's a very powerful thing.  That's the whole point of why people are searching.  But they just, you know, the best home for it probably is in Google in Google search.  They just don't they just for whatever reason have not thought about implementing it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the thing is that, you know, completely agree with you.  I mean, Twitter feels like it's a great finger on the pulse kind of a site.  It feels like it's the global conversation happening that you're witnessing.  It's not really the case because it's dependent entirely upon who you follow and so on.  But it feels like like this is what everybody's talking about.  And the psychology of it is very different.  If you go to Facebook, I don't know if you feel this way.  But if you go to Facebook, you feel like you want to go back and see what you missed, even though you missed, you know, eighty eight percent of it or whatever that they filtered out of your newsfeed.  But on Twitter, like, you know, you go there and you just tune into what's going on right now.  You don't feel any pressure to go back and see what you missed four hours ago or whatever.  And so that, you know, and I think that's entirely the result of two factors.  One is that it's got a 140 character limitation.  So you people are forced to be concise and then you have all these short things going by.  And that's something that people can handle.  And the second thing is third party integration.  So, you know, for example, a lot of people are using these things.  I'm using Tweetbot, for example, which is a stream that I don't have to touch for it to move.  It streams by. And that's really important, I think.  And that's something that Google Plus used to have.  That's something that Facebook sort of kind of has.  But for Twitter and apps like Tweetbot, it can just sit there and you can watch the stream go by.  And that is a powerful zeitgeist kind of trend watching kind of a feel that I think Google needs to figure out how to implement somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and one thing that you see fascinating that Google did and I can't remember if they ever put it out on other people to do this.  You'll remember you have to go to things like the Web crawler spy or whatever.  And you could watch what people were searching for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that. That was right. And it was fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And people used to do it and look at it all the time.  Twitter, Google used to do that within their offices.  And then they kind of got rid of that later on.  The difficulty with something like that is, you know, there's a lot of filtering you've got to do because you can reveal sensitive stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the number one search when I saw it last at Google's offices was Yahoo.  Yeah, because people instead of going to Yahoo.com would just type Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's always like and they don't like to filter that stuff up.  But can you imagine like can you imagine if BuzzFeed ran Google and you'd have like an app that would be showing you like in real time what the top searches were happening?  You could just go there and you'd be like, oh, this is picking up here.  This topic and Google Trends almost as an app and and possibly you'd have the ability to share or comment or talk about it.  I mean, there's fun stuff you could do with it, which in turn would generate searches, which in turn is what pays for all the auto driving cars.  So, you know, I think there's stuff that they could do.  They're just and you know, to be fair, I think what they're trying to do with today's announcement is part of that and trying to better realize we've got this great data.  You know, and we know people are interested in it. So we're trying to find a better way to present it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shocking result in the European Court of Human Rights.  The case of Delphi versus Estonia. Delphi was a or I guess is but maybe soon will be was a website that aggregates news in both Estonian and in Russian.  It also operates in Latvia and Lithuania.  At the end of the news articles, as on many sites, there was a comment section.  The comment section was automatic and they weren't edited or moderated.  There was a notice of takedown system in place.  So a reader could mark a comment as insulting and it would be taken down and apparently fairly expeditiously, according to court documents.  There was a system of automatic deletion of comments that included obscene words.  A victim of defamatory comment could notify an applicant company, in which case the comment was removed immediately.  There was a terms of service or they called it a rules of comment, which said there should not be threats, insults, hostility, violence.  Nevertheless, the government of Estonia sued Delphi, saying the site had a notorious history of publishing defamatory and degrading comments.  The European court ruled that Delphi was indeed responsible for libel posted in comments on their site.  Even if the website took down the comments after complaints, it was held libel because it should have anticipated bad comments in the first place.  This is the Human Rights Court in Europe saying websites are libel for user comments.  They've agreed to actually the case was ruled on once they reheard it and the same thing happened.  Mike Masnick writing in Tech Dirt says the ruling is horrific.  The right of protection of reputation versus the right of freedom of expression and the protection of reputation wins, according to the European court.  Freedom of speech, another great challenge coming out of Europe.  I wish Jeff Jarvis were here to turn beet red and have steam coming out of his ears.  This is just another terrible decision by a European court.  I hope this doesn't extend into the United States because it's very difficult.  We don't allow comments for that reason, but I think we could be sued for a chat room for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that this is unlikely to become a big issue because even though this is potentially a precedent being set here,  in fact it contradicts other European Union directives, including their e-commerce directive,  which guarantees liability protection for intermediaries that implement notice and take down mechanisms on third party comments.  Part of the problem that's happening with this Estonia site is that there is speech on that site that qualifies as hate speech  and there are problems with the way Delphi is dealing with it.  In that case, they're trying to turn the screws on Delphi to get rid of this hate speech.  But as a policy, as a precedent, as a thing that's going to happen Europe-wide,  I don't see a world in which Facebook is going to be required to be responsible for everything everybody says on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be the end of the world. It would just be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The end of the world is nigh though because of another European directive,  which is the French Privacy Commission, which is telling Google, actually a few days ago, now they have 13 days or something like that,  to censor the global internet according to the right to be forgotten rules within Europe.  And that is the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's an end of the world depending on how they implement it.  And that's part of what I wrote up on Marketingland last week.  And we have a similar thing where we had a Canadian court in the same week say the same thing, that you have to do this global censorship.  And what is unclear is whether or not they want to have censorship applied to people physically within their boundaries or globally.  So in part, and this is what I call the myth of censorship, Google's played this little game.  And by and large, either knowingly or out of ignorance, the various governments around the world have played along with it,  which has been that the government say you have to censor these results.  And Google says, OK, we've censored them from Google France.  And everybody nods and winks as if you couldn't go to Google.com from Google France to see uncensored results.  Right. And that that had worked and that most notably had worked in China, right, where they kind of got around with it.  And then when China finally caught on with it, it kind of didn't matter because Google ended up leaving China anyway.  So but that's not working anymore.  People in the EU, you know, the regulators or whatnot have said, no, we realize you haven't censored this from Google.com.  So people can still find this stuff and it needs to go.  And what is entirely unclear and I can't get a straight answer from anybody on is whether they're saying you now need to censor worldwide for everyone in the world or worldwide for everybody within our country's boundaries.  And I think that's the latter that you're saying, look, you know, if if someone is in our country and they do a search, we want you to censor according to our laws.  It's it's you know, those are the laws and it's not impacting other countries.  And it's not difficult for people who really want to fake an IP address to get around it.  And I would hope that that's the compromise that we get to that that that the governments are reasonable about this and say, look,  we said you had to remove this material for our citizens.  You've made sure that, you know, reasonable steps have been taken so that our citizens can't get to this material.  We're done. If it's we're going to insist that you remove this stuff from your search engine worldwide.  That is a very scary situation because while say the Europeans that are pushing for the right to be forgotten, I think that that's all in good.  And that's the way it would happen. I guarantee some of the same people pushing for that would freak out if they Googled in said, oh, by the way,  we now have to censor all this stuff about Tiananmen Square because even for people in France, because we've got to follow Chinese law worldwide because they want to do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all pictures of women's hair have to be covered and banned because Saudi Arabia doesn't like it and et cetera, et cetera.  There's no end to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm hoping that the the IP based type of censorship is what we end up with, that that that's what happens.  I'm sort of a gap that Google has not been clear on all this sort of stuff, but themselves by not not explaining what's going on or outlined the issues.  But I assume that there's more negotiations going on and we'll see how it plays out.  But that's what we'll need to have happen.  And by the way, the flip side, and this is what my article got into was Google has been censoring worldwide on US law for some time.  If you file a DMCA complaint and you get something taken out, that's taken out worldwide, that's taken out for the US.  So, you know, Google might also have a weird situation where they then have to only filter Google dot com DMCA for stuff that's within the US.  You know, it gets more complicated than that.  And that might be part of the other reason why they don't want to kind of get into this all granularity.  But, you know, they're probably going to have to do something.  I mean, I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's likely to happen is that Google will roll out censorship as a service.  So they'll go to every single country and say, OK, what's the menu of things that have to be censored?  We'll censor it globally for your citizens based on IP.  And it's going to be a very complicated Internet.  The illusion that search engine results actively and accurately reflect what's actually on the Internet is going to become increasingly false.  And it's going to be basically a hodgepodge of censorship and legal take down notices and all that kind of stuff based on IP and where you are will determine what you can see no matter where you are.  And that's that's going to suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this just in from the explosive doctor, Mom AT&T just got hit by the FCC with the largest fine in the history of the FCC.  One hundred million dollars. Why?  Because they said your data was unlimited.  Those liars. Those liars.  The FCC said that the company improperly slowed down Internet speed for customers who signed up for unlimited data plans.  AT&T throttled their speeds when they exceeded a certain amount of data.  The fine is the largest ever levied by the agency.  AT&T implemented the practice in 2011.  They say they will fight this.  Tom Wheeler continues his transition from dingo to hero.  He's playing it. Wow.  He said consumers get what they deserve to get what they pay for.  Broadband providers must be upfront and transparent about the services they provide.  The FCC will not stand by idly while customers are deceived by misleading marketing materials and insufficient disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he said that's our whole business model.  What are you talking about?  That's what that's what the whole like that's what your plan is when you go to sign up for a new smartphone plan.  It's the whole thing is all about you not knowing what is really going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This probably won't help AT&T's attempted acquisition of direct TV.  I hope it hits other people too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was yelling at T-Mobile about the same thing when they talked about all their unlimited data and you had to go into the footprints to find it.  I just I don't get how you say unlimited data that's limited.  Right.  I mean, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To play devil's advocate, it's not that they're limiting the data.  It's just that they're slowing it down.  They're limited to speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still have unlimited data.  It's a limit.  It's like saying we're not limiting the we're not limiting the speeds on the freeway.  We're just slowing them down.  I mean, it's like it's a limit.  A limit means that you're putting some kind of restriction on data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought unlimited meant there's no limit to how much data you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's that.  Well, that's how you might interpret it to me.  If you say I get unlimited data, it means that there are no limits you're placing on the data.  And if one of the limits you place on the data is how much how quickly I can stream the data,  then I view that as a limit.  But I like a T-Mobile site right now.  And it's interesting because I look at it now and I think they're being much more forthright than they had in the past,  where they still say unlimited data, but up to one gigabyte LG.  It used to be you kind of had to dig that stuff out and it was kind of buried with it.  But I still think this is really significant because like remember you get unlimited data and T-Mobile when you go abroad.  Right.  Remember? That's pretty cool.  It's very slow.  Well, yeah, but they didn't tell you that.  Well, they said, uh, Edger.  You want to know that you got to dig through and try to figure out, well, just how fast is it?  What is it that I'm at?  So on the one hand, I think it's great that they have it.  But on the other hand, when I dig through and discover that it's 128K, it's like, oh, well, maybe that's not going to do what I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard, by the way, that it's faster.  Well, they probably are going to guess that.  I will test that in two weeks.  Yes.  We're sending all T-Mobile phones to Europe.  We shall.  I shall.  I shall report back.  Razer bought Ouya.  Hey, I recognize a company with a weird name.  I want to buy you.  Razer, of course, makes the boom slang, the best named mouse in the world.  It also makes gaming keyboards.  Ouya was a Kickstarter.  I think it was Kickstarter.  Was it Indiegogo?  I don't know.  Crowdfunded project to create a Android-based gaming TV thing.  And while we didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread is kind of slow, you could put Plex on it.  And that made it pretty darn cool.  Razer, of course, is a gaming company.  Makes sense.  They could sell the Ouya as an accessory.  Although I have to say, I have the Nvidia Shield, which does 4K video, is a powerful Tegra processor, I think K1.  And it plays games great on my big screen TV.  Crossy roads on my big screen TV is a great deal.  Yeah.  Razer actually had its own Android console.  I didn't realize this, the Forge, which also, like the Ouya, got terrible reviews.  But like the Ouya, $99.  Ouya was on Kickstarter, by the way.  Kickstarter wasn't.  Okay.  By the way, Snapchat now.  If you go on McDonald's, you'll get a new sticker capability.  You could Snapchat burger and fries.  I didn't even know they were doing this.  Do you still use Snapchat?  Remember that we all played with it for a while and then it was like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't use McDonald's.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't see you into McDonald's.  You should go in just to do it.  I do deserve a break today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't buy or eat anything.  Just Snapchat it and run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just Snapchat, here I am, and then run as fast as you can.  Snapchat thing is cool.  It's where the creepy clown comes out.  It is kind of cool.  Is there a creepy clown?  That'd be good if Ronald McDonald were in the hamburger sticker.  I'd like that.  Or the Hamburglar.  Are you a Snapchatter, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I love Snapchat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you use it?  What do you use it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I use the My Story feature.  I take a Snap, I share it out, and anybody can follow it.  It bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You put all this work into this and then it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope.  You can download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a lot.  Well, still, it's a lot like Meerkat or Periscope because it's a lot of work.  And yes, you can download it, but really, at the end of the day, not very many people's  going to see it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, well, no.  It doesn't scale.  Very easily.  Why don't you use Storify or search me Storhuis?  I'm trying to find one of my examples.  When I went to Paris, I was walking around and I was just taking a little ... Is that  the one?  No, that's not it.  I'm trying to find my download of it.  Give me a second.  I'll find it.  This is really entertaining as I try to look for the Snapchat thing.  I was walking through and I was just taking pictures of stuff and sharing what I was seeing.  You could do a little bit of video with it from there.  It's hard to know how many people, but you have because they're not really suited for  that.  But I'll have like 200 views of anything I'm doing and I'm like nobody on Snapchat.  Right?  I actually think that's pretty good engagement.  It's fun.  Yeah.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like there's other choices that are more ...  I like teaching people.  ... that last longer.  Of course, people like Snapchat because it doesn't.  You got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to do it.  Here we go.  Here's my Paris thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.  Then it was just like everything I was seeing.  Here's my story.  Yeah.  It's just like little three second clips of what you got.  This is what I was doing throughout the day.  Those are the love locks that were still surviving somewhere.  You saved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're taking them down.  They're all gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you'll see because I went onto the bridge and then you see the little ... It's just  as I'm walking around, you're taking little annotations.  If you want to see somebody who does it really well, it's Josh Constine from ...  TechCrunch.  Oh my God.  His are awesome.  His are awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should hire him.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking for something that I can take on my trip that will let me kind of tell the  story of my trip in a way that I can ...  Google Glass.  ... like an album.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason, can I borrow the glass?  Oh yeah, of course you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Google Photos will do that for you automatically.  Automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, I'll have it from Photos.  And you can trade it.  And I'm thinking Microsoft Sway.  That's kind of cool.  That lets you do like presentations.  Storehouse.  It's iPhone only.  I don't know if I'm going to take an iPhone with you.  But yeah, I guess if I just take the pictures and the video, then Google will automatically  assemble them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can also do the thing.  I just did ... updated it yesterday.  I want to see if I have another one here.  It was for the ... We did for Matt Cutts.  You can do the ... just pick all your photos and throw them together and make a very quick  one minute thing with music and everything.  I like that.  Animoto will do that.  Yeah, it was very, very easy.  Oh, here it is.  Google does that, huh?  Okay, ready?  Photos does that.  Photos does that.  You remember Matt Cutts, right?  Yeah, I've heard of him.  Yeah.  So he was ... because we did our conference two weeks ago, and it was the one that he  normally would speak at, but of course now he's all kind of retired.  So he sent you something?  Well, no.  I just ... I looked for all the pictures I found of Matt that I'd had, and I put them  all into Google, photos, and then it just made a little thing like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we all have big photo caches of Matt Cutts.  We should put those together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep meaning to create a story about Matt Cutts in Google Photos with all the photos  I have.  But that's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like I grabbed 30 photos, I tossed them in there.  You could rearrange them.  You pick your theme.  It does all the fades.  It has some standard music that now I'm sick of hearing because I had to hear it so much  as I was doing it.  And you were done.  Slide show over.  And then you download it to your camera roll, and now you have it.  The only thing I didn't like was you couldn't go back in and then add in another photo or  make more edits.  Like if you didn't pick all the right photos from the beginning, you had to start over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's what Google Stories does on Google Plus and now Google Photos.  Right.  Do you ever use that?  Do you ever have one pop up and say, hey, this is pretty good, and then go in and tweak  it and all that kind of stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do sometimes, but usually I can't.  I'm not that bothered.  Yeah.  But usually I'm just kind of flipping through it.  And I've had that weird thing like was covered before.  Remember that?  I can't remember who wrote about it at The Verge, but they had pictures of his kids and  then pictures of his like, I think his grandfather's funeral.  It got mixed together.  And I've had weird things like that where Google's mixed different things together.  But then sometimes it does a good job.  And then if I get back, I always look.  As long as you can fix it, it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can fix it.  You can swap them out.  Yeah.  But the thing is that it's yet again another frustrating Google product.  It's so awesome.  It does everything you want it to.  It does everything we've been saying.  It'll put in auto awesomes.  It'll put in videos.  It'll put in pictures.  It lets you put in captions.  You can swap things out, swap things in.  Nobody uses it.  Nobody.  I mean, I almost never see people sharing stories on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that?  Well, that's, but I think that's part of the challenge.  Like I love what Google's doing with Google Photos, you know, and this is what I said  to them.  They had their, they did their press conference afterwards, but it's still overwhelming.  And sometimes I get, you know, like my family has all these pictures of me when we're on  vacation of me doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the other problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to, you want something that's really easy to do.  I guess that's why Google is the best way to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Part of the reason I tend to want to share the photos when I share them is it's almost  like if I don't curate them right then and there.  Yeah.  They never get created.  No, it's kind of nice, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the crazy things about Google Photos is that it's been chunking away at all of  mine.  I know.  I literally have 80,000 photos.  So I'm just getting like, I just got a story a couple of days ago from my trip to Olympia  Greece in 2012.  And it's like, wow, look at this.  You know, but it's like, it's still, it's still working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still getting animations from when I didn't have any hair.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm still waiting.  I've got like 10 years and 300 gigabytes of photos, but they're all in Google Drive.  Google got back to me finally yesterday telling me, sorry, when they launched Google Photos,  they said, and it totally works now for people with Google Apps accounts.  Totally works with Google Apps accounts.  And I was like, okay, I'm on Google Apps account right now and all my stuff on Google Drive  is not talking the way that you said.  And they're like, what?  It's just rolling out.  And like they finally came back to me and said, yeah, it doesn't work.  So I guess they're still working on it.  It'll be nice if it finally comes to Google Apps.  But I have noticed that what they seem to have accelerated is it's almost like they  really are going back in time, making even more animations and stuff just to get you  all excited that they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, if you go to the assistant, you'll, you'll, you'll find the animations as you  go back and I like that.  I think that's good.  You know, now I'm settled.  You're right.  All I have to do is just take pictures of my phone.  And they'll line up on photos.  In fact, my camera that I'm going to be using, the Sony a7s, I tap to the NFC to the back  of the phone and it copies all the pictures over to the phone, which would then upload  to Google Photos at 128 bytes per second.  Well, but it'll do it over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the thing is you can post it now with Google Photos to Facebook or Twitter or Google  Plus or all the above.  And by the way, while we're sitting here, I just posted the one to Olympic Greece.  I just posted it already.  It's so easy.  But you're right.  No one ever posts them.  And so but anyway, it's I think it's a great feature and probably the way to go.  Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you solved it.  You saw my conundrum.  I've been puzzling about this.  I can't wait to see them.  Yeah.  Google solved my goodness.  But do Snapchat too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Do Snapchat.  No.  It's fun.  You need to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're like always cutting edge.  You got to be Snapchatting.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's so old now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like the geezer at my 18 year old niece's birthday party or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not old.  Apparently, Meerkat will now not only stream live, but save it out to YouTube live.  We'll stream to YouTube, which is cool.  I was doing that with my little Reeve from HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is good because I didn't.  Oh, not Meerkat.  It was Periscope.  It surprised me that I knew that they would save your video.  I didn't realize they didn't save it forever.  Right.  Oh, wow.  24 hours.  I was like, what?  You deleted it?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was happy about that.  All right.  You convinced me.  Now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense to use photos.  Yeah.  It's free and it does it and it does all that.  I've been uploading every digital picture I've ever taken back to 2001.  It's been uploading slowly to Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There may be controversy about whether it's the best thing or the easiest way to ship  it.  I believe that for formatting, compiling and posting pictures, it's way faster than anything  else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's the last.  It does it without you doing anything.  Yeah.  Which I kind of like.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We come back.  Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land.  Always good to see you.  Danny at Danny Sullivan on Twitter.  Mike Elgin from TNT.  Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific on Twitter.  We're going to get your picks of the week.  The first fresh books is my pick for the easiest way to get those invoices sent out.  It's one of the most annoying things there is about being self-employed or having a small  business is invoicing, getting the money from your clients.  And of course, it's kind of like the most important thing you do, too.  But just firing the whole idea of firing up Word or Excel and creating the spread, the  and then if they don't pay you, calling them.  It just was painful.  So much so that I often would just put it off for months.  Fresh books solved that problem.  They bill in multi-currencies.  I was billing Canada.  It made it a lot easier.  You can easily get your expenses into fresh books.  Just take pictures of the receipts.  And if you bill for time and hours, easy time and expenses all done by the app.  You can actually press a timer and then it'll go right into the invoice.  Plus, the best thing about fresh books, you get paid faster.  Turns out clients like these email invoices.  They like the pay button because they want to pay it.  It's just a pain for them.  Just like it's a pain for you.  Make it easy for them.  You get paid on average five days faster.  And if you get a slow pay client, they'll automatically send out reminders.  You don't have to worry about those awkward phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what's great about this?  I use this all the time.  Do you?  I do.  All the time.  It's really fantastic because you use from the cloud-based service.  You go in there, it creates the invoice number.  It does everything.  It knows the address.  It knows everything.  You just plug in the minimal details and off it goes.  And then when the person replies to your email, it doesn't go back to the service.  It comes into your inbox like a regular email.  So for example, I get a reassuring message saying, hey, got it.  Thanks a lot.  And again, just part of the usual flow.  So anybody who invoices and doesn't use it is basically nuts.  So much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the deal.  Go to freshbooks.com slash twig, freshbooks.com slash twig, and you can get it free for 30  days, no obligation.  But do me a favor when there's a place in the form when you fill it out.  How did you hear about us?  TWIG.  Just put twig in there and that way they'll know.  We'll get credit and you'll get, well, you'll be happy.  Freshbooks free for 30 days.  You get paid.  So thank you for your support.  Freshbooks.  Everybody use it, please.  So this is a 2001 picture of me and Patrick Norton on this set of the old show.  And it even did an animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Auto Awesome, they used to call them Auto Awesomes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's incredible.  That's 14, 15 years ago now.  Almost 14 years ago.  I love that.  Thank you, Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike, you got a pick for us?  I do.  I do.  It's a service that went live today called Earthcast.  Earthcast is spelled U-R-T-H-E-C-A-S-T.  And what this is is a site that will show you 4K photos taken from the space station.  Turned straight down at planet Earth.  And I'm sorry, I said photos.  The thing that this is, they are videos.  They're 4K videos.  And they are beautiful.  So we've all seen Google Maps and Google Earth and all that kind of stuff.  Well, these are actual videos.  You can see cars driving down the freeway.  You can see lots of stuff.  What?  It's not live.  You can see cars moving?  Yes.  You can see movement and so on.  And they are going to be posting all this stuff.  And they're going to...  Is this just random places?  They are straight down from the ISS and across a swath of the Earth that they go across.  But it's super high res.  And they're going to have an API.  They're going to do all this kind of really cool stuff.  But this went live today.  And it's basically 400 kilometers high.  It's going 25,000 kilometers an hour.  And so they do all kinds of computational stuff to make sure that the video is really  high quality.  But it's just breathtaking, as you can see from this.  It's just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that.  So now you don't have to wear astronaut diapers to get the great view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might if you just sit there and stare all day.  It is really exciting.  These are gorgeous.  Yeah.  This is just from the website.  I'm just like, I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm just looking at the URTHE.  C-A-S-T.  C-A-S-T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Earthcast with a U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why they spell it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Earthcast with an E was probably taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Earthcast with a U.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  So this is it must be a promotional video then.  This doesn't go on forever.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you go to the website, earthcast.com, you can see all kinds of promotional videos  and different things.  The gallery, they talk about their APIs that they're going to be doing.  They have all kinds of images that they've posted.  And it's going to be a service as well.  So if you have a business, if you, for example, are a food conglomerate and you'd like to  monitor crop conditions or any kind of sort of industrial use like that, you can do that  as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a commercial enterprise here.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gives you a funny feeling inside to see video like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is something they just mounted on the ISS?  Yeah, two cameras.  They got permission to mount?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, two cameras.  They're a little, they're cameras called ISIS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And do they pay the ISS for it?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't know, but I imagine there's some kind of deal.  It's a profit deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is baston.  Here's the live feed right now because.  Oh, there's a live feed.  It's on the right side of the earth.  It's dark.  It's on the night side of the earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just leave that.  We can watch sunrise.  Or is it sunset?  Sunrise, sunset.  Wait 15 minutes and you'll know the other one.  That's a sunset, I guess.  That was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was very good.  Jason, where did you get the live feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just up a top left hand corner.  It says live.  Oh, I love that.  On the main site.  All right.  Holy Magoli.  That was perfect timing.  Yeah, we got to see sunset.  We almost missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And with that, we close today's.  I think that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't get any better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the best pick in the pick of the year.  And you can dial it down from 720p.  The live one is 720p, 360p and 160p.  You can go full screen on that.  So this is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's cars moving in Boston, Massachusetts.  You can actually.  So it is live.  These are vehicles driving down Route 95 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could use this as, pardon the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or a new screensaver.  There's Fenway Park.  If there were a game going on, we could watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm really enjoying the earth at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's dark.  That's the live one.  It's dark.  It's a well, you can see a little corona there.  Not for long.  But you know, it's cool.  You're going to see the sunrise and in another 40 minutes, you'll see the sunset again.  What a world.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you want to follow that, Matt.  I mean, Danny, do you want to follow that or do you want to just go home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I'm good.  Good.  What's your pick?  Sunset.  My picks are all depressing.  That's what I mean.  I'm trying to find a fun pick.  That's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll just keep this feed going while you're talking about whatever you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more depressing than darkness.  If you want, since it's a Google thing.  Amy, on our staff, did a really good post today looking at Google.  You know, it does a lot of direct answers.  Now you can search for stuff and it tries to put an answer right up there at the top  of the page.  And as they've expanded this, it tends to be making more mistakes, either as picking  up answers for things where there's debates or it can get wrong answers or it can get  not safe for work answers.  So you know, I'd suggest taking a look at her when Google gets a wrong article, because  it looks at some of the challenges that they face when they're trying to pick one answer  as opposed to the usual, we're going to give you the 10 blue links.  You still get the 10 blue links that they've had out there before.  But you know, it's like, like if you do a search, one of the searches is like, does  God love everyone?  And it comes back with an answer.  God only loves Christians.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it can only do what's on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, or I think this is still working.  If you, this is my favorite.  Let me see if it still works.  If you search for King of the United States, please still work.  Please still work.  Please still work.  Yeah, there we go.  So if you search for King of the United States, it comes up as Barack Obama.  And you'll see it's really dramatic.  It's like this big, huge box, right?  That's the King of the United States.  And what happened was Breitbart wrote this article saying, all hail Barack Obama, Emperor  of the United States.  And so Google started listing that up.  So a few months ago, we wrote about how that direct answer was showing up and that turned  us into the source.  I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's wrong.  And yet no one at Google's there reviewing this sort of stuff.  And so as they've increased the number of direct answers that they provide, it's becoming  easier and easier to find these kinds of really weird glitches.  You have another one if you can type like, what is 411?  You'll either get an answer from AT&T.  Oh, it looks like they killed that one.  Yeah, it was coming up.  Maybe if you do it as like, what's 411?  It's not working there.  The other thing, I don't know if you want to bring that up on screen.  We came across this young dude was like a hiccup cure.  I'm warning you folks.  Oh no, that one didn't go there too.  So maybe they're fixing it.  They're fixing stuff.  That's what it is.  Stop hiccups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop hiccups.  Is this not safe for work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you should look away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look away.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, that one we talked about before.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  By the way, that does work.  I tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be actually correct, but when you consider that this is a...  It's not what you Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a long standing problem, although I'm surprised it's not getting better.  It's getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting worse because people are going for the single answer.  Because they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're Google bombing it.  It's not because people are specifically going at it.  There are people who are becoming savvier to the fact that you can optimize to become  an answer.  Yes.  But it's because Google...  The people at Moz have a service where they try to track how often certain features appear  in Google search results.  So about seven, eight months ago, you would get a direct answer maybe for 5% of the queries  that you would search that they would check on Google.  That's up to almost 30% now.  So the reason it's getting worse because they're becoming more aggressive in where they're  trying to find answers.  But they're not coupling that with any kind of fact checking thing.  By the way, this is maybe a better thing too, but type in...  Let's see if this works.  Leo Laporte.  Let's see how famous you are.  Laporte quotes.  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good quote.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh God.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, but let's try something else.  I'm not that famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank God.  Make the famous person like...  You can do Barack Obama quotes.  And is that working?  So they've got a new thing now where we use...  That's nice.  ...people.  You get quotes that they've said.  And it is very nice.  The only downside to this is they don't source any of the quotes.  Because hey, facts is facts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, but not really, are they?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not really, because sometimes like, for example, if you searched for PT Barnum, Barnum quotes,  you'll see that he says, there's a sucker born every minute.  Right.  Right.  And one of his competitors apparently said it about PT Barnum.  It was spurious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But everybody says that he says it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because there's no source and there's no context, you don't understand that.  And that might have been useful to get.  Or another one was like, if you type in Eric Schmidt quotes, you'll see the third thing  is hey, you got something you don't want anybody to know.  Maybe you shouldn't be doing it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he said that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just said it.  But when did he say it?  Why did he say it?  He said it too.  You don't get any of that context, which is what you would have gotten if they actually  sourced some of this stuff.  So it's new, but some sourcing might be nice too.  But it's still kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll do that.  Yeah.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now back to the sunset.  Yeah.  Or sunrise soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sunrise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good news just came in from ScooterX in our chat room.  The Motorola 360 is being updated now to 5.0.  Beginning to roll out.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do I get with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get lots of stuff.  I've been using 5.1 on my Urbane.  This is the one that adds Wi-Fi.  It's amazing.  Who knew?  I thought I had that already on the Moto.  Well, the hardware was there, but now you can connect your watch to Wi-Fi, which means  you can get data from your phone over your Wi-Fi network.  Leave your phone at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  That'd be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You also get the scroll where you twist the wrist scroll, which is only good for strap  hangers or somebody who's...  I find it very useful in the segue because I need to keep one hand on the...  So I can go like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as it's not on your throttle hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  You can now draw...  Oh, you can get to send a smile thing.  Yeah.  You can draw emojis.  You'll really...  The UI actually is much better because, in fact, can you do...  I don't know if you can see my...  Yeah, you can kind of see it.  So now I can slide over to applications.  You don't need a separate application launcher and slide again to contacts.  Not that you can make a phone call, but it's good for texting and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Those are my favorites.  So that is much improved, I think.  A lot of the other stuff is pretty much the same, although I think watch faces can do  more as well.  Oh, and I know the always on is great.  So let me show you...  That'll be handy.  Yeah.  I don't...  I need Google Keep on here for this to work because I think that's one of the few always  on things.  And I'm using Evernote instead of Keep as my...  Oh, there it is.  Let's launch Keep.  Let's see.  This is nice because I use Keep for my shopping list, right?  Your house crap, apparently.  My house crap and my shopping.  So there's my shopping list, right?  But now when the watch goes to sleep, instead of going dark, it has an ambient mode for  even apps.  So the ambient mode for Keep will continue to show my list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can shop without ever getting off of your segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's exactly what you want.  So this is, I think, a much wanted, much anticipated update.  It's been out for the LG watches.  LG updated all their watches, but we've been waiting on the Moto 360.  I still think the Moto 360 is probably the best looking Android Wear watch.  So if you've got one of those, get your update.  Get your update.  It's rolling.  There's nothing you can do, right?  No, there's not much you can do about that.  You can get a photo of that.  It'll just happen.  But just make sure you have the latest Android Wear on your phone and cross your fingers.  We'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll get it in the next week.  Also, one of those...  My next week's episode of This Week in Google, you'll have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mentioned the Android TV made by Nvidia, the Shield.  I haven't done a Before You Buy review.  That's still to come.  So it's $200.  I like it.  Unfortunately, Android TV is missing some capabilities.  There's no Amazon on there yet.  I don't know why not.  There really needs to be.  There is Netflix.  And if you use the Google apps, like Google Music, it's great with Google Music.  It turns Google...  You know, your home theater will now do Google Music.  If you use Netflix, if you have a 4K TV for 4K video, it will support that 7.1 surround  sound.  They just pushed out an update that means images, pictures are also 4K, which is great.  And that X...  It's not a K1.  I misspoke.  It's an X1 processor, which is an incredibly fast ARM processor.  And you can't play games on it.  controller.  But you may also want to order the remote.  Do not get the 500 gigabyte version for 300 bucks because that's a lot for that storage.  You can hook up...  It has a USB port.  You can hook up any USB drive.  So a 3 terabyte drive for 100 bucks is a much better deal than 100 bucks for 500 gigabytes.  And you can also put a micro SD.  And that's what I did.  I put a 128 gig micro SD in there.  And by the way, unlike smart Android smartphones, it will automatically copy the apps to the  SD.  So you got lots of room for games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is Nvidia's version of Android TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Android TV.  And I think it's probably the best one out there just because it's easily the most powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As opposed to...  Because I think I've got the Google Android TV that they sold directly, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That little puck.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So this is just a more powerful version of this?  Much more powerful.  Also more expensive.  200 bucks is a lot compared to a Roku for under 100 dollars.  Apple TV for 69 bucks.  You get a controller with it for 200?  You do get the controller.  Okay.  And the controller has a microphone in it.  And you can talk to it much like Fire TV.  So that's pretty good.  It's nice looking.  It's actually smaller than it looks.  That makes it look kind of imposing.  It's really just a little skinny little box.  But I think they've done a nice job.  This is...  It's game focused.  You know.  And if they add...  I think if they added Amazon, it has Hulu, it has Netflix.  If they added Amazon, I think it would be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We went skiing back in February for the break and I took the Android TV with me.  And it was nice because, you know, it was like less than trying to take an Xbox and  we had little games we could play or whatever.  But it was sluggish in some cases.  Yeah, this is not.

Transcript:  Yeah.  You will never say this is sluggish.  It has 802.11ac MIMO, 2 and 5 GHz, fast processor, 3 gigs of RAM.  And what was there?  There was something else I wanted to mention.  Oh, you can use Nvidia's Game Stream, which means you can play hardcore games streaming  from Nvidia's...  I haven't done that yet, but I'll have to give it a try.  It's Android 5.1.  I am actually...  I like it a lot.  It's pretty good.  They just pushed out an update.  So I think I'd probably recommend it except for the price, which is...  You know, 200 bucks is a little steep for something that basically adds internet to  your television.  And it's not...  I mean, you know, Android gaming isn't the state of the art gaming that you expect with  Xbox One.  It's a lot cheaper than Xbox One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is Nvidia, so you get some of the games that a lot of other Android folks wish they  had access to because Nvidia kind of has some...  It's also a Chromecast.  Yeah, original.

Transcript:  I almost forgot to mention.  And it doesn't need to be configured.  It just shows up.  I decided to hardwire it to put an ethernet cable in there.  So I'm getting great performance.  It's a great choice around that kind of stuff.  It's great Chromecast device.  You know, in a way, everything...  So many things Chromecast now.  I mean, I can Showtime Chromecast, Showtime, so many of the apps on my phone.  I don't mind so much that those apps aren't on...  It's got HBO Now, but not HBO Go, but that's okay because HBO Go Chromecasts.  Amazon does not yet Chromecast.  I think Amazon and Google are going to be kind of like that, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is...  I mean, I kind of wish Amazon would just embrace...  Give up.  Well, not give up, but just embrace Android.  If Microsoft...  Not try to run their own thing, but just jump in on it.  But then again, if you're Amazon, you're watching Google decide they want to be your shopping  thing, you're a little wary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  All right, my friends, we're wrapping it up.  Thank you so much, Mr. Danny Sullivan, searchengineland.com, marketingland.com.  You're welcome.  Thanks for having me.

Transcript:  www.twit.tv slash TNT.

Transcript:  That still works.  That still works.  So many things don't, but that still works.  Oh, man.  We're working as hard as we can.  We love the new...  I hope you like the new website.  I'm very happy with it, the design and so forth.  But we understand there are some issues, particularly, I think the biggest issue for people right  now is that when you want to download a single episode, there's an issue with these download  buttons.  We're working on that.  We understand it's kind of a thorny issue because it has to do with how browsers respond  to certain mime types.  Internet Explorer actually does it right.  Yeah.  But it's the only one that...  I didn't see that coming.  It's the only one that does.  But we're going to fix that.  That's a number one priority for us.  But in other respects, I think it's just...  I hope you like it.  I'm very pleased and I want to thank our developers at 4Kitchen for doing a great job.  If you go to the site, www.twit.tv, browse around, click the Learn More button where  it says, Welcome to the new website.  It hears my long article about what's going on with this site, why the site is the way  it is, what we did, why so much of the site is invisible.  There's a lot more to this because we have a full API, which we're making public through  our developer program.  And we want to encourage anybody who wants to build anything from a short little snippet  that downloads the programs that you want to a full website to do it.  The API is fully documented.  It's very rich.  You can get just about any kind of information you want about any of our shows from the API.  So if you're a programmer, especially if you're a programmer and saying, I could do that site  better, do.  Maybe I'll buy it from you.  Twit.tv, the new twit.tv.  Thank you everybody.  Hey, we're out of time, but thank you so much for joining us.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday, about 1 to 1.30 PM Pacific, 4.30 Eastern  Time, 23.30 UTC, live.twit.tv.  I think that'll now go to twit.tv slash live.  That's probably the best place to watch if you want to watch live.  We also put it up on all of the podcast places.  They all have us.  So if you want to watch, subscribe and you'll get it every week.  Thanks for joining us and I'll see you next time on Twit.
