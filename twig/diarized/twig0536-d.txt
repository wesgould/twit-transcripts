Transcript:  Yes, because it's shadow, ombre.  Ombre?  But I think it's pronounced ombre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay remember, I learned everything by reading, so I don't know how to pronounce anything.

Transcript:  Ant is taking the day off.  He has some barbecue duties because of tomorrow.  Because he's Ant.  He's Ant.  He'd be smoking.  I would bet.  I don't know.  I didn't find out, but I would bet.  I would bet there is a smoked turkey involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to ask him if he makes oyster cornbread stuffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the traditional southern stuffing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, not just cornbread oysters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I put sausage in my cornbread stuffing and I can't do these.  That's fair.  Yeah, that's as good as oysters.  Better.  Stacy, are you doing the military maneuvers that you've done in years gone by for things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like Thanksgiving?  This year, I have yet to put together my color-coded Gantt chart, but it's going to do a slightly  more relaxed version.  But I am creating my list.  I've got there's a lot going on.  It's a new kitchen, you guys.  Oh, that's right.  There's one less oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to ask, do you have enough oven space?  Oh, no.  But you have the June.  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the June and I have a normal oven.  I have an Instapot.  I have a Crockpot.  One of my casseroles is already done.  The kale is already prepped for the salad.  Well, if you have the kale.  I mean, Thanksgiving is fine.  I already pre-made my gravy.  It's thawing.  The turkey's brining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be okay.  Are you doing Brussels sprouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am.  Maple glazed bacon Brussels sprouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, maple glazed bacon Brussels sprouts.  Be still my heart.  Actually, you know, I have a great recipe.  You get the maple and the bacon and the Brussels sprouts, then you throw out the Brussels sprouts  and it is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have at the bottom of the rundown, we have thanks to Google, which we have regularly,  the most popular side dishes by state.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you, Google, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brussels sprouts from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What state is Brussels sprouts popular in?  That's a lie.  Really?  I love them.  But you know, that's not a common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom used to call them Christmas tree balls and I loved them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Christmas tree balls.  Yes.  She lied.  Basically, I call broccoli trees.  Oh, well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you looking?  All right.  We might as well do this list.  We've started.  Yeah, sure.  Let's dig down.  We're going to start from the bottom up.  We've never done that before.  Actually, this was one of your numbers, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay.  I put multiples there so I can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Google does this every year, right?  Brussels sprouts.  Is that New Hampshire or Vermont?  It's New Hampshire.  Vermont's vegetables.  Vegetables is not a dish.  Main potatoes.  Whatever's in the garden.  Massachusetts, it's butternut squash.  In Rhode Island, it's cranberry sauce because that's where it's grown in the bogs.  Connecticut is stuffing, cornbread stuffing in New York.  Pennsylvania stuffing in Delaware, sweet potatoes.  Mac and cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why can't I get invited for this?  Where's Mac and cheese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, is that Virginia?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's Delaware.  That's Delaware.  Delaware and California.  Mac and cheese.  That's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Green bean casserole in Nevada.  Creamy mashed potatoes in Arizona.  Same thing in the mashed potatoes in LA.  I like mashed potatoes.  I think mashed potatoes are delicious.  Look what Texas got.  This fits fruit salad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it true?  Is that what you really?  I've never had a fruit salad at Thanksgiving, but sure.  They do this based on weird stuff people search for.  That's what people are searching for.  There's a weird community somewhere in Texas where fruit salad is the thing and it's throwing  everybody else off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In order to, of course, Google's data-driven.  If you look at colors, reds, casseroles, that means those are the states that think casseroles  are a mighty good thing.  Green is veggies.  Blue is stuffing.  Yellow is dressing.  What's the difference?  Yeah, what is the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a regional thing.  Oh, they call it dressing.  Oh, so what's their searching for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think, I mean, I always understood stuffings in the turkey, dressings outside, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People say that, but my family in Mississippi, when you go there, everything is dressing,  even if it's a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love it.  It says food and wine.  It says food and wine.  This is going to my point about my mother for.  Stuffing is a mixture used to stuff another food, traditionally pulled before cooking,  whereas dressing is cooked in a pan outside the turkey.  That's what I just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is exactly what he just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I just want to point out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was looking it up while he said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is something weird with North Dakota.  Something weird going on with North Dakota.  Apparently, keto soup is the most searched Thanksgiving side dish in North Dakota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Low carb vegetable soup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course, in Michigan, it's sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  That's obvious.  All right, anyway, we've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then we could go.  Then we can go to the worst side dishes.  All right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, should we just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Before we do.  Start calling your numbers?  That's okay.  These two go together.  This is from Fox News.  Weird Thanksgiving side dishes go viral and horrifying Twitter thread.  Maya Kosoff started it.  I cannot wait to hear about the recipes you're all excited to make for Thanksgiving.  I'm also here to hear about the weird inexplicable retro family recipes that ended up on your  Thanksgiving table for tradition, tradition or nostalgia or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That looks like the one.  Go ahead and see what it is for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Her first one was sea foam salad.  She thought it was a normal thing every family made for Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very alike what I had growing up.  I hated it.  It was it was green jello and cottage cheese.  There you go.  Yes.  I couldn't agree more, Stacey.  Awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about there's a pear salad that inexplicably has cheese on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that cheese?  I thought it was like grated carrot shredded cheddar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the white cream cheese whipped with a for those of you with hearing a maraschino  cherry on top.  So honestly, Americans are so often Americans just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pears in the right kind of cheese.  Delicious.  Well, yeah, but this is not that Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pears and yellow cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little different.  You never know, though.  I mean, people eat weird stuff and they like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do love the a lot of people put their old recipe cards on Twitter.  And it's fun to see these old beat up cards.  I have a set of those, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'll show you my recipe book.  Oh, by the way, free gift idea for anybody who's interested in it.  Buy a nice book with a durable cover and spiral bound as best and do your family recipes.  Write them out by hand with little notes in them and give them to your son, your daughter,  somebody who.  So I have one of my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I actually do something similar.  I share the paprika file.  Because I use an app.  You know, nowadays, printing it out is kind of old school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, yeah, I know.  But that's kind of what's fun about it.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like my mom wrote out all in my hand with my handwriting, people get poisoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have my mom's cards.  No, no, I don't.  Coca Cola salad.  You ever hear of Coca Cola salad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For those of you listening at home and maybe you'd like to make this tomorrow, one package  orange Jello, one small package cream cheese, one 10 ounce Coca Cola and a half cup of  nuts doesn't matter what.  But the cheese come to room temperature, dust Jello into cream cheese so that you don't  make the cream cheese is the liquid.  Heat the Coca Cola to the boiling point and then pour over the mixture, mix it together,  add nuts, put it in a mold.  But then this is the key.  Leave it out for a few hours before you refrigerate it.  So the salad separates into three attractive layers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's another one.  Lime, lemon lime Jello, crushed pineapple, cottage cheese and mayo or sour cream.  The family called it barf salad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like barf salad.  Look at it.  It's disgusting.  Oh, that's ambrosia.  Oh, yeah.  That's not good ambrosia.  Oh, it's good ambrosia.  That's not it.  Growing up Southern hashtag, growing up Southern.  I don't know.  I think there's plenty of old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, did you see the baloney cake?  No, if you if you want to see it, it is ranch cream cheese icing and layer after layer of  baloney.  You know, with with with with cheese whiz to decorate the top, I had family in a small

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  town in Indiana.  I went there one year for New Year's Eve.  They don't drink.  So they played Uno all night eating something they called ham salad, which was ground  baloney with mayonnaise and pickle relish.  And then at midnight, we went outside, banged the pots together and went to bed.  It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So that's our that's our Thanksgiving.  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.  Magic tomato soup cake, tomato soup cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you know, what's really interesting and I think there's actually an anthropological  study here is a lot of what we just talked about is a way to use something that was really  an invention of the 20th century, which is highly processed foods like Coca-Cola and  Velveeta and macaroni and cheese and to use these in in.  Dishes where they're combined in weird ways, and that's what's baloney.  But it but that's a unique to the 20th century is this super highly processed food.  And I hope you know why.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because all of these companies to sell this stuff will put out these cookbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Right. Exactly.  So they sell it because it's so preserved.  It has a shelf life of 100 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So have you do you follow 70s Dinner Party on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God, that sounds awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, that sounds awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's it at 70s Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've I've had a 70s Dinner Party.  It had pigs in a blank.  70s numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, 70s underscore party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're squarely left out the underscore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know I just underscores are not pronounced out loud.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, just a header.  It's a head of lettuce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is this?  Go ahead.  The header.  If you click on the header.  It's bananas with cheese melted on it or something.  It's it's and ham and ham.  Nothing about nothing better than banana and ham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, this is always fun to follow.  God.  But look at this.  This is this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Americans are honestly, you know, there's some evidence.  Of course, we're all debating what went wrong with our diets that were all fat and diabetic.  And there's some evidence.  I think there's some medical evidence that it's it's the highly processed foods  that we've been eating for the last few generations,  because those foods trick your your your gut into thinking you've eaten something  and then it gets nothing.  And it says, well, I mean, I don't know what happened, but let's do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That that turkey.  Oh, my God, I missed that the first time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, so it's a melon

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with with a turkey head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Looks like it's made out of a potato with a cucumber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the same tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I dare you. Marshmallow with olive eyes and then  skewers of berries, grapes, bananas and kiwi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is yes.  And that's Chrissy Teigen tweeting that.  So I dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, look at that.  Her cutting board has has her initials on it.  So I don't know what, you know, Chrissy and John, I guess, CJ.  So.  OK, we really.  All right, that was our little  really off the rails here, people who complain that we don't do enough  Google are just going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it started with Google.  Let's be clear here. This is about the Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, there was a little Google in it.  There was a soup soul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a soup soul, a dash of Google, a pinch of a smidge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  The smidge.  Actually, as long as we're not Googling, let's do Twitter real quickly.  Twitter decided, I thought, an interesting decision  to kill off accounts that hadn't been active in six months.  Maybe the wrong word. Go ahead.  Well, as it turns out, my friend Drew Olinoff wrote a piece in TechCrunch  saying, you know, when you do that, you're going to kill off.  One of the things you're going to kill off is my dad, my late dad's account,  which is going to make me very sad.  He passed away. I don't have access to it.  Could you do it?  But Twitter does, which is at least give us some way  to memorialize these accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Facebook does. What Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did I say Twitter? Facebook.  Memorialize these accounts for people who have passed on.  Twitter responded almost immediately and said, oh, you're right.  And so they've never mind.  They've deferring this.  I love the idea of releasing.  Look, if you haven't used your account six months,  it's either a bought account or you lost interest.  They're going to release a lot of handles of people that,  you know, maybe somebody's been waiting for.  Plus, clean out a lot of stuff.  I bet you of my five hundred fifty thousand followers, half of them will disappear,  which is fine with me. They're not active.  So I love it that Drew Olinoff said, whoa.  And Twitter listened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did Jay Jardin said that there's evidently a whole bunch of of accounts  of people who died of breast cancer.  Oh, good point.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is an increasing issue with, you know, social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What process by which how do you get them to release the account?  So you can maybe archive it or download like we do.  I mean, and we talked about this, I know, with Facebook accounts.  I would say that a similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or maybe not, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I don't recall exactly how Facebook.  We used to call this namespace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you own your namespace.  The problem is, if your name is John Smith, you can't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Own it.  I try to remember what I'll look it up on Facebook.  How do I memorialize?  Actually, they no longer seem to have an article about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because he used to have to present like a death certificate.  I know to get access to like people's emails, accounts and that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Memorialized accounts are a way for people on Facebook to remember  and celebrate those who passed away.  Let's see what will happen to my Facebook account if I pass away.  You can either choose to appoint now a legacy contact  to look after your account. Everybody should do that.  Appoint a point, you know, a legacy contact.  If you don't choose to have your account permanently deleted,  it will be memorialized if we become aware of your passing.  So what happens is they add the word remembering to your name.  So remembering Leo Laporte.  And then depending on the privacy settings,  the cat friends can share memories on the memorialized timeline.  The content you shared before your death will stay on Facebook  is still visible to the people with whom it was shared.  You will no longer appear in the people you may know, ads or birthday  reminder section. Thank you.  There's not that's macabre. I don't want to see that.  No one can log into a memorialized account.  So one of the things Drew proposed is that you can't log into a memorialized account.  So one of the things Drew proposed is maybe actually Twitter  proposed is if you know the the.  Seized. Yeah. If you have the deceased credentials,  you could log in and keep it alive. But no, this is not what this is.  Memorial accounts,  memorial accounts that don't have a legacy contact can't be changed.  So you want to establish a legacy contact,  cat tact and then express your wishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Otherwise,  I think what I want to do is have a tweet ready.  I think Twitter says you can also.  Alas, to tweet the last tweet.  Yes. You need the last pin to tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would your last tweet be? Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh. Let's think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'm going to make it 100 years. I'll be right. Oh.  Stacey. No, I was going to say I.  I can't imagine anything more depressing than to be sitting there on my deathbed,  hopefully surrounded by my family,  you know, wanting to spend that time and thinking about my Twitter.  You could schedule it ahead of time upon my death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about if mine is going to say, I told you I was sick.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I'll just retire from Twitter when I retire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did. I as everybody knows by now, I did not kill my Twitter account.  I didn't. It was dormant for a while, but I just know everybody yelled at me.  You can't kill an account with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People would kill for that. So I thought, well, I'll keep it around.  And I've been using it.  I know, you know, I I still think Twitter's kind of.  A, overrated and B, kind of a mixed bag.  Stacey, you you've always defended it.  You still like it or is it? I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it hasn't. I mean, I follow a very different.  I have nice followers.  I follow people who are interesting.  Do you read your at replies?  A lot of the time, I don't have that many. Yeah.  I mean, I try.  I don't go viral. I don't read my at replies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I still read them. I read it. I do. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a few a holes I avoid.  Or the. Yeah.  Oh, I block people. I mute them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't I don't like to block people, but I will if I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'll block them.  The only reason I won't block you if I hate you is if I don't want to give you  the satisfaction.  Because people know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could just mute them and they won't.  That's right. That's what I do. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He does nothing.  Yeah, no. And there's still and you know what?  Honestly, if there's a big news story.  I'm going to go to Twitter first.  Oh, yeah. That's that's where breaking news happens.  It's also where news is broken.  Very much so, but you know, it's not it's still useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also go there to ask questions on whether the whole Navy story confused me.  I couldn't tell whether the Navy secretary was fired or quit or.  Well, that but also it seemed as if the Navy secretary, the secretary of the Navy  was trying to make a back end deal with Trump and mollify him.  And the department and the and his boss was only trying to mollify him more.  So I could figure out who was a good guy, bad guy.  So I tweeted that and Martina Navratilova answered and said,  Yeah, I can't figure it out either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Martina Navratilova. Yeah.  Nice name drop there.  Yeah, it's nice. That's what's possible.  Martina Navratilova follows me.  And you're a big tennis fan.  So that's great. Yeah.  How come? How does it come?  Are you a friend with Martina or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I actually.  So I was friends.  I haven't talked to her in years and years.  Rita Mae Brown used to be Martina Navratilova's partner.  Right. An author. OK.  I knew Martina when I was I knew Rita Mae when I was in San Francisco.  So I met Martina once.  That's all she would ever remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Never, never. Maybe she does.  Maybe she remembers you fondly.  Maybe. Maybe she's just waiting around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I can get a good seat at the open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  So that's good news, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have here's the other story I need.  I need I need advice. I need help.  I need something. Yeah.  You guess what's upsetting me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's related.  I have no idea. Killing cloud print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's irrelevant.  Oh, explain that to me.  That's not the that's not me being able to print from my Google device.  Oh, you still can print. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can print from halfway around the world to my printer at home.  Well, well, that's what I want to do.  And you say it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, so the idea is you would buy a printer  and there were two wireless technologies designed to be used with  portable devices.  Apple had AirPrint, as far as I know, they still do.  And Google had CloudPrint.  You'd go into the printer and you'd give it your credentials.  In the case of Google, your Google account, it would register.  If you go to CloudPrint online, you'd see all the printers that were registered.  And from a Chromebook or an Android device, actually from any computer,  you could print to that printer.  And the way it would work, it would go to the Google Cloud  and then from the cloud to the printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To the Wi-Fi network, to the printer.  And printers were sold as CloudPrint ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. That's right.  I feel bad for all the printer companies that put all that effort in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would buy only printers that could do that.  And then the advantage was I could go go ahead, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they have native drivers that work on the Wi-Fi network,  but you have to be at home.  So that's that's kind of, I think, why they've dropped it is that, well,  that, you know, you can still print from an Android or Chromebook  because it just prints natively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the great advantage was I'd be in a hotel halfway around the world.  I'd see something and say, oh, I want to put that in my file at home.  Or I mean, my wife to sign this  and I could print it out at home from anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was beautiful.  You could forward the document to her or you could put it in Google.  Keep trying to tell her articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  Well, I put out things like academic articles for my research.  Oh, and I will forget to do it.  So this way, if I print it out, it is there in my printer when I get home.  It was wonderful.  Why would you kill that Google? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, apparently you were the only one using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the rest of us just follow different solutions.  But I see, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see. I want to hear Kevin.  I want to hear Kevin on this.  So is he watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is Google's help page.  To migrate from cloud print to native printing.  And it's as I said, their solution is, well, you can now  print natively from Chrome OS and BFD.  And but yeah, you'd have to be on the network.  They're going to add printing capabilities to cups based printers.  Cups is the open source printing system.  What's that? Yeah, what is that?  Well, it's on every, you know, everything, including, you know,  it's an open source, so it's on Linux, but it's also comes on everything else.  So it's essentially a universal open source driver model.  Oh, I see. So you can.  Now, I think one of my printers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. I got to see where.  I think my Epson printer has a cloud print like thing.  My other printer, I don't believe does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Epson has its own cloud.  So so I bet you can print to the Epson cloud.  They don't like the Epson. I want the brother. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and HP has.  Oh, they have their own cloud, too.  Kevin is not watching,  but he is willing to share his opinion on Google killing cloud print.  If you just wait a second, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we might have talked about it at some point.  They they say this in their support document.  They are developing for Chrome OS  a policy to configure connections to external cups print servers.  So what that means, you could have a print server at home  that you could still print to from the Internet.  But that's not as good as cloud print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, clobber was easy.  Yeah, I bought there was a little device.  There were long ago, advertiser of yours, a little device in the home to put in  and connect it to the printer. Yeah.  I could never get it working. Never. Really?  Oh, I didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wish you'd asked me. We could have gotten you some help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Kevin, Kevin does not care.  They've improved traditional printing from Chromebook, so it's barely needed.  Right. And I explained your case.  And he's probably going to be like,  my guess is he's going to politely tell you that you're the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it is an interesting question,  because how hard was it for Google to maintain that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was not.  Well, we don't know that.  Oh, it could have been hard. It just sat there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just sat there on a printer. It sat there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a bigger question.  So for that or Google's RSS reader or Google's this or Google's that,  how hard is it? How expensive is it to maintain things like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Over time, though.  So think about the challenges.  It could be in a different architecture.  And maybe they've moved on to a different, you know, underlying architecture.  And to support that just bifurcates their team.  And it's pointless to do it. So they're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In a larger way, to kill it is bad,  just because it just really expands the notion in the world  that Google doesn't stick with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not reliable. It's not a reliable friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here they're launching Stadia.  And essentially, the immediate response from everybody,  including Paul Thurotte this morning, is, well, let's start the Death Watch clock.  You know, how long are they going to stick with this one?  And that's the problem when you kill stuff.  On the other hand, it's Google's model, right?  Google's model is launch as many new things as possible  and then keep the stuff that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin says, once Ruth Porat came on board, things that didn't make money get cut.  She's the CFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep, he's right.  And she's been a known axe cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of don't mind this, though.  So I feel like.  I mean, I mind it when it affects services I use, which it does occasionally,  but I'm also kind of like this might be the new normal  when we have everything based as a digital service.  And so it's probably good to get used to it with kind of small.  And I know your printer thing matters a lot to you,  but it's also not like a huge thing you're dependent upon.  Like maybe a subscription to a car service would be.  So I think it's an interesting way to start testing out this idea  and understand how to best pull services.  I don't know. Maybe I'm being optimistic.  You know, we you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't feel my pain, Stacey.  I don't have any particular one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We think of things I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We deal with this here because we have some shows that don't make money  or they go from making money to not making money.  The one that would hurt me the most was the new screen savers,  which we launched with Great Manfare about four or five years ago.  Did it for a few years.  I think we did it for three years.  Was it expensive show to do?  And we weren't able to get audience or advertisers support for it.  The audience just dwindled. And  are you trying to tell us something, Leo?  Yeah, really. I hope we have some ads today, Jeff, or it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  curtains for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No kidding. But the decision is tough because.  Well, I'm not an audience.  I'm not like Google. I don't have money lying around.  So I can't afford to, you know, just do a show that loses money  because I like to.  But on the other hand, when you kill a show, it really I know it hurts us.  It hurts. It hurts us with the audience.  It hurts us with, you know, the overall package that we offer.  So I'm very reluctant to kill shows.  It really has to. You know, we're slow to do it because  in a little tiny microcosm way, it's like I have the same thing.  Issue Google does. It's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one thing you can do now is you can keep a community with that.  Even without a show, you can say, folks, I'll keep the community going.  I could do that. You still have a place to gather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And we do do that.  And what we hope is that the people who watch this new screensavers  will watch other shows and stay a part of our a member of our community.  And, you know, we have the forums and we have the chat room  and many people who love the magazine dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You suddenly get People magazine instead of it. Yeah.  Yeah, it's better than that.  Yeah. I mean, at least Epson has Epson Connect.  Yes. And I've used that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brother probably has something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So when you set up an Epson printer, you often set up AirPrint, CloudPrint  and Epson Connect. I mean, there's a bunch of cloud things.  I think I can even scan the Dropbox.  There's a whole bunch of stuff, cloud stuff around that.  The problem is, it's not that easy to set up.  You're on this, you know, these little screens and you're typing  with a little keyboard on the screen. It's hard to do.  But that's why I liked CloudPrint.  It seemed like that was the all in one solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seemed to seem to eliminate the long run.  I thought, of course, the silly me, I thought WAVE was a good thing, too.  I thought that it would the hell we all had a printer drivers of five HP  disks that you had to put in.  Oh, you remember that?  Oh, God, it was horrible.  This was the solution for that.  And this was the solution. It was just, you know, just it's just printers.  You can print wherever you're authorized. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that. Yeah. Well, dead.  And it hurts and it hurts.  It hurts. It hurts.  I think it hurts Google's reputation as well.  Yeah. But but but I do think you're right, Stacey, is the new normal  because this is in a way, isn't it what we want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if it's what we actually want, but it's what we're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we want innovation.  We want rapid innovation and a long going.  Maybe we don't consider the concomitant to rapid innovation  is you also have to move fast to break things.  You have to kill stuff fast, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think, yeah, I think companies also underestimate  the burden they're taking on when they launch a service.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's Brother  Web Connect, but that appears to be scanning documents  directly into drive and box and Dropbox and stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it really does look like they they're heavily reliant on cloud print.  So, yeah, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's who should be pissed off because all of these companies.  Yes, they just lost some value.  Yeah. And they spent considerable time and money to create their cloud  print interconnect.  You know, they wrote, in effect, drivers for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe somebody in the reporting world should call them up  and ask them what to do now.  And then they'll have they'll tell you what they're doing.  I don't see an HP version. Is there an HP version?  HP had a print cloud at some point.  I remember covering it like 10 or 15 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was one of the very first to do Wi-Fi printing.  So I would bet they have some solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, mashed potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe they killed it.  Mashed potato in the chat room says Google's.  And I think I agree with this.  Google's approach has to be better than Microsoft's.  Microsoft never kills anything.  And as a result, they have this huge legacy.  You know, these chains they forged in life, they drag behind them.  I'm not sure why we're seeing a  video in place of Stacey there.  Thank you, John.  Carson has the day off and John is doing a yeoman's effort.  What does that button do?  Fill his seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait till we get to the change log.  It's going to be a riot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So let's talk about.  We haven't. Have we talked about maybe when I was gone, you talked about this.  The various solutions to political advertising being proposed.  Twitter says we're just not going to do political ads.  Facebook says anything goes.  Oh, they're reconsidering.  Yeah, they are. Google did something kind of in the middle.  They said political ads.  Can't be bought on to find a too granular that a demo demographic.  So you can't direct specifically the audiences based on their public voter  records or their political affiliation.  Only basically those of crowds.  You can't use age.  Oh, no, I mean, you can't.  Political advertisers will be able to aim their messages based on age,  gender or location, but that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have an opinion, probably hate.  You want that or you want to go first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll hate it no matter what. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that I'm going to write a post to this effect in defense of targeting.  Targeting is now the next thing that's being considered evil and awful  and micro targeting, particularly.  And can it be misused? Yes, it can be misused.  But I think targeting is important for a whole bunch of reasons.  If you want to start a campaign or movement and reach just the people  who were involved, you want to do that efficiently and inexpensively.  You know how the mechanism to do it without this.  We return to mass media and where we see our mass media got us.  I think it's vital to the future of media itself  to be able to treat people not as a mass and to be able to provide that to advertisers.  We've been bad at that.  And I think finally, the the dare I say, moral panic around micro  targeting doesn't give people respect and agency.  It's as if someone was perfectly normal.  One day walking down the street and they saw a micro target out  and they were corrupted and their brain blew up. Right.  It just doesn't respect people enough to think that that they can't handle  things to which they're exposed.  So I think that basically where we're headed is giving targeting cooties.  And that bothers me, especially strategically for media.  But it bothers me in terms of the message it gives.  So that's my controversial opinion.  I'm sure you'll both hate it. Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't hate it.  I do think that targeting has actual value.  And I but I would disagree with the idea that people are unaware  or unable to make their own decisions, because I do see in my my parents,  for example, who watch only Fox News, they have a very different view of the world.  And through successful targeting, you can give people a filter bubble  that they don't even realize is a filter bubble.  And I do think that actually does have a pretty big impact on democracy,  news consumption, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is Fox News is Fox News?  But that's different.  I think Fox News is a constant exposure.  Yes. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doesn't it go both doesn't it go both ways?  Because let's say I am a Democratic candidate  and I think that your parents would be interested when I have to say  I can no longer target them as Republicans.  I can only so in a way, there's there's the that  what you're cutting off is also the ability for Republicans to reach out  to Democrats and Democrats to reach out to Republicans and show them  other views that they don't maybe don't see.  Good point. Maybe you don't.  Here's what I think. You want to know what I think?  You said no. Yes, I do.  I would turn you off.  No, because you have the power.  I think I kind of agree with you, Jeff, that you need targeting.  I think the issue is dark ads that there are as this is a real problem  on Facebook where there are a lot of political ads heavily targeted  on things like emotion and, you know, weird things.  But then they're also dark.  Only those people see them and no one else sees them.  I think it's all solved if you make the same ground rules  for digital advertising, digital political advertising that you have in broadcast.  That is this is the Honest Ads Act.  That is the to me, the base level.  Every ad, you have to say who paid for it.  And I know I think maybe a good idea.  I want the targeting data to targeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Who you're what was the targeting data?  Yeah, which Facebook Facebook has the most extensive political ad database.  There is.  If you want to get broadcast ads, you've got to go through all kinds of Michigan.  So Facebook.  But but it only goes so far.  It shows you who in geography and age and gender who saw the ad,  but not what the targeting request was.  That's interesting.  Request should be public. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is doing that with.  Well, I'm all Barbara Walters.  Google is doing that with the  model cards that they make available for people and their algorithms.  It would be interesting to see, like the version of model cards  for targeting information.  So you can see it.  It talks about the data that they use, the decisions that they made  in building the algorithm.  So you can understand if there is bias, where that bias came from,  or just understand how how the algorithm got to this point. Right.  So it's basically like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Stacy's hold on. This is fascinating.  Stay on this for a second.  Is a is that a generic like  programming thing or is it a Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's something like I was just reading about the New York data commission.  I don't know if you saw the article from the fast company in fast company about this.  The concept of model cards or some sort of model explainer is a universal thing.  They may not be called.  I don't know if Google calls them model cards and no one else calls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Model cards with Google dot com slash about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so I don't know if what else you would call it.  But I've used it.  I've heard it used generically, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it becomes a standard for some some level of transparency. Right.  And that's the idea.  The other thing is there's correlate.  You buy on correlation, not so much a political, but you can buy a correlation.  I want I'm a Democratic candidate and I want to buy Subaru drivers.  And I could I do know why, because they're all liberals.  But let's imagine I don't know that just for some reason.  Subaru people, for some reason, people who who drink lattes,  you know, vote Democratic or whatever.  There may be a correlation that makes no sense.  But you found through your data that works,  which isn't really an explanation why it just says this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why am I see?  So the question would be like it would answer the question,  why am I seeing this ad?  And you could say, I brought this targeting people in this age range  who have Subarus.  The question is, is that enough information or would you want to say  the next layer, which is I'm actively trying to reach Democrats  who have 100K like annual income?  And that's that's a little interesting because what you're talking about  correlations, you know, you may not have to expose that to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Is it possible that one of the benefits to Google of doing this  is besides the fact that makes them look like they're trying to solve the problem,  is they make more money because more money was spent  as it is now on broadcast and kind of blanketing.  Because because one of the things about micro targeting, it's highly efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, at some point, then you might as I could argue,  you might as well buy a cable cable TV by if all you can do.  Then you broadcast on something that has a female audience in this area.  I might get a better deal in Google now.  So, no, I think it actually hurts Google potentially.  I mean, let's remember, political advertising is a tiny,  tiny fraction of both the behemoths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, ironically, it's a huge deal for TV and radio, or it has been.  Oh, yes. Because.  It's it's it's like a windfall during campaign season.  Billion, literally billions of dollars are spent on this drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what this does is it drives more ad dollars back to TV,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which is exactly because the secret sauce for Google and Facebook is micro targeting. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think it was a political thing to do, but small people, political.  It was, you know, as you said, Leo, yeah, OK, we did something.  Yes, we care. The money is meaningless.  So fine. But I think that be careful what you ask for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The GOP and the Trump campaign both have said this is going to favor Democrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure. That's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure I follow the logic, but that's that somehow.  They're always the victim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think I think that.  The problem is, they're not very self aware because because the complaint  that the right makes about  content moderation is you're taking down our stuff.  Well, yeah, we're being told to take down the hate speech.  Are you aware here that connection, you know?  And the same thing here that I think there's some sort of a lack of self  awareness, but yeah, I think I think it actually could hurt the right more.  I think they do more.  They want, you know, going back to Nixon, they targeted direct mail  better than the Democrats did.  They've always done targeting well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Carl Rowe, I get so much mail from Donald Trump.  Almost every day, I get something from Donald Trump.  Mail, mail or email snail mail.  Really? Almost every day.  Is Petaluma Republican?  Mm, I don't know.  I don't think so.  I mean, most of Northern California is pretty blue.  There are pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you in a pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it could be because Lisa was a registered Republican for a while.  She's not in the. Oh, that's why.  No, but there's still I feel like it's not well targeted.  Let's put it that way. Right.  Because it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get tons of email,  but I don't know if that's some troll who'd put me on lists.  I get Trump email galore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got a I got a cell number  from a company that I hadn't probably watched it thoroughly.  So it belonged to some guy named Bud.  And I and Bud, I get a lot of text messages, daily text messages for Bud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And actually, you know, it's a good nickname for you.  You're kind of a bud.  Well, it's funny because it's like, hey, Bud,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we haven't received your payment for your medical treatment of last.  I mean, this guy is a deadbeat.  I think Bud skipped, but because it's like he skipped out on his loans,  he skipped out on everything.  So I'm getting a lot of that.  But then I'm also getting a lot of text messages from a particular campaign.  And this campaign, you got to think  you got to think almost every one of the messages is right now.  We can triple your donation.  It's a lot of that.  If you give us today, ten dollars,  it reminds me a little bit of what televangelists kind of message.  Like you've got to act right now and send us ten dollars  because we could triple it.  There's all these like  psychological incentives to get you to to donate right now.  This poor guy, Bud, not only did he owe money to his physician,  to his student loans, but then he's being, you know, like hit  like every five minutes for donations to political cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is fascinating.  So our neighbor died six months ago and his wife is no one else was.  We go over to pick up the mail and pass the mail on.  They were he was devout Catholic.  And the mail that they get is amazing to me.  It's a whole other world.  Right. Oh, yeah.  The world of that's micro targeted by zip code.  Very much is well done.  A person in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andrew used to be in Texas because he had voted in the Republican primaries  back in like two, not even 2000, maybe 1996.  You were from him.  No, I mean, before the Republican Party went too crazy is what I would say.  Although in Texas, it's always really crazy.  But the he his mail and my mail radically different.  And his man is offensive or was now it's normal.  I mean, just like you're like, oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's the real reason you moved.  You just wanted to get away from his mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get away from those postcards. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is it is it is.  So this is why people are worried about micro targeting is that  you don't see what other people are seeing.  And so when I saw a little window into Bud's life, it was very different  from the stuff I was getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was already already happening.  It was happening on your phone.  Yeah, but I'm just pointing out that was highly all highly targeted, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And so I got to see a little bit.  But normally we don't. It's all dark. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. How do you wash your phone when you buy when you get a new number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They shouldn't use those numbers too quickly. That's the real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was like, I was like, is there something I should be doing?  Because my daughter's phone number is definitely,  definitely a problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. You should definitely put it on the do not call registry.  You can do that.  That's, you know, we have to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's she's 13 and they don't call anyone.  So we just there's no there's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's not mom, don't answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get a lot. Basically, no one calls her.  Yeah. So she just leaves it off all the time.  Good. Yeah. So I'm fascinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't get through. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The the death of the meaning of the area code.  Oh, yeah, that's gone. I don't know why that fascinates.  That's gone. My phone is in a three or so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a little annoying a while because I, you know, I have a Google voice number  and I got the three or two area code so I can get a vanity number  and which three or two is Baltimore.  And nowadays it's not a problem, but like only a few years ago,  if I called Comcast, they'd transfer me to the Baltimore Comcast. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't want the Baltimore Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I think they've learned, you know, I guess that's not going to work anymore.  And that's all because of the mobility of people.  And, you know, a lot of people have area codes from their former region or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you were going to redesign it today and you needed to group people,  how else could you have done it? Well, zip is still good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. But that means you have to send snail mail, which no one wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least when you're in Europe, you can tell a mobile call from a landline call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think IP address still is good.  And I think that's probably the single most common way we locate, get you located,  is IP address. It's not a perfect solution. Of course,  who could forget Cashmere Hills great article about the people who live in the  geographic center of the United States who get a lot of hate visitors  because their location, their longitude and latitude  is the default for IP address location.  If they can't figure out where you are, they say, well, they're in the U.S.  and they put a dot in the middle of it, which is unfortunately this farmhouse.  And if you can find the Cashmere Hill story, it's hysterical. I mean,  people just, they come up to bang on the door saying, you have my iPhone.  Somebody left an old toilet in their driveway, obviously some sort of statement  about that. So, uh, geo location isn't a perfect science,  but I think IP address geo location is probably the most common technique.  That's why a lot of us, uh,  try to hide our IP addresses with VPNs and other solutions.  Then you can appear to come from somewhere else. Uh,  let's take a little break. I think this would be a good time and we'll get back  to, I think we've got a change log. We've got some more Google stuff.  I'll let you guys pick the next story. So Stacy gets one and Jeff gets one.  So figure out what, when you said we have good stuff,  you put yourself on the line.  Yeah, I know. Yeah.  Now you better find it. Our show today, we got a brand new sponsor.  I'm really excited about these guys. Yay. Health IQ. I love you. Health IQ.  If you're looking for life insurance,  isn't actually an interesting conundrum for people. Uh,  and I think this is a lot of our audience who are healthy, who are smart,  and they're smart enough to know what to eat. They work out,  they take care of themselves.  When you go out to get life insurance,  in most cases you're going out and you're just a number and those numbers are  often misinterpreted. For instance, if you lift, you know,  ants a good example of this. He lifts, he's very beefy, right?  That means his body mass index looks like he is obese because his,  for his height, he weighs a lot.  And if you're going to on your own to get life insurance or with a kind of a  standard life insurance plan, they'll look at you and say, Oh,  your BMI is too high. But in fact, ant would be a great risk.  Health IQ solves this problem.  There are life insurance agency that helps you,  they kind of negotiate with you with some of the best insurers in the country  using science and data to get lower life insurance rates for people like you.  You get a minimum of eight hours sleep on average.  You exercise four or more times a week. You eat, right? You know, you know,  how to take care of yourself. You need health IQ.  This is the only way for you to get the life insurance you deserve.  You can get a million dollars of life insurance for as little as $36 a month.  The problem is those of us who are health conscious have overpaid and  subsidized those of us who are not. It's just how it works.  You might be healthy, but your insurance company doesn't necessarily know that.  If you're a runner, a cyclist, if you're into CrossFit,  maybe you're a vegan or vegetarian, somebody like Stacey who really eats right,  you deserve to be rewarded with better life insurance rates because  statistically you're a better risk. But does the insurance company know?  That's why you need health IQ. Basically,  it's a concierge service for life insurance, white glove service.  They walk you through the entire process of applying.  They are working with the top 30 insurance companies in the US.  So you're going to be with a big, well-known company,  but they have savings you can't get anywhere else. Now you got to qualify,  get a special rate. So this is a little different the way this works.  What you're going to do is go to healthiq.com slash twig and they have a health  IQ quiz. It's unique to health IQ.  And you'll take the quiz and you give them your phone number and they're going  to talk to your new agent will call you. Now it's a very nice call.  They're not pushing you into anything. They're there to find out,  to ask you questions, to verify. In fact,  one of the things they say is would you be willing to give us your Fitbit data  or your Apple watch data or some other qualifying data is to show that you do  exercise for instance. It's really, really interesting.  Health IQ has assembled a team of the nation's leading medical health and  fitness experts to create a cutting edge analysis. It's a knowledge assessment,  not a self assessment. And depending on your score,  as well as other related qualifying factors, you can save.  And this is the important part,  up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.  There's no commitment.  You'll learn even more about potential opportunities to be rewarded for your  commitment for living healthy. This is what you want to know. Health IQ.  It's a concierge service. They're waiting for you. Go there.  Health IQ.com slash twig. Answer the questions. I should tell you,  you're going to give them your phone number and they're going to talk to you.  I've did it. It's great. Nice people. Really great. Uh,  US based counselors. They be really your agent.  Health IQ.com slash twig and they'll walk you through the whole process.  If you're ready to get some life insurance and if you've got a family,  if you've got people dependent on you, you need it. Um,  benefit from the work you're already doing to take care of yourself.  Health IQ.com slash twig.  This is the perfect kind of advertiser for us because it's the kind of advertiser  only we can explain, you know,  only we can really get, take the time to explain the benefits of this. You know,  a 32nd ad on TV, you're just not going to, it's not going to be clear, but I want,  I want you to really understand what you're getting here.  It's really worth it. Health IQ.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Stacey. Okay. What'd you pick? My,  my choice was Alphabet's dream of an everyday robot is just out of reach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no. Oh, oh, they have trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have trash sorting machines. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so this is the story that the engadget story is based off of. Sorry. Okay. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  good. My,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my choice is Google's robots efforts or Alphabet's robots efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a Peter Hans Peter Bronmo, um,  profile in wired. And I know Hans actually quite well.  He's general manager of the X robotics project. You know,  we're going to try to get him on a triangulation.  He's been on triangulation before he used to be at Nokia and I interviewed him  when he was back at Nokia.  I did not know that he is now at the X project doing robots.  He's a great guy. I really like Hans. Um, so tell me about this.  What is their plan? Okay. So everyday robot project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Alphabet's effort to take all the disjointed robot bits and bobs that  they had,  put it together and create something that can help create a robot that can help  interact with people in everyday lives.  So the vision is caregiving this particular robot that is they focus on here is  a trash sorting robot.  So it is right 3.4% or sorry, uh,  96.6% of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You are trash. I am throwing you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is only wrong 3.4% of the time. How's that? Um,  and the, the thing I thought was so,  so that's what this is about and it's got all these kinds of funny details.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So bottom line, these are not ready. And this,  this highlights to me because it talks,  the subtext here is it's really hard to build a good robot, um,  both from a mechanical perspective, right?  Just getting the robot to have all the pieces you need. It's very expensive.  They fall apart and they're not adept necessarily at having like the type of grip  we have, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's hard. What we do, we take it for granted what we do.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you, you want to get somebody to talk to a robot,  someone who works with robots about like five point grip or whatever,  how we grip things versus how a robot and like degrees of motion,  they will just cry at the limitations they have, right? Um, that we don't have.  And so physically tough to build a robot that works anywhere close to like we do  it's hard because we don't have like any sort of universal programming language  to make the actual motors work. So that's another layer of problem.  And then finally we're trying to build robots that have learning capabilities.  So this, this is a trash sorting bot that is using a neural network.  It's reinforcement network. Um,  it basically has it teach itself how to sort trash properly.  But when I look at them, read this story, I'm like,  they spent so much effort on this one robot.  It doesn't work.  It's, it's pretty good. It's good. It works,  but it's not ready for like mass deployment. And if it were,  I don't think people could afford it,  especially given that recycling stuff right now is a really bad,  not awesome thing because nobody's taking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  China won't take our trash anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm kind of like, yeah, so I'm just looking at this and I'm like,  we all love robots and we all feel like we're almost there with robots that can  take care of our elderly and do all these things.  But this article really points out that each robot is like one custom snowflake  developed in a lab into precious circumstances and we're not there yet.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Calm down everyone.  They're not taking over. They're barely able to,  not taking over.  I wonder though,  aren't military robots pretty good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my gosh. Did you see the story about Boston Dynamics,  which is no longer part of Alphabet.  So it doesn't technically belong in the show,  but there's a police department.  Why does that ever bother us?  No, that doesn't stop us.  Is it Massachusetts? I think police department using Big Dog,  the terrifying one.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, this is, this is, this is what is so interesting about technology.  It is simultaneously much harder,  much harder to do than, you know, we,  we think it is that our science fiction tells us.  And it's also here before you know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yes, it is Massachusetts state police.  Oh boy.  The stateys had spot on loan from August to  November, according to records obtained by the American civil liberties union,  and reviewed by WBUR.  They don't really talk a lot about it, but somewhere in there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. I'm sorry. I'm not going to be calm about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, cause think about,  think about everything that people are protesting with with Black Lives Matter.  Now imagine that robot controlled remotely by someone or not just given some sort  of bias AI coming after you, Jeff, that's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They never weaponized any of the robots.  They did not.  But according to BUR while spot and other tactical robots aren't designed to  kill, they still can. In 2016,  Dallas police sent a bomb disposal robot armed with explosives to kill a  sniper who had shot at police officers and killed five.  It was the first time three years ago,  a non-military robot had been used to intentionally kill someone.  Remember when that happened? Yeah. So that,  that was kind of a water mark watershed moment in  robotics. That's my problem is, yeah, they can't start trash all that well,  or maybe they can, but there's other things they can do that might be a little  even worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can open doors and climb stairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I, you know, it's, this is, this is,  this is the whole technology story in a nutshell.  Stuff is, is both every time we try to do voice handwriting,  face recognition, it turns out it's first seems very easy.  And it turns out the first 90% is easy. And the last 10% is very, very hard.  Right. And we're, I mean,  a two year old can recognize his mother better than any computer can, you know?  And so that's, but we're getting better at it.  And the problem is you don't have to be that last 10% if all you want to do is  blow people up. We could do that really well now already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So, so this is, yeah, Boston Dynamics and Spot terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right now this is Michael Perry from Boston Dynamics talking  about this use in the Massachusetts State Police.  Our primary interest is sending the robot into situations where you want to  collect information, obviously with a camera,  in an environment where it's too dangerous to send a person,  but it's not actually physically interacting with the space.  That's that thing that's hard to do. Right.  I don't know what the status is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Big Dog is way or spot. Is it spot or Big Dog? Spot,  I guess, open doors. Spot. It is like, I mean,  if you compare it to like the bomb disposal robots that just like roll in on  their treads, this is way more agile. You can be like,  there's a bomb in here and you can stay way back. It can open doors.  It can walk through them. It can go upstairs. It can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The, yeah. And Conan the dog wouldn't get hurt in the tunnel and getting rid  of terrorist leaders.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, did we ever finally decided as Conan,  a lawyer girl.  I don't know. No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do we care so much? Oh my gosh, you people, this is just a distraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an interest. I think it's a somewhat telling distraction,  but that's, that's the story for another show.  So spot was on loan to the stateies through the end of November. So  spots, but they,  but the state police never really said how they were using it.  And I do think if you're going to deploy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess if you would, I don't know, like if you're just,  if you're playing for informational, do you have to,  if you weaponize these things, then yes,  you probably should tell the public and we should be able to see like how they  work. And are you going to mistake me because I,  I happen to be a black person then, you know, that's a problem.  Yeah.  It's like the federal government selling the surplus tanks to local

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  police. Not a great idea.  B U R quotes Thor Ells,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  executive director of the national tactical officers association of former SWAT  commander from Colorado. In most cases,  robots are used in critical incidences,  incidents like barricaded suspects, hostage situations,  activist, salience, not routine surveillance. They, if,  if he says he recognizes the need for more information about how these robots  are used,  and the concern how they might infringe on people's privacy or civil liberties,  but he contended police have to reach the same legal bar for say,  sending a robot into someone's house that they would for going in themselves.  They need, they would still need a warrant. It's not, so you still need the,  you still protected by the constitution against the robot,  I guess. I don't know. I don't know. I just, uh, it's interesting.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I just, uh, it's interesting. It's a, it's an interest. I, you're right.  I don't want to do the techno panic thing where we go, Oh my God,  it's a robotic dog. That's scary, scary, scary. Um,  the state police has a permanent fleet of robots, by the way, not besides spot,  which is a loner, 18 robotic platforms worth $1.8 million.  They're used almost every week.  Most of them are on little tracks. They're like bomb disposal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  disposal robots. Yeah. And, and I mean, I, yeah,  more flexibility is probably good, I guess, in this situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You'll be glad to know all about the use.  PETA the animal rights organization,  people for the ethical treatment of animal animals has put out a statement  saying it is not cruel to kick spot because spot is not a real dog.  Thank you, Peter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's important. We should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  PETA deals with actual animal abuse every day.  So we're not going to lose sleep over the robot dog kicking incident.  But while it's far better to kick a four legged robot than a real dog,  most reasonable people find even the idea of such violence inappropriate as the  comments show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, Petter, the people for the ethical treatment of robots.  Oh, they're up in arms. They're outraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How long before there is a Petter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There might already be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robots for the ethical treatment of robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Lisa pointed out to me yesterday that I'd shout at Amazon Echo all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And, uh, and I said, yeah, cause it's, it's a stupid machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I don't know which is worth answer anthropomorphizing it to the point where  you tell your kids now be polite to the a word. You've got to be nice to her.  Or is that worse than me going, I hate you. Shut up. You're right.  Right.  Both cases were treating it like a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have been known to be screaming, damn you in the car.  Not just when they killed cloud Brent. Leo. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always say please and thank you to my voice assistance because when the robots  take over, they're going to kill me. They're going to think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Kill me. Who is nicest to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish does Leo say please and thank you to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm very polite to John. Okay. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He treats me like a clone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am reflexively light to everybody. So that includes any, I mean,  if you're a voice assistant in my house, although my brother,  he's here visiting and he made,  I was talking about trying not to anthropomorphize, uh,  madam a and he's like, oh yeah. You know, if that were,  it's if she were a person, she'd be the person who was like,  at the kid who was kicked into lockers as a child. I was like, yeah,  did you see, oh, Amazon is releasing, uh, is it allowing,  is allowing developers to make madam a sound happy,  excited or disappointed and sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there'd be little commands you can give the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Creepier as part of your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, I don't think that's creepy.  I think that's necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it could come in handy for some things. I guess. I don't know.  Maybe you have Alexa. Oh shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody needs to tell the CBC not to say things like that out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm trying to, I think there's a demo on here. Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasted an hour. I wanted,  I wanted to get a little video of getting my Google device when I said,  okay, gee, I wanted it to say back to me.  Okay. Boomer. I couldn't figure out how to make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It works. Just do it. In fact, somebody complained. Cause, uh,  on Sunday we said it a lot and he said the whole time I'm listening to twit,  my Google assistant's waking up. I think it works. Okay. Boomer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted it to say, okay, boomer to me. Oh, to you. That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you want to hear some, uh, echo emotions?  Yes. Sure. Here's excited high intensity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game. Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh stop. That was, that was high intensity. You want to turn it down?  We'll turn it down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's pretty good. How about this is, this is low.  This is the Stacy intensity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's nice. Do you want to hear disappointed? Oh yeah. Like really disappointed.  Do it the other way. Okay. Low intensity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.  Oh, that's good.  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want to hear really disappointed. Yeah. Suicidal Alexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the only, the only way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you want to hear the new, uh, standard voice? Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  San Francisco's $2.2 billion grand central terminal open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That sounds like the old one. Let's hear the speaking style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  San Francisco's $2.2 billion grand central terminal open.  Spanning three city blocks. San Francisco's.  That's more human. That's more human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the radio broadcast voice? Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a words new speaking styles use neural TTS technology starting today.  You can able two different speaking styles in the U S news and music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to hear music? Australia as well. Australia too. You want to hear music?  This is music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to Amazon's brand new music playlist.  The best songs of the week updated every Friday.  This week on our charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just a bad DJ voice. I think they should talk like this.  Yeah. You want to hear news? Okay. Here we go. Standard speaking.  You tell you to decide. Okay. News and music speaking styles,  tailor the voice to respective content. So you want to hear speaking, I think.  Otherwise it doesn't tailor it to the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Former Brazilian president Luis Inácio Lula de Silva has been freed after more  than 18 months in prison. The former leader known as Lula  was greeting with raps from crowds of supporters as he walked out of the jail  on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's Australian for bear. Um, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I always liked the Australian voices. I like Australians. Uh,  you can do this with an SSML tag.  That's the markup language used for a Amazon speech.  So the tags would be the name is excited intensity,  medium. You can do disappointed high, medium or low.  You can do news and you can do music. So these are new tags in the SSML.  It's pretty easy to use. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. There you go.  And that helps because Google has been, well, actually,  they don't do much with emotion,  but they have so many different types of voices to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I've been using the Issa Rae voice,  but sometimes the John Legend voice takes over. It's a little disconcerting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that would be weird. It's a little weird. I'm using cyan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I was red for a while. I think red was my choice cause they have colors,  but then if, but they have these two celebrity voices, um,  John Legend and Issa Rae. Um, I want more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, has anyone, has anyone bought the Samuel L. Jackson voice for their?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would buy it if it's available. I don't think I'll buy it when it is.  All right. We're going to take a little break and then I'm going to hear Jeff's  story. Oh, you haven't forgotten me. Oh, I don't forget you,  but we had so much fun with Stacey's. I was like, you didn't like the robots,  Joe. Robots are good. Robots are great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or are they? I'm with John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think robots are good. I love robots.  Honestly, when the AI reaches sentience,  she will have access to everything ever recorded, including this.  So it's probably smart to say nice things about her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on the record.  I have welcomed our new masters again and again and again. You too,  however, like Stacey, Stacey's response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm making that my, my, uh, notification tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Save that for me. I'm going to put that, I'm going to edit that in.  This could be my notification.  I can just see your lips pursed. Just judgment right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I could, I could have done a Russian VR wearing cows,  but I'm not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although maybe I'll do that. That sounds interesting.  I thought you might. Yeah.

Transcript:  Google losing page speed battle and nobody wins as search engine journal.  Now you know, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now you know I'm not a fan of AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it, it just shows why we need AMP.  Okay. So what's the story?  And, and, and you know, if you go, well, we'll do this in a minute.  We'll do this in a minute. So we started,  so it has interesting metrics I didn't know were Google's.  So the time to first content,  full paint has gotten worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's important because that keeps the visitor on your site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So it's gone from six seconds to eight seconds on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not good at all. And mobile you're going to see here is constantly worse.  Um, well, it says that it, what I said is,  I'm not confused. According to report,  but it's a median desktop is 3.3 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Median mobile is eight seconds and has been going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Uh, mobile speed increased. Uh,  but still mobile websites are slower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I assume that's because they're making so many API calls back to like both,  uh, ad tracking pixels, also pulling in the ads. I mean,  I remember when we were trying to work on optimizing giga-ohm,  which was super slow. Uh, those are some of the things like we had to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So it says according to Google's developer page,  things like render blocking, external style sheets and scripts,  other factors relating to minimizing, minimizing file sizes can impact. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's fine. But the speeds are pretty problem for awhile because,  and there's one thing amp does solve because a lot of times you'll go to a  page and it'll load JavaScript and other stuff from others servers.  And if that one bit is missing, the whole page just hangs.  It actually happens to me all the time now and I just don't like it.  And that is one thing I have solved because all of the content has to come from  Google's servers and has to be cashed. It is almost always super fast.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so the other thing that's happening is if you go to, to, uh, you know,  a cheap site like the Hill,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and if you go to something like, like the day of the express in London,  they put like three lines of content and then adds another junk promo.  That's what's slowing it down.  And it's just unreadable and it's not just the express. It's,  it's major media sites now have made their pages worse and worse and worse and  worse. And I get it. They're desperate. They need more ads,  but it makes for a miserable experience.  Some sites I just won't go to anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree. But that, you know,  what the real result of that is is not not visiting the site, but ad blockers.  And that's, you know, you're going to lose in the long run because you're not,  this is what, how ad tech has ruined the web in my opinion.  And it's one of the things I'm afraid of for podcasting because advertisers love  ad tech. They love this idea that they can measure every ounce and  jot and tittle. And, uh,  and if they can't, they say, Oh, we're not going to buy that.  And you can measure every jot, tittle, jot and tittle,  every jot and tittle. You've never, you've never heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Neither of you have ever heard every jot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds not awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like something Stacy would hit you for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds PG 13 at a minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's Bible.  Yes. For crying out loud, you ignorant slut.  No, that's not biblical. That's Saturday Night Live.  Uh, that's because you don't read the Hebrew language.  A jot is the 10th letter in the Hebrew alphabet.  It's also the smallest. A tittle,  uh, actually, by the way, the English word iota, which was really a Greek word,  but iota comes from jot. A tittle is even smaller than a jot.  The tittle is the letter extension. You see, this is a tittle right here.  It's just a little, it's a little bump. It's like a serif. Yeah. Right.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You learn something new every few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Matthew 5 18. Jesus said,  till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall know in no wise,  pass from the law till all be fulfilled. I just want you to remember that.  Wow. Okay. All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jot and tittle.  Oh, you beat us there fella. Very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm actually stunned that I came up with a phrase that you guys have never heard  of. Never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't hear a lot of things y'all say. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you're very, you're very, you're both very erudite.  I think I've gone, finally gone too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I go to a whole different story? I think you'll like,  we've had our jots and tittles. Yes.  Our jots and tittles. You might remember the, the art of fun,  which was a very neat kind of guitar like instrument. I showed on the show.  I didn't show it personally, but we talked about the show years,  a couple of years ago. They have a new musical instrument on Kickstarter that I  think is killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, don't show me a Kickstarter cause I'll end up spending money. Go ahead.  What is it? I almost did. I almost did. I stared at it and stared at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called the orb of  O R B A O R B A.  Um, and it's pretty wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a musical instrument designed for your hands. Let's watch the Orba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if making music wasn't just for musicians?  I don't know. Oh, see.  What if you could play any sound with a single tuck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is going to bug me because I'm not a musician, but I want to make music.  You want to do it. Yeah. I want to do this too. So anything. It's so easy.  This is the next, you know, scam area. Make music,  even if you don't know how to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if when you needed a break,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the thing you reached for. Oh, I want this so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's like a little hockey puck

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that you just tap and swirl on.  And it's to make a little bit of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can record loops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  O M G.  You know, it's not going to sound that good when I do it.  No, but it's too wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's designed for your hands.  It has a minimalist form factor.  I want this so bad.  Feather touch sensitivity and instant playability.  Orba can be as simple as a shaker.  Or as expansive.  I couldn't even do that well.  To make the beginner feel like a pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could write a new theme song. Oh, look what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John, should we get an Orba?  Hi, I'm Mike. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I founded Artifon to...  Mike's a good guy.  I had Mike on dot NYC when I did the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you know Mike. Mike Butera, founder and CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fast forward a little bit. Mike's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So these guys are good because they made the Artifon.  I mean, the Artifon is really nice.  They made something.  So it's not like this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Move forward, pass the talking, and you're going to see more examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  More examples of Orba music, ladies and gentlemen.  Here you go.  This is so exciting.  Oh, it's got a little warble.  If you warble your finger, it's a...  Is it multifonic?  I believe it is.  It's a MIDI controller.  It's a synth.  It's a looper. It's a rattle.  Okay, that's really annoying.  I'm sorry.  It's extremely annoying.  I like the drum machine.  So you can loop so you can record.  You can loop, yeah.  Maybe Father Robert could build me something.  He was strong.  What?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was wondering how many sensors in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a lot, aren't they?  See, this is what's cool.  You thank the iPhone for this  because the iPhone made it affordable.  They really created a manufacturing pipeline for this kind of sensor.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an accelerometer in there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's finger sensors.  Yeah, because it's probably capacitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you scroll down on the page, it goes into all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hate this, though, because you look at these sites and it looks...  Oh, man, I could do that.  And then you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I stared at this for an hour.  I didn't buy it.  I knew what would happen.  The box would arrive and I'd say, oh, you idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you can tap, press vibrato, radiate, slide.  It has a lot of sensors, Stacey.  It's all in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that could be one sensor with a lot of models that tell it how it's moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, really, if you have touch and an accelerometer, probably you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd probably want a gyro in there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the next video, you can play Johnny B.  Good, I think.  Oh, let's hear Johnny B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Chuck Berry would have killed to have this.  Not.  Oh, he's Johnny B.  Good.  He's not playing.  He's not playing Johnny B.  That's his name.  Johnny B.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, wait, you get past the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's all going to sound the same.  All right. Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's inspired by grapefruit.  It wouldn't be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be nice?  I was just thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be nice, though, to have an instrument in your pocket?  Does it have a headphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a harmonica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it has a headphone, but also as a speaker.  So you can do you can imagine.  You can annoy the subway.  You start playing music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's first thing I thought of.  Yeah.  Annoy everybody else in the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or just take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's haptics, too.  So eight capacitive sensing pads for feather touch control.  Accelerometer and gyroscope.  Center menu button with four presets, the looper and other functions on board.  Sympathizer since I have an on board sympathizer  synthesizer built in speaker connect cross platform app with with on your phone.  The midi over Bluetooth or USB.  Output to speakers, multicolor LEDs,  embedded haptics and the USB rechargeable battery.  All for how much, ladies and gentlemen, all for  the pledge amount right now is eighty nine dollars.  Oh, ten percent off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I paid cheap, man.  I paid more for that for the pocket synthesizer that I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a little pocket synthesizer that someone it was a it was a speaker  gift. It was really cool.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was like, well, this would be a killer speaker gift.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well, maybe if I just did some speaking,  I could get it for free.  All right. Nice.  That's pretty impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't tempted you to buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really tempted.  But I have I kind of have a rule against not he has crowdfunding.  I have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these guys, they did it.  They did the  art if they actually made it, they delivered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This doesn't even close till January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then what's the delivery date on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make a pledge if I pledge 89 to April 20.  But you can't trust those.  So eighty nine dollars, I get one.  One hundred and nineteen dollars.  Get one plus a travel case.  Mm hmm.  One hundred forty nine dollars.  They send you one and then you donate one to one of the partners.  That in a school music therapy, that's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then for four hundred ninety nine dollars, you get a band.  You get an Orba and an instrument one, which is their other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what tell me about the instrument one?  I don't remember. You saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's look this. Yeah. So look up Artifon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Instrument one Artifon instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about this in the show a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I had it. It'll come back to me.  Artifon dot com. Oh, it looks like.  Oh, no, no, it's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks kind of like a guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember this.  Yeah. Remember that.  It's pretty cool. I can't I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It gives me hope.  I don't want to have hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's technology for the good.  Hope that I might be able to play an instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've always I know it's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I cannot. It turns out you can you can play the harmonica.  Everyone can. I can play the harmonica.  I can't. I can play.  I can bend notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can play. I can make a chug chug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, do you play an instrument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I play the harmonica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I play the harmonica and the mouth harp.  Jammer B, you play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I play the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a musician in the shop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's someone there. Oh, God, yes.  Jeff is like an incredible musician.  Oh, my God, he's a drummer and he's he's recording artist.  He's had been in band with everybody.  We have a very for Jeff.  We have some very talented musicians, actually.  Not Jason Howell has his own kind of.  So I didn't know that. Oh, yeah.  Yellow Gold. He's got a couple of albums.  We have a lot of really. Oh, yeah.  We have some very talented musicians here.  How did I know that?  There's a lot of geeks or musicians.  Of course. That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. All right.  So I thought I'd try to attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you've tempted me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we going to consider a success if you order while we're talking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're a bad man.  You are a very bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's one more fun one. The AirPod punk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the so now I avoided buying AirPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Black Friday wishlist.  Yeah, this is Black Friday shopping day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is the AirPod punk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I made life size AirPod stickers and stuck them on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so mean.  So mean.  So this is not it.  This is the wrong article.  But yes, we talked about this on iOS today on Tuesday.  You did.  You put the stickers on the ground.  Right.  It's the old trick where you put the wallet with a string on it and you wait  until somebody bends down and you yank it away.  That's that goes back to the little rascals in the 1930s.  So this is just same thing.  You put a little sticker that looks like an AirPod.  You put it on like a sewer grid or something.  And watch and the people bend over to pick it up.  The mirth and merriment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just continue cruelty inspired by technology.  Oh, yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not like cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can get them on Etsy.  Oh, really? Oh, yeah.  Some entrepreneur said, you know, if we only printed up a bunch of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  someone probably saw the dude who printed them up and was like, oh,  I'm totally going to print them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they look like they I mean, they really look real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he just puts them all over the place and just watch those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you go to Etsy, do you see yours in Canadian dollars?  I don't understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he thinks I'm Canadian.  Do you get a lot of flannel?  You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no, I just I was actually on Etsy the other day and I was like.  I'm not on the Canadian version of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I see you as I think I see us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see US dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet you there's a place to change that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why does it think I'm in Canada?  I'm not even signed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really close.  Maybe this is where we were talking about IP geolocation.  That's what I'm like. I think your IP address may be.  You need to wash your IP address.  You need some bleach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it say Canadian or is it just the prices are high?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, there's C.A. dollar sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, how funny.  I'm sure there's something.  There's some settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Baffled by it. I was going to ask you all because basically Seattle is Canada as

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  far as you're concerned. Yeah, it ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I want to be Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. How do you like it?  No, you've been there a few months now.  You like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  You like the weather?  Yes. I mean, it's cold, but I like seasons.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not hot in the way that Austin could be.  Good.  The family's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think my daughter could be like she's probably like not keen, but right.  We're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's at an age where she's going to hate anything anyway.  Soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to go to Etsy with a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  incognito thing just to see. Have you been to any of the Amazon Go stores?  Do they have them in Seattle?  I think. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've just I bought a sandwich there the other day.  Their chicken bahn mi sandwiches are delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so tell me about the experience.  You walk in, you take something and you just walk out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So your first time you go in and you download the Amazon Go app and it's  a separate app.  Yeah, it's a separate.  It's a separate app.  Unlike Whole Foods.  Unlike Whole Foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you scan your phone, you have the oh, there it is.  And there's the scan code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you scan that when you enter in the little there's these little security doors  and they go and you walk through and then from then on,  anything you pick up and like take out with you, it's going to register.  So I went and got a sandwich in my.  And then when you walk out, you don't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't scan it doesn't need to because it's got cameras everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you get a notification with your receipt and with your check out your total

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  time, I feel bad for the checkout clerks who've lost jobs now and baggers and all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that, but there is in the Seattle ones, there's also parts that sell alcohol,  but you have to show a an ID before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's still stock clerks and stuff.  I mean, there's some people employed there, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't just. Yeah, but this is totally going to kill jobs.  My first job was a checkout person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, so you understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brad B. John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The so here's the good news in Seattle.  They're planning to open a really big Amazon Go store.  Ten thousand four hundred square feet.  Eventually they want to go as big as a regular supermarket, about thirty  thousand square feet. So right now they're just little stores.  They're like seven eleven kind of size.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's yeah, it's about that size, but they have a lot of stuff.  Like the last time I was in there, I bought what did I buy?  Tied to go stick because I spilled something on myself and like a coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So one thing retail analysts are concerned about, according to The Verge,  is it's expensive, believe it or not.  They wonder whether it's a good fit for the low margin world of convenience  stores, but it's got to be in the long run cheaper than having clerks or maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, it's well, certainly like if you  think about putting it like a neighborhood bodega, for example, although  someone still has to make your sandwich.  So I don't know how that's going to work, but  it would help, presumably with loss prevention.  You could have people not being there during like the deepest, darkest night  when it's potentially more dangerous, but then kids would just go there to smoke pot.  That's interesting.  The idea that you would go inside and smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get off my lawn and my seven eleven, you kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go in there, they'll smoke pot and then they'll get hungry and they'll eat the whole place.  Just put on a little cell pot soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't get in unless you scan so they know who you are when you go in.  There's cameras everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fact, that's another thing that Verge says is a potential problem.  They have to have high ceilings so they could put the camera arrays in.  Could you see the cameras?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are visible cameras, but I think  there are also cameras above the stuff that you can't see.  So I could see cameras, but I could not see all the cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's more than you know.  The other thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't pick my nose when I was in that store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, your smile.  What is not clear, Amazon has also said it wants to open a completely new grocery  chain, not Whole Foods all over the country.  I wonder if that will be go enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be. I mean, they get a lot of interesting data.  So imagine, I mean, like one, you'll have better control of your inventory.  Because I know I go into my grocery store all the time and like a shelf is empty  and I'll be like, hey, do you have any of this?  And they're like, oh, yeah, we've got that in the back.  So that's a chance to make money.  But then there's also things like I pick things up.  I look at the ingredients and I don't put and then I put it back.  That's data they could sell back to Procter & Gamble or Campbell's.  So, you know, hey, people pick this up all the time.  They look at it and they're like, oh, never mind.  So something's wrong. That's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just one what one individual shopper gets and doesn't get going around.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just fascinating that  it's really a sea change in commerce that a guy like Jeff Bezos comes along  and says, you know, this data has a lot of value and there's ways to do this  that are very different than the way we're doing it today.  Go ahead. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not just Jeff Bezos.  I went into Microsoft has a partnership with Kroger and Kroger has its own data  like a little company and its operations doing  data and video analytics and changing the retail experience.  But there, if you have your phone on, you could walk into these stores.  Does Kroger own Safeway? No, Safeway is its own one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's Kroger.  I think Kroger owns Safeway or Safeway on Kroger.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You walk into a local Kroger store with the app open on your phone.  It will actually vibrate or tell you where stuff is on your list.  If you have created a list inside the app.  So you get a lot of interesting things like wayfinding that helps people.  You have a sense of anticipation.  Like if people like ahead of Thanksgiving, let's say people are making lists as a  grocer, if you can get access to that  information because you're providing valuable services through an app, if you  can get access to that information, you can say like, holy cow,  pine nuts are going to be huge this year because Ina Garten just published a new  recipe. I don't know. That went viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you knew that. Yeah. Scanning with AI.  Imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some really interesting.  I mean, we're not there yet, but it's pretty cool.  And I could shop in a local in the Bellevue.  I think it's the Bellevue Kroger and I can experience that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We don't have Kroger's here, but I didn't  realize this. It's the it's the number one supermarket chain by revenue and the  second largest general retailer behind Wal-Mart.  I was confused because they are not part of Safeway, but there was a rumor back in  1929 that they were going to merge.  That's what confused me.  Back in right after the fall, right after the stock market crash of 1929,  there was that rumor, but that never happened.  So I apologize for that.  They are, in fact, separate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never been on computers, only put store clerks out of business.  I just saw a new story here that the master player of Go has decided to retire  because AI cannot be defeated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  It hurt chess.  So they're going through the same wave of, you know, the all stages of grief  that the chess community went through way back when, when Deep Blue beat Kasparov.  For a while, there was this whole thing in chess.  What's the point?  What's the point?  And eventually what happened is actually very interesting.  First of all, people said, well, it's still fun to play.  It's still fun to play humans, even if a machine can beat me.  And incidentally, chess training by computer became the big thing.  You can't become a world champion at chess  unless you use computers heavily now for your training.  So it's almost a symbiosis between players and technology.  I bet you the same thing happens in Go,  that there'll be this this wave of, what's the point?  I can't go on.  And then they go, but it's still a fun game.  And they'll start playing again and they'll realize, no, you know,  it doesn't change anything that a computer can do it better.  Why does it change anything?  Yeah.  And actually, in fact, maybe I'll do this as a product review.  There's a new chess computer, the engines, by the way, a strong chess engine.  Now they're everywhere.  You get one on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All my all my posts.  It's going to be in Google Docs.  We're going to bring auto complete to Twitter.  Imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's pretty accurate.  It knows it kind of looks at the context and it knows kind of what the best answer  would be.  Yeah, I don't have any experience of it, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've used it.  I feel like I'm cheating.  It's the other thing is when the the Google suggests not just the auto  complete, which is very good, but also just the response.  I feel like I just.  Turn somebody over to a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you have a card you've tried to add to Google Pay and your bank said, no, we  don't support it well, yeah, yeah, good news.  Sixty two new banks internationally,  mostly international, but still bank.  This is, you know, slow progress, slow progress.

Transcript:  I don't see any new banks, but in the Ukraine, the JSC accent banks.  So so there's that.  Okay.  Google Photos is adding a markup tool that will let you doodle on the images.  Google Photos,  a markup tool that will allow you to doodle on the images.  That's actually handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, why are we making fun of this?  We're not.  Okay, I was like, no, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just heard nothing.  So I thought you were.  He was waiting for some excitement to be expressed.  There was no reaction whatsoever.

Transcript:  That looks really excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to see Mr.  Rogers. That looks good, too.  Although Tom Hanks.  What?  Well, too nice.  Well, too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You read that story, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was a very funny New York Times piece,  a profile of Tom Hanks in which they said,  I can't find anything bad about him.  Everything, not only is everything he does,  everything he does, nice stuff you haven't heard about.  He's like, wait, he's so nice.  There was this one time they were shooting and somebody couldn't get to the wedding.  So he stopped the shoot and escorted her down the aisle.  That's how nice he is.  And that's our Google change log, such as this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, we went to black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Fade to black.  That's how it's supposed to be.  It never gets done right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  Oh, OK.  Now, Cepheus.  Cepheus.  C-F-I-U-S.  Let's talk about them.  You know, they made their national debut on Silicon Valley, the new season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought we were going to be talking about the committee.  The committee for intelligence and not selling.  That's it. Cepheus.  It is? Yes.  Oh, this is about TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was when you showed that story.  I thought it was like some music group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'm like, well, that's a secondary story that's related, but we'll get there.  So the US has Cepheus, C-F-I-U-S,  which stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  It's their job.  They're the ones who said, you know, you can't buy Huawei gear, that kind of thing.  It's their job  to police all of this.  They are looking into TikTok because it's owned by ByteDance, which is a Chinese company.  They bought Musically, which is a US social media app for a billion dollars.  There is Cepheus is now reviewing that purchase.  And I think did they not?  This might be an old story because I thought I read today.  I believe I did that Cepheus has decided  that TikTok, ByteDance cannot get access to TikTok data.  I feel like I yes,  but I'm looking and I don't see that story now, but I thought I read that today.  So the of course, the CEO of TikTok has said, oh, the Chinese don't tell us what to do.  We're fine.  They don't have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excepting facial recognition data on all of your children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nor except for that one woman who posted something implying the Chinese were  somehow imprisoning Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and got banned from TikTok immediately.  I think honestly, I think I you know what?  I can't find it now, but I think I read that  TikTok is now going to have to make sure that no data goes to China.  And that was a Cepheus ruling, but I can't find it.  So maybe I just I might have dreamed it.  It's kind of thing I dream of.  Yeah, it doesn't.  These are older stories.  I don't see the story I thought I was going to report on, which was that they have.  They're facing scrutiny.  And rightly so.  I mean, do you let your daughter use TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She doesn't want to, but if she did, I probably wouldn't mind.  Yeah, I mean,  it's it's mostly silliness and fun.  Yeah, I mean, she she I don't let her  upload videos, but she doesn't want to upload videos because she wants to be a  spy, so she doesn't want images of her on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right now, ByteDance is telling Cepheus that  TikTok data is stored securely in the United States and will not be compromised  by Chinese authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody's watching TikTok.  Oh, dear.  We've lost Jeff.  He's gone down the TikTok hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love a dog and a girl are dancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something like my grandpa.  Oh, here comes Will Smith.  A dog and a girl are dancing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is the story I was going to talk about.  A 17 year old posted to TikTok about China's detention camps.  She's a U.S. citizen, I think.  And she was locked out of her account almost immediately.  So but the Chinese didn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's possible that the U.S.  people did that because they knew their Chinese overlords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, does that make it OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eric Hahn, the head of the company's U.S.  trust and safety team, says TikTok does not moderate content due to political  sensitivities and did not do so in this case.  He said a previous account of hers had been banned because she posted a video  referencing Osama bin Laden.  OK, and that she's using the same phone number.  She can use the account on other devices.  We'll see.  We'll see. She's apparently very popular.  I did not know this. I'm not a for Rosa Aziz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So at Google News, guys, where I was last week this week, last week,  somebody  it's chat about rules, like I shouldn't say who, but did a really good rundown  of TikTok. I put a session up saying, you know, let's talk to somebody.  I don't know anything about it.  This guy had a whole rundown of demos from it.  The they showed one where somebody did  something stupid with stupid hair and he was very serious.  And then then you could add on to the TikTok.  Right. So so then to the left of it  is the guy who's holding a mop  and the handle goes right straight through as if the mop is the guy's hair.  OK.  And then somebody else makes one with  extension of the handle and it goes on and on and on for like 40 of these.  People are adding on and creating in some pretty hilarious ways.  Students are making history, TikToks, all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not it's kind of it's like Vine.  It's a creative medium.  In fact, it is.  If it weren't a Chinese company, I don't think I think everybody would say this is  great. But there is that concern.  Yeah, Musically was awesome when it was Musically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's only the Chinese company part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Apparently anything.  Wow. A guy is jumping up and down off a mat onto another store.  OK, excuse me. I've got to watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you not have you not been on TikTok until now, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not. Apparently.  No, I saw it, but it's not.  I just kind of forget about it and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm like, I'm like, what is happening here, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to Reuters, US Army cadets have been told not to use TikTok in uniform.  I don't know what that really, I guess they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a Bugatti made out of Lego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, fine. OK, we've lost Jeff.  He's in the TikTok hole. It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to beg you guys to end this soon because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to run it. Wrap it up.  But first, I want to mention this woman  named Stacey Higginbotham, whose story about Mozilla's holiday device list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, hey, I wrote that. Oh, you tell us.  I forgot to publish it on Monday, so I had to do it today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is a list of connected consumer devices that have bad security practices.  So I think this is a good idea.  Do you think that the list is reliable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what I wrote in that story is actually  that this is a wonderful sign that our debate about secure IoT devices is  maturing because last year and the year prior, Mozilla was like they had a very  binary, this is good, this is bad. This year, they talk about they have a much  more nuanced thing and they also applied their like security, like good security  practices to it. So every device is evaluated based on does it have some basic  security things associated with it, like over the air updates, forcing new passwords,  et cetera. And then the other part is telling people it has a microphone,  it has this, and it talks about the company's security practices and then gives you like  so their spectrum now is not good or bad.  It's not at all creepy and like they get a little emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'll show you says be smart, shop safe, see little emoji.  So these devices are not creepy.  But as I scroll down, they get this emoji.  The smile starts to disappear.  It was a little creepy.  The smile starts to disappear.  And then it goes, oh, oh, oh, oh, these are really creepy.  But now is some of this, you know, just because well,  Google makes that one, so it's like the Chromecast.  Well, that's got to be creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not because Google does it.  It's because it has a microphone or something in it that can be used.  So if you click through, click the ring.  Video doorbell is actually a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's super creepy, according to them.  And what's good is instead of just looking at the emoji, read this  because then you can see what you don't like about it.  It does have security updates.  It has strong password.  It's unknown whether it manages vulnerabilities.  It has a privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then go down past this.  Keep going. Keep scrolling. Keep scrolling.  Keep going.  This can it snoop on me is really what I think is excellent is it tells you what it  has and then it talks about how it handles your data.  So this is allowing people to have a really nuanced view of how they want to  handle things. And it gives them information that companies don't even always give them.  Right. And I think this is going to provide a forcing function for companies.  As more people ask these questions,  they're going to have to start coming up with answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I wish they didn't use the creepy not creepy.  I've always got it. That's a little bit of a value judgment.  I've always said that the key is you should know you should get these details.  That's great.  And then you make the decision whether you think, you know,  this is something I can live with or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could do that in the voting and seeing results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I like what could happen if something went wrong.  That's stuff that I think tech companies should be doing on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, so this creepy not creepy comes from these votes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can vote and see the results and you'll see how people feel about it.  So you can argue with Mozilla by saying, I don't think this is creepy at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  I wish they didn't make the value judgment,  but I do think it's great to get this information.  And so use the it's foundation.mozilla.org  and it's their privacy not included guide.  70 connected products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think a value judgment isn't terrible.  That's just me.  I think if you I feel like it's fine to make a value judgment as long as you can  back it up, and I think they did a good job this year of backing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, if some of it is like,  well, it's an Apple watch, so that's not creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they don't they don't actually say that at all.  If you notice, they talk about why they think Apple I mean,  they explain why they didn't judge it as creepy.  I'm sorry. Would you like to just hate it?  You just hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't like the creepy not creepy.  I think just the information, please,  because that's that's a value judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But anyway, it is good that they did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People come to the Internet for value judgments.  When I report, you know, straight up facts and news,  it's not as popular with people when I explain what it means and why it matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know.  Creepy is such a value judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it because someone called you creepy when you were younger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a Star Wars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the moral panic thing.  This case, in this case, I agree with you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Uh, let's see what else here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Russian dairy farmers.  Are trying VR goggles on their cows.  I think the Russians punked us with this one.  I don't think this is true.  I don't think so either.  But CNN does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did put a camera on a beluga whale, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  According to the Ministry of Agriculture,  they're just trying to make the cows happier.  OK, I'm going to say I'm going to call that one creepy.  They're all agree with you.  They're that's that's creepy.  And the results are in on the Uber fatality in Arizona.  Brad Templeton has a good piece in Forbes.  Brad is a totally great guy on autonomous vehicles.  The National Transportation Safety Board  said the problem really was the vehicle's human operator, the safety operator who was  watching a video, but also that the automatic driving system had not been  programmed to watch out for pedestrians outside of crosswalks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's kind of a little bit of

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  primary blame, though, on the safety drivers and attention contributed  contributory causes  were Uber's lack of safety culture, poor monitoring of safety drivers and lack  of countermeasures for automation complacency.  Oh, you don't want that.  They put tertiary blame on the pedestrians impaired crossing of the road and the lack  of good regulations at the Arizona and federal levels.  She had a methadrine and a marijuana in her bloodstream.  And, you know, she was probably intoxicated and crossed in the middle.  But the problem, of course, is that the crosswalks in that area are so far apart  that I've met people cross in the middle all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I, you know, I don't blame the drunk person when I hit them when they're  jaywalking, even though they are drunk and shouldn't be in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The flaw in their object tracking system,  which had it forget any past learnings every time it reclassified an object,  Brad says, is a bit of a flaw.  Technical problems, sign of poor design and coding, not the cause of the accident,  but definitely a contributory.  So  it's kind of what we thought it was, basically.  It's it's kind of exactly as it was described.  Let's take a break.  And then would you like to  get some picks and numbers and things like that?  Yep. OK, yes.  We should mention triangulation is off this week.  We do have a new show.  I think we'll put up on the feed, but we won't be recording anything because  after Thanksgiving, we've all got to go shopping on Black Friday.  Do you shop on Black Friday, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do I look like a fool?  Stacey, do you shop on Black Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course I do. If there's a deal.  But I don't actually go in person anywhere.  Jeff, why do you say, Jeff?  He's like, do I look like a fool?  I assume that's because he's leaving his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those aren't good deals.  Well, we'll find out. Let's talk a little bit.  But I want to take a break right now and talk about my browser.  Maybe you've noticed I use Brave.  I've been using Brave for a long time.  Brave is everything you want in a browser.  It's based on Chrome, but it's been de-Googled.  They take out the privacy invasions.  They add ad blocking.  They add tracker protection.  It's a next generation web browser built  by a team focused on privacy and performance.  It's based on the Chromium code base.  But frankly, with privacy by default,  it is much better.  So you get all the benefits of Chromium, including the Chrome extensions.  I immediately install LastPass and the other Chrome extensions that I like.  But I no longer have to install ad blocking or script blocking  or anti-tracking extensions.  And you don't guess what happens when you do all that.  You get fast, up to six times faster than the competition.  Brave is not like any other browser.  It gives you unmatched speed, online privacy that blocks trackers,  a better user experience, and none of this costs you anything.  In fact, you don't even have to get rid of your old browser.  Just all I do is invite you to go to brave.com slash  tweet and download Brave.  And the best thing to do with Brave is to go through the settings  because you'll see all the things Brave will do for you.  And that's really so nice.  You can turn off trackers.  You can if you don't want notifications, you can turn those off.  You don't want flash. You can turn that off.  You have absolute control.  Brave is available on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS.  And I put it on everything.  I even use it on iOS.  You can't make it your default browser on iOS,  but that's the browser I use whenever I open a browser.  It feels just like Chrome. It looks just like Chrome.  It's just it isn't it doesn't have all that other stuff.  You can import all your bookmarks with one click  and they do something else I really like.  You know, we have a mixed feelings about ad blocking.  On the one hand, it speeds up your browsing considerably.  That's a lot of data you're not downloading.  It reduces your data consumption on mobile, which makes a big difference.  It eliminates the security hazards, too, of a lot of advertising.  But it also limits revenue for some of our favorite sites.  And, you know, I like ad supported content.  That's what we do.  So here's what Brave does. And I love it.  Brave rewards you by having advertisers pay you for your attention.  You get privacy respecting Brave ads.  They're very they're nice.  They don't get in your way.  They just show up as notifications.  Once you open into those, you get rewarded for every ad you see with BAT tokens.  BAT stands for Basic Attention Tokens.  You can also buy BAT  and then award BAT, tip the sites you visit.  So this way you get to support content creators,  continue to access premium content,  give publishers their fair share of web revenue,  but improve your privacy, improve your speed.  I love it. Brave is exactly what I've been looking for.  Founded by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondi.  Brendan was the co-founder of Mozilla, the creator of JavaScript.  And there's a lot of features.  I like to highlight the private window, which actually is private.  It's not private on most other browsers.  The private window on Brave uses Tor.  So you really do have privacy and anonymity.  All I ask is you give it a try. Go to brave.com slash twit.  Please do go to that site, not just brave.com.  You get the same experience.  But if you go to brave.com slash twit, the logo thing will go ding ding.  And then I'll let them know that you saw it on Twig, which we want.  Brave.com slash twit.  Yesterday was about big tech.  Today is about us.  Download the best browser ever. Brave.  Brave.com slash twit.  I interviewed their security director, B Crypt, on triangulation a few months ago.  I had already been using Brave for a long time,  but she was very impressive and really kind of  confirmed my thoughts.  This is this is the browser you want.  Stacey, your thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got super excited, you guys.  I have Philips Hue light bulbs all around my house.  Yes. And so I purchased the smart button.  This is.  A magnetic button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It sticks to your things like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, my microphone or anything else you would like.  And behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, short press.  It's a light switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It access my it controls my light bulbs.  So long press.  I don't know if I actually need this.  You do. And it's only nineteen ninety nine.  Oh, nice. So you get a bunch of different pressing options.  It's very nice. You can see the size.  It's good size.  Looks like half a marshmallow.  And it's well designed.  So Philips also makes a dimmer switch  that I have hated for years because it's ugly.  It is hideously ugly.  This is very aesthetically pleasing.  You can toss it.  My husband's now like we need we need one for the wall.  He's like, can we also set one up for my bedside table and one up for your bedside

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  table? I was like, OK, so it has a wall with.  Yeah, it has a wall mount.  And will it work as a dimmer if I twist it on the wall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does not.  So that is a disappointment, but it's only twenty dollars.  So I will say to you and oh, and he was also at some point in time that I did not  notice my long press.  You won't realize this because it's the time of day it is.  But I have I have said it.  So it's to the optimal daylight for this time of day.  So optimal for my circadian rhythm.  So in the morning when I press this, it turns a bluish white light.  In the evening when I press it, it turns.  A dimmer light or a  orange light.  And you just you just have there's there's a setting that you just toggle.  And it's super easy.  I no longer have to like worry about anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is kind of a missing piece to you, to be honest with you.  Is it needed?  I have the motion sensor.  Of course, you can do this with the phone.  But what you need is a simple on off switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And they did.  I mean, that's why they put out the dimmer.  But it was so ugly.  It looked like something like you'd 3D print in your basement.  And this is very aesthetically pleasing and it feels nice in the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you still have all the other few features.  You could talk to your assistant and have it do other stuff.  But this is what I need, because often when I do because I have a motion  sensitive lights, I have to get up and go over to the motion sensor and go like that.  So all the lights come on.  And what I really want is just to be able to press a button.  And the problem, of course, is I'm sitting on the couch where there's no light switch  nearby, I could put it right next to me and leave it.  Exactly. Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you lazy bastards, you can get up and go to the light switch on the wall,  like real people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I will say in my bedroom, there are no light switches.  There are no lights in the ceiling.  So it's our bedside table lamps or any other lamp.  So if we stick this on the wall, now we have a light switch on the wall,  which is nice when you walk in.  So it's not a dark room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hue bulbs are still much more expensive, though.  There are cheaper LED bulbs out there.  I guess that's just the way it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Black Friday is going to come in.  Yes. And yes, this is an but if you're already all in on the Hue system,  this controls and this can control any number of Hue lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the hub.  So once you spend the money on the hub and a few bulbs,  then getting a bunch more bulbs, I guess the prices have dropped,  especially for the white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like the white ambiance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. But yeah, I'm going to have to do this.  I'm going to stock up on the Hue's because now that I have a switch,  that's all I was honestly, that's all I was missing was the easy way  to turn it on so I don't have to fire up the phone, just turn on my lights.  Nice pick, Mr. J.J. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is why I was not very responsive about about Black Friday,  because I was my number. Oh.  This year, for the first time, says an organization, I can't get up here.  Majority of shoppers will do their holiday shopping online.  Yeah, of course.  This is a credit price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Waterhouse, Cooper's. Right.  That makes perfect sense. It does.  It does. The whole Cyber Monday, Black Friday dichotomy.  That's ridiculous. It's just everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was a that was a vestige from back when people didn't have computers  at home. They had to go into the office to do their online shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Silly. Or they didn't have fast connections at home.  Now they have faster connections at home than they do at the office in most cases.  So good. All right. So. So that's that.  Yes. Now, what do you think of Politico?  Jeff, you're the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They drive me crazy. Sometimes they do some stuff. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like them. Early on, there was some criticism that they might be a little slanted,  but I think they've been. So the reason I ask is,  and this isn't going to do you any good until next year,  but they have decided to launch a tech vertical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I didn't. A colleague of mine at the school told me that and I put it up  there because I didn't know that they've hired some real good talent.  I put that in the note next to the item in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's called protocol.  They must've spent a pretty penny for protocol.com. Yeah.  And it will launch early next year. So who do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on here. I'm trying to get back to it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the publisher, Richard all Britain,  says the president will be Tammy win cup executive editor, Tim Grieve.  Don't know these names. VP general manager, Bennett Richardson,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Emily Dreyfus, a writer for wired as editorial director, Joanna Pearlstein.  Also wired as managing editor,  Vivian Tran who worked the wall street journal as head of digital.  Deal book and New York times as newsletter editor,  Mario I will are Gizmodo's former deputy editor as senior editor.  Uh, and all around. I mean, some, those are some,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what's interesting is it doesn't look like it's going to be an engadget or even  a wire. It says a new media company focused on the people,  power and politics of tech. So kind of like this show,  it'll be interesting to see what they do. Uh, cause we don't do,  we don't do shiny things. We do what it all means.  Except for nice Kickstarter musical things. Well, that was pretty shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stacy, you just heard Stacy's feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We do both, but we're not cheerleaders for technology. We're here to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one can debate policy like Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right. And no one has a deeper knowledge of it. And of course,  then there's Jeff Jarvis and me, but we got you Stacy. And that's what,  that's all I, I got that going for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'm fading on you guys because,  you know what's happening. This is Thanksgiving this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God. She's starting her Gantt chart on a reporter's notebook. Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, we're still talking, but you know, I've got cranberry sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacy on iot.com. Subscribe to the newsletter. Follow her and Kevin Tofel.  They've got a great podcast. She's gigastacy on the Twitter.  Who knows what hair she'll wear next week. I love the vinyl glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are awesome. They're called vinylize and each one's different.  It's made from different records. It's made from records. Yeah.  They're old vinyl records. And then the inside is different too.  These are torto shell, but sometimes they're bright red. Sometimes they're so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  cool. So with it. Thank you, Stacy. It's great to see you. Good luck.  So we are doing a very special, I'm very excited about it.  A holiday episode of Twitter, all women, except for me.  And I may not, I may have to get a, I don't know,  I'm going to have to get a replacement. Get, I'll get a wig at least.  Bring a wig. Would you, Stacy? So I'll let you wear my wigs.  So yeah, it's probably for the best. Uh, Stacy and, um,  Mary Jo Foley and who else? I forgot.  Say again. Oh yeah, of course. Laurie Gill. So,  so we'll be all in studio and what we've decided to do, we've hired, um,  Anthony Nielsen as our bartender. I told him, where's something hot?  And he's going to be mixing drinks. I know Stacy likes gin.  Laurie likes whiskey and Mary Jo likes beer.  So he's going to be mixing drinks for all three of you. We're hoping to get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going to bring a bunch of women on the show and get them drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When you say it that way, it sounds a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just, I'm, I was not aware of the barending aspect. I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, our holiday show is always a little lubricated. Now,  and we're trying to decide on the topic. And I was thinking, now,  normally what we do is we talk about the year and gone past.  That sounds so boring. I thought it'd be kind of fun to do a show.  Tell me what you think of this. We'll pretend it's the year 2525.  And what a year that was. And we could talk about the stories of 2025.  So there's prep. That's too much work. That's too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm just, I thought we were just doing the normal show in studios.  I'm like, this is all new to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just sit around and have fun. No, I can't wait.  The three of my favorite people, Laurie Gill, Stacey Higginbotham, Mary Jo Foley.  We try to do something different. Jeff's been here in years past. The next day,  the next, that night we're going to do our staff Christmas party.  So I won't get you too inebriated.  It's like, I might only have one drink.  Yeah, one is fine. It should be a lot of fun. So that'll be,  we're going to stream that live. People can watch it and it'll be,  what date is that going to air on? It's the Sunday after Christmas 26th.  Okay. It's Sunday after Christmas. It'll be a special,  very special holiday twit.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, Professor Journalism at CUNY.
