Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT.com.  Hello Stacey.  That is a lovely sweater you're wearing.  For the radio audience, I just want to describe it.  It's like a speckled Robin's egg  if a Robin's egg were black and white.  It's Funfetti.  Funfetti, is that what they call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has a touch of the Norwegian fish boat too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a fish boat meets Funfetti.  And that is Jeff Jarvis, Leonard Tao professor  for journalistic innovation at the Cray.  Newmark graduate school of journalism  at the City University of New York.  And I'm thinking we really do sound like a morning show.  Actually at this point.  We do.  We do.  We got the sound effects and everything.  Just on it.  That's Aunt Pruitt.  I'm little Leo.  He's the mighty Aunt Pruitt.  Twit.tv slash hop.  That's right.  Working out his delts a little earlier.  So stand back.  They might burst through the screen.  My delts need a little work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw you on Twitter saying how hard it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to work the delts.  It is.  Well the rear delts in particular.  The rear delts, the shoulder muscles, right?  The deltoids.  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have three heads on your shoulders  and the rear delt is the hardest one to work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So when they say you have a good head on your shoulders,  they're talking about your deltoids.  Sure.  Sure.  The reason we're in a kind of weird mood  is for the last half hour we were playing  with this Amazon amp we talked about last week.  Turns out one of the founders heard us,  or more likely his clip service alerted him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm sure he's a regular loyal listener.  Matt Sandler.  Wishing for this week in Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt Sandler, he said thanks for the kind words  about on amp.  Love for you to play with the beta.  So he gave us a code.  Turns out the codes are easy to come by.  You have to have an iOS device.  It's an iPhone thing.  And I played a song.  I made some noises.  Made a lot of noise.  Well, a lot of noise you tuned in at the end  and then one person was listening, which is,  we took a call from John.  Here live in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was full meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing really how technology makes it possible  to do something that, you know, in an earlier time,  my time, took a lot of money and a transmitter  and a tower and a radio station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like Howard Stern screaming about how podcasts  are ridiculous and this is before Joe Rogan made a fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's so wrong.  People kept telling Stern, do a podcast.  He said, no, they're a joke.  Kind of like the classic old radio guy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or was, I mean, I called into it.  Or like the old magazine people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, same thing.  That's true too.  Same thing, yeah.  But you know, Stern got what they say 200 million  or 500 million, 500 million to do,  to move to satellite from broadcast.  Yeah, that works.  He's fine.  He's doing all right.  Rogan only got 200 million.  Poor sap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Poor sap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, whatever happened to Joe Rogan?  He's still there.  This is the funniest thing when you agree.  But I'm saying there's no discussion of him now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, it just kind of came and went.  I'm glad.  You know what happened?  The war in Ukraine happened, really.  Well, exactly.  Real news.  Real news and then all of the silly news  went by the wayside for a while.  Good.  Gas prices went over four bucks.  By the way, it's over five bucks here, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, California's always been ridiculous.  Well, we have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always tell people that you're paying  California prices now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yay.  I don't know.  I think this is why.  Still not paying European prices.  There's a law that gas you buy in California  has to be refined in California.  So it's more expensive because they have to ship it here,  crude, and then they refine it.  So that's kind of ridiculous.  It's still less than what they pay in Europe.  Protection laws.  It's a protection law.  It was passed by the refineries, I'm sure.  It's like the chicken tax.  We're talking about this with Sammable Salad.  Wait a minute.  Chicken tax.  Do you know about the chicken tax?  All your chickens have to do tail, sir.  There's a 25% tariff on light trucks  imported into the US.  Let me tell you how that started.  Lyndon Johnson imposed the tariff in 1964  in retaliation for European tariffs  on American chicken imports or exports for us into Europe.  So they charge 25% on our chickens,  so we charge 25% on their trucks.  But in 1964, there weren't a lot of Americans  importing light trucks from Europe, right?  So the chicken tax has gone, long gone.  In fact, the average US tariff rate on imports is 2%.  But the chicken tax on light trucks still stands.  How?  Which means it's bizarre.  And so for this reason,  a lot of trucks,  it's actually been good for the truck industry  in the United States.  Not so good maybe for competition  and prices for people buying them.  The original order was a 25% tariff on potato starch,  dextrin, brandy, and light trucks.  One of these things is not like the other.  Everything, all the other products,  the tariffs are gone except for the light trucks.  That's why they call it the chicken tax.  This is to me why trade regulation  is not often is to benefit somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, I've mentioned this book tons of times,  but I love this book about the history  of the Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Company  as the first chain store in America.  And the regulation and legislation that came out  raised prices to protect mom and pop groceries  and hurt consumers and voters.  Protectionism always does.  Well, okay, hold up.  A corporate entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, maybe.  Or you also might have benefits outside of just,  I mean, raising prices to consumers  is not the only rubric we should look at.  We should also look at like how the workers fared.  Was it better to work under a mom and pop store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  Was there any stopping progress?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there is a chance to say,  hey, is this progress giving us the benefits we want  across the board? Yeah, I'm not against that.  Is price the only benefit we want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not against that.  The problem is these things tend to outlast their utility.  And they have also all sorts of unintended consequences.  The chicken text of properties.  And the horse or chicken is out of the barn.  But doing nothing has unintended consequences as well.  That's true.  No, you're right.  You're right.  I mean, it is Congress's job to try to level the playing field.  The only problem is all that money on one side of the seesaw  really changes the equation.  Yes.  That is 100% true.  Hey, we knew it was going to happen.  It has happened about eight hours ago.  A video, a fake video with Ukraine president Zelensky  was published asking Ukraine troops to retreat  and surrender their weapons.  But it was a deep fake.  And an obvious deep fake.  I think fortunately, in fact, I'll show it to you.  Fortunately, an obvious deep fake.  But it's only a matter of time  before they're not obvious, right?  Now, I don't understand Russian, but for Ukrainian.  That's not his voice.  His head is kind of not.  Yeah.  But you know, you're on a battlefield  looking at it on a small phone.  You might, you know, you might want to kind of retreat.  You might want to stop fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can think about these deep fakes  as they're generally deep stupidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How long is that going to, how long do we count on that?  It's cool tech though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we have systems, this happened in text.  It happened in photos.  It happens in every medium of communication  that comes along.  And that's why we have things like  branded news organizations to tell you what's real and not  and to put the effort into reporting them.  I'm not terribly concerned.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, it's sad that that's out there,  but I still enjoy the fact that there's tech available  that we can utilize this from a creative standpoint.  You like Adobe's AI, for instance.  As well as even the Blackmagic Design AI stuff too.  It's good for creating decent, cool content,  but yet it can be put into the wrong hands  and put stuff like that out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a really good example of how it's not black and white  in any case.  We've talked a lot about a clear view AI  that was scraping face recognition  from public places like Facebook.  There's all sorts of issues with face recognition anyway,  especially with people of color.  But there are some uses for it.  Ukraine has started to use clear view AI  to identify Russian soldiers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good or bad, I don't know.  Seems like there's a lot of that going on.  One bit of tech or some story that's happening  around this war where it's,  you want this AI to be for the power of good,  but yet at the same time, it's still a bit of a mess.  It'll be both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it clarifies that tech is a tool  and we can use it both ways.  And it also offers good examples of why  or how it could be used in a negative way  and in a positive way.  So then you can start thinking about legislation  or regulation around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Clear view AI gave Ukraine free access.  They're using it at checkpoints  as people are coming and going to vet people of interest,  among other things.  Yeah, I think this is a good use of it.  We talked about Taylor Swift using face recognition  at her concerts to keep stalkers away.  Another good use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But a questionable use might be retail stores  like Home Depot or Target using facial recognition  to profile shoplifters coming into their stores.  Or sorry, accused shops, profledged shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not just accused, but tried and tried.  And guilty shoplifters would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not just, they're doing alleged,  they're not just convicted shoplifters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and because of the high false rate of false positives,  that's another issue.  And we've seen now a number of stories  in the last couple of weeks of black men  who have been held in prison, who have been arrested,  who have been detained because they incorrectly were matched.  Yep.  Just like eyewitnesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eyewitnesses are terrible too.  It's been the case of eyewitnesses for years  and years and years and years.  And so the discussion at the level of principle  is the degree of confirmation that would be needed  for either to be believed.  Here's a test.  And I think you raise another important point too,  is what this is all doing,  a lot of the presumptions about bad use  or bad activities of the platforms,  a war puts that in a different light.  Sure does.  So platforms getting rid of bad content.  Well, they get rid of RT.  Okay, well then Russia kills the platform  and people can't get any information, not so okay.  And it creates a new context for the discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a story in our rundown about Slack  that it hit close to home because I don't-  That troubled me.  Yeah, I don't use Google Hangouts or anything anymore,  but my family, our chat is Slack.  Really?  Yeah.  Our group chat is Slack.  We wanna power points to each other.  I'm not gonna comment on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what story, the one about Slack cutting off access  to Russia? Yes, that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause they're being sanctioned, but at the same time,  what about the people there in Russia  that has nothing to do with that war,  that may be just like the Pruitt family  and use it as group chat to communicate,  to make sure, hey, you got an appointment at four o'clock,  make sure you're there on time, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or developers trying to stay employed within the economy  or dissidents arranging events.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the truth is a lot of these sanctions  seem a little misguided.  They seem, well, people do them for a couple of reasons.  Sometimes they just do it to look good, right?  Virtual signaling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Signaling.  Yeah. So there's certainly that.  I don't know if that's why Salesforce is doing it,  but they own Slack.  But the other thing I think is even a more serious concern  is it seems to be you're doing this to put pressure  on the populace to what, overthrow Putin?  They're not responsible for the war.  If you want to punish oligarchs  who are benefiting from Putin, that's one thing.  But if you're a Russian citizen,  many of them seem to be against the war.  They're suffering greatly as we know.  And what is the end game of that?  That you overthrow, like what you're gonna rise up?  Is that what we're trying to get done here?  Putin doesn't care.  Right, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Putin care?  Seize the yachts.  Don't take away their productivity software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  There you go.  There's the slogan.  Take the yachts, not my Slack.  Show title.  Take my yachts, please.  Russians saying farewell to Instagram.  This is another example of that.  In fact, Instagram is really widely used by people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that because Russia cut it off?  Russia cut it off.  Oh, okay.  On that side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To hell with you, Russia.  Farewell posts at midnight on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They gave them time to say goodbye too, which is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  48 hour grace period to say goodbye to Instagram.  The reason Russia's regulator gave Ruscom Nanzor  is that Metta has decided to allow posts  calling for violence against Russians  on Instagram and Facebook.  You know what, honestly,  if you take out the invading Ukraine part of this,  I kinda, of course, if we wouldn't want Russians  to be able to post on a social network  advocating for the assassination of our people,  the company made an exception to its policy  against inciting violence,  so long as the posts represented political expression  against Russian forces invading Ukraine.  Oh, calls for violence against ordinary Russian citizens  are prohibited.  So Russia decided to cut off Instagram.  Yeah, that is a different story  because that's Russia doing it, right?  I don't know.  It's like charity.  Bill Gates said, I'm not gonna donate any money  until I can do it right.  I'm not supposed to throw money at things.  And I think it's the same thing  where it's hard to figure out what the right action is  and where the, in the case of charity,  where the money should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where Stacey and I will come to agreement, I think,  is that she says all the time that we need discussion  and I say all the time we need principles  and then, yeah, we need discussion about principles.  What is it that we think?  What's the internet we want?  On what principle should it be to be ruled?  How free should expression be?  How much should we fight for that?  Even in such cases as this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how do we make exceptions?  Because that's another, I mean, like,  it's silly to think, I mean,  we might have fabulous moral principles, right?  But at the end of the day,  we all have to make decisions kind of individually  or even collectively about what we're gonna throw  under the bus, as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but on what basis?  What's our goal?  And then we just have to commit to it.  Yep.  Or change it.  The thing too, Stacey, you're right,  is that you can hit an exception and say,  ah, that means the rule, the principle,  was wrongly thought through.  And so you can change that,  but you should live with the principle  you then put out there, I think.  Here's another complicated one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  Here's another complicated one, Kaspersky.  Antivirus, very widely used, comes out of Russia.  The German government has said, stop using Kaspersky  because we're worried it could be used to attack us.  As a backdoor, the German Federal Office  for Information Security published the wording on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's been an issue for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we remember, in fact, that Kaspersky was implicated  in the famous leak of NSA tools from the United States.  Remember that?  I'm trying to, what was the name of those tools?  Let me see if I can find that.  The NSA contractor who brought those tools home  had Kaspersky antivirus on his computer.  One of the ways Kaspersky works  is if it senses something that's potentially dangerous,  not necessarily something it has signatures for,  and a lot of antiviruses are doing this now,  it's called cloud detection,  they will take what they think is bad  and upload it to the cloud.  Well, as it turned out, what it got was the NSA tools,  and they were uploaded to the cloud in Russia,  and it's always been thought that Kaspersky had connections  with the Russian intelligence agents,  and they think that's how the NSA tools were leaked,  in fact, to Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that makes sense.  Every government is looking for zero-day attacks,  so scanning people's antivirus is a great way to get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kaspersky Lab, this is from the story  which was back four years ago.  Kaspersky Lab does not dispute  it discovered hacking tools on the computer,  but they say it's the NSA contractor's fault  for bringing it home,  they were using the company's antivirus software  when it detected a piece of malware  attributed to the equation group,  that was the name of it, in 2014.  Sometime after that, the contractor disabled Kaspersky,  but they're not sure when, then he turned it on,  because he had downloaded and installed some malware,  this guy should not be a contractor for the NSA,  he downloaded and installed some malware  trying to pirate Microsoft Office.  Lovely.  The malware dropped from the Trojanized Key,  Jim was a full-blown backdoor,  so they say, Kaspersky says, it wasn't us,  the guy installed the backdoor.  Eugene Kaspersky, who is pretty well liked  in the security community, has said,  we are not part of the Russian government,  and we think that this announcement from Germany  was political, not for any technical basis.  This is another one of security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But security and Russia don't mix, right?  This is a practical level.  I mean, Kaspersky, I've met him,  he was a major fixture at Davos,  back in the day, and he was very good  at presenting a portrait of himself  as someone whose business depended upon  the credibility of their security,  but at some point, you lie down with dogs,  you get up with fleas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would argue that the way all nations  deal with cybersecurity, we'd have the same issue  looking from the outside in at the US.  A lot of nations have problems with us.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why Europe and Brazil don't look  at the security here.  We're flea-ridden ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, not me, but the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kaspersky has been careful not to criticize  the Ukraine invasion too.  He tweeted recently, he hoped negotiations  would lead to a compromise between Russia and the Ukraine.  Nice try.  Yeah.  That's a fine line to hoe.  They're killing civilians, nice try.  Yeah.  Let's see here.  There's a few stories.  Jason was worried that this was a light news day.  There's some stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some stories.  By the way, I'm sorry, but he put in the possible title,  as Jason does as we go along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, take the yachts, not the slacks.  Sounds like it's take my pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You take my pants.  I like it.  I like it.  That may be the title.  I don't know, unless something better comes along.  So you saw Saturday Night Live making fun of the fact.  This is still is enough.  Making fun of the fact that the White House invited  TikTok influencers to a briefing about how they can help  with Ukraine.  Now, if you're looking at this picture  and you're not a TikToker, you probably don't know  that there is a very famous Asian guy and TikToker  who does strange things with plungers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That explains it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on TikTok and I had no idea.  You've not seen his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He started not on TikTok.  He started, I think probably on Instagram  or somewhere else, but certainly I've seen a lot of that.  But on the other hand.  TikTok feed, man.  I think it's probably a good thing for the White House  to reach out to social media influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good to explain.  I think it's always good to brief people  and give them your side as a story  and explain what's happening and to provide ways  to find more information.  I mean, that is never a bad idea.  I understand a little upsetting for trained professionals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there's a but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, but you also have to hope  that these creators recognize  they're being potentially spun, if that makes sense.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another way to look at it, a but to your but,  I'll raise your but, see your but and raise a but,  is that, sorry, that was not,  two ladies out of my mouth.  Your however, I'll see your however and match your however,  is that it also shows respect to the people.  I remember when bloggers were allowed into the conventions  to cover the political conventions,  that was a big deal to say bloggers can matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're right.  Yeah, it's totally validating.  And I think, ultimately, I didn't make fun of the White,  people were making fun of the White House.  I was like, why are you making fun?  This is a great first step.  And I don't know who they invited  or what they were trying to do,  but there are legit news platforms on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they weren't inviting traditional news platforms.  They invited influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but there's under the desk news,  although now they have a deal with the LA Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember you mentioning them before, under the desk news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a Ukrainian journalist, Jules Solzaltsev,  who does Good Morning Bad News.  He's been doing many briefs.  He said it was kind of like a briefing for kindergartners,  but he's kind of more up on this.  The problem is, the norms have just disappeared.  So, I mean, obviously, you brief the newspapers  and the news channels.  They have their press briefings every day.  And they have regular press briefings.  But what if there's an influencer  who has 10 times the audience of CNN?  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to make sure that those people  aren't saying dumb stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is one of them.  This is from the Washington Post story about this.  Ellie Zyler, she's 18.  She has 10 and a half million followers.  That's more than CNN, right?  That's more than all the news channels combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poor wolf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, yeah, I know.  And so, of course, you got to reach out to,  and yes, they're not trained professional journalists,  so they could be, you know, influenced.  Spun, I mean.  Spun.  Yep.  But I don't know.  You want to give them information.  I think it would behoove the White House not to spin them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you want them to have the facts as you see them.  I mean, that's, I'm just skeptical.  You know, this is my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what if those same influencers  take the information that they're given  and spin it themselves into some other malarkey  because they have that kind of reach.  And that's what the American press does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Fox News in the press room.  You know, it's still the same old crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that we're dealing with from the smaller.  I'm sorry, I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this isn't magic.  It's just.  If you believe in the power of information and transparency,  you have to look at this and say,  that's a positive move to be like,  hey, we're going to tell you what we know  and what we're telling professional news people  because we know that you have a following.  If you choose to go this and take this  and go do crazy things with it,  maybe you don't get invited back.  Right.  But that's the most American thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  I would hope they would do Instagrammers.  YouTubers might even be even more influential.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, John and Hank Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But TikTok is, they're where the youths are.  They're where the attention is right now.  Also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also a lot of Ukrainian attention now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, YouTube, I guess you can't necessarily  get it everywhere, right?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and maybe the White House is kind of like,  well, actually that doesn't make sense.  I was just saying,  maybe they don't want to deal with Google or Meta,  but they probably really don't want to deal with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess we could do that one too.  And actually that was pretty right on.  It really was.  This might not have been the best cold open I ever saw,  but they were mocking the grab and go stores  that Amazon has.  Let me go to the, I'm sure it'll be posted on YouTube.  Can I play this again?  I feel so nervous.  It's not music.  Yeah, but you can't.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a parody of the stores Amazon has,  as you know, where you go in and you don't have to pay.  By the way, is this a set or is it an actual  grab and go store?

Transcript:  They even convert it to metric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's even worse.  Well, that's how you gotta do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A fine grind.

Transcript:  Thank you.  He did not know.  We're gonna have to put a sponsor hashtag on his head.  Or something.  Just draw it in.  Over his face.  Over his face.  That's actually an interesting question.  I wonder if the FTC would say something about that.  If you.  No.  No.  Well you just disclosed it right now, yes?  It's disclosed.  It's disclosed, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look how people have been wearing their schwag.  Even interviewed on the MSNBC.

Transcript:  I know.  They never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wearing Funfetti schwag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Funfetti?  Is that a brand name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you not know about Funfetti Cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean it's like a thing.  It's not a brand.  No, because pie is greater than cake.  Oh it is, it's Pillsbury Baking.  Yeah, it is a brand.  Oh my god, you're right.  It looks just like your sweater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had no idea.  Oh.  I didn't know that it could take his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I recognize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe y'all don't know about Funfetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But wait a minute, before we have to clarify this.  Pillsbury has not given you any money  to wear that sweater, am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, in fact I get Pillsbury.  If you wanted to, Pillsbury, we'd win.  You're really missing out Pillsbury.  We would take it if you offered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Advertise at twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So on Sunday morning, I got up an hour less sleep  because we set the clocks forward.  Monday I was groggy.  In fact, every year, the Monday after the change  to summertime, which happened early this year in the US,  it's gonna happen later this month  than the rest of the world, there are more heart attacks.  There are more auto accidents.  Marco Rubio, the Senator from Florida.  Apparently this has always been an issue for him.  He picks the big issues.  And he got it passed on a voice vote unanimously  in the Senate to stay on saving time.  Now that's a little controversial.  It has to go through the House  and of course be signed by the President.  But I think there is broad nonpartisan support.  For one thing in Congress, it's this.  Stop changing the clocks.  Now, the question is, which way should we stop?  And Rubio's bill says-  Anti DST.  Really?  Rubio's bill said we would stay on DST in the fall of 2023,  in November 2023, we would not go back  to night, dark, scary time.  Why do you wanna keep DST?  Not keep DST.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my issue is that in the winter,  which is already a dark and depressing time,  the sun literally rises at like eight o'clock here in Seattle  because it's so far north and it sets around 420.  And I get the idea of the extra hour of daylight  being at the end of the day, but waking up,  sorry, not waking up,  waking up at my normal time and being expected  to do things in pitch dark.  In the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I think it comes down to if you're a morning person  or a night person, I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm a morning person and it kills me.  I'm gonna be up for like three hours trying to force my body  when it's like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So believe it or not, we tried this in the 70s.  And here's a picture from the Washington Post-  Because of energy.  Because of the energy crisis of kids going to school  in the dark and this is why people hated it.  And in fact, it didn't last.  I remember going to school in the dark  and never thought twice about it.  This is the starting time of school.  There you go.  There's a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just move it, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  In 1973, the US state decided to stay in daylight  saving time for two years.  By the way, this is a fairly new thing.  It started in World War II, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My grandmother, my Republican grandmother-  Used to complain all the time-  Oh, 16.  About God's time versus FDR's time.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how she put it, huh?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the Obamacare of that era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes.  Now I know why Rubio's against it.  No more FDR time.  But our time zone,  our time zones are not, are they set by national?  No, it's set by the longitude, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So something interesting to know  because Washington State already passed a law that said,  hey, we're going to DST time if it ever federally passes.  California's done that too.  Yeah, so when this law happens,  all the states, it basically gives states a choice.  So some states have already passed laws  that say this happens.  That's, now it's chaos.  But hold on, hold on, hold on.  Now Arizona, which we all may be familiar with,  is on standard time year round  because you didn't have to actually,  you could have, any of our states have been like-  Anybody could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just not, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they did that instead because they were like,  all right, we don't want to change the clocks.  Standard time, all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Indiana have like slices that go different ways?  I feel like they-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They used to, I think they changed that.  But I do remember,  because my first wife lived right over the border in Ohio  and it was very strange  that you had these weird time zones.  Going over a state border and it was just very strange.  So this just shows you,  there is nothing not controversial in the whole world.  Clearly.  Because if anything, you would think this,  they have a unanimous vote in the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That this is what they can do.  They can't do anything else that actually matters.  No.  This is what they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine  immediately issued a statement cautioning,  cautioning that a move to permanent daylight saving time  overlooks potential health risks  associated with that time system.  Standard time, they said,  for so many scientific and circadian rationales,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now-  Basically it'll be dark when you're trying to get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now we're bringing out the big guns.  Circadian rationales and public safety reasons  should really be what permanent time is set to.  Because permanent time is based on our time zone.  So our bodies will,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our bodies adjust already with the time change.  We get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yes and no.  So like living so far up here now,  in the winter, deep as darkest winter at like eight o'clock,  my butt is out of bed.  It's hard to get out of bed,  but the best way to make it get you feeling  like a human being is to go out,  get some sunshine.  Walk out for like five minutes into the daylight.  And you have to do that.  Otherwise you're like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  When I get up, I throw open the curtains.  And you're right, if we're dark out-  Oh, I thought you said you throw up in the curtains.  Yeah.  That's on how the night before went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That also sounds unhealthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I throw open the curtains  to let the sun shine in like it is in your office  right now, Jeff.  And that's a great way to wake up.  And you're right, you should probably go outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why do we never hear any of these controversial  stories in the state of Alaska?  Their time is-  People move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And frankly, Bainbridge Island too.  I have to deal with the fact that  they're higher up in the latitude  and they're not gonna have much sun.  I'm sorry.  That's just life.  Welcome to Helsinki.  Yeah.  Move to Brazil if you want to.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where is Seattle?  I love those maps that show where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, ironically, it's your Senator, Patty Murray,  who co-sponsored this with Marco Rubio.  Patty Murray said,  "'The Senate has finally delivered on something  "'Americans all over the country want.'  "'And I will agree with her on this,  "'to never have to change their clocks again.'"  Right.  Let's not change them, but what do we leave it at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what you could do  if you don't want to change your clocks ever again, y'all?  Just make every clock an internet-connected clock.  Make it a different time.  And then it will happen by magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You still have to change your kids' pens.  Yeah, that's already happening.  It's not the actual physical act  of changing the clock, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying, if that's your issue,  we can solve that today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't want it to be a different time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  when I wake up.  The queen of IoT has spoken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we have clock changers.  Actually, you know, completely off-topic,  but Buckingham Palace has a brigade of clock changers.  Did you know that?  I did not know that.  Yeah.  I read this somewhere.  Let me see if I can find-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like that on my resume.  Royal clock changer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there are 450 clocks at Windsor Castle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are 600 clocks at Buckingham Palace.  And someone has the god-ass-  And none of them are automatic.  Okay.  Wow.  Queen Elizabeth's palaces have over 1500 clocks  and they all need to be reset.  A whole team of conservators is required  for this massive horological undertaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is quite the horological undertaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a picture of a horologist looking at a clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want another one?  This was my job growing up when I was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another one.  The guy has a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very serious.  I gotta say, he's got a monk's tonsure.  He's definitely-  Yeah, these guys, look at this.  They gotta change all these freaking clocks.  Every one of them.  They don't change them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a watch store,  expensive watch store in New York  where they make a big deal about how that night  they change all the watches.  I put in the Twitch chat the map of the equivalencies.  What major city is Seattle equivalent to  in latitude across the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Vladivostok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paris.  We're actually the farther north in parts of Maine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Paris is very far north.  I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Berlin is up in Canada.  That's that whole thing.  Yeah.  Europe's only warm and habitable  because of the Atlantic current thing.  What's that called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's the thing that we're worried  it's gonna shut down.  It's a current over the ocean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gulf Stream.  Jet stream?  Gulf Stream.  Gulf Stream.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're worried it's gonna shut down.  Let's see.  That's all.  Seattle is about Paris.  Portland's a little south of that.  San Francisco, oh yeah.  We're on the Costa del Brava.  We're a very nice warm-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where Fargo is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fargo is-  I like where San Francisco is.  Ukraine?  I don't know where that is.  I really couldn't pinpoint Ukraine on a map.  I think that's Poland, maybe.  No, that's Ukraine.  Fargo's in Ukraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ukraine's to the right.  Ukraine's to Ukraine.  Ukraine's right next to Russia.  That's the issue here.  Oh yeah, right.  So Winnipeg.  Remember Winnipeg's in Ukraine.  Winnipeg is Lviv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jesus.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only reason we're laughing is,  well, there's no reason to be laughing.  We should be very serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Denver is in southern Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Denver is in southern Italy.  See, that doesn't make sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Texas, it always made me laugh  because Austin was in line with Morocco  and I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty hot.  Yeah.  That explains-  Anyway, Facebook has a TikTok now.  They do?  That's the stupidest story ever.  It is.  I'm the one who-  What are they calling it?  Bookmarked it.  They're calling it Facebook TikTok.  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't, yeah, Facebook, see?  And look at all the followers it has.  That's what's fascinating.  21,000 followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they have a, I thought they launched their own TikTok thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, isn't that confusing?  That's me too.  That's very confusing.  That's why I clicked on the story.  Yes, me too.  That's, yeah.  So Facebook has an account on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well played, TechCrunch, well played.  Well played.  Editors of TechCrunch, I should say.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg says,  NFTs are coming to Instagram.  That seems like a terrible idea.  Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.  Instagram users will be able to, quote,  mint things within the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you can abuse and rip off people on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, is this just like, so you can show your-  But that's the thing-  Are NFTs on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  Mark says, we're working on bringing NFTs  to Instagram in the near term.  You sound like 90 year old Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but wait, what does that mean?  Like, you know, is that like-  I'm not ready to kind of announce

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  exactly what it's going to be today,  but over the next several months,  the ability to bring some of your NFTs in,  hopefully over time, to be able to mint things  within that environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay, so I could mint them.  You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's the idea.  You could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't get it.  Well, all those gas fees going to other people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they gotta get those gas fees coming in  to Facebook coffers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wet their beaks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, remember Facebook started a cryptocurrency DM,  which failed.  Yeah.  They shutted it, they folded it.  They have a cryptocurrency wallet now called Novi.  Okay.  Novi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But who doesn't have a crypto wallet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have one, but I can't access it.  Everybody who's anybody has a wallet.  So, I guess the idea is you would,  I don't know, you'd put your NFT in your wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't get it because there's a lot of NFT artists  out there on Instagram, quote,  sharing their NFTs on Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you could put a picture and say,  that's not what this is.  No.  This would be, instead of OpenSea,  you'd use Face, you'd use Instagram,  you'd use your Novi Wallet.  So that's-  So you're linking-  It's just a way to make money.  It's a way to make money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's NFTs in the metaverse too, right?  Okay.  So that's what he wants.  Okay.  But by the way, Zuckerberg spoke by video  at South by Southwest.  I saw basically no discussion of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sounds riveting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's fewer people at South by Southwest.  I thank goodness have not been,  like there's just fewer South by news in general,  because I don't think there are many-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Surprisingly, you're right.  I mean, that would be in the years gone by,  that would have been a big story.  The last time-  He said something that people mocked about Ukraine.  South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got in a lot of trouble.  Did he?  No, I'm sorry.  Sarah Lacey, who interviewed him-  Oh, I remember that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because she kind of flirted with him.  I was there.  Oh boy.  She did not flirt with him.  Well, that was the-  No, she didn't.  Oh, that was the kind of story where she was-  Yeah, let me-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Making googly eyes.  The human sexism was showing.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But she also, this was early marketing times,  so she also just wasn't as tough on him  as people thought she should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah.  Twitter has-  That's where I met him.  NFT connection.  Now that I think about it,  if you're on the iOS app,  you can connect your crypto wallet  that has your NFTs displayed in it  and use that as your avatar, I believe.  Someone may want to fact check me though.  And Ms. Stacey, do you think Twitter  would have had a wallet if Mr. Dorsey was still there?  He was all into crypto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  You know, he-  That's an interesting question, man.  Very interesting question.  Well, but is that gonna compete with Stripe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I guess that makes sense.  Conflict of interest, whatever you want to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little disappointed, Google has announced Google I.O.  May 11th to 12th, and it will be online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Square, that's right, square, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Online, not-  Maybe online?  No, in person, online.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Join I.O., okay, I'm wrong.  I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that a seat mat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put that in your history books, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't cancel this thing.  Oh, wait a minute.  First I have to say the site used cookies.  Okay, got that.  Now I can close that.  Now I can read Join I.O. live from Shoreline and online.  Ah.  Oh.  Lovely.  I want to go to that.  Lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason, are you gonna go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we have to always figure out  who's got to use the real live ticket and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't be here that week,  I'll just tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where are you gonna be May 11th and 12th?  I will be in Las Vegas.  Oh, doing an event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doing an event on the industrial I.O. team.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It won't let me into-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Y'all are very sweet.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what is this on the front at I.O. dot Google?  This is a clock.  But is it a game?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I thought that was the stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you how you tell the time with the clock.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ooh, it makes music too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So days, hours, minutes and seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone get went to down on the horn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the yellow one is hours,  the blue one is days.  The little tiny dots have to be days.  Pink dots are minutes.  Well, no, there's a color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if it's actually counting.  Oh, there is a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Count the outside circle.  Are there 55 with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, one.  That's a lot to count, ma'am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two, wait a minute.  Oh, geez.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, dude's day.  There are 18 hours.  Look, I just counted the 18 hours.  Y'all are fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why did you screw it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There, it's back the way it was.  So why, when I click the dot, does it all?  See, they do this.  They have a puzzle, right?  For Google I own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would they ever get hired at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mind doesn't work that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you would be a great quality assurance tester.  Yeah, like what the hell is this?  You're breaking things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, anyway, I guess we'll cover that.  We'll do the keynote May 11th  and we'll send somebody, probably Jeff and Jason.  I'm thinking, maybe you too, Ant, if we get enough tickets.  I'd love to go down there.  It's fun to go.  It's really fun to go.  You haven't been to Idaho, probably.  Haven't been to Idaho.  Yeah, you should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Iowa's really great.  People are really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went to one of the extensions down here  several years ago in San Francisco,  but never like on campus in Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I were using Vimeo,  I'd be a little perturbed right now.  Vimeo, which is owned by IAC, right?  Barry Diller's IAC, which is a big Hollywood agency.  Now owns Time Inc. and Meredith.  Oh, that's right.  They shut down those magazines.  Apparently, Money Crunch, don't know.  They're gonna start charging people more  for Vimeo hosting.  This is an article from The Verge quoting Lois van Barrel,  a digital artist from the Netherlands  who joined Vimeo 13 years ago,  has a number of videos up there.  She says, I was already paying $200 a year,  which I think is pretty expensive,  but I thought, well, it's a quality platform.  She had 117 subscriber-only videos so far.  She uses it for her subscriber-only Patreon content.  Each one only gets around 150 views on average,  her most viewed video had 815 views,  so not driving a lot of traffic.  She got a notice from Vimeo on March 11th  saying her bandwidth usage  was within the top 1% of Vimeo users.  Doesn't reflect very well on Vimeo.  That scared me.  And if she wanted to keep hosting her content on the site,  she'd have to upgrade to a custom plan.  Her quoted price, $3,500 a year,  but worse, she was only given a week to either pay for it,  decrease her bandwidth usage, or leave Vimeo.  Do you know how many independent filmmakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are out there using Vimeo?  Absolutely.  It's a ton of them, of high quality content.  Because it's the best quality.  Yeah, and they're getting,  I'm sure they're getting way more  than a couple hundred views a month.  You think they're paying thousands of dollars  a month to Vimeo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Vimeo's actually deleting files.  Channel 5, a popular account,  doing man on the street style interviews,  got this message in January,  in a post on Patreon titled,  Vimeo is holding our catalog hostage.  That's crazy.  Channel 5 creators say that on returning from a trip,  they saw their videos disappearing from the Patreon feed,  resulting in hundreds of angry messages,  and the loss of more than 500 subscribers.  The quote from Vimeo for their new custom plan,  $7,000 a year, and you either upgrade or you move it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vimeo is definitely gonna be spun off by IAC,  which might explain part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They wanna make it worth something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't see any other comment from Vimeo  regarding the percentage.  What did they say she was in the top 1%?  Yeah.  There's no way.  800 views is not a lot of views  when there's a ton of different.  Well, I think there's thousands of accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that have been abandoned  for years and years and years and years.  And still getting a ton of views.  Oh, yeah, I have videos there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if my Vimeos are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go check.  This partly comes from the fact  that Vimeo is pivoting away from the perception  that they are kind of an independent YouTube alternative.  What they really wanna be is a B2B solution  for businesses to post their videos.  One of the CEO of Vimeo, Anjali Sood,  said back in February,  today we are a technology platform,  not a viewing destination.  We're a B2B solution, not the indie version of YouTube.  So that's the problem.  It's just kind of,  Vimeo has changed from what it was to something else.  And actually, I've seen this coming for a while.  That's fine to pivot,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but something's not right with those numbers.  At least not with that quote, I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my video's still on Vimeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many views?  Nobody's watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I said nobody go watch it.  Only 845.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but that puts you in the top 1%.  You're in the top 1% then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because I only have one video there.  I have one video.  It's been there six years and only 845 views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now you've got me wondering.  Let me just log in real quickly and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you've got me wondering.  I can add.  See, it really does look like B2B.  Add team members, modern tools for modern businesses.  Here is a video I posted five years ago  called Segwaying.  Let me see how many views.  Wait a minute.  Oh, you've gotta hit the banner.  Oh, I hate these things.  Go away.  Go away.  It's new and improved.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, that looks like B2B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, look at you in that 120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Boom, fancy.  Boom.  I remember this.  If you like it slow.  Do you still have it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you still have your Segway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the battery's died.  I gotta get new batteries.  If anybody knows how to get new batteries,  going from slow to fast,  this is a time lapse through the streets of London.  Look at that.  I mean, I don't, where do you see  how many views you've got?  Video actions, got it, got it, got it.  How do I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a nice video, sir.  Hyperlapse.  That's kinda cool, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was when Hyperlapse first came out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ina Fried says that Google I.O. is gonna be,  press is gonna be online.  Oh, man.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Oh, let's pan it then.  So I was in a double-decker bus right in the front,  and I put, and I had Hyperlapse from,  it was Facebook, right, or Instagram, I can't remember.  I think it was, no, I think it was Facebook.  Facebook, and I plastered the phone up against the window,  and then we got to drive through rush hour  in a double-decker bus.  It's so smooth.  Look at the cyclist.  Well, that was what's cool about Hyperlapse, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at all those people on the street.  I can't, I can't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God, they're not wearing masks.  Run!  This is 28 days later.  Look at all the lighting cabs, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Looks no different from Manhattan

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and all those people on the streets.  I figured some, you know, 100 years from now,  this will be on some site, you know, on Mars,  and they'll say, we've got a 4K copy of London in the 1850s.  So I don't see where you see how many people.  Yeah, no, your view count's not showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my view count shows.  My screen did not look like this screen at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where does yours show up, though?  They've already converted you to the B2B platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm, you know, I might actually pay for this.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Wait a minute, no, no, wait a minute.  It says come back to Vimeo Plus and save 25%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My, here, I can't share my, can I share my screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, don't share your screen, but just where is it?  I don't, like, here's when we moved into the brick house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So mine is right beneath my name as the creator.  I get the triangle play sign and it says 845.  I get the hearts and the collections and the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is before we moved in, in 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been trying to figure out where  the daggum brick house was,  and Mr. Howell just told me today.  Oh, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking, I was way off on,  I thought it was like on Boulevard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look how bad this looked.  We really fixed it up.  There's our, there's our Roger Ambrose, our set designer,  and Jim and the builders.  Yeah, that was fun.  Memories.  Memories.  That was the basement.  That's the basement.  So I don't know why I don't see,  maybe I have like some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're on the B2B point.  You know what I said on top to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can send you a link.  Oh, you know what?  I'm not logged into my platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, if you log in, you don't see.  Here.  That seems odd.  That's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should see it if anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway.  Maybe if you log out.  Oh, look, Mashed Potato found me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mashed Potato found you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, my three Vimeo videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mashed Potato found you.  I don't know.  I don't know what that means.  I have zero views.  In the chat room.  I have zero views.  That's why.  I have zero.  It says zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is there a lock next to the segue one?  Did you just put it there as backup?  Oh, it's private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's private.  That's why.  Oh, well, I guess I shouldn't have showed that.  I probably didn't have permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you need to, you could show mine and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still don't see your view count.  I'm looking at yours right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Stacey.  Okay, let me see.  Stacey's Vimeo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, I'm trying to go to,  I'm not logged in either.  I searched for Leo's London video,  and I can't scroll up to see how many views it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't know.  It doesn't.  Vimeo is changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to click on a video to click.  So if you click on that video, scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yours looks really, no, I'm scrolled all the way down.  Scroll looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't.  No, it's not showing it.  Oh, that is so weird.  That's not even what mine looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm not logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's not how you spell Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just taking.  That's how you spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I made this account.  I should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's fake, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Anastasia W.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So apparently, according to a Mime artist in the chat room.  No, Leo's Tour says 27 views.  Okay, we'll take your word for it.  That's probably about right.  Because we know, yeah, I mean, that was a long time ago.  I don't ever publicize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also put it on YouTube, I would imagine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.  You did.  I saw it on YouTube originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, let's take a little break  because I want to tell people who are going back to work,  it's going to be okay.  It's now the whole thing is hybrid work, right?  Some of you are in the office.  We had a lot of people in office today  because it was Wednesday lunch day, which was really nice.  But there's still a lot of people who don't want to come in  and want to stay home.  And that's the future of work,  I think is this kind of hybrid thing.  But that means your conference rooms  have to be kind of considering this.  And audio is a big deal.  If some of the people are at home,  some of the people are at work,  everybody needs to be heard clearly.  You don't want people straining,  you don't want them shouting,  but you also want them to be comfortable.  You want to be able to move around.  That's why you want an ARAVA.  Many people with their conference rooms,  they go, just, you know, I guess,  if you don't think about it,  oh, we got to go get the audio visual company in  and they're going to measure,  they're going to do sound tests,  they're going to run wires,  we're going to have microphones,  we're going to have speakers,  we're going to have all kinds of DSPs and stuff,  and it's going to cost a lot of money,  and they're going to have to come in  and tweak it every once in a while.  That's expensive.  The industry has changed, things are changing.  And the best thing that's happened  to conference room audio is Nureva, N-U-R-E-V-A,  with their patented microphone mist technology.  Nureva makes it very simple.  You just put in a, what looks like a sound bar.  It's a speaker, it's got some integrated microphones,  but it fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones  using computational audio.  So there are no dead zones.  Everyone can be heard clearly,  no matter where they're facing,  no matter where they're standing,  and you don't have to have a technician  come and calibrate it.  In fact, you can install this yourself  for a really big room, put a couple of speaker bars in.  Meeting participants, class participants,  you can talk and move naturally in the space,  and the people who aren't there  won't be second-class citizens.  They'll be able to hear exactly what's going on.  And by the way, it's continuously calibrating.  So they're always ready with optimized audio.  You don't need an outside technician.  Your IT department can handle it.  Your IT department will love this  because they don't have to go from room to room.  With the Nurevas, you'll get a Nureva console,  which means IT can monitor, manage,  and adjust the systems from anywhere,  no matter how many rooms you have.  Nureva's installation is simple, a 30-minute DIY job.  If you can hang up a sound bar, you can install a Nureva.  So you're gonna save on installation,  you're gonna save on cost, you're gonna save on maintenance,  and you're gonna love the quality you get  with this microphone mist technology.  So really, ask yourself before you just do the obvious,  instead of going with that costly,  complicated traditional system,  make the leap to simple to economical Nureva.  It actually works better.  Great audio simplified, N-U-R-E-V-A, nureva.com.  In fact, they even invite you on the webpage.  Compare us to the competition, please.  Nureva, this is a perfect example of Silicon Valley  finding a better way to do something.  And I know it's a little inertia.  We gotta get people to try it, but I think if you do,  you'll realize how much better it is, nureva.com.  Thank you, Nureva, for supporting this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  May I add in?  Yes.  So I've had to be teaching the first seven weeks so far,  hybrid, as some of the students are coming in by video.  How's that been?  It is hard, I wish I had Nureva.  Because we've got an expensive little pod.  Yeah, I hate this.  Yeah, I hate this.  And so trying to, and students are in the back,  because we're trying to stay distant,  and try to be heard by the people on the video.  It's hard, and I also came to a faculty meeting by video,  half the faculty were there and half weren't.  I really came to appreciate the difficulty of the students,  because the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you know how hard it is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's just boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you using it like a polycom in the middle of the table?  Basically, not even in front of the room, yeah.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the way to do it.  Yes.  I didn't realize this, Google yesterday had a big event.  If I had known, we would have covered it,  although Paul said it was kind of boring.  It was their stadia.  He's a Microsoft guy, so.  Well, he said it was very kind of-  Stadia.  Oh, stadia, yeah.  It was the Google for Games Developer Summit,  and it was kind of stiff,  but one thing Google did announce,  which is kind of interesting,  is they really wanted white label it for other companies.  So stadia, which you probably are familiar with,  is Google's streaming gaming service.  And it's, you know, it doesn't compete well,  I think, with Microsoft's offering or Nvidia's offering,  because you have to buy the game, full retail price,  but you never own it.  You buy it, 60 bucks, but it's sitting on their servers,  and if you're not a stadia subscriber,  you lose access to it.  So that's, I think, a little annoying.  It does work well.  The backend technology is good,  especially if you have this special stadia controller,  which uses Wi-Fi direct, so it doesn't have latency,  or not as much latency.  And so it's a better way to-  Yeah, okay, that's better.  Yeah, it's a better way to play.  So this year, Google's gonna let any,  so there'll be some changes here.  They're gonna have white label partners.  In fact, AT&T is the first one.  So AT&T is gonna have games that they offer  to their customers on their phones using the stadia backend,  but it'll be white labeled.  It won't say Google, it won't say stadia,  or might in little letters, I don't know,  but it's an AT&T product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought this sounded familiar.  This was reported back in February of this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, the white label, yeah, yeah.  They also will let any stadia game developer offer  an instantly accessible free trial of the game,  and you don't even need a stadia account to play it.  So you click on YouTube, or a search ad, or social media,  and you can play the game.  This was something like that, that they promised  they're finally getting around to doing.  People will be able to browse the stadia store  for those trials too,  so you'll be able to find free games or free trials.  Even if you don't have a stadia account,  you can browse the store.  This is really interesting.  They're gonna offer a tool, or a number of tools,  like DXVK, which will let developers port games written  with Unreal, Engine, or Unity to stadia.  So that's a very big deal for developers,  because they don't want to write a second kind of version  of the game if they can avoid it.  So it's really, they're really pitching developers,  and I think that that's, you gotta get them  before you can get the gamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, there you have it.  I still get emails about my free monthly game,  or whatever it is.  I think I have stadia, but I...  I don't have it anymore.  I just logged in, just to confirm that I don't have it,  and it says, yeah, get stadia pro.  Right, so maybe I don't, maybe I cancel.  Yeah, sounds like it's exciting, you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the appropriate response to stadia  from everybody, I think.  It's too bad, I really wanted it to work,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because as a Mac user, and a Linux user,  a lot of games are not ported to those platforms.  To be able to play PC games in the browser is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have one person that seems to be standing behind,  and he's a Twig listener, Mr. Leo, not Laporte,  but he totally digs the stadia experience  with his phone and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a great idea, it's a great idea.  Meta told workers on Friday,  you're gonna have to do your own laundry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's my violin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I feel for these people,  because it always sucks when someone takes away  a cool privilege, but it's kind of like people  who are like 28 complaining that their family  took them off their Netflix or phone thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's just more dastardly than that.  Oh, gosh.  They are starting dinner at 6.30,  but the last bus is six or some such thing.  Yeah, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently there were complaints that people  were packing up big to-go boxes and running after the bus.  Run!  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I totally see people doing.  Of course.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Giving away the meal, I don't wanna stick around work  to eat it, so thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I worked at Time Inc, though, many years ago,  they used to have dinner on closing nights,  because people would work through the night,  and we were all macho.  Yeah.  And you'd also get a dark car home after a certain hour.  Yeah.  So people would wait as long as they could,  stretch out every edit, drink as,  they also stocked the editor's offices with news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had a bar cart.  I think it's important that people know that Time Inc.  had a bar cart that roved around the offices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, Time Magazine,  because they were higher class than we were,  people, they just stocked the editor's credenzas.  The editors had credenzas.  It seems so counterproductive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like my old IT department.  I missed the bar cart by a year.  By a year, y'all.  It just seems like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  do you really want your writers to be drunk?  Oh, damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's this whole mythology about drunk writers.  Thank you, Drew Micapote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, drunk editors at Time Inc.  It just seemed like-  They would go to dinner at the steakhouse,  and then come back,  and you did not want your copy edited,  then you did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who wants to even work when they're drunk?  And creamer TV lunch came from somewhere.  I don't understand the appeal of it.  At all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had a guy who had a serious bad breakdown  on the 29th floor.  He threw his chair out the window,  broke the window,  the time-by-building. What?  Luckily, it was over another building sitting below.  Yikes.  Drew his A-tex terminal out,  which dangled by the wires.  What?  Was taken to the ER,  and then into- The loony bin.  The detox tank, right?  And guess what the editors did,  who came back- They brought him a bottle.  They drank,  and they said, well, I gotta have a drink.  Wow.  This is what I'm writing about now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently, at Microsoft,  they call it the Balmer Peak.  This is from XKCD number three, two, three.  This is a graph of blood alcohol concentration.  Right between .12 and .16,  there is a peak in programming skill  that cannot be achieved any other way.  Called the Balmer Peak,  it was discovered by Microsoft in the late 80s.  The cause is unknown,  but somehow a blood alcohol content  between .129% and .138%  confers superhuman programming ability.  However, it's a delicate effect,  requiring careful calibration.  You can't just give a team of coders  a year's supply of whiskey  and tell them to get cracking.  Has that ever happened?  Remember Windows ME?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I knew it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, this may be apocryphal.  Google employees are unhappy.  Well, they're unhappy too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook employees are unhappy  and Google employees are unhappy  and nobody in the country is gonna care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With pay, promotions and execution.  They're getting killed?  Yes.  I would prefer to be hanged if you don't mind.  In the annual Google Geist survey,  Google workers gave their employer  particularly poor marks,  according to CNBC,  on how compensation compares to pay  for similar jobs at other companies.  This is just a trend worldwide,  this AP work trend,  the great resignation.  It's not just Google.  Oh yeah.  But you know, a lot of it is because of inflation  and housing prices in the Bay Area are insane.  So it doesn't matter how much you make,  you can't afford a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I gotta tell you,  I appreciate y'all buying lunch today here at Twit.  Does mean a lot, sir.  Because boy, everything is so much more expensive right now.  It is, especially gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  46% of survey respondents said  their total compensation is competitive  compared to similar jobs at other companies.  That's 12% down though.  46% is fewer than half.  56% say their pay is fair and equitable.  That's a drop in eight points.  64% of employees said their performance  is reflected in their pay.  That they work as hard as they are paid.  My performance is reflected in their pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually work very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure they do.  A Google spokesperson said,  we know our employees have many choices  about where they work.  So we ensure they're very well compensated.  It's a lot cheaper to keep an employee happy  than it is to train a new one.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  I think this might just be a general cultural phenomenon  as much as a Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also, dare I say it, generational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You sound like a boomer.  Hold on, what makes you say it's generational?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, boomer.  Let's see what it is.  I knew I was gonna get crap for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she just leaves.  She says he left.  She says I'm out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, sorry.  No, I was reacting.  I just had to let my dog out.  So my reaction was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what you call it when you scream into the pillow?  You're letting your dog out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interpreted.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be generational only in the sense  that people who are younger and recognize  that they're not gonna get to the point  that basically all of this is BS.  When you wake up and realize that,  why would you keep this job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, and put yourself in their shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't even have houses yet, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can't get houses  because the housing prices are insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It blew my mind to see the RVs.  The first time I went to the Google campus-  People living in the parking lot.  They're in the dad gum parking lot.  Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All around Palo Alto.  On El Camino Real, there's campers, both sides, up and down.  Palo Alto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went there to meet a friend that loves Twit.  And I thought I was in the wrong spot  because of all the RVs in the parking lot.  It's like, this can't be Google.  He's like, yeah, this is where people live  because it's cheaper to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to get your eyes opened.  Follow Reddit's anti-work subreddit, slash our,  slash anti-eats work.  Yeah, I mean, it's just-  Anti-work.  Anti-work.  Okay, don't just say it, anti-eats work.  Here's a tweet from Burger King.  You're beautiful, you're loved, you matter, don't forget it.  And then from a response from low voter turnout,  you pay people $8 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McDonald's near me pays $16 an hour.  Even my daughter's looked at that and going,  yeah, maybe I'll work there.  I was like, you're going to smell like french fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she's like, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's,  maybe it's generational in the sense that this generation  got a raw deal, but also because our generation,  Jeff and my generation were able to work jobs  and get paid enough to buy a home and build a family  and send the kids to college.  And now we're sticking around and not retiring  and we're not making any room for the people who follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, and then you've created policies  and you vote against any sort of affordable housing or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like I see the people here where I live.  Okay, there's that.  Okay, there's that.  And yeah, I took out loans in college,  but it was a total of $16,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you're like,  it's a total of $16,000.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to say you still work  just as hard as everybody else did.  It's not a function of-  But I see there's other things in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But these people are working hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're working even harder.  They're just not getting anywhere.  And they're not getting as much.  There's other things in play.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, it doesn't even, at that point,  you look around and you're like,  why am I working so hard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Screw it.  Meanwhile, Google's sponsoring F1, the McLaren cars.  Ooh, that's some money.  Look at that.  Ooh, look at that car.  And look at it.  Look at the hubcaps.  The wheels have chrome hubcaps, the chrome colors.  They'll show that to the Google employees, though.  Official partner of the McLaren Formula One team  and the McLaren Extreme E team,  which is their electric F1.  Ooh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all the computing inside the F1.  Google could bring, plus they're going to get it.  Hopefully they push that team onto GCP  and they'll get like all sorts of cool things.  What's GCP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Compute.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're a cloud.  McLaren Racing.  Is that Daniel?  Daniel Ricciardo and Lance.  Stroll.  I'm sorry, Lando Norris.  Oh.  Not Lance Stroll.  Lance Stroll has got his own money.  Daniel Ricciardo, who's great.  Lando Norris is great.  So, that'll be fun, watching McLaren race with the,  I love the hubcaps or whatever they call those.  I love that.  There's no caps, just hubs.  Put some LEDs on those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be amazing too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I wonder how they do it so that if it spins,  it stays a solid color.  I wonder, hmm, that's interesting.  That's a photograph, sir.  Oh, it's a picture.  It's a photograph, sir.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  I hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they do that?  Let's talk about deep fakes.  That car isn't moving.  How do they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it looks like it's moving.  That's called a great pan with an awesome shutter speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I feel like there may be,  they will do something with those,  yeah, you're right, not hubcaps,  but those hubs to make it look like it's standing still.  Well, if they're going fast enough, I guess it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where the answer comes in so handy,  because he could have said,  You dope.  It's a photo dummy.  You dope.  But he said,  You've done, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, let's, oh, by the way,  congratulations to Pete Davidson.  Finally found a way to get away from Kanye.  He's going up in Blue Origin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worst move ever,  because now Kanye can say,  Hey, he ain't even on the planet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course, this is in the,  kind of sort of into space.  Marty Allen will go on March 23rd.  Isn't that a comedian from the old days?  No, that can't be that Marty Allen with the frizzy hair.  That's who I thought too,  but then I realized he must be a hundred.  It couldn't be that Marty Allen.  Must be.  You just squirreled that quickly.  Wait a second.  This guy?  This guy?  That guy?  Yeah, Marty Allen.  There's gotta be some good video on Marty Allen.  Not only dead,  but his hair isn't as good as it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, Stacey.  Oh man, that picture.  Ooh, ouch.  It was literally 10 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not make fun of this fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  It was literally 10 seconds,  and you squirreled into another subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Marty Allen.  Well, who is Marty Allen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he mentioned Marty Allen.  Who is he?  And we both said,  we old farts said it can't be our Marty Allen.  Can't be that.  And he's blue, he's Blue Origin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's with Blue Origin.  Is he?  No, the only Marty Allen I could find on Google  is the fuzzy haired member of the popular 1960 comedy.  Yeah, with Steve Rossi.  Allen and Rossi.  He died in Vegas at the age of 95.  In 2018.  So I don't know who Marty Allen is.  It'd be funny if you had two comedians up there.  But it's not that one.  It's not enough room.  Husband and wife duo Sharon and Mark Hagel,  Jim Kitchen and George Neal.  I think these are the people paying.  I think these are the paying guys.  So Jeff Bezos will not be with them.  Do you have to make it public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if I decided to spend all my money  and several inheritances going up into space,  would they have to say my name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if you're Pete Davidson, yes.  Because that's the whole reason he's getting to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The last time I checked, I am definitely not Pete Davidson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank goodness.  So here's Marty Allen.  His hair is completely normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boomers must go after him all day.  He's boomer age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He totally missed out.  Marty Allen is a turnaround CEO and angel investor.  He was the CEO of Party America.  There you go.  There you go.  What do the others do?  Pete Davidson joined the cast of Saturday Night Live  in 2014. I knew that.  Sharon Hagel founded Space Kids Global.  Husband Mark Hagel, President and CEO  of Tricor International, real estate development company.  Jim Kitchen, teacher, entrepreneur and world explorer  who has visited all 193 UN recognized countries.  And he's a space dreamer.  University of North Carolina's  Kenan Flagler Business School.  And Dr. George Neeld is president  of Commercial Space Technologies.  Former associate administrator for the FAA office  of Commercial Space Transportation, Space Guy.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should send a Space Force person up there  every now and then.  Just to get space force back.  You mean Steve Carell?  That'd be great if Steve Carell.  No, no, the actual guardians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got their own rockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't go up into space.  How cool would that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send their founder up, Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  They were creating space.  Okay, so I'm coming around on Space Force, y'all.  Are you?  You are?  I am.  So actually the Russian-Ukraine conflict shows  and also because I've been reading,  what's the title of this absolute downer of a paper,  it is the annual threat assessment  of the US Intelligence Committee  that was released earlier this month.  You have all the fun stuff, Stacy.  I know.  But-  Between Daddy and Sadoku over here.  The challenge is our satellite infrastructure  is so relevant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sadoku, sir to you.  Go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, Miss Stacy, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This happens all the time to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, I am sincerely trying to explain  the dangers of space.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just try talking about Gutenberg, Stacy,  and see how far you get.  I can speak from experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, we've already seen Russian interference  with satellite communications.  The satellite communications are not just key for mapping,  but they're actually becoming control items  in lots of, ready, the IoT.  So having in China and Russia,  both have well-defined satellite space programs  and they're creating missiles and infrastructure  that legitimately are targeted towards space.  So if we have an international conflict,  it is fair to say that our infrastructure in space  will be attacked and we should think of ways to fix that.  So that's why Space Force becomes actually relevant.  Now, I don't know if their current Space Force  is being trained with the skill sets.  We would need to counteract this,  but that's why I'm coming around on Space Force.  That is all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Hermione.  Hermione Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Higginbotham, wow.  That's a good name.  That beats, yeah, I think that's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another one for Hermione.  PSY-5, S-I-F-I-V-E, raises $175 million.  They want to do RISC-5 chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really exciting.  Y'all don't really,  you can't have two Stacy excitements back to back.  Yes, we can.  You can't just delete the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Explain to us what RISC-5 is one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  RISC-5 is an open source ISA instruction set for chips.  So it competes with like Intel's x86 instruction set  or the ARM instruction set.  This is how chips,  it's the operating system for chips basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is how you should think of it.  And PSY-5 makes chips.  They're a foundry that makes chips based on the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not a foundry.  Oh, they're not.  PSY-5 is a company that is basically like the ARM  of RISC-5.  Oh, so they take the RISC-5 designs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and then they make more designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, and they make more designs and they've tested them.  You don't need to use PSY-5  because RISC-5 is open source,  but they just make it easier, much like ARM does.  So that's how you should think.  So they license their ARM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they build bigger SOCs and things like that,  more capabilities and stuff like that.  Okay.  And then somebody else's foundry, I guess,  who makes these?  Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can send it to TSMC, you can send it to Google.  Any foundry will make your RISC-5.  So this is really exciting because RISC-5,  I mean, I feel like it's been a sleeper hit since 2014,  but that's just me.  But people are really realizing it now  and it's getting a huge boost from the ARM-NVIDIA deal.  When that was announced, everybody was like,  oh crap, if NVIDIA buys ARM,  we're gonna need an alternative architecture.  Let's check out RISC-5.  And then a lot of people started designing  and playing with it and they were like,  same half bad, let's keep using it.  So this is a really good, this is a huge series.  It's like a series E round for them.  It's a lot of fricking money,  but they're trying to go be the next ARM.  So and Intel is back them, AMD is backing them.  Like this is really a big deal in the chip.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Intel is gonna be a RISC-5 foundry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  In fact, they're one of the creators of RISC-5.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With all those competitors backing the same thing,  even though it's open,  is there any kind of antitrust consideration at all?  Is it a closed one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If PSI-5, the way it could be construed as antitrust  down the road is if only the PSI-5 versions  get software support,  but right now the software that runs on top of it,  Intel and ARM don't really have a big foothold in that.  Like if they owned Linux, then we might be worried.  But because someone can always come out  and make their own RISC-5 chips and people already are,  it's not as big of a risk.  Does that make sense?  If you saw PSI-5 go in and buy Red Hat,  that might be, well, nobody uses Red Hat.  Pick something that people use.  Oh, people use Red Hat.  People use Red Hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of people use Red Hat.  Okay.  A sponsor once in a while, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, right.  That's not why I've said that.  No.  No, I just, I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have good sense to be a sponsor,  and so we might have to give them credit for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So that's the Stacey nerd talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good.  Thank you.  Anyway, and that's why I bookmarked it.  I thought that would be a good story for you.  And now a story for Jeff Jarvis.  I'm really mad at the New York Times for saying  Ben and Justin Smith  named Gina Chua as executive editor.  So first of all, congratulations,  Gina Chua, executive editor at Reuters.  She's, I think, 61, 60.  Previously editor in chief  of the South China Morning Post.  This is that weird startup.  Nobody knows what Ben and Justin are doing.  But they're not related.  They have the same name.  The New York Times, which used to call people things  like Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith,  for some reason have decided to make them a couple.  Ben and Justin Smith.  That is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is funny.  Is it just, am I the only one who noticed that?  I thought that is.  Ben, just for the background,  Ben was the editor of BuzzFeed News  and then became media columnist in the New York Times.  Justin Smith was the founder of The Week magazine in the US,  head of the Atlantic,  founder there with the people who started the courts,  and then head of Bloomberg Media.  And the two Smiths went off to start a new media venture  to serve everybody who speaks English in the world,  but they said nothing more about it.  We all don't know what it really is gonna be.  So I'll be talking,  I'm having Justin come talk to our management students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, now they have a little bit to chew on  because Gina Chua is a very big name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina is brilliant.  I know Gina.  And I think this is important too.  Gina is trans.  And to have a trans person that high up in news and media  is part of the diversity we have to seek out.  And I'm glad for that.  I think it's gonna make a difference.  Yeah, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they used Ben and Justin Smith  as a headline, kind of like headlinies.  Because you have limited space in a headline.  I'm just thinking of ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could have said Smith and Smith.  Everybody's been making Smith and Smith.  It's just a very strange thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I get it.  Pretty soon they're gonna be calling it, you know,  Beniston.  Are they married?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're-  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They even threw it over another line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't even fit with the headline.  It doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a very strange, somebody-  The Smiths.  Somebody, the Smiths, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Smiths.  Or Smiths Squared.  Smiths Squared.  Is the other reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It happened to me,  I accidentally attended a Crypto Bro dinner.  It's very gargoyant. Alex Krueger.  I love the gargoyant.  At a Miami event, I found myself surrounded by a cult,  obsessed with minting bananas and trading ETH.  Does it all mean anything?  I just like the title.  I don't know if there's anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I came to the dinner,  I was wearing shorts, was kicked out,  came back and then had that moment of realization  when you realized, oh no, I'm surrounded by them.  Oh no.  They're everywhere.  Given Stacey's reaction last week to my suggestion  that we should talk about crypto more,  Nice work.  This is her nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a weird one.  Board Apes and Crypto Punks are merging.  Yuga Labs, the NFT company behind the Board Apes Yacht Club  acquired the rights to Crypto Punks  and MiBits collections from Larva Labs.  These are the world's most valuable NFT collections.  Yuga now controls NFTs with around 5.5 billion in market cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yikes.  B-billions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  B-b-b-b-billions.  Unbelievable.  Yuga Labs says it plans to open up the IP rights  of individual Crypto Punks to their owners.  That's, I guess, how Board Apes works.  I don't even understand what that means.  Apparently there was a conflict  between the Crypto Punk community and Larva Labs  which hadn't been willing to take such a step.  So, NFT marriage made in heaven.  Board Apes and Crypto Punks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just be the next to the last person holding the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty much how it works.  I am the penultimate bag holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just be next to the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, geez, don't want to be the last one,  that's for sure, yeah.  Do you want the remote-controlled cookie store  as long as we're on ACCO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I put this here, this is stupid.  I put it here because it's so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a smile. Oh, it's so cute.  Is that a Waymo?  Looks like one of those Waymo cars.  It's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the giant robot, the robot who roams  around the Philadelphia stores,  plus a smaller wagon robot.  It's got two faces.  It's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  It's from a company called...  Put it there for you, Stacey.  It's very cute.  Make you happy.  It's very cute.  It's from a company called Tortis.  They're steered by operators, though.  They're not autonomous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big trend in robots, by the way.  When you see a robot,  you might be having a person operating behind it.  This is a big thing in autonomy.  So when people say this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have to walk behind it,  or do you have to sit in an office with a steering wheel?  Yeah, that's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of them are office-controlled.  And they have...  You can do drones.  So it's like watching a drone.  Do bombs thousands of miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can deliver cookies.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So I want to know who was driving this drone in Shanghai  that drove straight into wet cement and got stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, poor drone.  Oops.  Wait, tell me about the cookie robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it deliver cookies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Retailers can use the Tortis Mobile Smart Store  to deliver whatever you want.  Chocolates, AirPods, knee socks.  I don't know why those...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is this like...  This is actually a really interesting way,  because for some, like in some areas, not all areas,  if I like said like, oh, I need this,  and enough of my neighbors got together and needed it,  maybe it could deliver it to our area  in a cost-effective way by consolidating everything.  Here's an interesting thing.  Like Imperfect Foods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're being used right now by 18 retailers  in the US and Europe,  but they're all being driven by humans  in the remote operations center in Mexico City,  where Tortis...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, why not, right?  People who encounter the robots can tap their credit card.  This is from the story in Axios.  Open the lid and take a box of cookies  or AirPods or sweat socks.  Remote operators watch and listen  as the transaction takes place.  The merchants don't pay for the robots.  They just give them 10% of the gross sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I have the socks you're gonna want.  It sounds like a sweet gig.  They're like 151.  These are the socks or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, how do they prove that they've paid?  Tap a credit card card.  It won't even open until you tap the card.  It won't open until you tap it.  Is everything in its own bin?  They must have some sort of sensor.  If I pay for a cookie and I grab AirPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Amazon store all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's interesting is...  Good point.  The co-founder, Dmitry Shevchenko,  who was the Uber's micro-mobility guy,  said people spend more on these things.  People are buying a $35 pastry box  when previously the most they've ever spent  at a vending machine is maybe $4.  They're spending more than they would at a vending machine.  Unbelievable.  The 18 merchants on board so far, Go Grocer,  convenience stores in Chicago, Lady Chocolat,  a confectionary in Los Angeles, and Edith's,  which sells what it calls Jewish comfort food  in Brooklyn, New York.  If somebody came up to me with a bagel and schmear...  You're in.  You're in.  Bake some.  I do it for chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna beat that.  I'm gonna put in the chat here, the oyster vending machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now see, that's a bad idea, because oysters...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's dodgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go take a look.  The oyster vending machine, right there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you mean, right there, right where?  In the chat.  Oh, in our chat room.  Look at that, look at you getting all fancy.  Wow.  It's a French vending machine that spits out fresh oysters.  Don't say spits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't say that.  Shucks out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, and Calvin Trillin, who's a writer I admire greatly,  worked for the New York Times for years,  New York magazine, New Yorker for years.  The New Yorker.  Writing about food.  He covered great food stuff.  Alice Let's Eat is one of my favorite books ever,  and he covered once an oyster festival  in somewhere in New England.  And he said the firemen in the oyster festival  was always held at the firehouse.  Used to like to get people crazy,  because they would tell people that the real way  you eat oysters is to snort them up your nose,  which to a non-oaster eater makes as much sense as eating.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes the first place.  Ew.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ew.  Ew.  So, this actually, this is actually quite a good story  you came up with here, the oyster vending machine.  All of the oysters are sold unshucked.  Some shucking is involved.  Shellfish fans can also purchase oysters in advance via text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it just sits there, the picture's not good,  it just sits there on the street.  Well, the-  You drive up to it.  Yeah, the problem was-  It's not like in a mall or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the problem was that the store that sold these,  people would always come when they were closed,  because people sometimes need oysters  in the middle of the night, I guess.  So they just, so they actually got this themselves.  It's the viagra of food, after all.  The owner, Tony Bertolo, explains,  people always arrive when the shop door is closed,  which is frustrating for customers and for us.  So, we looked at the systems,  we looked at what was being done in agriculture,  because there are many distributors in the countryside  who contacted the manufacturer who responded  to feed the machine for oysters,  since it is a particular product,  it is not very restrictive, but requires some adjustments.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eight dollars a dozen oysters, not bad, that's good.  We need that out of here, we got a great oyster.  We got hog island every night.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it open only in months with ours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem, so now you can get it in December.  No, that's not months with ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Socks, Leo, 151 socks.  I found the socks that should go in the thing.  The socks, point sized-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm giving you one of mine in room.  Point sized socks.  Point sized?  You mean like the pencil,  pushers, lettering department.  Oh, I get it, 72 points, 60 point, 40 point,  like font points.  That's cool.  Oh look, and they also have tool bars.  Yeah, they have a tool bar and they have a CMYK too.  That's cool.  CMYK socks, and if you want to buy a pencil  that says keep on pushing, all types are welcome.  Give it out to Maternity Ward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What store is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the pstypelab.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually sell, I think, fonts, but,  aren't those cool, the CMYK socks?  Oh, look at those CMYK socks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, that's enough.  Dude, I have a size 14.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute, so many cool-  Socks don't come in sizes.  They all one size fits everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Small, medium, and large.  Bomba, no, not Bomba,  it's supposed to be the one that does the sizes.  There's another one that's like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's all they do is like,  oh, see, shocker sizes.  Light, regular, medium, and bold.  I like that.  That's a cool hat, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't put heavy on there.  Heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, let's press the button  that plays the music that begins-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google Change.  Neo's favorite part of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was perfect timing, y'all.  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Someone's deaf was asking if I could talk up an intro,  and I just wanted to show that I can.  Google details, its latest big Android feature drop.  This will be for next month, I guess.  Improvements to Google's keyboard, Gboard.  Google Photos and more.  Google Photos portrait blur feature  will soon be able to blur backgrounds  in a wider range of photos,  including pictures of pets, food, and plants.  Okay.  Okay.  Gboard's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Photos constantly insults me.  I just want everyone to know.  Why, what's it doing?  When you take a photo with your Google phone,  it always is like, pick a better shot.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you brush your hair?  What's going on?  Did you get a good night's sleep?  I figure you would appreciate that, aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, I mean-  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are subscribed to twit.tv slash hop,  also known as Hands On Photography, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aunt, it is the only how-to show  I think I've ever watched and picked up tips from.  Do you ever say, take a better photo, aunt, to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my goodness, people on the phone.  Yeah, does your camera-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, does your camera on your phone do that to you?  I need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be no, ma'am.  Every shot he takes is perfect.  Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time, it's like, pick a better shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pick a better shot.  We were trying to get some numbers off of a box  way up in the ceiling up there,  and Burke was standing up on this shelf behind us here,  and he was going like this with his camera,  and then he got a picture and they couldn't read it,  and he said, here, try this Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra  with its 100x zoom.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You found a use for the 100x?  Look at that.  Yes, and it looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can read the numbers.  That looks good.  Isn't that amazing?  And that was optical zoom.  Not optical zoom, that was digital zoom.  But it was able to really get in there.  Yeah, normally it looks like crap.  That's good.  That's magic.  So there you go.  And it said, take a better shot afterwards.  I don't know.  Outstanding.  Outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't say take, it's just like, pick a better shot.  Pick a better one.  And then it goes through all the possible-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You couldn't get a better shot.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Than that kitty cat.  That is a photo.  That is Paris.  Oh, she's a floppy.  She's a very cute cat.  So again, it's really handy with the pets to have a big zoom.  Because then otherwise, if I got that close to her,  she would-  She's been, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet she'd be gone.  No, you'd have more stitches on your face.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google Keyboard's grammar correction feature,  which has been exclusive to Pixel phones,  will start to come to other phones as well.  Great.  That's a good thing.  Google has also updated the Gboard emoji mashups,  2,000 additional emoji mashups.  So let's take two emojis and mush them together.  The live transcribed, which I love,  accessibility app, which will transcribe anything,  will now work offline.  So if you're in a subway or an airplane,  you still can get the live transcribed.  Kudos, kudos.  Yeah, really good.  A bunch of other stuff coming.  No release date yet,  but presumably sometime in the next couple of weeks,  since it is March.  Steam is coming to Chromebooks.  Steam, which is the number one gaming marketplace  on Windows, now because of the Steam Deck Linux.  You can even get it on the Mac,  but now it's on select Chromebooks.  You can't do it with every Chromebook.  You'll have to have enough hardware.  This is also part of the yesterday's  Game Developers Summit keynote.  So far, the Asus Chromebook CX9, very good, or Flip CX5.  Those, I think, are Kevin Toffle's favorite Chromebooks.  HP's Pro 6, C640, G2, and an unnamed Lenovo model.  You probably need at least an i5,  and it says seven gigabytes of RAM.  I don't know.  Seven?  Somewhere between six and eight, I don't know.  So that's interesting.  That's good.  That's good.  Hey, Google, pay for my parking.  Wouldn't you like to be able to do that?  Google announced Thursday a slew of new features  that rolled out through its latest software update.  I haven't tried this yet,  including the ability to pay for parking using your voice  through a partnership with ParkMobile.  You know, we've talked about this before.  It's really annoying.  Every jurisdiction has a different parking app,  so every time you want to park somewhere,  you gotta download an app.  So annoying.  So annoying.  I'd love to see this.  If I could just say, hey, pay my parking, that'd be great.  So this partnership with ParkMobile  is only for people using ParkMobile,  but the idea is Google would be adding partners over time.  Once you park in a spot, you say,  hey, you know who, pay for parking.  The assistant will prompt you to pay from your phone.  Google Pay handles the transaction.  No more coins, no more confusion, says Google.  Thank you, Google.  ParkMobile is the, according to ParkMobile,  leading app coordinating parking zones  across more than 400 cities.  Google's domain name register.  Did you know that Google had a domain name register?  It's actually a very good one.  Oh, yes, it's very good.  It's perhaps the lowest cost.  It has been in beta for the last seven years.  Okay.  It is now out of beta.  That's why I didn't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I envision 10 nervous employees.  Are they ever gonna let us out of beta?  I'm afraid to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was the best tweet about it.  They were like, and now prices will rise,  and in another year it will be deprecated out.  Right.  That is true.  The Google roadmap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google way.  I have not experienced this,  but maybe you have, Ant, some Google Pixel phones  cannot make contactless payments  after the March security patch.  No, it was only for the 12L folks.  Oh, 12L March feature drop.  So we didn't get 12L on our Pixel 6,  so maybe we're glad.  We're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Ant, let me ask you a question  since you're a Pixel 6 complainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, stop saying that.  I'm not a Pixel 6 complainer.  This is Android OS.  He's an Android 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I think I got the latest version  because it happens, right?  Right.  And I don't know whether this is me  or whether it's the towers around me,  but suddenly my connectivity at home  for my AT&T has gone to jeez.  Uh-oh.  Is that a known problem around?  That was the problem with the previous version of the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They supposedly patched it to fix connectivity issues.  Well, they patched it and screwed up mine, I think.  Grunt row.  Yep.  I wonder if you can do a rollback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't on Wi-Fi calling.  I had to switch to Wi-Fi calling  because I can't call my bloody phone at home.  Oh, wow.  And by the way, AT&T is town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Wonder if you can do a rollback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a thought since I don't even care.  The contactless payment issue was fixed  with a server side fix.  Google announced that on Pi Day,  which was day before yesterday.  Android's iOS-friendly emoji reactions  officially launch in major Google messages updates.  I still see people saying, when am I gonna get them?  When am I gonna get them?  But now when you use Apple's messages to react to a message,  you will have a similar reaction  instead of a text-based reaction on your Google messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So-and-so laughed at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So-and-so loved this message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get loved a lot.  Loved, loved.  Well, you know what it is anyway.  And wow, I don't know if this is anything to celebrate,  but Google has started integrating air raid alerts  into Android phones in Ukraine.  Kudos.  It was a service.  Kudos.  That seems helpful.  Oh yeah.  You get a red warning triangle icon  sent by Google Play Services.  I don't think you get the actual sound,  but you will be alerted by your phone  without installing an additional application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a lot of the cellular service has been staying up,  it would appear,  especially since a lot of people were sharing.  And by the way, did you see that Ukraine switched  to the European power grid in three weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, is that why they weren't brought down?  Wow.  Isn't that interesting?  Amazing.  Yeah.  Because the Russians had some years ago used, you know,  hacking tools to bring down the grid in Ukraine,  as it was clear it was kind of a test of their capabilities.  I gathered that it didn't work this time.  Right.  So they had to blow up the nuclear plants.  Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one probably wants to say anything  because you never know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is what the alert looks like on your phone.  And that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  We get, you know, extreme weather alerts  and stuff like that.  It seems sensible that you would get air raid alerts  as well.  And that is the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was nine minutes on a changelog.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that a long time or a short time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's, I think that's a long time  because it's been a bit of hit or miss  and a lot of times you're not doing the best.  I think you had a 30 second record once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like changelog diarrhea was out of bounds.  You literally scroll through and like,  this changelog sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if that's how you feel,  maybe it's time to get to our picks of the week  with our fabulous team on this week in Google.  First, as always, Stacey Higginbotham  with her thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember if I've done this one.  So did I already do the firewall of purple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Do not recall.  The firewall of purple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the firewall.  So I've talked about firewall.  This is a device you use on your router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I might've mentioned Firewalla before.  Do you have one now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've tried the gold and the blue.  I do.  So y'all probably saw me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you have done Firewalla.  I recognize the logo now.  Firewalla.  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause you didn't have one at the time.  So I want to hear about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't.  And I actually installed this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The idea is this is like a Raspberry Pi  kind of a security appliance  that you put in your network, right?  Did you get the gold?  Yes.  Which one did you get?  The purple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the purple.  On a gigabit network,  but I don't need quite the tools of the fancy purple.  Right.  I'm sorry, of the fancy gold.  Right.  So what this is, I pulled it here.  This is the Firewalla device.  And what I got it for is actually  because I've got probably about 80  or 60 to 80 IoT devices on my network.  And this actually shows me all the traffic on my network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really useful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot.  It shows me the traffic on my network.  It shows me how many gigabytes or megabytes or kilobits,  whatever they're sending.  It breaks down by Mac address,  what things are sending data,  where they're sending it to.  So you can see things are going to like  the People's Republic of China,  if you would like, or to Colorado.  I still can't figure out who's sending traffic to Colorado,  but whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you block by a country?  I, on my ubiquity, I block China, for instance.  Can you just say, I don't want to traffic?  If I did that, some of my devices won't work.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, but I think it's a really interesting tool.  It's good for this audience,  because y'all are super nerdy.  It's not that nerdy.  It's not hard to use at all.  You download an app and you plug it in.  That's it.  It will also quarantine things on your network,  if you want.  You can also set up VPN features,  if you want to do all that through this.  But it's really just deep packet inspection  on your own network.  And I found it to be pretty cool for tracking,  like how my devices behave.  And some of them, like,  why does my outlet need to send that much data?  I really don't know.  So it's also good questions to ask manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It also works as a firewall though, right?  It's a security device as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  I'm less worried about that, but I know I should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you've got parental controls on it, which is nice.  And I presume it's got to add blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It mimics some of the features that like your Euro Plus  or some of the plus services you have.  Yeah.  It's way easier than Pi Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has its own VPN server.  Oh, that's interesting.  Yes.  Oh, that's really interesting.  Yeah.  Cool.  And you're happy with it?  It didn't slow your network down?  You feel like it was fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did not.  And that's what I was like,  because some of these can slow your network down.  I have not felt like this.  So, and for everyone who's telling me  I should segment my network,  I counter with, if I segment my network properly,  then my IoT devices won't talk to my phone  in some of my routines.  It's a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've done that.  I have an IoT, what do they call it?  A VLAN.  And I have a regular VLAN for secure VLAN.  But you have to then do all sorts of rules  so that things can talk to one another.  By the time you're done, it's like a pain.  So how many devices?  I'm just curious.  I'm looking at mine.  I have 83 devices online.  Unbelievable.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.  I don't think I have,  it used to show me, but it no longer shows me.  Which map?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This map?  And 40% of those are in the closet somewhere.  I have 65.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have a better map than I do.  And also, let me see,  I think I could block geographically, can I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're doing ubiquity.  Did you ever see, did I send you that video  about how to super segment your ubiquity network  from YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, yes you did.  That's what I was using, yes.  And that's the thing is you did,  oh yeah, look at this.  So I'm also blocking Ukraine.  I didn't realize that.  So I'm blocking China, Russia, and Ukraine.  Maybe, I wonder if that's,  I wonder if that is impacting some of my IoT devices.  I never even thought about that.  Everything seems to work.  China maybe.  Yeah, I should check to see if I have any devices  that aren't working.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All 83 of them, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, you get voice assistance.  I actually was going to ask you, Stacey,  if I should get a,  I was talking to Lisa about a Bluetooth door lock,  like the, like, with HomeKit,  like the new Apple HomeKit thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the HomeKey one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, HomeKey, that's it.  Acara makes one, but there's another one.  Schlage, I think, makes one.  No, there's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Schlage, the Schlage encode now has HomeKey.  That's a good lock.  Is it?  It's very efficient.  It's a WiFi lock, which is great.  I don't know if the HomeKit one is a WiFi lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they also use NF, I think they use NFC, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They use NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually going to buy a new smart lock  and I'm torn between the level,  which I think is aesthetically pleasing,  but doesn't have a keypad attached  and just going with the encode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some of these, apparently, they're very flexible.  They will use varieties of ways to,  including face ID to identify and thumbprint.  Wow.  So the Schlage, the encode plus you think is all right?  That one's WiFi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that their HomeKit one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's a good, I have that lock on my front door, y'all.  Come on over.  Come on over.  I'll bring my iPhone and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gotta get to the island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the idea of being able to say to somebody,  I'll let you in, here's a temporary pass  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't actually need,  you don't need a smart lock, a connected lock to do that.  I mean, my friend has a programmable Schlage lock

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that is not...  Oh yeah, you can just give them a code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she just creates a code  and gives me the code that's set for X number.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.  The firewall of purple gigabit cybersecurity firewall  and router with WiFi protecting your family and business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mentioned it was Raspberry Pi size,  but it ain't Raspberry Pi priced.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seven hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 189.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it?  That's still in there.  It says 319.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was from the purple.  I'm sorry, it's 319.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a cheaper one for,  if you don't have a gigabit network, you can go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a variety of solutions, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you have like a 500 megabit per second network,  I can't remember if it's gold.  There's the blue plus, which is 189.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The gold is the most expensive, 468.  And there's the firewall of red, which is only 139 bucks,  but doesn't have anything inside.  I think you want the blue.  Dintzy, dintzy wintzy.  Dintzy.  There's all the different firewalls.  Aunt Pruitt, oh no, I'm sorry, Jeff first.  You're a number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do it in any order you want,  because this is not a democracy.  You are the boss.  You can choose what you do.  So true.  You are empowered.  Who do you want to go next?  Who do you want to go next?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 10 minutes to five, I looked at five by time.  I looked and I said, oh crap,  I don't have a number.  So I went a little mad trying to search for things.  Some of which are crap.  Look at all of them.  You got a hundred numbers.  Wow.  I mentioned two things real quickly.  I'll plug them.  One is I just finished reading,  listening to Ellie Mistal's Allow Me To Retort.  If you watch MSNBC, you see Ellie Mistal often.  Oh, he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Legal commentator.  Oh, I love him.  I know who you're talking about.  Now I see this picture.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  And this is, so this is,  I've never seen a case before where I more highly recommend  the audio versus the print.  Cause you have to hear him do it with his full anger.  It is audacious.  It is brilliant.  And what he argues in it is that the US constitution  is a racist document.  And then it goes on to really argue it.  Really?  Yeah.  But he goes through the nuts and bolts of it  and how that is.  And he says that it's the constitution's junk,  which will get him in trouble in all kinds of places.  He was on The View when they were just clutching their pearls.  But it's brilliantly argued.  I want to assign it to my students.  So that's a recommendation for the week.  But I also want to recommend something else.  So the guy who created a movie about the Linotype  has been uploading all of his artifacts.  And of course, to me, this is just heaven.  This is Linotype, Gutenberg, geek heaven.  He started PrintingFilms.com,  which has old wonderful corporate videos  for things like the Linotype.  If you go down and just pick any minutes  in the blue streak Linotypes video, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or tactics.  Oh, we saw one of these, farewell at Sherdlou.  That one we showed.  We showed that, yeah.  That was in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now these are the corporate videos.  So the Linotron 1010, the Linotron 505.  Pick any of them and play two minutes.  And it's just delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is from 1969.  Let me see if I am getting audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you didn't test it before.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a night on Linotype Mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well now that will get us pulled down.  The ride of the Linotron 505.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, no, that is definitely public, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it depends on the performance.  It depends on the performance.  It depends on the performance, it's not the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Moving world of constant change.  We can't always rely on yesterday's tools  for today's work.  At Mergenthaler, we make a tool  for the graphic arts industry.  A sophisticated tool using modern electronics  to perform one of the most vital functions  in printing and publishing.  High speed photo type setting.  It's a cathode ray tube photo type setting system  called Linotron 505.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're gonna let Dick DiBartolo play the rest of that  on the gizmos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is awesome.  Great stuff.  The boost free cleanup type, which came before,  was the tape fed Linotype.  It still went kachakada, kachakada, kachakada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about the tactics of tape setting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't see that one.  Go ahead.  Produced in proper sequence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The result is galleys of classified  and semi-classified ads with all lines in order,  ready for proofing.  Time consuming slug collating and hand spacing  are held to a minimum.  Slug collating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how time consuming slug collating can be.  Slug collating.  No one wants to slug collate.  Okay, that is printingfilms.com.  Man.  It's called a slug collating.  There's some fun ones.  I know, he's gonna show us some slugs  that he has personally collated.  He's getting his slugs down.  We've seen your slugs before, dude.  Wow.  It's kinda.  You know what?  When you buy slugs, you gotta show them off  as often as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a compositor's  type setting thing, would you?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, what is it?  You move that over.  Or do I?  This is where you put the letters,  one at a time, little tiny letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The person who lays out the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Into that.  One before the letter type.  My hand.  My hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, after you finish the newspaper,  then you have to do your slug collation.  Put it all back.  No one wants to do time consuming slug collation.  It put, what do you got for us?

Transcript:  It's actually his, it says printing films.  Oh, you're right, that does look like  the Vimeo interface, doesn't it?  Oh no.  Uh oh.  How much longer will that be there?  Uh oh, go download them all quick.  Oh boy.  Put them up on YouTube.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause everybody needs the tactics of tape setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my, but that's fascinating.  Yep.  My pick, first, it's a great mirror image  that they find folks at ESPN and Sports Center  because I know all of you folks watch that stuff.  Religiously.  But I thought it was pretty cool.  And also heartwarming is featuring Tiger Woods.  And it's just a great mirror image  right there on line 154.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tiger looks in the mirror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is him.  Is this his kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  His son Charlie.  Oh, and they do the same.  Of course they do.  Is Tiger gonna burst into tears?  I bet he is.  But watch it though.  It's, it's.  They have all the same mannerisms.  It's really true.  That happens.  That's crazy.  Look at the wall.  The gate.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he digs that, man.  Yeah, that's really sweet.  I like how you talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I have the audio muted.  I should turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just the nose, those things that we have.  We both have allergies.  So we both struggle on the golf course.  We get like wind blowing or we'll sniffing and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they rub their nose the exact same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so cute.  There they are.  Look at that.  That's crazy.  That's neat.  But I thought that was just heartwarming to see that.  The Sports Center Instagram,  if you want to see it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really cool.  For all you sports ball folks,  it's part of Twitter family.  Yeah, that's really sweet.  Yeah.  Next up is the, I don't know how to pronounce it.  Clos or close.  Clos.  The C-L-O-S app.  This app has been around for a little while.  And in one of the hands-on photography listeners,  Mr. Jim mentioned it to me a while back,  but I never really said anything about it  because it was only iOS.  And now they have it for Android as well in limited use.  But the point of this app is to create a virtual photo shoot.  And I'm looking to dial into this  because I've had some people back East  that want some work from me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but they can watch you while you're working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can guide them through.  Well, yeah, if you want to do this too.  I was going to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually going to get a new headshot.  So if you want to,  like I was going to hire someone here,  but we could practice if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, this is,  I thought this would be pretty cool to try it out  because I did have the Android version a little while ago  and it just kept crashing and kept crashing.  And I reached out to the devs and they said,  yeah, we got an update coming out.  That's going to fix all of that.  We know.  And the update came out yesterday  and it is much better on Android.  And it's a free app.  And the images,  when I played around with it just in the house,  it looks pretty good.  So I'm going to try it out with some real people  and highly recommend.  And lastly, order some prints,  antproot.com slash prints,  and go check out the images and order some prints.  Beautiful stuff.  Help continue to pay for college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, college.  How many of those college tuition checks  you going to be writing soon?  Oh, college.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And are they really doing a nice job printing those out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do a great job.  And it saves me a lot of money  from doing it myself.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You don't ever want to get in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To pay them to do it.  You'd lose money if you did that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do a really good job.  Even the large prints come out looking really, really good.  I've had a lot of positive feedback about that.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Every Friday, Tarek and I take a deep dive  into the stories that define the new space age.  What's NASA up to?  When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?  And how about those samples in the Perseverance Rover?  When are those coming home?  What the heck is Elon Musk done now?  In addition to all the latest and greatest  in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look  at bits of space flight history  that you probably never heard of.  And all with an eye towards having a good time  along the way.  Check us out in your favorite podcatcher.
