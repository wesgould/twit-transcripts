Transcript:  This is TWiG.  This is TWiG.  This Week in Google.  Episode 34 for March 21st, 2010.  Live from Google Luma.  It's time for TWiG This Week in Google.  The show that covers everything in the Googleverse and the cloud.  Joining us, the core cast of the show right now, Mr. Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Working on a new book.  We'll ask him about that.  Also here, her book is out, Gina Tripani, the author of The Complete Guide to Google  Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Also a blogger at SmarterWear.org.  There's her book.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  How's the sales?  Hola.  They're good.  They're good.  They're going well.  Thank you to everyone who bought a copy.  If you haven't, buy one.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't actually have to read it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just buy one.  Just buy it.  That's so mean.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And we're good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll be your best friend.  Now you've sweetened the deal.  I love it.  We were in Austin last week and we had a wonderful time, fun show and saw a lot of people out  there.  Boy, it's my first time and that is a great conference.  That is such a fun conference.  By the way, Gina's wearing her Google Slanket.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am.  And then Diego gave us the Slanket and I didn't bring it to Austin because it was really big  and tough to pack.  And it was hot in Austin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't need it.  It was.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was.  And it's a little warm here in San Diego so I don't know that the Slanket is going to  make it through the whole show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not wearing mine.  It's too hot for the Slanket today.  We'll save that for winter.  It is the first day of spring.  Happy spring.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Happy spring.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Happy spring.  So one of the stories that we wanted to talk about, we were out of time last week, was  the Google Apps marketplace.  Just like there's an Android marketplace selling Android applications, there's a Google Apps  marketplace and there are even some pretty good apps in there.  Yeah, there are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is pretty cool.  I thought this was a pretty interesting story.  So you can basically plug in web apps into Google Apps, which were also web apps.  So we really haven't seen this before, right?  We've seen widgets that can go in different places.  We've seen extensions and bookmarklets.  But this is full-fledged web apps hooking into Google Apps.  So there are a couple of good ones.  And actually, I wrote this up.  This was like two weeks ago.  This was like two weeks ago and I can't remember.  There's batch book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's merge and automate.  Here's MailChimp.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Aviary, which is a really good image editor.  So basically what this does is, depending on what the web app that's plugging into Google  Apps, it depends on what it does.  But something like Aviary, for example, it's a really good online image and sound editor.  When you connect Aviary to your Google Apps account, you can edit images and sound and  save it.  And it saves directly to Google Docs.  And it's free.  And it's free.  And it is free.  There are a lot that are free and there are a lot that cost, you know, there's a subscription  fee or a premium version.  So this is pretty cool.  So when you use one of these apps in conjunction with Google Apps, first you skip the registration  process.  You don't have to register for Aviary because it already has all your information from your  Google account.  And also you get some like workgroup functionality.  So this is for Google Apps accounts, right?  This is for people who have registered their domain with Google Apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I can't use it just with my regular Gmail account.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not just with your vanilla Gmail account.  But if you've got the Smith family dot com and Jane and John and Joe all have accounts  there.  If you enable Aviary, then everybody can get access.  You can automatically share images and edit images with all the people in the workgroup.  So it really gives you kind of workgroup access permissions.  And it uses Google Docs and your storage space and Google Docs to save files.  It can access your calendar and your contacts.  Now it tells you when you install the app, it says this will need it tells you what you  need, what it will need access to.  Similar to what Android lets you know when you install an app, what what components your  account it needs access to.  But it's pretty neat.  It's pretty neat setup.  And I think that it's getting some exposure to a lot of these kind of third party web  apps.  And what I really liked about it is that Google was like, you know, we're not going to we're  not going to build all of these apps.  They exist and we just want to create a bridge to them.  So I really I really dug that approach.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I'm going to be cautious about trying to say that this is a big deal.  Having said that about Buzz.  But is this kind of the beginning of the architecture we're going to see around Chrome OS and a  web app world?  Absolutely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so.  I think this is all about Chrome OS.  I think it's all about getting enterprise folks to move over to Google Apps and to be  able to say, hey, we have you know, what app do you need?  You need faxing.  We have e-fax.  You need image, you know, editing.  We have aviary.  You need some, you know, trip it.  You need travel planning for your group.  Trip it is an awesome web app plugs into Google Apps.  Now you can share your you know, you can share all your travel plans with everybody in your  company.  This is this is absolutely all about saying like this is the app store for for the web.  But everything's on the web now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it new this week that Google put out an app to migrate off of Microsoft Exchange?  Yes, it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  This is this is an interesting one, too.  I haven't actually tried this because I don't have an exchange server.  I didn't think you would, Gina.  No, that was a long time ago.  But yes, it's um, oh, geez, the URL is a little too long for me to read.  But if you if you Google switch from Microsoft Exchange, there's a there's basically a migration  tool that will import your mail, your contacts, your calendar from your exchange server,  regardless of what your setup is, whether you have one in-house or otherwise, and move it  into Google Apps.  So so yeah, Google's going for the enterprise customers and they're they're serious now.  And now I mean, they've always been serious.  But now now it's becoming a lot more practical for a small company that has an exchange server  who hates maintaining it.  And I would bet that many do.  Here's an easy escape hatch into into Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, this Aviary application requires flash, so it's possible to have flash applications  as well.  I mean, there's no limit to what you can do with this.  You can have any application running on any platform.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm actually not sure what the in terms of development, what the hooks are like.  But yeah, there are quite a few apps available.  It would have to run in the browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It has to be a web app.  Well, not necessarily.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's this office sink, which is basically like Docverse.  It's a it's one.  It's a toolbar for Microsoft Word or Microsoft Office that that syncs up.  And that actually is available through Google Apps.  There's analytics that are kind of behind the scenes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's JavaScript.  That's JavaScript and then runs a server side.  I'm sure software.  So but as long as it runs in the browser, in other words, as long as the web app.  Well, no, because then, as you said, you could use Microsoft Office apps, too.  So the plug in the process for the stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm really not sure.  Is it an Apple style approval process?  I doubt it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I doubt that.  Yeah, I doubt that.  But but it does.  I mean, it raises some questions.  It's like that this, you know, these apps can access their hooks into accessing your Google Apps account information, which is going to include obviously some.  So, you know, there's some sensitive information that it can access.  So I imagine that they're going to approve apps and they're going to open up your apps account information that they're going to be pretty stringent about approvals.  But but I'm not sure I have actually haven't heard from any developers.  Everyone that I heard heard from had had their app, you know, launched with it and were really happy.  It got a lot more users.  I talked to the Aviary guy and he at South by Southwest and he said that they got an influx of users and he was really happy about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bet they did.  So here's the approval process listing in the Google Apps Marketplace is self-service and easy after creating a marketplace vendor account and paying the one time one hundred dollar listing fee.  You could publish one or more marketplace listings that will be visible to the public as long as they adhere to the listing approval policy.  And here is the listing approval policy.  It's got to be business related.  It doesn't look like it looks like it's automatic.  No, it's very much like Android.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So we're going to have a problem here.  I think we have the same app overload issue is going to hit real soon where you just you have with both iPhone and Android.  It's forest for the trees.  It's interesting.  They're requiring this though.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, they're existing web apps.  Right.  So it's like Tripit and Aviary.  These are these are apps that I've reviewed.  You know, a life hacker we knew we knew and loved.  Right.  So it makes sense.  On the iPhone and Android.  These are all new apps and you don't know.  You don't really know who's making them.  You haven't used them before.  Well, except for the apps that interface with existing services.  Right.  Like Evernote like the Evernote app, for example.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or I could make a new app for the apps marketplace.  Right.  Sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So we you know, if this proves popular, we start hitting overload soon.  And there is a large enterprise base.  I mean, I wonder what Salesforce will think of this.  Has this become Salesforce?  I mean, it goes after Microsoft clearly, but I can't think it's going to be that robust,  is it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Boy, if I were Salesforce, I would absolutely make sure I had an app in the market in the  marketplace.  Wouldn't you?  Yeah.  What it does is it provides a very powerful way to get your hooks into a large group of  users.  I think this is very I think this is a win for everybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I would love to see is specialized things.  I think that, you know, educational market things, stuff for publishers.  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, Moodle should have a plug in for this, for instance.  Then you could have Moodle work with Google Apps.  And now you've got a you know, you've got an educational platform.  I mean, I think this is very powerful, very exciting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It didn't get a whole lot of press because you can't install it with your regular Google  account, right?  So you have to have a Google Apps account.  So that's one kind of big hurdle.  And yet you have to be an administrator on that account.  So only the administrator can enable these extra apps.  Or enterprise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it looks like I have to have a domain.  You have to have it.  So it's not merely that I have a paid apps account, but it has to point to my own domain.  Right.  So I'd have to have a twit.tv Google Apps.  But that's 50 bucks per seat per year.  It's not hugely expensive.  And I think a lot of companies do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you have to have a paid domain to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, no, I'm using the free edition and it works.  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  So you're allowed to have the free edition redirect to smarterware.org or whatever the

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  TLG is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I associated my Google Apps account with my, yeah, with Gene after Penny.  I thought you could only do that on a paid account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you're so you can do this.  You don't have to have a paid commercial account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you're right.  This goes back to the same problem they had with Buzz.  They've got to start to regularize the apps world to the rest of Google world.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  So here's the big disparity, right?  So before it was like a vanilla Google Apps account, a Google account, excuse me, got  things like voice, Buzz, reader, and Google Apps accounts didn't have that.  And now Google Apps accounts have access to all these third party web apps, but vanilla  Google accounts don't.  So so yeah, it's interesting to see them kind of split off.  I mean, ideally, everyone heard about Buzz.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They do complain about it within Google.  But the more things they add to each, the harder it's going to be to bring them together,  I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not clear to me why there's such a split between the two platforms and why it's so  different and why the release schedules are different.  Yeah, I'm not I'm not sure if it's just too.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The Googler that I spoke to said that there was a good reason why there was this split  and why there are these differences that they're working on on resolving it.  But that seems to be the line whenever something's not working.  So we'll see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about Buzz, because it really seems like Buzz flopped.  I hate to say this because I am a big Buzz fan.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm surprised you're saying this, Leo.  You're like you're the Buzz lover.  I'm a Buzz lover.  You're so excited about buzzing from maps at South by.  Did you did you use Buzz at South by?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use Buzz nonstop.  In fact, my tool of the week is a Buzz tool.  But it looks to me if I look through Buzz and all the people I'm following that almost  every very few people are doing to me for Buzz to be a success.  People have to post natively in Buzz, right?  And and have to comment on posts and interact and engage.  And right now I don't see very many people doing that.  I see a lot of ported content from Twitter, from Flickr, from Google Reader.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not much discussion there.  I admit that I went way overboard on Buzz.  I saw all this potential and all these implications and it ain't clicking.  It needs a rethink.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I still get something quite a bit of engagement on mine.  And what I've done, Louis Gray said he's going to do it too, is I've turned off importing.  So it is just native buzz.  And well, you know what?  The engagement has gone down quite a bit.  Forty three comments, forty comments.  Even if the stuff from South by has many more comments than the stuff since South by perhaps.  Yeah, I am posting a show, you know, as we do a show as I've done today, I post a new  buzz entry so that there can be some engagement there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There just needs to be something to bring it together here.  Between Twitter and Facebook and Buzz and whatever else is out there, for that matter,  FriendFeed and things like that, I think it's a problem that we can't live in five worlds.  The winner in social is he or she who organizes the Internet as a social network rather than  getting us to go to a social network.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ev announced right after we did Twig at South by Southwest, a new at anywhere platform for  Twitter, which makes Twitter or the goal is to make Twitter the single sign on for a lot of  sites, Huffington Post, Yahoo, a lot of people signed up to do this.  It makes your you know, it makes it very easy to tweet from within the Huffington Post, for  instance, without even going to Twitter.  Is Twitter unassailable at this point?  Do they own this space?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I love Evan.  I love Twitter, but the ad anywhere thing really kind of left me cold.  I was like, oh, great.  I have another way to sign into places like Facebook, OpenID, my Google account, Yahoo  account.  Those weren't enough.  Like now I can sign in with Twitter.  And I also just was confused about the announcement.  I was like, oh, at anywhere so I can.  Besides being bad grammar.  Yeah, it's like, oh, so I can tweet at a blog post author from the Huffington Post.  It didn't really make sense to me.  I was hoping you could explain it to me, Gina.  Yeah, well, I could tell you what I think is going on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this became clear when Facebook changed its URL style from this weird number thing  to a name, when they allowed you to brand pages, is there's a fight over what I call  the Internet namespace.  Oh, yeah.  And that's what that's all this looks like to me.  These companies, Facebook, Twitter, I'm sure Google, Yahoo, want to probably Microsoft  too would like to be your name.  So right.  But it's a Betamax problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  It's just too many different standards, too many different ways to go.  And we all just want to say, here I am enough.  So at Jeff Jarvis becomes your name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, at Gina Trapani becomes your name and you don't bother with anything else.  That's it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it adds into my phone number and SIP, phone connections and connectivity and all  kinds of other things.  But yeah, the namespace and connectivity space and identity space, they're all related but  somewhat different, is wildly too confusing today.  Do you think, though, at some point people will stop saying, oh, I've got this, this,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this and this, and we'll just say I'm at Leo Laporte?  That's all you need to know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I feel so strongly that identity is built into the Internet.  I know this is a really geeky thing to say, but for anyone who says they're trying to  set up an Internet presence like for themselves, I say register your domain name with your  name, set up a web page, link it to wherever you are, and then whatever the social media  du jour is, embed a widget or whatever.  But that, yourname.com is, oh, for as long as you maintain it and control it, is going  to be you.  Here's the problem.  I can't get leolaporte.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Someone else has it.  It's too late.  Definitely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, there's definitely, there are namespace problems.  There are.  There are.  Well, you know, so then you pick something else.  You do .name or you do .tv or, you know, you can, or you throw in your middle name.  The identity thing is an issue.  I mean, my kids aren't definitely not going to get anything close to their name.  So maybe at some point we're going to move to, you know, subdomains or, but, but just.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People are, parents are, by the way, searching.  Thinking about names.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're thinking about names.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know many parents, modern parents who won't name a kid something they can't get a unique,  unique domain for.  By the way, I did register abbyleport and henryleport.com, my kids' names.  Before they're born?  No, a few years ago, but I was registered for 20 years or something like that, till  they were 20.  And I figured if they don't pick it up after then, then that's, that's their problem.  We'll be able to find them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, then again, some people say to me, well, you're crazy.  I don't, I don't want, you know, I don't want this one place where I'm always going to be,  you know, that things are ephemeral and, you know, my identity is going to change from  whatever.  Well, it's just impractical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, can, I don't know, can you really have, I mean, I guess that was the  idea of dot name and dot me, right?  Right.  That didn't work.  Didn't work?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can every individual really have their own domain name?  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody's got leolaport.name.  Somebody's got leolaport.me.  Hmm.  So I'm screwed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They haven't tried to hold you up for it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I'm sure that's coming.  Leoville is a pretty good domain, Leo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got that a long time ago and I'm going to stick, obviously I'm going to stick with that.  But, uh,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But I think the point is that I think that we have to set, as far as I'm concerned, in  terms of identity, you have to set up a place that you control, that's on a space that you  own and, and you can, you know, because when Twitter goes away or when it's down or whatever,  or they turn evil or Facebook or whatever, you want to be able to say, this is, this  is where I am, this is where I've been and this is where I'll always be, especially for  people who work online.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't want it to be some one company.  You don't want Yahoo or Google to own it, right?  You don't want Twitter to own it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  You don't.  You don't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why we want, it's a perfect place for standards and interoperability.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And the ability to say this equals this and we can claim those things.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, if you Google my name right now, Twitter is the second result, I think, after  my, you know, nameplates.  Right.  So some companies are going to own it because people don't, you know, a lot of people aren't  like us.  They don't care enough to set up, you know, you know what I mean?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  There's a bigger issue here, you know, societal issue here about the benefits of identity.  I had a long conversation yesterday with a reporter who's doing a piece, I won't give  it up for her, but doing a piece on the nasty comments that come in her, these two stories  she wrote.  And I spent a long time trying to explain to her what Doc Searles taught me long ago  is that, listen, you're trying to judge the Internet in your media terms, that everything  is a package with a bow on it.  And Doc says the Internet is a place.  It's just a street corner where we talk.  And that in that, in trying to find new kinds of civility, requiring identity doesn't work,  but identity in Facebook and Twitter does work.  Right.  Those two are more civilized places than comment spheres by far because we can follow people  and not follow people because we value identity and relationships there.  And it changes the nature of society there, I think, rather profoundly.  So there's huge benefit to identity online.  And that's why I resent all the more that we can't bring it together.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you have to swipe your card when you log into Twitter to get on.  But to log on just to the web in general, you don't.  And, yeah, and associating yourself with a handle and building a history and creating  a social graph, you know, it has its benefits in Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is somebody at a disadvantage if they have a kid or they don't grab their name now?  Are they at a disadvantage if they don't have leolaport.com?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, if a kid's name is Bob Smith, they're at a disadvantage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're never going to get it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think people will probably get created.  Not even that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not even just for Google juice, just to be searchable.  You know, you can't name a kid Bob Smith anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's why I think people at Twitter and Facebook think we have, and Google too probably,  I think we have a very credible proposition.  A lot of people now, facebook.com slash leolaport, that's, you know, I got it.  That's how they want to do it.  Right.  Is it easier than registering a domain name?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's a lot easier.  And Google profiles, right, will include like your name and your location and other bits  of metadata, right, that identify you in search results anyway.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's interesting, Gina, because every place is going to have its page.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  That's the idea of the profiles, Google profiles, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So, you know, the irony is, I think here that locations are going to get better identity  on the web than people are at first because of that, because they have geo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But as a user, what happens when Google profiles gets pulled down or Facebook, you know, loses,  you know, isn't as popular?  I mean, you know, you invest all this time.  I mean, I guess that's always an issue in addition to the SEO issue, you know, the findability  issue, the identity issue.  I mean, that's an issue anyway.  But, you know, what happened to your Friendster profile page?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What did happen to that?  Is that a round?  Yeah.  I don't even know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't even know if the domain is still working.  Let's see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an interesting question.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Friendster is, there is Friendster.com is up and around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a, it's a, it's a, but anyway, that's to me what Ad Anywhere is all about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like Twitter's answer to Facebook Connect.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And Google Connect.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is it called Google Connect?  I don't even know what Google, what is it called?  Google Accounts or Google Sign In or.  Isn't that Friend Connect?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, Friend Connect.  Yeah.  Friend Connect.  Yeah, that's what Kevin Marks had worked on.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, right, right, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, you know, Kevin showed me a lot of very neat things that he was working on about  being able to collect your trails too and being able to publish them anywhere.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there is some work being done.  Or publish what part of it you wanted it.  There is some work being done in that area, right?  Is, I want to say, I want to say Salmon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Salmon is the comment upstream downstream commenting system.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Comment upstream downstream.  Okay, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's a very interesting thing and I think everybody is trying to figure out  what's going to be the next land grab and doing what they can.  Everybody thought that Twitter would announce a plan for monetization.  And no, they didn't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or would be asked about it.  Was the EVE keynote after our show?  It was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was on Tuesday.  Maybe it was, it was on Monday, I think.  And unfortunately, the questions that the moderator was asking were very softball.  We really didn't get much information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Umair Haake is a friend of mine and he's a brilliant guy.  But the talk, people walked out like crazy.  It's fascinating between this and the...  Sarah Lacey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sarah Lacey interview.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a very hard thing to do with South by Southwest.  You've got to be aware of your audience and give the audience what they want,  which is tough questions and geeky questions.  And otherwise, shut up.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you've got some, yeah, you've got some really hardcore,  hardcore people in there who are not afraid to tweet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That's a tough crowd.  If you don't grab a South by Southwest crowd within the first five minutes,  they're going to leave on you.  I mean, unless you're Gary Vee, who was definitely the best,  best session I saw.  Oh, really?  Oh, he's just such a dynamic speaker.  And just high energy, very engaged, got the audience involved instantly.  I mean, he spoke for about 10 minutes and then was like, okay, Q&A.  That's the way to do it, boy.  And two people got up and started like spontaneously rapping  and the place was on their feet.  I mean, it was just, it was super high energy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat.  Oh, that's really great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, and I like Gary.  I think he was in danger of becoming prerecorded about a year ago  where he heard the patter and the spiel.  I didn't think that was true at all this time.  I think it was all the better that he did what Gina said  and just talked to people and helped them and advised them and pushed them.  What was fascinating too is he wasn't all sunshine and flowers.  One woman got up and asked about her startup to enable companies  to automatically answer brand questions on Twitter.  And he said, I hate that in every fiber of my soul.  And she said, the woman said, well, but companies don't get it.  Then a woman from Procter & Gamble stood up and said, I'm from Procter & Gamble.  We get it.  And Gary said, well, but you have your agencies tweeting for you.  That's wrong.  Right.  He was very tough on her too.  So it wasn't just as if he was doing platitudes from pillows.  He was really, you know, talking to people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, he was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Platitudes from pillows. I like it.  Speaking of which, I do have a twit pillow now.  Thanks to throwboy.com.  No platitudes on it, but the logo.  Are you going to be selling it?  Yeah, Throwboy is going to sell it.  He came up to me at the Big Dig Shindig and said, here.  I said, you want to make those? Please do.  So I think throwboy is going to make it.  That's cool.  Yeah, isn't that cool?  So while we were speaking, I covertly registered leolaport.mobi, leolaport.name, leolaport.net, leolaport.org.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take that!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Leopalooza.tv, just in case.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there.  You just went through a few hundred bucks.  And freepants.org. You never know.  I'm feeling very powerful.  Longest crowdsurf.org might be a good one too, if I could steal that one quicker.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If any of our listeners have not seen the leolaport Dignation Party crowdsurfing video, get the to YouTube instantly.  I don't think anybody has not seen it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, even today, if I look at Twitter, at least three quarters of the mentions of me are that.  Are that?  Yeah.  Best thing I ever did.  After swearing at Mike Arrington, that was the best thing I've ever done.  There you go. There you go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Geez.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jake's favorite thing, Son, Jake's favorite thing was your tech person begging you not to in Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I missed that part.  Colleen said, don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Please don't do it, Leo.  Please don't do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Colleen did not equip me with a Twitter readout on it.  So there was no way to know what she was saying.  That's funny.  Well, she rightly so was probably worried about the gear.  She wasn't worried about me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  She was worried about the gear.  She was worried about the gear.  I didn't know if that was a euphemism.  Not that gear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, she was worried about the stuff on my back, the backpack and the camera.  I'm sure that's what she was worried about.  That's funny.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing that that backpack made it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was stunned.  And it's funny because it streamed the whole crowd surfing and then I ran to get back up on stage and it fell out.  The connector fell out.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Because you had an ethernet cord.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a firewire cable that just fell out at the drop of a hat.  So I was stunned.  Somebody up there was looking down.  And I also found out later that it is in fact a dangerous thing to do.  I didn't know.  But they dropped Meatloaf in a crowd surf once and he landed on his elbow and injured himself.  Chris Meatloaf.  He's a rather big boy.  So the Nexus One is now we mentioned that for Roger's compatibility they've made it so it works with AT&T.  But now Sprint is saying it's going to have the Nexus One.  Verizon is going to have the Nexus One probably this week.  So the Nexus One, is this going to be the next big phone, the Nexus One?  You guys use it.  I use it.  And you're all three Nexus One users.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But then we hear that analysts are saying that the sales are disappointing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although there are a lot of Nexus Ones in South and Southwest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought that was very interesting.  I'm sure that in years past it was all iPhone, right?  Everybody's staring at your iPhone.  There were a lot of droids.  Huge number of droids.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I saw more droids I think than I saw Nexus Ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And a few Nexus Ones.  But I think the Nexus One has been held back by T-Mobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's part of it.  I think that the apps still need some goosing.  You know, some companies like New York Times really need to support it I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  iPad's going to come out in a couple of weeks.  You guys, what do you think?  Is that going to be, is that going to help?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I saw something that I fell in love with.  I'll tell you about this.  Was the Dell Mini 5?  Yeah, that's really cute.  Did I see that mushroom stroke?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you didn't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you showed it to me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So it's, you can find it online, Leo.  It's been written about, but I saw it in person.  So rather, it's a middle point between the phone and the iPad.  It still fits in a pocket.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you did mention that, yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it looks pretty big on the head.  But it's just that much bigger.  And so I think we're going to see Android pads of all sizes.  Pardon the use of the word, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's just a little bit, the Mini 5 or Streak, as it's called by some,  it's just slightly bigger than the iPhone.  That's pretty big.  It's pretty big.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's big enough to have a proper dock and to do a little more with the layout on the home screens.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it is running Android.  And it's Android from Dell.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, it was impressive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I don't know what carrier they're going to put it on yet.  They just had the prototype there.  It was running AT&T in there.  Wow, that might be just a little bit bigger.  That's the question is what's the right size?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That might just be just right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, although it does look dorky holding against your head,  but all the more reason to use your headset, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could you fit it in a breast pocket?  Yes.  You could.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tried and then tried to walk away with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just big.  It's probably the limit.  I bet you that's what the deciding factor was.  Can I put it in a breast pocket?  Yeah.  And is it Android 2.1?  I can't tell from the pictures.  It looks like it might be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it was.  The other thing was, too, is that as you do things like look through your apps on the screen,  just the functionality of having a larger screen is nice,  which I'm sure will be part of the appeal of the iPad as well.  But this opened my eyes to see that there's a lot of new devices coming here.  And Android's going to be the means.  If you want to create a new device, you've got to do it on Android.  You can't do it on Apple.  So that's where there's going to be tons of development.  And that is Google's hope.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple's, I think, shooting itself in the foot by really asserting this closed marketplace.  I also wonder how much longer Apple's going to stay in the computer business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got to say, it's pretty clear that they can only...  Not only will Apple devices not multitask, it's pretty clear the company can't multitask.  For instance, since January, Intel has had a new laptop chip that everybody and their brothers  make in laptops around the i3, i5, and i7, the Arendelle chipset.  In the past, Apple's always jumped on these.  In fact, Intel's given them the pride of place,  allowed them to be the first company to ship.  They did it with the i7.  Apple has...that's three months in, and they have still not announced an Arendelle laptop line.  It's clear they're not going to do it now until after the iPad, maybe much after the iPad.  Can Apple do more than one thing at once?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interesting. I hadn't really thought about that.  I mean, not to be a total Google fan girl, but it always amazes me how Google releases products,  product after product.  I mean, it's so obvious that they have so many different teams working on so many different things at one time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But therein lies the problem, too.  We just complained about apps versus Google, Android versions versus this or that.  I think that's a problem for Google, and there's some kind of middle ground there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Focus is not a bad thing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, too much fragmentation. Yeah, and focus is not a bad thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is what leads me to think that maybe Apple, having taken computer out of their name,  might take computer out of their product line.  They've got very successful products with the iPod.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That would hurt me. I want to hug my computer right now, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hope I haven't made you sad.  Don't go away.  I haven't made you sad, but...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So, Kevin Rose tweeted this week, RIP Palm, they need to move to Android as fast as humanly possible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very sad. It's too bad because WebOS, I think, is a nice operating system.  And I thought the Pre was a very nice phone.  But they announced that in their Q3 call with Rubenstein, they announced that their losses were significantly higher than analysts predicted.  The market immediately punished them by dropping their stock price by 28%.  It doesn't look good for the next quarter, either.  His advisory for the next quarter was in widely increased losses.  Sales are not good on the Pre.  You've got to wonder how much longer Palm can hold on.  And I don't think shifting to Android is going to do anything for them at this point.  I think they're out of business.  Amazing.  They created this category in a lot of ways.  And I think WebOS was good.  You know what? Palm did exactly what I would have done in their position, which is scrap everything, steal the entire iPhone team, give them free reign to do something better.  They did all of that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So what happened? What went wrong?  Too late?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sprint.  Probably.  Nobody's going to buy.  I mean, it's too little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about the iPhone?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the iPhone's an AT&T. Nobody wants Sprint.  Do you think? I mean, Sprint is really an also ran as a carrier.  So that's one problem.  That's problem one.  You're not going to.  They have 2000 applications in the App Store, not 40,000, not 140,000.  That's a problem.  You've got to get developers.  You got to be.  Well, you mean it's a catch 22.  It's a catch 22.  You've got to get people to buy it.  So the developers have developed for it, but developers aren't going to develop for it if the people don't buy it and people aren't going to buy it unless they see apps.  And unfortunately, Palm was too small a company to develop enough apps.  Maybe they should have gone Android in the first place.  Kevin might be right that the mistake was going to WebOS at all.  But now I think it's too late to go to Android.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I was just I was looking at PDA net and thinking, God, I haven't called these things PDAs in ages.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's what really killed them.  Yeah, the smartphone marketplace just put them out of business.  It's interesting because Microsoft's response now they're a much bigger company.  They have a lot more resources.  Windows seven phone system, whatever the hell they call it, is a real shot across the Android bow.  I don't know if it's going to be enough, but a lot of people saw Windows, the new Windows seven at Mix this week at the Microsoft Mix conference.  And we're very impressed by it.  Interesting, though, limited multitasking, no cut and paste.  It sounds a little familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll never learn.  Sounds a little familiar.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I heard some good things about IE nine from the coming from people following on Twitter.  Very fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did a developer preview that had no Chrome and had no UI.  But the engine was there and the engine everybody's saying is extraordinarily fast.  And props to Microsoft HTML five looking forward to HTML five.  Yay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Finally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you know, Microsoft just needs to put IE six and IE seven in bed.  They just need to force the update.  They just have to tell people we're done.  Yeah.  No more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they're moving in that direction.  It's very this has always been Microsoft's most difficult challenges is that unlike some companies, Apple particularly, they cannot and are not willing to and probably shouldn't.  Cut off legacy users.  And so while they'd very much like to say, sorry, you know, we're going to we're going to reach out and uninstall IE six for each and every one of your computers.  They can't do that because it's a their primary customer base is business.  And business is notoriously slow to adopt new stuff.  You've got to keep the old stuff working or business is just going to abandon you.  So Microsoft has to support all this old stuff.  And that's really what hurts them.  It's what hurts their security.  They can't abandon the old models.  Because they've got to work with all the old stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But don't you feel like these refresh cycles have to speed up?  I mean, yes.  Or else, I mean, they have to speed up, right?  Business has businesses have to get faster about this.  And Microsoft has to be a little more insistent and assertive about it.  I think they have that luxury.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that this is, you know, it's the price of success.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's bigger.  It's an architectural issue.  I mean, it's the it's the closed world.  If you have to update it, you're the only one who updates it versus the open world where it's constantly iterating.  That's Microsoft's death.  Yeah.  It's the word.  You know, it's interesting we talk about this because it's the word processors died.  PDAs died.  Microsoft isn't dying, but it's stuck in the same rut where its closed world became its barrier to entry to others became its disadvantage.  Same as in media.  I own the press. You don't.  I have this huge expense.  It now becomes an albatross around your neck.  Retailers who have huge investment in bricks and mortar used to be their advantage barrier to entry.  Now it's the albatross.  Microsoft's closed system that made it a somewhat same monopoly is now its burden.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think it happens to everybody in the long run.  I mean, Google may be the first company to say, oh, look, we can we can succeed openly and maybe not have that problem.  I think there'll be other problems.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it's much less of a problem having to reach down to people's computers and update their software.  I mean, it's all, you know, iterating web app is a completely different.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But look at the problem they have with phones.  There are some phones that are one five.  There's some phones that are two one.  People who bought one five phones are pissed off.  That's true.  There's another side of that story.  Yeah, you've got five different platforms out there.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right. Because there are going to be certain certain networks that they support and, you know, updates and that kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet there'll be people like Hexa who will do builds for anything.  Yeah.  You lose control.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so what's what's the business strategy then?  You know, if in this world, web apps.  Right. So you don't want barriers to entry anymore.  So you have web apps, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because web apps, you control the version.  You know, you have absolute control of the software and you that's why I'm sure why Google's pushing Google Apps, because then that's it.  That's an ecosystem you can completely control.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And but you're also set up to be advantaged if someone invents something you didn't invent.  Perfect. The app marketplace.  That's exactly it. Where by being closed, you had to invent it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So you get the best you get.  You get two really good, strong things going in your favor.  And, you know, it's interesting because Microsoft is very much trying to be a cloud company.  But boy, I mean, they hired Ray Ozzie, the creator of Lotus.  They.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was not a cloud thing.  The Lotus was it was the ultimate closed system.  That's the problem. It just extended that architecture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I still make fun of Howard Stern every time he has to sync to Lotus.  How often do you hear that anymore?  Geez.  Seriously?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  So my VM guy talked him into it years ago and now he's now he's stuck with it.  You just I just don't hear that anymore.  It's it's it's like Microsoft Exchange, but worse.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He says it on the air.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, he does.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We need to have a little talk.  Can I?  You want to sound like her from 1998 or what?  I'm just I got to tease Howard.  Come on. Of course. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, Howard doesn't he's not worried about anything.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I try to talk him into the iPhone the first time he finally got it, he couldn't because it didn't have an exchange.  I mean, a Lotus sync.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's so sad.  It did.  Who uses Lotus?  Serious?  Howard?  Oh, just Howard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just Howard.  He's using it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was the great curse of working for Ziff Davis in the late 90s was that they had to have Lotus.  You had to use Lotus.  Lotus Notes is the worst piece of.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And this is this is Howard's company that's using Lotus.  So Howard can say, hey, we're going to move to something else and he hasn't done it yet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or yeah, he's a creature of habit.  But but yeah, he's he he's he has this IBM tech guy who installed his machines.  And as a result, he's been addicted and he can't break out of it.  What's to be addicted to?  Terry Delabatte.  It's just this mess of Lotus crap.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, you ought to get him a genie account or MCI mail.  Then he'd feel at home.  So you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was listening to Howard Bestov because he's off this week as he has many weeks and they had a segment on on how Howard used to go do online sex.  CompuServe back in the day.  And they had one of his paramours from CompuServe in who was not as he'd imagined her.  Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That must have that was that.  That's a good bit. It was a good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's funny.  But it shows how the world's changed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I remember my 75106, 3135 on CompuServe.  You never forget.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  She just look at us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't have one of those.  Dad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I also have an MCI mail address.  I was L. Leporte at MCI mail.  But MCI mail.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think I was like Geetra Panning 2000 on MCI.  OK, OK. I can get LMS game.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you could never email anybody else.  You could only email MCI mail users.  It's crazy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You have a source account too, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had the source.  I had CompuServe.  I had Genie.  I had them all.  Quantum Link.  Crazy.  So a great thanks to the Viacom Google lawsuit.  A great.  We're starting to see some revelations.  Jeff bookmarked an article at FinancialAdvisory.com.  Secrets of Google YouTube deal revealed.  Now, I knew one secret because we interviewed Chad Hurley.  After the acquisition.  And he told us that when Google was talking to them, they wanted to keep it top secret.  So he met with Eric Schmidt at the International House of Pancakes in Mountain View.  And that's where they hashed out the details.  But now we're learning what the details were.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In a chocolate chip pancake stupor.  I want to know what they had.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you have the strawberries with the whipped cream?  Obviously, Eric Schmidt did.  Did you have the cheat loveless fantasy?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Obviously, I expected because according to this, Eric Schmidt said the company was valued when they offered one point six five billion dollars for YouTube was valued at six or seven hundred million.  They offered a hunt, a billion dollar premium on the company.  He said that the time factor was the reason why they needed to get it now.  Chad Hurley got three hundred thirty four million dollars in Google stock.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would love the calculation of what that's worth today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, a lot more. Right.  I'm sure that's ten times more.  Yeah.  Steve Chen, three hundred one million dollars in stock.  Yeah, with Kareem, sixty six million dollars in stock.  Sequoia Capital, one of their chief investors, got half a billion dollars.  Wow.  In Google stock.  Man.  That's why I want to be a venture capitalist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They picked up the tab at IHP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They put in nine million dollars and they got five hundred sixteen million dollars two years later.  Wow, good for them.  Artist Capital Management put in three million dollars, got eighty five million dollars.  But it was a risky, I mean, buying, I mean, investing in YouTube was crazy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, people thought it was nuts.  A million dollars a month in bandwidth.  Everybody screamed.  This is your insane Internet.  It's never going to work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not to mention the lawsuits.  We interviewed Chad right before the Google sale.  And I said, dude, what are you going to do when NBC, CBS and ABC try to sue you out of existence?  And he just smiled.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My favorite part of the Viacom suit is that part of what the Google lawyers have revealed here is that even as Viacom was saber rattling and suing,  they were secretly uploading their own content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Beautiful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Love that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google has had.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think this ties into the Google TV box now because it does show the grander strategy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Google TV.  Let's talk about that.  New strategy here.  And I think YouTube does tie right into that.  It makes bigger sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what is.  So we're hearing now more about Google TV.  We talked about last week the fact that they were doing a test with Dish using Google employees to do search and so forth.  Now we know a little bit more.  There's a what?  There's a set top box, right?  Gina set top box, Android based.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's Google, Intel and Sony.  And this from the New York Times article, the partners envision technology that will make it as easy for TV users to navigate web applications like the Twitter social network and Picasso photosite as it is to change the channel.  So we've seen this so many on the set top box.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've seen this so many companies founder on the rocks of this.  Yeah, from Microsoft to Apple to everybody on down.  This is a very hard thing to do.  Yahoo widgets allow this right now.  And nobody wants to tweet while on their big screen with what their remote control.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You don't want that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But there are a lot of developers out there who make it easier.  Who want to do a custom build of Android that will automate your BitTorrent and use Netflix and whatever.  I mean, this is I mean, this is going to be the ultimate media center operating system for your leg irons tied to the cable company falling off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what this is about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  If you can get if you have bandwidth and get access to most TV with ease, that's it.  Right.  And you still make you still pay for HBO.  Fine.  But does it have to come through the cable box?  Well, for now, it will, because they've got, you know, wrap up agreements.  But the more programming that goes free of the cable MSOs and much of it's being done from the cable companies, the more this strategy can work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man. But imagine the lawsuits.  I mean, you're basically building a gigantic piracy device.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, you're not. You're just it's an access device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  That happens to have built BitTorrent built into.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if I can find TV anywhere, which is the Comcast and Time Warner structure, if I can find Hulu, if I can find Twitter and Twig, if I can find YouTube, if I can get to any of this stuff in the post scheduled TV world, then that's the goal.  That's what Roku wants to do.  And it's what, you know, others want to do as well.  But they don't have the clout that Google has here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Google has monetization attached to that video.  That's part of the key.  Sorry, Gina.  No, no, that's OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's OK. I mean, I was going to say who else has done this?  So Apple TV, Roku, TiVo, to some extent, you know, there's Windows Media Center.  There's also like the software.  There's like Boxee and XMB, you know, XBMC and those kinds of.  But this is just like this feels like it could be the best of all those things because, well, because it's got Google behind it.  It's got that huge cloud.  It's got the leverage to make some deals.  And it's Android based, which is, you know, the fact that it's open.  XBMC and Boxee are, you know, some of the best media center software available as far as I'm concerned.  Oh, they're fantastic.  So, yeah, so this is.  I want to consider this too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So so fine.  You've got the iPad on one side with its closed deals and worlds.  But I take the Dell Mini 5 Android based with this Google software on it.  And I can watch anything that's available there in a pad device.  Apple has its closed deals with a certain number of magazine publishers, newspapers and TV producers.  I get the rest of the world.  Here's the problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The premium content providers are not going to want to play with a box like this because it does open up the door to piracy.  They're scared to death of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, but they are playing already.  That's what the TV anywhere thing means is that as long as I have the web, I will be able to watch the HBO shows I've paid for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that but that reason that works is because HBO and com or Time Warner in that case or Comcast in the case of Extenses have this kind of close relationship.  And you have to be a subscriber.  They got your IP address.  They got it locked down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going to stream it to me only.  Yeah, stream it on demand.  Try and save it.  That's fine.  OK.  Of of of big bandwidth.  If I could figure out what the FCC did last week with bandwidth, we really had 100 meg and had 100 meg wireless.  Who needs anything other than streaming?  Right.  I don't need to store things locally.  If I'm on an online on the plane, I don't need to store things locally.  That's the plane is the last frontier of the need for a hard drive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  But let's talk about the FCC.  It's called the National.  What is it?  National Bandwidth Plan or strategy or brought National Broadband Plan.  They want to take one of the things they want to do is take back spectrum from broadcasters and use that spectrum for kind of wireless anywhere.  Right.  I think this is this is a sensible thing because frankly, you know, the commercial ISPs just aren't going to see any value in stringing wire out to the rural users.  So that makes sense.  And then they want to increase our broadband to 100 megabits somehow.  Some magically 10 years, somehow magically 10 friggin years.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why do we have to wait so long?  It's available in other countries today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think this is why Google is doing all of this with its gigabit.  They got a lot of attention on that one.  I mean, that and by the way, a little later on, we're going to talk to a member of my local city council about what my town is doing.  And I think there's towns all over the country who are just slathering.  I don't know how they're going to choose a town, but they're going to do five towns that get this gigabit Internet service.  So the National Broadband Plan doesn't mention open access.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, that's the other big issue is that because you don't have open access, the belief is we won't have the competition needed to push this along.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  FCC has really stuck its claws into Internet in the past with very negative effects for one of the reasons, for instance, that there are monopolies in the cable company and the phone companies is because they were awarded, essentially awarded monopolies, duopolies for Internet access.  And, you know, I guess the FCC at the time believed that was necessary to get them to lay the cable.  But now there's no incentive to improve on the copper physical plant.  They've got to amortize the costs. And so there there is no incentive on the incumbents to increase the speed, right?  Which is what Google's trying to do is shake that loose.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google pushed for openness in the auction for Spectrum.  That's why they did it. And that's why they got some, you know, foot in the door on that.  Google's now going to push for market based 100 megabit.  Google's going to just push past this.  Now, Eric Schmidt did write and I put this on the friend feed, did write a post on the official Google blog kind of craziness.  But he's it's rather a political move.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the things the FCC is going to do that I think might might help put pressure on Internet service providers, they're going to collect and publish data that you can download an application that you can run that will then post it to the government.  And the government is then going to have a FCC broadband performance chart that that tells you who the who the sucky guys are.  And you could plug in your address and see everybody who offers service and who offers the best service.  So they're really going to to kind of improve the marketplace.  The problem is they've approved these duopolies.  So most places will have two choices, the phone company and the cable company.  Right. There'll be no magic third choice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's where that's where again Google comes in by pushing for the white spaces in the broadcast spectrum as super Wi Fi Wi Fi on steroids, as they say, that the key thing we must have is competition.  Yes, that's the problem.  And that's neutrality.  There's a very smart guy named Tom Epslin who have I ever mentioned him on the show?  I don't think so.  Epslin is to my mind the unsung hero of the Internet because he was in charge of AT&T World Net when he decided to drop the clock and go to flat rate 1995 a month pricing.  And when the clock turned off, we all said, oh, let's explore this thing as opposed to hearing the tick tick tick of chinkachinkachink going by.  Epslin then went on to found the first arbitrage market for VoIP.  And and then he said some things about regulation and his argument about regular net neutrality is it's a temporary need.  We wouldn't need the regulation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If we had competition, we wouldn't need it.  Absolutely.  Which is why it's not a good really not a good solution.  Just promote competition.  And that's kind of what this national broadband plan is supposed to do is to promote competition.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Schmitz post on on the Google blog so that he supports this because you bet ubiquitous broadband connectivity can catapult America into the next level of economic competitiveness, worker productivity, educational opportunity.  Amen, brother.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I've been saying this for a long time.  We need to kind of policy like we did in the Depression with rural electrification where the government gets behind the fact that we all need universal access to broadband services.  And makes it possible.  They have a connect America fund that to support the provision of affordable broadband and voice with at least four megabits actual download speeds nationwide.  Got to be behind that.  A mobility fund to provide targeted funding to ensure no states are lagging significantly behind the national average for 3G wireless.  I think I know this all looks good.  I mean, it really, you know, it's it's going to depend on where the rubber hits the road what actually happens.  But I mean, I I'll see anything here that I would argue against.  Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service and the means and skills to subscribe if they so choose.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did I talk about this postal guy I talked to?  No.  John Callan, he found me out of nowhere because he read my book wasn't a plug.  And he was at a meeting of postal people.  Ruth Goldway, the head of the now the head of the Postal Rate Commission, which oversees the Postal Service, was asked at a meeting, what would Google do if it had the post office?  And she had read my book.  He gave her a copy.  But she said Google would give everyone in America a computer and a printer.  Right.  Who needs mail?  If we had that right.  Right. If if we did make that a national strategy, what all falls out of that?  It's awesome. What happens?  You don't need a postal service anymore.  You don't need newspapers anymore.  You you change the entire nature of education and of publishing and of retail.  If we had ubiquity of connectivity in this country, you know, Schmidt calls it the space race.  But the space race was just to make a few advances in the far end of technology.  This makes such a difference.  This is the interstate system.  That's exactly what it is.  This is indoor plumbing.  It's infrastructure.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Definitely.  Six goals. Goal one to at least at least 100 million U.S.  homes should have affordable access to actual download speeds of at least 100 megabits a second.  Actual upload speeds.  I love this.  Of 50 megabits.  Yeah.  Upload.  This is where you're seeing a guy like Julius Genachowski, who worked in.  You know, he was this.  He did startups.  He worked in the tech business.  This guy knows what he's talking about.  He's leading the FCC from a point of view of not of ignorance, but of knowledge.  And boy, you see a huge difference when you say we want upload speeds of 50 gig 50 megabits.  That makes everybody a publisher.  Right.  Goal two.  The United States should lead the world in mobile innovation with the fastest and most  extensive wireless network of any nation.  By the way, these are long.  These are proposed long term goals.  I don't know.  I guess Congress would have to.  I don't know.  You know, it's these are lofty sentiments.  I don't know.  How you make it happen.  Goal three.  I mentioned every American affordable access goal for every American community.  I love this.  Every American community should have affordable access to at least one gigabit per second  broadband to anchor institutions like schools, hospitals and government buildings.  To ensure the safety of the American people, every first responder should have access to  a nationwide wireless interoperable interoperable broadband public safety network.  Amen.  Yeah.  Wow.  I can't argue with any of this.  Goal six.  To ensure that America leads in the clean energy economy, every American should be able  to use broadband to track and manage their real time energy consumption.  Somebody tacked that one on.  That's a Google word.  Yeah.  And it's green.  Okay.  Now I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.  Within the next three years, we're going to have major cyber warfare incursions into a  lot of infrastructure.  We're going to have collapses.  We're going to have the equivalent of terrorist attacks on our nationwide cyber infrastructure,  which is going to cause a complete shutdown and closed system.  And the government's going to step forward and do the, effectively do the Patriot Act  for the internet.  And all of these lofty goals are going to go by the wayside because we can't afford them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Aren't you the ray of sunshine?  What a downer, Leo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was just going to say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are not prepared for this and this is going to happen.  And we are, this, you know, I admire this.  I really admire these six goals and I think they should happen.  But, you know, we've got a bigger problem.  We have the most, our infrastructure is absolutely vulnerable.  And we have made no concerted effort to protect ourselves.  Basically, our heads are in the sand.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But this is how it works, right?  You get attacked, you shore up, you get attacked.  You know, this is how networks become secured, right?  Don't you feel like it's an arms race?  No.  In some extent, don't you feel like security often happens in response to attacks or you feel like proactively?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the real problem is the interdependence that we have now and the utter dependence and interdependence we have  makes us so vulnerable that an attack could have devastating impact, nothing that you could recover from.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, making, yes.  Not making everything under control.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are relying, we are now relying on the kindness of strangers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and those strangers are the Chinese.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they wish us ill.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is a piece, may I do this one, Leo?  There is a piece in the Chinese, China Daily from the Xinhua news agency that was, that is on the FriendFeed feed.  It is the party line propaganda on Google and China as Google prepares to potentially pull out next week,  or at least pull out of censored search.  And it's a fascinating read because it says that first Google claims without any evidence the Chinese government  supported these hackers' attacks against it.  It's threatened to pull out of the Chinese market if the government doesn't compromise on internet regulations.  American politicians and government institutions spoke up to back up the company and show the world a slapstick commentary.  The most amazing thing to be recognized, says China,  no country will allow information about subversion, separation, racialism and terrorism to circulate in it through the internet.  Sovereignty and borders also exist in cyberspace.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, they do not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Amen, which will need to be watched by each country's laws and regulations.  This is the real war.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what you're seeing?  You're seeing a pissing war.  But the Chinese cannot act unilaterally.  They have such a huge investment in the US economy that they can't just say we're going to make it this way.  I mean, they have the power, I guess, to do so, but their economy relies on the robustness of our economy at this point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know, but they also have different priorities.  There's a sure discussion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  Here's the great line.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is a great pity that the Google case told us the company's aim of entering the Chinese market seems not for commercial reasons,  but to act as a tool to penetrate into the Chinese culture as well as into Chinese people's values.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, they're running dogs of capitalists.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it is a modernism fight too.  It's not to get controversial and get us bombed, but it also goes into the discussion about parts of the Middle East as well and the Chinese government.  And it's about freedom versus a lack of freedom.  We're fighting over nothing less.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet it's not weapons of mass destruction that are going to be the real problem here.  It's cyber warfare.  And the Chinese have shown a willingness to use these tools.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I'm going to go build a bunker tonight.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, seriously.  I hate to be a downer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hate to be a downer, but truthfully, all I see is increasing dependence on cyber technology and interdependence.  And frankly, it seems to me, and I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary, that it's a house of cards that is just not very robust.  I mean, Gina, you're a programmer.  You know how hairy this all is.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Uh-huh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's impossible to secure.  And so I think truthfully what will happen, I think these are the kinds of lofty sentiments this international broadband or national broadband plan, kind of lofty sentiments you have as you had in the 60s.  We're going to launch a man to the moon.  And then reality sets in.  And by the way, we don't have any money to go to anywhere else.  We're going to just stay here now that we've done that.  And I have a feeling, I just have a feeling that in years to come, we're going to say, well, yeah, this would be nice.  But really what we better do is make sure that all of you have rigidly controlled Internet access.  Ouch.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Total security is not possible.  It's not possible.  It's not possible.  It's a myth.  There's no way to completely secure a network.  But there are ways to monitor and to make things and to build things in a certain way that make them more secure.  And I'm certainly not an expert.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And there's the Jonathan Zittrain argument that you kind of have even in your own machine, you have a bifurcated open and closed world so that you have something you do know is secure and something that is open and less harmful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But don't you think we are moving and maybe we are part of the problem of moving everybody towards this open world and not reminding them to keep part of their stuff safe and private?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the irony is what gets attacked most?  Microsoft's closed worlds.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's just because it's a big, it's a big, no, it's just because it's a big public face.  Because it's a big public facing target.  Yeah.  That's all.  Same reason why Sutton robbed the bank.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's just where the money is stored.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in fact, it's a more difficult place, a more difficult surface to attack.  That doesn't deter anybody.  As long as there's something inside that safe, they're going to attack the safe.  As soon as you start putting your goodies in somewhere less secure, you're wide open.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what do you think we should do, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would bury gold in the backyard.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What is the equivalent of a bomb shelter in a cyber world?  Whatever that is.  I'd have a, I would say get a garden and some solar panels.  The less dependent you are upon the national infrastructure, the safer you'll be should that infrastructure,  which to me looks like it's getting more and more vulnerable, should it collapse.  I've been listening to no agenda too much.  I'm just going to stop right here.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think Gina's going to put her snugly up over her head and hide.  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm like, well, an encrypted disk image.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you do not?  But I mean, does anything I said not make sense?  Can you give me a, I'd like to not believe any of that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Everything that we do every single day, where there's some measure of trust,  you're putting yourself in your hands and just driving down the street.  You're kind of putting your trust in the car on the other side that it's not going to run into you.  I mean, I, listen, I agree with you, but like, it's hard for me to think that my own personal backups are less secure than, or more secure than Google servers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not worried about your backups.  I'm worried about, you know, the grid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. You're right about the grid.  The water supply.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that is the analogy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The food supply.  So what do we do?  There's a reservoir, you know, serving Jersey City.  You could go and poison the reservoir.  It is possible.  We've talked about it through terrorism.  It's there.  It's not done.  Why isn't it done?  Well, you have police.  They control somewhat, but they don't control.  Absolutely.  We play the odds.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I guess I'm just going to get really good at like wilderness camping or something.  I would.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know what to do.  You just kind of have to live with it.  Right.  You're right.  I mean, this could have always happened.  It just seems like we're moving in the direction where we're more and more relying on our infrastructure.  You know what?  What stimulated this was this great lofty goal for a national broadband plan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which we do need.  Which we do need.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet, I certainly hope there is also equivalent energies, if not more energies, being put  into protecting our infrastructure, our national cyber infrastructure.  So that's interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where does that innovation come from?  I saw that, I think it was Peter's, Peter Principal said on Twitter this week that he  talked to some bankers who said that all the innovation in Wall Street in the last  10 years went to going around regulations.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I stood up at South by Southwest at a great session about seed incubators, seed accelerators,  because I want to do something like that for journalism at CUNY.  And I said, we have no innovation and entrepreneurship in journalism, so we've got to find a way  to create it.  So where is the fountain of innovation in security?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is a good question.  Is that something the government, is that what government should be investing in?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could be in Fort Meade.  Maybe we don't know about, maybe there's a wonderful team of very expert people.  I would hope that a lot of the best minds of the current generation would be going into  this particular area and thinking about it.  Because I think it's something we have to resolve.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You see people like our dear friend, Matt Cutts, who in his way is devoting his career  to playing Whac-A-Mole.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good for him.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Good for him.  That's what he does.  And he's, when he talked on the show last time, which I think was a very important moment  when he said that Google is looking for signals of quality and originality, there's a continuum  of spam.  He's not just looking for the bad guys, he's helping look for the good stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just look at things like that story out of Austin after we left.  Some guy broke into, it was easy to do, trivial to do, broke into the dealer's database.  The dealer had been putting, this Texas car dealer had been putting little black boxes  in every single car they sold where they were carrying the paper so that if the people defaulted  on the loan, they could turn the car off.  And this guy got fired, he got laid off, so he said, well, screw it.  And he got into the database and he started disabling cars or making their horns go off  without stop and over a hundred cars before they finally tracked him down.  But here's my problem.  First of all, the dealer was putting these little black boxes in every car they sold.  Then they had this first thing.  Yeah.  Problem one, I'm sure they didn't tell anybody.  Problem two, they didn't secure it.  Obviously, I mean, the guy was fired and he got into the database.  They had a poorly secured database and software that allowed this guy to disable the cars  or make their horns beep.  I think we've got like a million of those out there.  I'm just, you know, who has the OnStar database?  Who's securing that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whatever connected refrigerator can go off tomorrow.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  And we starve.  Anyway, let's, I'm sorry.  That was a very big downer.  I apologize.  We're going to, we're going to cheer you all up.  It's time for our tip.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Time for you to chug a beer and go crowd surfing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, but you know, it's all seriousness though.  I would love to have someone on the show, a guest on the show one week to, that who's  doing this kind of work at that kind of level to talk about, you know, exactly what's going  on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody I've ever talked to about cyber warfare is an incredible downer.  Oh boy.  But I'll try to find somebody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let's go on to the tip of the week.  I think Jonathan's the trend.  Bruce Schneier are two very good people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll get Bruce on.  I'd love to get Bruce on.  That would be fantastic.  I could get Bruce on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Bruce depresses me too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he's probably one of the guys that really knows more than anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jonathan's a trend from Berkman who wrote the book, I think the future of the internet  and how to stop it is brilliant on this topic and has concrete suggestions for what we should  do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'd like to know more.  And I would love for us to, as hosts, to kind of compile like the list of things one should  consider before moving your stuff into the cloud.  You know, what does it mean when you move your stuff into the cloud?  What does that mean?  So things like, you know, people need a subpoena versus a search warrant to get to your data  or like what can go wrong, what you should know in terms of, I mean, because we do advocate  for moving to the cloud, but it would be good for us to have kind of a list of like things  you should know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Gina, something we talked about before that I think you pointed out, I was on the  plane coming back from Austin with Charlie O'Donnell, who's an investor in Backupify.  And he was saying that the real strategy isn't backing up at all.  It is fluidity.  It is not being imprisoned to anything.  Yes.  And that's the key.  And then he goes back to our discussion earlier on the show about identity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and also getting away from a monoculture, which this is where I really fear is that  we are moving to our monoculture where everything is stored at Google.  And of course, everybody knows a monoculture is a bad idea.  Where all your eggs are in one basket is a bad idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whether that's your data or your identity or your tracks of what you've done, you want  fluidity with it.  And having it on a five inch disc at home is not necessarily the best.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a very, it's a really interesting topic.  We're also going to talk in just a bit about the ramping up of local municipalities trying  to get this gigabit Google because the deadline for nominations is March 26th is less than  a week away.  And so the campaign is on, whether it's Topeka, Troy, or my little town of Petaluma.  Everybody wants to get this gigabit and only five, five cities are going to get it.  We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  But first our tip, our tool and our number of the week, starting with Gina Turpani, your  tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  My tip this week is for Google Calendar users who often schedule meetings with other people  who also have Google calendars.  In Google Calendar Labs, in Calendar, if you click on the little labs beaker at the top,  there's a new labs feature called smart rescheduler.  And if you enable it on your calendar, if you have to reschedule an event, it will recommend  the best times where all the people who are attending your event are free based on their  calendar.  So it's an easy way to see who's free and what time would work best for all the attendees.  So really good for Google Calendar users who often schedule things with other calendar  users.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love though.  Okay.  And I would love to know how it works, what it does.  I would love to know anything.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  There's nothing I can click.  It just says helps you reschedule an event by analyzing everybody's schedule, evaluating  conflicts, obtaining conference rooms and proposing the best meeting times.  It's like magic.  It's like magic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's all you have to know.  When you just click on that enable.  Okay.  I've enabled it.  And then you have to scroll all the way down and click save.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I have to say I have to turn it on.  I always forget to do that.  Now it's in here.  It's smart rescheduler and it's just over on the right hand side.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.  And you just click on events.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to find something that people have invited me to, right?  Yeah.  Current Geek Weekly.  Oh, find a new time.  Loading calendars.  Look at that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it checks out the different calendars and gives you a suggestion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a couple of steps, but kind of a new level.  I want Google to run my life.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Forget what I said about monoculture.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hand myself over to the Google.  I give you my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always the trade off, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The risk, the convenience versus risk.  The convenience of automatically checking your friends' schedules.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It must go into my friends' schedules then.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, they have to have shared their calendars with you.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which you'll do in an enterprise.  Sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  In an enterprise situation, absolutely.  There's a lot of labs features there in the Google Calendar labs.  It's very cool.  I love the labs.  I love the Gmail labs.  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, would you plug your wonderful, wonderful piece about all these great Google tricks?  Oh, yes, please.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, sure.  I wrote the current issue of Maximum PC Magazine.  I think it's the April issue.  The cover story is the Power Users Guide to Google Apps.  And it's like eight pages, 48 tips.  I mean, I learned a lot of stuff researching this article that I didn't realize that certain Google Apps could do.  It covers all apps from Maps to Picasa to Picasa web albums to Gmail.  Anyway, it is now online, so you don't have to buy the magazine, but you should buy the magazine.  Just in case you don't want to kill trees, it's online now.  We bookmarked it in the friend feed.  It's at MaximumPC.com.  This is a great magazine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You should get this magazine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It is a pretty great magazine.  And the layout's really cool.  And I got pictures of my grandpa-in-law in screenshots of Picasa.  Cool Easter egg.  Yeah, yeah.  It was right around the time that he passed.  I was happy that the editors didn't cut those.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun to write that article.  And I got my little Wave plug in there.  And it's, yeah, calendar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny, when I clicked the link, it linked it to DIG.  Okay, here we go.  The Power Users Guide to Google Apps.  There you go.  Wonderful.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And there's lots of tips in there.  I'll mention the few that kind of surprised me in upcoming episodes as my tip.  I've got a font of tips now.  I'm never going to be without a tip.  This is going to last me for like six months.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One guy suggested that my number of the week should be the number of times that you've stolen my number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That number growing all the time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I did have three choices this week, one of which was the data about the YouTube deal.  But I have another one.  Danny Sullivan has a stat rant.  You're kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I chose your number again?  I put three up there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's fine.  You're learning.  Danny Sullivan has a very good stat rant up at Search Engine Land, which he answers this hit wise story that came out last week that I've talked about that said that Facebook was becoming bigger than Google and Twitter and sending to publishers.  And Danny digs in quite well.  The number was 3.64% of the Facebook is 3.4% of the source to news media sites.  Google News 1.27% and Twitter 0.14%.  Couple problems with this.  Number one is Twitter, you cannot count as Twitter.com.  Most of Twitter, of course, is over other apps and so on.  And it makes it impossible to count the power of Twitter.  I look at Bitly as a proxy, but it's only a partial proxy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sure I follow more links from Twitter than any other source.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  But then Danny dug in further and the numbers came out this way that Google sites as a whole caused 20% of the links, clicks to news publisher sites.  Take that Mr. Murdoch.  Yahoo 18%, MSN 8%, and Facebook 3.64%.  So Facebook is nothing to sneeze at.  But Google hadn't caught a cold yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Facebook for the first time this week had more visitors than Google, right?  Wasn't that in the US?  Wasn't that an interesting statistic too?  That was a new stat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of weird.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But again, Google isn't really a site to visit.  You don't visit Google.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But still more traffic to the Facebook page than the Google page is still a big number.  That's weird.  That doesn't sound possible.  It seems weird.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's wrong.  It's wrong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So my tool is a tool for your Android folks.  I'm not giving up on Buzz.  I'm not.  I just won't.  Google released.  Let's not show somebody's phone number here.  Let me go back to the front page.  I do that all the time.  Google released a new widget.  Oh, I love this widget.  You can download.  You do need to use, I think, Android One 6 or later.  But if you go to the Android Marketplace and you search for Google Buzz, you will find  a new Buzz widget.  You know, I commented on Buzz that it would be really nice if Google's API was advanced  enough that there were some really good third party developers writing Buzz applications.  But they don't yet really give you the tools you need to write Buzz applications.  So we're going to have to let Google do the widgets for the time being.  But this is really nice.  I put it right on my front page because, again, I'm trying to get people to use Google Buzz.  It automatically does the location.  I can add a picture.  I can add multiple pictures to it.  And then I can tweet out with it.  And it's...  You can tweet out?  Did I say tweet?  Oh, you said tweet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Son of a bitch.  I can buzz out with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Damn.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Damn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there you go.  There's the problem in a nutshell.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I used it a few times yesterday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You also have the option to do public and private.  It basically does everything you can do on the web interface.  And what's nice is that a mobile interface does not give you all of these capabilities.  So you really do need a standalone application or a widget of some kind to make this work.  If you click the Buzz icon on the widget, it'll take you to a browser with Buzz.  And this little multi picture will allow you to pick a photo or two from your gallery.  So a really nice way to buzz.  And if more people would please use Buzz, I would be very gratified.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Neat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But nobody's using it, so it's over for Buzz.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A lot of good conversations have on Buzz.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love the...  You know, see, to me, threaded conversations are so great.  And I don't understand.  The same thing happened to me when I left Twitter for Jaiku and nobody followed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then I left Twitter for Plurk and nobody followed me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I left Twitter for FriendFeed and nobody followed me.  Now I've left Twitter for Buzz and nobody's following me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And next you're going to leave everybody for your bunker.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Come, go into the bunker.  And nobody follows you.  Screw y'all.  So I brought my member of the City Council, Petaluma City Council in.  Her name is Tiffany Renee.  She's a wonderful person.  Hi, Tiffany.  Hello, Leo.  Thank you for coming in.  Tiffany, before she became a member of the City Council, and actually still probably is,  since they pay you $5 a meeting, was a web designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still a web designer.  You still have to do that, don't you?  The hacking is actually crippling my ability to be a web designer.  Is it really?  It is.  Last year was really tough.  No kidding.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No kidding.  So I guess I wasn't wrong.  So one of the things Petaluma has been doing, like a lot of other communities, is lobbying  hard to get Google to put that gigabit internet service in here.  So what is a town, what do you do?  How do you get people to, what do you need to do, I guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We, it actually started as a really grassroots process.  We had a couple of people bring it up to us, and I had heard about it and mentioned it  to a few people, and it just has gotten a lot of traction.  We have a new member of the Technology and Telecommunications Committee that has kind  of really led that charge.  That's nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And does the community understand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that there are members of the community who really get it, and others that may not  understand it or just haven't been connected yet to know what it means to us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the things you've done, and I think many municipalities have done this, is create  a Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we were late in the game on that.  We actually just started that on Monday, and it actually took off like a rocket once we  got it up.  We're a little behind on that compared to the other cities, but it's growing by the  minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of like campaigning for the Olympics.  It's kind of a long shot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is.  I think you need some gimmicks.  Like what?  I just asked the chat room, here's my first bid.  Okay.  I think you need to get every school child in Petaluma in a school bus and drive down  to the campus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you go.  And beg and plead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And sing the Google song or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there a Google song?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Make one up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Make up a Google song and sing it.  I love you Google.  Oh, yes we do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, who can refuse singing school children?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  Can we do that, Tiff?  If you're nearby enough, you can beat Topeka.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is Topeka the front runner?  Topeka wins.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  I hope Topeka is not the front runner.  You have Twig and other wonderful things there.  You're in Cyberville.  You must win.  You must gather the talent together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're the hub to Sonoma Wine Country and we're within the Bay Area.  Google could drive up here.  They wouldn't have to fly to the cities.  That's true.  They could drive up.  I think there's a lot of reasons why it would be great for Google to choose us.  And it would be like a vacation for the folks from Google to do it here as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  San Jose Mercury News writes, Gaga for Google.  Communities compete for high speed internet.  They're swilling Google-tinis in Sarasota, Florida, vowing to Google-ize the names of their first born children in Duluth.  Topeka has...  See, I think you've got to do something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you've got to bribe the Googlers.  What products is Petaluma known for besides slugs?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're known for slugs?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I went to... I judged a slug bake-off years ago.  What?  I thought it was there.  Are you thinking Santa Cruz?  I think you're thinking Santa Cruz.  I'm sorry about that.  I didn't mean to besmirch.  Good Lord.  What is Petaluma known for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're known for butter and eggs and wrestling.  And twit.  And absolutely twit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And twit.  I think this is the pitch, right, Tiffany?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  School children cook the largest omelet at Google and then Leo wrestles in it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Topeka has renamed itself Google Kansas.  Troy is bringing out 100 Uncle Sam's.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How pathetic.  You're much hipper than this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The city of Palo Alto, which really is just down the road from Google, says,  the whole country is going goo goo over Google.  If I were Google, I'd look very hard at Palo Alto.  We've got a lot of Facebook employees living here.  That's not good.  That's not what Google wants to do, is empower Facebook employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things I think that the other cities are missing that we do have is Leo and twit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And no Facebook employees live here or Yahoo employees.  Right, Tiffany?  I don't think so.  No.  And if they do, we'll ship them out.  We'll banish them.  If there are any Facebook employees that live in Petaluma, you're gone.  How about that?  That's what Google's looking for.  You said that, not me.  Oh, I know.  How about Apple employees?  We'll tar and feather them.  In butter and eggs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In butter and eggs.  We'll make an omelet out of them.  It'll be an apple omelet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is interesting how much competition.  What does it mean, do you think, economically for a community if they get this fiber for communities?  I think it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The ability for our schools to get the bandwidth is key, I think, to their success.  Make a big difference in schools, yeah.  It would make a huge difference for them.  I think for Petaluma, we have a large number of creatives that live here, people that work from home, people that commute to the Bay Area.  And I think that's one of the target demographics that Google is looking for, are people that are willing to step up and demand that kind of bandwidth and use it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, boosters were planning to get residents to form a human We Love Google sign at the local football stadium.  You can talk and talk, Tiffany, but where's our We Love Google sign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But will they buy it if they lay it?  And I think Petalumans will buy it if they lay it.  If you lay it, we will come.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's bad.  That's not going to work.  That's not going to work.  A blogger in upstate New York lobbying for Buffalo says, at least take Buffalo out of the Dark Ages and bring our internet power up to the rest of the world.  Boca Raton says, hey, we're the birthplace of the IBM personal computer.  Holland, Michigan, the Public Works folks created a superhero.  It's like the Olympics.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You've got to step up here and make some kind of vow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What can I do, Jeff?  What could I do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Shave your head.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll shave my head if Google walk.  Geez, I'll walk down.  I'll tell you what.  I'll dress up in a giant chicken outfit.  And what should I do, Tiffany?  Walk down the street, the main street of Petalumans, maybe go to Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You've got to go to Google.  Go to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would Google?  What would?  Okay.  So help me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tattoo the Google logo to yourself?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will tattoo Google on my forehead so that every Twitch broadcast for the rest of eternity.  No, maybe that's going too far.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think shaving the G in the back of your head could be pretty cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  I'll shave a G and I'll dye it multicolors.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You need the multicolors.  You kind of need the Google balls, the multicolored balls.  Deal.  The chicken outfit is ... So is that about the eggs?  What's the chicken outfit about?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this used to be a big butter and eggs capital of the world.  There's a Woody Allen joke in there somewhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There really is.  We need the eggs.  We did that one before.  You could vow to beat your crowd surfing record at the Googleplex.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will crowd surf my ... I know.  I will crowd surf my way from Petaluma to Mountain View.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So this is just a big ad campaign for Google, right?  This is what this means.  Yeah, look who's getting the benefit.  They're not doing good for a community.  They're actually just getting communities to do free advertising for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In Sarasota, Florida, citizens have rechristened a water-bound park as Google Island.  A local restaurateur is serving Google-tinis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got to move way past this.  I think you got to go to the Googleplex.  That's your advantage over everybody else, and you speak Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, what if I just had a lone person with my staff, my backpack, and a sign?  What should the sign say?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I've got it.  You'll camp out on the lawn of the Googleplex and broadcast from there until they give you ...  That's not a bad idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Should I do that, Tiffany? What do you think?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the gimmicks are great, but I don't think that they're really reality.  I think Petaluma's got the reality.  We have a telecom committee. We have a technology and telecom committee.  We did. I used to serve on it.  We're really committed to the innovations.  I don't necessarily see that with some of the other cities that are doing the gimmicks.  I think they're fun, and they're great to get the ...  But it doesn't tell Google what it needs to know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. I do think that our application will be very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our city's very committed to the process.  They've been spending quite a bit of time at City Hall working on it.  Our technology and telecommunications committee has really reached out to the community,  and the community has responded in big ways.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What Petaluma and all these communities are asking people to do is go to a ridiculous URL,  which is google.com slash app serve slash fiber RFI.  Oh, that's easy to remember.  We should make a bit late for this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we need to shorten that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Should I ... Wait a minute, let me fix that.  I can do that. That much I can do.  Let me give it a bit late link for this one going here.  Make it slash Petaluma, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because we don't want anybody else to use it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We should use the Google shortener.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, should we use a Google ... How do you get to the Google?  It's goo.gl, is that it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I have the bookmark lit here somewhere.  Google URL shortener. Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tiffany, this is what happens on the show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this is where the rat hole of the show goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can also go to facebook.com slash Google Petaluma.  Google Petaluma, that's where we are right now. That's easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I want the world to vote for us.  All right, yeah, yeah, go to facebook.com slash Google Petaluma.  You don't even have to be a Facebook user.  And if it's some other town, go ahead, you can go there and use the link.  That'll take you to that silly Google fiber for communities.  Their goal is to install this, I think, into five different towns  ranging in size from 50,000 to 500,000.  So we just make the cut. We're a little over 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do, and actually there's other communities.  Santa Rosa, which is just north of here, and actually our smart train system,  the railway that comes through Sonoma County,  they're also interested in applying as well.  And Google may look at all three of our applications  and see those as a really powerful mix.  Together, huh?  Together.  That's a good idea.  And make a concerted effort for all of Sonoma County,  which is mostly the hub through the 101  where the smart train runs from Petaluma to Santa Rosa.  So there's some exciting propositions, I think, out there for Google  in terms of what we are proposing as a city  and then also the other communities in the county.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, the truth is this Facebook page is pretty cute.  We kind of know what Petaluma is all about.  There's a lot of great little posts on here.  There is a lot of interest for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've gotten some kids, some of our youth are up there posting  what kinds of things that they would do with it.  And I think that's important.  That's part of the information that Google is looking for  is what people will do with it, what the interests are.  And, you know, heaven forbid we don't get the award, the application.  Then I'm moving to it.  We know what our community is looking for so that we can deal with our infrastructure needs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good point. Very good point. I like that.  Thank you, Tiffany, for coming in.  You're going to like Topeka.  I'm not moving to Topeka.  They have a lot of bunkers there.  Yeah, after saying, oh, yeah, we're all too reliant on monoculture and infrastructure,  I'm saying, but I'd be glad to give up all of my different connections  for one Google connection.  Yeah, just think of that.  Cool. You could say that the whole Twitter network runs on Google fiber.  How about that? How about that?  I'd be glad to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah. Anyway, I did make a bit.ly bit.ly.  You could also go there.  And you have till March 26 to vote for your community, whatever community it is.  And we'll be very interested.  I think the next time we're on the show, we'll probably be talking about,  I don't know how they're going to do this, announce nominees and then make you dance.  Dance, Petaluma, dance.  If you want Google, make Leo shave his head.  Yes, I will. I'll shave my head with a G and I'll dye it in color.  Will you burn your iPhone?  I will gladly. I will take my iPhone and smash it with a sledgehammer  and vow only to use the Nexus One forever or until the iPhone 4 comes out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you've got to make a YouTube video with a hammer poised over it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. That's good.  Or I can have it poised over the Nexus One.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think there's many people in town to make videos with what they'll do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a great idea. See, a little creativity.  What they would do with fiber.  Tiffany, thank you for coming in. I really appreciate it.  Thank you, Leo.  Tiffany Renee is a member of the City Council of Petaluma and a good friend.  And it's so nice to see you.  Enjoy spring. Happy spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy spring, everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And, you know, whatever community you're in, I think getting Google Fiber would be a big deal.  But where would you get more publicity, Google, than right here?  Really.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not that you're selling your soul or anything, Leo, but...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd sell my soul for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me Gigabit Fiber and I'll sell my soul more.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What a man will do for a man when... My gosh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.  And now in paper form. Amazing.  Her blog, of course, is smarterware.org.  You can catch her writing in Maximum PC Magazine this month and many other great places.  And it's always great to see you, Gina. Thank you.  Thanks for having me. Fun show today.  Thank you for... I see you've divested yourself with the slanket.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I did. It's a little warm here in San Diego today, but the slanket...  I'm wrapped up in this slanket pretty much nightly, although it's pretty fuzzy.  I'm still trying to wash it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are the red fuzzballs still plaguing you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The red fuzzballs are creating some tension in my house.  There's a little problem here with the fuzzballs.  So I'm going to wash it with a towel. That's the next tactic.  So maybe the little physics, little friction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that how you get rid of fuzzballs?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm no Martha Stewart, but I'm going to try that.  I'll report back next week to tell you how that went.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is the man in charge at BuzzMachine.com.  I'm going to get your picture up here, Jeff.  You're confusing us again.  I'm confusing you again.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If Gina can do it, I can do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would Google do? That's the name of the book.  And everybody should go out and buy it quickly as possible.  Thank you, Jeff, for being here.  Thank you.  Really appreciate it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thank you again for a great fun time in Austin, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had so much fun in Austin. What a great time that was.  It was so great to have you with us together.  We were snuggly free.  And I am wearing my...  There we go. We're putting on our Google snugglies.  We're braving the red fuzzball menace.  To beg Google, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bring fiber to Petaloma.  I beg of you.  What a nice little town. It's a cute little town.  Lots of lovely people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll all be glad to get gigabit.  We'll see you all next time on This Week in Google. Bye-bye.  This thing's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shh.
