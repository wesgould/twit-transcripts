Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You got it. Greetings, humans.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Greetings, humans. She is not one of us, but we can only aspire to be one of her.  Jeff Jarvis is also here. He is the man behind the Buzz Machine at BuzzMachine.com,  professor of journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York and a podcaster himself.  His Guardian podcast is called Media Talk USA.  And today, joining us from the Googleplex, Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick.  Brian is the guy, one of the guys from the data liberation front, which we've talked about before,  but I thought it'd be great to get him on and talk in more detail about what DLF is all about.  Brian, it's great to have you.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Oh, it's great to be here. Thanks for having me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When did you start working for Google and what did you start doing when you started at Google?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  I started in 2005 and I was asked to move to Mountain View and I respectfully declined to do so because I'm a big fan of staying in Chicago.  And so I started off working on Google code actually, a project hosting feature.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which we're very familiar with, especially Gina, of course. That's neat.  And you're still in Chicago?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Still in Chicago. It used to be me and 45 salespeople here and now it's...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One developer and 45 salespeople. That's about the right ratio, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a bad ratio.  Only for the developer.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  We're doing a lot better now. We're almost 100 engineers and about 300 salespeople.  The odds are a lot better, I'd say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can fight them off. If they should turn into zombies, you'll be okay.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  I don't know, 300 zombies sounds a little scary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You've got to be able to barricade that door. I just start planning now, just in case.  So what is the idea behind the data liberation front?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, the idea is that we're coming into a big paradigm shift in general.  You're not storing data on your computer or your laptop so much anymore as you're storing it on the internet, in the cloud.  I think that it's a big shift for some people.  Some people feel more comfortable with it, some people feel less comfortable with it.  And we want people to trust us with their data.  So if we're going to do that, I think it's important that you can get your data out again.  That it's easy to be able to take your data with you and maybe go somewhere else if you decide to.  I think people in general just don't think about that so much when they're putting their data in.  They think about it when something happens, whether it's extended downtime or they find a better product somewhere or something to that extent.  And they want to take their data out. Only then do they really look and see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where did the initiative come from? Was it from the ground up? Was it from you guys?  Or was it from the front office who said, Brian, we've got to do this?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  No, it was definitely the ground up.  I was sitting around talking with some other engineers.  Even before I came to Google, I often heard Eric Schmidt talk about the fact that we don't lock our users in.  He ended his talks with it for years.  We realized that we were looking through some of our products.  While it's true you can get your data out, sometimes it was a little bit of a pain in the butt.  It took you a long time, or it was a matter of jumping through hoops, or pasting something into the URI bar and then add a number at the end, etc.  If APIs and that sort of thing are accessible to engineers, we needed something that was more accessible to your average user.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it something new or just exposing something that was already there?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  We started about two years ago, actually, working on iGoogle.  Our first engineer working on the project came from the iGoogle team.  It was a logical place to get our feet wet.  Then we moved to Blogger.  Google Docs was our real big launch last month.  We've done Google Sites, Notebook, Finance, and then other products are actually starting to do it themselves as well.  We're really happy to see that because obviously we can't keep going to every product and doing it for them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You guys, if you've got any questions...  Looks like we lost Gina. I'll bring Gina back in.  Jeff, if you've got a question at all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just see an opportunity here. I wish there were a business, someone that would start a business that would make it easy for me to back up my entire cloud.  That used the API for the data liberation front and used whatever Facebook has or hasn't and what Gina is doing with Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be great that I know that my life is being stored somewhere off of all of those places in some standard formatted way.  That's just a wish for somebody to go make billions of dollars on the idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are a lot of these online backup services. We just interviewed Ubuntu One.  Microsoft has theirs. There's a lot of commercial services.  You're right. I think that's a natural. It's a great opportunity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does the DLF end up becoming part of standard setting for the whole idea of data freedom and backup?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  With regard to standards, we're making sure that we use existing standards in open formats.  We don't want to get down the rat hole of defining formats or anything proprietary.  You can actually have a copy of your data in proprietary format and not be able to access it.  We're hoping that what we're doing is something that other companies pick up on and see the importance of doing it just for users in general.  If you look back to 10 years ago, you'd have to go buy a piece of software at a store in a box on a floppy.  You're talking about 5.25 inch floppies in your last show.  You take it home and install it. That was a high barrier to entry.  Nowadays, if you want to try a piece of software, it's just a matter of typing a URL in.  With the ability to switch so easily and try other software, I think trust is coming into the picture much more than it has in the past.  I see this as a contributory measure to making sure that users still trust us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It seems like a good marketing move.  What are you going to say? It's a good idea from a point of view of marketing.  As long as you walk the walk, it doesn't really matter if you're just saying it for marketing or PR purposes or not.  You get the sense that there's a serious commitment to not only doing this now, but an ongoing commitment that every time there's a new product from Google,  that there will be an interface, there will be an API, there will be access to the data.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's even going beyond the API to a point where it's easy.  Our end goal is to click a button and take everything with you.  There's a big launch. As you guys said, there's a bunch of launches this week.  One thing we launched is a one-click button to take all your docs and spreadsheets out of Google Docs.  All your documents, you can sort of roll them up into a format that you choose and give them to you as a zip file.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's cool. That's really great.  That's great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a useful...  Is there a kind of set of principles about this that's emerging and best practices that are emerging that if we take the list that you have and go to Facebook and say, we want that?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, so, I mean, on a very high level, there's three questions that we sort of say that you should ask before you're putting your data into any sort of cloud product.  The first question is, can I get my data out at all?  And the second question is, how much is it going to cost to get the data out?  And the last one is, how much of my time is it going to take to get it out?  So, if you can't get it out at all, it's a non-starter.  If it's going to cost you extra, we'd say that we don't think everything needs to be free.  If you're paying $10 a month or a year for a service, then that should include the ability to get your data out.  And lastly, how much time?  Again, going back to the Docs example, my wife and I use Google Docs a lot to collaborate on stuff, and we have two, three hundred Docs.  And if I had to get all those out one at a time by clicking through the export process, that's going to take me a whole afternoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's well be locked in.  Right. That's a really good point. We're in that same boat. We use it all the time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wait, wait. I got to ask. Do you and your wife collaborate on software or on life?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's shopping lists, to-do lists.  Who's going to pick up the kids?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  We've got a hundred... definitely not collaborating on writing software.  We've got a hundred-year-old house here in the city that we've been in the process of restoring.  How neat.  And there's a whole lot of stuff to track on that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Brian, I have a question for you.  I'm one of these crazy people who once a month I go in and I pop all of my Gmail locally so that I have all my mail saved onto my hard drive.  And I actually have a calendar reminder for a while.  I had this cron job running, but I didn't want to keep my computer on all the time.  So now by hand, I launch Thunderbird and download all my Gmail, right?  Because I feel like if I'm locked out of my Gmail account, I at least want to have my archives on my hard drive.  But I'm crazy, and I don't think a lot of people do that.  So I'm curious to know if you back up your Gmail and or export your Gmail in any way and how you do it.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that's crazy at all, actually.  I mean, interesting note.  When we first launched the blogger, Dayliberation, we started seeing users downloading their entire blog every week.  And we were trying to figure out what was going on here, but we finally figured out it was exactly what you're talking about.  People were backing up their blogs locally because they felt more comfortable.  You know, I liken it to flying in an airplane.  It's arguably safer than driving in your car, especially in Chicago.  But most people tend to feel a little less safe in airplanes.  They tend to be more tentative about flying on a plane.  I think the same applies in general to cloud-based computing.  So anything that you have, the lockout example is a great example most people don't think about.  But anything you have in our clusters is going to be stored multiple times across multiple data centers and that sort of thing.  Again, one of my goals, in particular, friends of mine who take a lot of digital photos, they're kids, that sort of thing.  I always tell them, for the sake of heaven, back up your pictures.  I know somebody lost a hard drive, lost the first two years of their children's photos.  That's horrible.  And I think I'm on a crusade, I guess, to get people to think about that and about data liberation to some extent.  The analogy that I like to use is, if you're living in whatever, insert your city here, and you have a nice apartment,  but you find a nicer apartment that's bigger, better view, with a better price.  And you call your landlord and you say, look, I'm going to end my lease in two months when it ends, not going to renew.  Just wanted to let you know I'm going to need my security deposit back.  And the landlord says, that's fine, no problem.  When you move out, you can't take any of your photos or your clothing or your furniture or that sort of thing.  Your cat.  The cat. I don't know if they want the cat too.  No, I don't think they want the cat.  But in any case.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Are there requirements in place?  When you start to build a new product at Google, is export an initial consideration on the requirements list?  Or is it something that gets patched on later?  It seems like things are getting the ability to export like docs later on.  I mean, is the data liberation part of the initial product specification process now?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, docs already had exportability.  It wasn't what we would call as liberated as we'd like.  It wasn't as easy as it could be.  We're hearing more from products earlier on.  They want to talk just a little bit about what we think is better for them to do.  They're just looking for advice and wanting to basically sort of get a thumbs up on the data liberation side.  It's not always the kind of thing that teams are thinking about in depth at the beginning of their product.  Things are so fluid you don't want to typically wind up writing any code to liberate your product until you have a good idea of what your product is and what your data is going to be like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. That makes sense.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  But I mean, it's definitely something that's huge.  We've had different products call us up and say, hey, we've looked at dayliberation.org.  We think our product needs to be easier.  What can we do?  We're happy to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So are you a skunkworks within Google?  I mean, how is it treated within Google?  The data liberation front doesn't sound like you're part of the company.  You don't even have a Google address.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, that's what happens when you let me name the product.  No, I'm kidding.  We actually had a whole bunch of discussion about what we'd name our team when we first started because it wasn't skunkworks.  We did get some actual headcount from and the ability.  We said we want to try this out.  We'd like some headcount to try it.  And we went ahead and did this, but we were just sort of an internal team helping out other engineering teams.  But back to the name, we couldn't figure out what we're going to name ourselves.  So in sort of that bickering, Monty Python, Life of Brian thing, we wound up with the day liberation front because we figured it's either the front of the liberation or the people's front of the liberation.  It says something.  The reason we chose the website and the sort of somewhat subversive logo is because we think, A, the liberation.  Or we we want this to be seen as more of a general movement, not necessarily just Google, but we'd love to see more of it across the Internet.  But B, it's for a big company to do this sort of thing we think is rather subversive.  Although within Google, everybody I tell this is what we're doing.  They're like, oh, yeah, of course, that that makes complete sense.  Exactly what the right thing to do is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have a Twitter account and do people give you requests for use this to say, hey, can you liberate this data?  Can you liberate that data?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  We do actually. We get people ask us questions.  People mention stuff to us.  You found the photo.  There they are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They look a little scary in the in the uniforms.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Very civil war.  But we have a we set up a Google moderator page for people to put up, you know, things that they want to see better liberated and questions.  And one of my favorite things is every once in a while we'll get somebody on the moderator page will ask us to liberate a product that isn't even our own.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Please free this product.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That is an interesting thing to start to set up, you know, maybe a new independent organization that does become kind of an arbiter of what it means for data to be liberated.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  That is one of the things that we're we are talking about is what is it because it gets kind of I don't even want to go into the legal aspects of data ownership, you know,  especially when more than one person is working on a document.  I'll leave that to the to the copyright lawyers.  But to think about data from a control point of view, you know, if you write a document and you put it in Google Docs, arguably that you should be able to do what you want with that.  If I send you an email, arguably you have a copy of that.  You should be able to do what you want with it.  But what if you and I collaborate on a document?  You know, how much of that is quote unquote mine?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My day.  That leads to my next question, which is which is wave.  Right.  A is it exportable now?  And B, for the reasons you just mentioned, also for the kind of data issues, you have something that's an entirely new format, an entirely new way to record collaboration.  In what form do you export it?  Gina, have you tried?  Exactly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's an early bot, an exporty bot that will can can apparently publish a wave to HTML, but only works in the sandbox.  And things are still really early.  Brian probably knows better than I do.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, we've actually talked to the to the wave team since for quite a while now since the first time I saw wave demo, which is a long time ago.  And, you know, they're very interested in doing the right thing as far as, you know, they're open sourcing, they're federating, et cetera.  And, you know, the ability to export your waves in some sort of format is is definitely something they're interested in doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have a Google moderator page where people can vote or suggest, I guess, which products should be liberated.  I guess. Is that the way to say it?  I guess.  Absolutely.  And 2768 people have participated.  Fifteen thousand total votes.  That's fantastic.  Have you learned anything new there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Things that you hadn't thought of in liberation terms?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, one of the things we're sort of one of the things that comes up often, a lot of the things we get are people actually wanting new features.  They want to like, you know, they'll ask for, oh, I'd like this be able to put this type of data in here, in there, that sort of thing.  But, you know, it sort of brings things to the forefront of what's of our attention.  We know what people are more concerned about or more thinking about with regard to liberation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not always backup either.  I mean, I notice here somebody saying we want an API for Google moderator.  When they say when people see liberate, it's not just data.  Right.  Is that but is that part of your mission or you stick with the data side?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we try to to leave a trail of APIs in our wake.  I mean, we really do stand on the shoulders of giants.  And so far as the Google data, the G data team, they've been working on APIs for years and years.  And, you know, there's sort of quietly in the background opening up all these products to developers.  And we've sort of taken that and wrapped that up all in a nice neat package and given a nice HTML button or something to that effect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's kind of part of the API solution.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Yeah.  If we encounter a product that doesn't have APIs, obviously APIs are step one and the liberation is step two.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's great.  Well, we're really glad you could come and explain it.  Guys, you got any other questions for Brian before we let him go?  We're just glad you're doing it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really glad this is happening.  I still have a nagging feeling that like exportation isn't quite enough.  I wish that my cloud data could just sort of seamlessly and automatically sync to my local machines in the background without me having to worry about it.  But that may be going sort of beyond.  I mean, that's like that's going beyond beyond the ability to pick up my stuff and go.  We can ask for that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're saying instead of exportation, we want integration.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, because I hear from people all the time who say I'm locked out of my Gmail account and I can't get in and I'm screwed.  You know, or whatever, either lock out is usually the issue or, you know, I'm I think lock out is probably the thing that most people are concerned about, especially for free services where it's hard to get someone on the phone or, you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not back up at sync.  I like that as a concept.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  I don't think that's an unusual thing to ask for either.  I mean, I think there's a I think this is sort of step one and we're you know, there's a lot of different ways we can go with with the liberation in the future.  But I mean, I think that the the simple thing to say is that, you know, closed data, lack of integration, you know, walled gardens are not sort of the way the future and it's not where it's going to be.  And the interesting thing happens when you have more access to your data.  Things are more transparent.  You have more control, that sort of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're all for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep, definitely.  Glad that you are that you all are doing what you're doing.  That's for sure.  I'm glad to hear about that.  I'm glad to pick up a move if I want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the company supporting that.  It's unusual.  It's really kind of unheard of that a company would would support that.  It's part of the openness that I really like about Google.  Yeah.  The not the not evil part of Google.  Thank you for joining us.  Really appreciate it, Brian.  My pleasure.  Take care.  Brian Fitzpatrick, data liberation front dot org.  No, data liberation dot org.  I'm sorry.  Data liberation dot org.  Hey, where can we get those cool uniforms?

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  I don't know about the uniforms, but we got some stickers and we could definitely set

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you up with some laptop stickers.  The fist stickers.  That's good.  Oops, I hung up on him by accident.

Speaker: Brian Fitzpatrick
Transcript:  Now we'll never know where to get those stickers.  Oh, man.  My fingers on the button.  I made the fist and he went away.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I apologize.  Well, I'll email him and maybe we can find out where.  Now he thinks you're mad.  Stickers.  Screw you.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Screw you.  I don't want those stickers.  I want the damn uniform.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I told you that.  I want the uniform.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Liberate my uniform.  It's a little creepy.  Did you see the uniform?  It's on their Flickr page or you can follow.  It's cool.  Well, it's a little weird.  It's a mix between Devo meets the 1984 commercial from Apple.  It's very, very strange.  But I'm really glad Google's doing it and I wanted to give them a little extra plug  for doing that and continue to urge them to keep their eye on that.  Moving on in just a bit with some of the other big stories in the Google verse and there  are quite a few of them.  They released about 80 tools this week.  It was a big week for Google.  Before we do that though, I would like to mention our friends at Citrix, the makers  of GoToAssist Express.  If you're a programmer or a support person, if you've got IT chores that you need to do,  you need GoToAssist.  This is a really fantastic product.  I'd like you to try out from the folks at Citrix.  They're kind of the experts on remote access and they've taken their remote access platform  and made an IT support platform that is second to none with some great features.  Things like the ability to do eight sessions at once, unattended sessions.  I don't have to tell you why you'd want eight sessions at once.  It's really nice to be able to start a scan or a backup and then move on to the next computer  without having to wait around for the first one to finish.  It also does a survey of what software is running, what the operating system is, what  security software is running in the background.  Very useful.  You can drag and drop files from your computer to the remote computer.  It works PC to PC, Mac to PC, Mac to Mac, PC to Mac and it's just about as easy to install  as you would expect from the folks at Citrix.  Try it right now for 30 days.  Absolutely free.  That's right.  Go to gotoassist.com slash twig, G-O-T-O, assist.com slash twig and give it a try.  I've used it for, I think we started using it at the beginning of the decade with the  screensavers and it's just been a great boon to us.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  I want to go back a little bit to a story that we did and was changed immediately after  the show came out and that's the Etherpad story.  Oh yes.  Minutes after.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Minutes.  Minutes after.  As soon as we got off, it all changed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We mentioned last week that Google had acquired Etherpad and really fumbled.  Flubbed it.  There's the word, the F word I was looking for.  Flubbed the transition by just turning it off.  Gina, you were upset.  A lot of programmers who use Etherpad were upset.  What happened?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They did a complete 360.  Yay!  Yeah, which is great.  They listened to the users.  I was impressed.  They reopened Etherpad.  You can now create new pads and they promise that they will keep it open until all of the  source is open source and can live on in other ways, at least until it's open source.  I was pretty impressed.  They should have done this to begin with.  At this point, Google has acquired enough products, I think, to understand how it works.  They should have known.  But still, kudos for the quick turnaround.  I think this was a Thursday to Saturday 360.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Lars' quote was great.  Did you hear that?  No, Lars Rasmussen.  I forget where he was, but he just said, what were we thinking?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the way to handle it.  That's so great.  That's just the way to handle it.  Just say, you know, we made a mistake.  Sorry.  And then to fix it.  There has been some skepticism of the opening it up claim.  Like, well, we'll believe that when we see it.  Do you think that that's something that, you know, they have a bad history of that, Gina?  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're integrating into the Wave team and the Wave source code is open.  I don't see why it would be an issue.  I think there was an issue with maybe some of the libraries that they're using not being  open source.  There might be some licensing issues, but I mean, I don't have any reason to think that  they wouldn't do it.  But the Wave team really is one of the most open products they have.  Yeah, it's good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and I'm just opening it up again because people were just really missing the functionality.  I think it was just a really smooth way to handle it.  Yeah.  So we just wanted to correct ourselves.  It's just sometimes that happens.  You cover something and we're one week between shows.  We don't have any way to kind of update an audio show in the middle.  So I guess I could have come on and said, never mind.  They fixed it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They were writing this blog post while we were talking.  I know.  It's so funny.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They must have been.  They must have been.  Maybe they were listening to us and said, whoops.  That's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  If Twig says it, we got to do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I swear they've been listening to us because last week I was complaining that Google Wave  doesn't have control Z undo and redo and that got it added in this week.  So I think we've got somebody's ear.  We have a bully pulpit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's use it.  What do we want to fix?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let's fix it.  So Leo, I just got a tweet from Brad Davis Seale who says that the company that I imagined  only minutes ago exists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is how powerful we are.  Isn't this great?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wish this happens and it occurs.  So I just put this up.  It's called Backupify.  B-A-C-K-U-P-I-F-Y.  And it says that it supports backups of Twitter, WordPress, Google Docs, Gmail, Facebook, Zoho,  Delicious, Flickr, Basecamp, Photobucket and more.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean you couldn't back up everything but the fact that it backs up those big names.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can back up today.  It's a neat idea.  I'm sure it doesn't operate as smoothly as it could if there were cooperation from those  companies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean maybe these all have APIs.  So let's see.  It's free Twitter backup.  Of course, Gina, you've been doing that for a while.  Basic comes with two gigabytes of storage.  Yeah, you're going to be spending five bucks a month for 10 gigabytes or 15 bucks a month  for 50 gigabytes.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, but it's a great idea.  It's a good start.  Yeah.  It's a great idea.  Yeah.  It's a start.  Yeah.  Oh.  But I think it's interesting that you talked about integration and you talked about integration,  Jeff.  I think it really has to be more than just getting a lump.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was Kudos to Gina.  That was Gina.  I think that's right.  Because otherwise you're going to back up the backup to back up the backup.  Right.  And if you don't have enough storage to eat it, it's like having an old, as you said earlier,  five and a half inch disc.  What the hell do you do with it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the next generation of all of this...  I've always bugged me that we create all these little silos and the next generation really  has to take a look at integrating it all across platforms.  So we don't just have...  I mean, it's okay for a Twitter to exist for an individual vendor to do it, but it's not  okay for it to be a data silo.  It has to interoperate somehow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what Gina really said, I think, is the import of this is that you have to have not  only the right to your data, but the right to a player for your data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right?  Just having the VHS tape is no good if you don't have a VHS machine.  So just having your Gmail is no good if nothing else can read it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I'm even thinking...  I'm pumping a lot of content into a variety of places.  Just use Facebook and Twitter.  There needs to be some way of...  I guess we're getting there of kind of interoperating between them so that you can have a presence  in one place, I can have a presence in another place, and we can follow each other even across...  It's federation is what it's called, even across these different silos.  So it's not merely for backup and play, but it's even while we're doing it, even all the  time.  Yeah.  And that's...  No, it's a thorny one, and I know that we're a long way from solving it, but I would hope  that that's kind of the Web 3.0, the next generation of it, as we figure out a way to  do it.  Do you see the...  Now, I would like to know your...  This is the Kremlinology here.  We've been talking in the past about whether Google has a phone or not.  And there's a blog post...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The story that will not die.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Times now says that Google appears closer to releasing its own phone.  This is in the Bits blog on December 12th.  Google employees, according to the Times, this is Miguel Helfd writing in the Times,  who asked not to be identified confirmed recently the company was indeed helping to develop  new hardware and software for Android phones.  They said the project wouldn't alienate allies.  On Friday, Google began distributing new phones to employees who began tweeting about them.  Some of them refer to the device as the new Google phone.  And on Saturday, today, Google confirmed that it's testing a new concept in mobile phones.  I don't know.  Here's the Kremlinology.  The blog post says it's...  Well, I'll read you.  We recently came up with a concept of a mobile lab, which is a device, a mobile lab, which  is a device that combines innovative hardware from a partner with software that runs on  Android to experiment with new mobile features and capabilities.  We shared this device with Google employees across the globe.  This means they got to test out a new technology and help improvement.  Unfortunately, because dogfooding is a process exclusively for Google employees, we cannot  share specific product details.  And that's where the Kremlin shut up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So...  That's where you ought to have one of those things that changes your voice and puts a  black mark on the face.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think that you can read this.  Now here's where we go in interpretation and say, oh, Google's doing a device themselves.  I mean, they're just testing stuff, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But they are trying to taunt us here with the idea that they have something that is  otherworldly and it almost strikes me as a kind of Apple-like game of saying, you will  believe what we have next.  We're not telling you, but oh, what do you see it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So now TechCrunch is saying this is an HTC device, which is unlocked, an unlocked HTC  GSM phone.  God bless them.  The passion.  Really?  The passion?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Will it come out on Easter?  I was thinking something else, Leo, but...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Early January.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not Valentine's Day or Easter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The passion.  And well, that's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's not a Google phone, it's just another provider doing another phone, but it is Android

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  2.1, right?  It's Android 2.1.  It's not specific to any carrier.  So they're going to release it.  It's unlocked.  So you could pop a SIM card into it, which I love.  So, yeah, it's not a Google phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's an Android 2.1.  It's not specific to any carrier, so they're going to release it.  So you could pop a SIM card into it, which I love.  And Google has a hand in the hardware development as well.  They are working with HTC.  It's completely Google branded, so there's no HTC branding, but that doesn't make sense  because it's called the passion.  And that doesn't strike me as a name that Google would have chosen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an HTC name.  They like that kind of stuff.  They get the hero and the touch.  That's an HTC name.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I love this too.  It's becoming Google's monomaniacal fetishism toward fast.  The TechCrunch piece says the phone is, quote, really, really fast, says someone who's seen  it in action.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, it should be because that was the knock on the G1.  It was really, really slow.  That must have really annoyed Google.  But now that the Droid and the Ares are out, and these are pretty snappy little devices.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's the other little trick here.  It says it has a camera that is, quote, weirdly large for a phone.  But if you put that together with the other thing that came out this week, which is Google  Goggles.  Oh, yes.  I've seen Schmidt talk about this at the force.  What the hell is Google Goggles?  You can point the camera of the phone to an object, a place, or I've heard from certain  people soon, a face of a person, and that becomes your search query.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is awesome, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you're scanning a face?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, OK, OK.  So it's an Android application.  And right now, facial recognition is not supported.  But they did this search event at the Computer History Museum this week.  And a reporter asked, what about facial recognition?  So it supports logos, book covers, DVDs, landmarks, and objects.  So you take a picture.  It scans the object.  And it identifies what it is and returns Google search results for it.  And someone asked, what about faces?  Because Picasa and PicasaWeb have facial recognition.  So ostensibly, it wouldn't be that big of a stretch that you could point your camera  phone at somebody's face and get Google search results.  And they said that faces are objects which can be recognized, but that they did not turn  that on because of privacy issues.  They need to work out the privacy issues.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think we're very-  I've heard from another executive that it is imminent, that they can do that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's kind of scary, the idea that you could be in a room with someone, snap a photo of  a stranger from across the room, and get Google search results before you even speak to that  person without knowing their name.  I mean, it makes sense, but it's also a little creepy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want this.  You know what I really want?  And every old person has always wanted this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's memory time.  You know where I'm going, Jeff.  I want a little earpiece in my ear, a little ear button there.  I want a little camera on my lapel.  And it just goes, that's Jeff Jarvis.  His son is named Jake.  His birthday is on November.  And that would be so cool.  Like the queen.  The queen has that, but it's a human.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, now let's tie it together with another thing from Google this week, which is putting  the QR codes on a thousand favorite places.  So you have the physical code on a business or a place.  You take a picture of that with your iPhone, and that again becomes a search query, and  you find out about that place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you get the feeling Google is just, yes, it's so perfectly positioned to do this stuff,  the opportunity for this company is limitless.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now you start to see what goes beyond this notion of the quaint old phone.  So this device is not only making you constantly, perpetually connected to the world, it's also  connecting the world to it.  It becomes your world connection device that what you see and experience can come back  through and populate not only search queries, but your own personal data, four square like  where have I been, what have I done, what do I want to know about this, what can I say  about this?  It becomes really powerful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So freaking cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's kind of crazy.  But you know, the barcode and the window thing, I don't know, my first reaction was like,  am I really going to scan a barcode on a coffee shop window?  I mean, I mean, of course I will to try it out.  I will. But will most people do that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, what if you go to a restaurant and you can scan through the barcode or through  just now a picture and you get all the reviews right off the bat?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, no, you know, I was in Paris.  In Paris, you see on the posters everywhere the QR codes on the corner.  Ah, so I mean, so worldly.  Well, when I was in Paris, this was a year ago.  So I think that, you know, a lot of phones, maybe European phones have the QR capability,  you know, or at least software for it.  I know you can get Android can get something.  Iphone could get something that will read those.  It is a lot easier.  I mean, aren't we already maybe you have you don't do this, but I do this.  Take pictures of stuff on my phone to remember it.  A flower or I mean, I use ever note that parking spot.  If you were on it, I could easily see you're on a subway train and you see an ad  and you take a picture of the ad.  How much better to just do the QR code and you get all the information in there.  I think that's kind of natural.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think you're right, too, though, is that is that at some point GPS does it for you?  Right.  I mean, that's the force.  Or God, I'm here.  Right.  Or God.  Yeah.  See, that's the thing about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  If I'm standing in front of the place already, I'm more likely to just browse the menu,  you know, in the window versus take out my phone and scan a barcode.  But on on on posters in the subway, this this makes a lot of sense to me for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I can download goggles now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in the it's in the market.  It's an Android market.  It's Android only.  I'll be with you later.  A lot of iPhone owners not happy.  So, you know, I wrote this blog post this week that all the best Android apps are made by Google  at this point. I think you're right.  I think except for like Amazon and P3.  But that got a lot of people a little upset.  But I mean, everything else is either on par with with what's available for the iPhone or  or or less so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is the Google kind of ways do it yourself.  That's why I kind of credit the Google phone because they get it's you get the feeling.  I don't know what's going on internally, but you get the feeling they get fed up  and then just say, oh, screw it.  I'm just going to do it ourselves.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. And they're using their own applications to differentiate Android from the iPhone OS.  I mean, the Google Maps on Android is just just way better than the iPhone at this point.  And that's that's a really good killer app for your mobile phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want good maps. So we've also learned from the Google ROMs  fiasco that those proprietary applications that Google owns and doesn't let you,  you know, distribute yourself are closed source.  Yes, it's a closed source.  And it may be that that's another way of kind of controlling a little bit the  the environment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I do sense we're on the cusp of something that's that's the next device.  I argued that when the iPhone came out, they actually should have released it first  as the iPod Touch and as a computer that you had and then added and said,  Oh, guess what? We just added a phone to it. Right.  It's a computer that oh, yeah, we put a phone in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they were in a bigger hurry than that. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I get that.  I think in this case, you want to try to push people's minds  past the idea of just what a what a mere phone is. Yeah.  By the way, I when they announced the QR thing, I went on  and they had pictures of the places with the QR codes on the web.  So I took a picture of the QR code with my iPhone right off the screen.  And I kept getting the wrong place.  And so I tweeted that and got bless somebody from the QR team at Google,  the places team at Google, tweeted back to me and or email me back and said,  PR person just sent this to me.  What's the problem?  And then I guess the resolution on the QR code, if you take it off a screen,  is just that much off.  There was going someplace else on the list.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  I think QR is an intermediate step that really got the thing  should be smart enough not to have to look for some code just to go.  Oh, I get it.  Precisely.  Somebody said they pointed goggles at the screen, the video stream that we sent  and Google sent them to tweet on the search page. Really?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, how smart can this be?  The logo is really good with logos.  Must have seen the logo.  Yeah, yeah, it's quite good with logos, actually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of spooky. I love it, though.  I mean, basically, this is what you want.  You want I mean, that's what search really is.  Ultimately is tell me what's tell me what's going on.  What's that mean?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So you we go through this whole thing about about static search.  Now becoming live search.  Now you get truly place based and object based search.  Object being a place or a person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, I'm just boggled by goggles.  This is it's really amazing.  The show this week.  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it just did it.  I saw your reflex there to write it down so you don't forget about it.  That's a new phone will do for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, exactly. No, I have the chat.  Well, see, I have had the chat room to do this for me for a long time.  I will just at the end of the show, I'll say, what was that title?  And they'll say boggled for goggles.  So I actually have people for that.  There's about six or seven hundred people who are watching at all times.  Crowdsourcing.  They're my brain. It's great.  So I have a little sense of how cool this would be.  And I don't think it's eventually I think it's going to be all time, real time.  Just, you know, that Gordon Bell's idea of you wear the camera around your neck  and it's recording everything that you do all the time.  Well, why shouldn't that camera also be giving you information  about stuff you're looking at?  I'm just very I'm just very excited about this whole idea.  More from Google coming up in just a second.  There is this is this was this was the week that I don't know.  You might we might look back on this week and say this is when Google kind  of just took off.  How many announcements did they have?  It felt like a dozen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if you go to the official Google blog and it has this week  and search this week and this this week and that, there's just four or five  things in all of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just amazing.  And by the way, thank you for stealing this weekend.  I appreciate it, Google.  We still have this week in Google, though.  See, they can have all those others, but we have this week in Google.  We own this week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the other really neat announcement that I love.  Save it. Oh, save it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, because I'm a that's called a tease.  It's called a very brutal, abrupt tease, but it was so subtle.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't even get it.  That's how smooth you are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we've got more things to talk about the moment.  But right now, I'd like to talk to you about my Ford.  And the Ford Sink, the mighty, mighty Ford Sink.  I have a video on here.  I'll show you.  I'm going to take more videos of it because people don't believe me  when I say that my car understands what I'm saying.  It's like Google goggles for your car is what it is.  You're talking to your car.  It's like having hell in here.  Sink is the hands free calling music search, turn by turn navigation,  information search built into Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  It has, you know, you press a button in your steering wheel.  You don't have to take your eyes off the the the the window because.  It's not the screen is talking to you.  There is a little screen, but it's not about what's on the screen.  So when you ask for directions, it walks you through the directions.  It tells you what the traffic is going to be.  You can get sports scores.  I can tell it things like I press a button, I say climate,  and I can tell it what temperature to make the car.  You can go on and on.  It can give you vehicle health reports.  You get a website, syncmyride.com  that you can go to and get all this information about your car.  You can also get updates because every Ford Sink vehicle has a USB port.  So you can take a thumb drive, download software on the website  and bring it over to the car and install it on the car.  In fact, they plan to do applications next year.  There's this magical convergence happening.  They're also opening the platform.  Just it's just remarkable.  Of all the I am very happy to be associated with Ford,  the only American auto company that didn't take tarp funds or whatever,  the bailout funds, they are very forward thinking.  They're really very active in social media.  They're paying attention to this stuff.  And I think that that's why Ford is is is I'm just thrilled  to be driving an American car and I'm really thrilled to be telling you  about Ford Sink. Find out more.  Go to syncmyridepodcast.com.  Sometimes it's just it's good to be proud to be an American.  I got to say syncmyridepodcast.com.  And for those of you listening outside the U.S., it's great to be you too.  I don't mean it's not great to be you too.  I keep forgetting that this is really an international audience.  But look at guys, our car industry has been dying.  We're just happy to have one that's surviving and doing and thriving  and doing well. Sink My Ride Podcast.  I come. All right, Jeff Jarvis, what was it you just were so excited about?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, coming back to the  synchronicity of this, the Google is trying to they always want to want  to know your intent and anticipate your intent.  And it's almost freaky that when you start typing in, their example was  whether in New York, in the search box, and it's it's pre filling out  the possibilities of what you're doing.  It also says, I know what you want and gives you the forecast right there  in the search box.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the search. Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. Now, so this is if I go to Google dot com,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  go to Google dot com and search for whether in, you know, Chicago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, that fade in thing is weird.  OK, but Google weather.  Isn't it a little strange that the controls don't fade into later?  Weather in.  That's going to give me some choices.  Oh, it's fading in.  Just had to fade in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I messed it up. You could even do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I thought, oh, there it is.  Holy skimoli.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You haven't finished typing Chicago and it's already given you the answer  in the search box.  Whoa. Forget the web.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we love suggest suggest is awesome.  But now suggest is even more often awesome because it has images in it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so it's all about intent.  And if it can know your intent is going to give it to you before  you can friggin ask.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I can click this box and it will give me more.  And oh, my gosh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had dinner this week at a Michael Wolfe,  the media columnist played host to a dinner for Yuri Milner,  the guy who invested in Facebook for the Russian oligarch.  It was fascinating. I got to sit next to the guy.  I bet that was really interesting.  Oh, it was great.  But he was talking about what happens in a world where you have a billion people,  which is Facebook soon will connected to a billion computers.  And what does that mean for intelligence and intent  and how things will anticipate your needs, not just answer them?  And the power of that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  An AdSense link also appears when you type the word.  What do you see that? Good catch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If it really if you just just type the word search box.  It's incredible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, they're so brilliant.  There's it's like, oh, look at that.  The Weather Channel.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's amazing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's yeah. Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that an AdSense ad or is that a sponsorship kind of ad?  Or did the Weather Channel have to buy weather?  Why does why does weather come up?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They must have bought weather.  Well, I'll tell you what, let's just do this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or do they buy this?  Can you can anybody just buy that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Actually, no, if you know the word life hacker, life hacker appears first.  And we definitely did not buy that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I don't see, by the way, the Weather Channel  on the sponsored links when I type in weather and hit return.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that is not ads.  If you type Twitter, Twitter.com first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I don't like that one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cotton picking bit because that goes away.  If you do TV, you get you, Leo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me ask this.  Is that evil? Oh, I didn't buy that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's not evil.  But why is it linked and underscored like that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I didn't buy that because it it looks like it's just it knows that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How is it? Why does it do that, though, instead of just the link below,  which is to it, that TV, it says it gives the full title,  the Twitter cast network with Leo Laporte.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you buy the keyword? No.  No. That's weird.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not unhappy.  I mean, I wish it would give me.  But of course, I can see why I go to Twitter.  But as soon as I put a dot after it, it goes to it.  It thinks I'm going to Twitter TV.  That's remarkable.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hmm. Yeah.  So, well, I would have thought it was a slightly evil if it was an ad,  but now it's clearly not.  That's all right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, this is like school.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google just becomes sentient.  It's like, do you feel like all of a sudden this week?  Just kind of it became sentient.  And all of this stuff is happening.  Why? What happened to Google?  Did it reach critical mass?  Did I don't understand now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Messiah. The moment has come.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I feel like 2009 was just this just incredible year for Google.  I mean, they had that like focus on speed, which they delivered on.  I mean, that just wasn't PR.  I mean, Google has put out dozens of products and tools at this point  that that increased speed of the web. Yeah.  And then they're right, by the way.  Speed is everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're right. I'm not going to deny that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean, I don't remember 2008 Google having a focus  on on a particular concept like speed, like the way that they did this year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. It's like they had an offsite.  Last year, and they said, OK, we're going to get it together.  What should we focus on?  Speed. I mean, it's very it's very interesting.  I think the Google culture, you know this better than anyone, Jeff.  The Google culture is kind of a non-traditional corporate culture.  It's very committee driven, which would you would think would make it very hard  to suddenly all agree speed is the process.  I mean, you know, it seems that isn't it also, I think, just that

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Larry likes speed. OK, we all like speed.  Let's give Larry fast stuff. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think so he has that kind of there's still that leadership  coming from the top.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, let me I think it's really, really good point.  Really smart point.  Leo, I've worked in a lot of companies because I have a checkered resume  and can't keep a job.  But I've worked for mogul companies like Murdoch or Maxwell or Hearst  or Newhouse, and I've worked for corporate companies like Time Inc.,  which are more ruled by task forces and committees.  Maybe just thinking about this, as you say, I think in a sense,  Google combines the two where you have the committee filter structure.  No, you've got to go through this this this gauntlet to get there.  But at the top of it is a mogul.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. A king, a king.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A monarch or a junta, perhaps in this case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. But this is not a this doesn't well, it doesn't feel that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All right. By the way, it's if I've asked people about various things  in the company and the answer came back.  Yeah, we tried that. But Sergey didn't like it. Yeah. Yeah. Good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because, you know, I trust Larry and Sergey.  I trust even more than Eric.  I think Larry and Sergey are mad, are magical, brilliant guys.  Yeah. And I trust I always trust a programmer and an engineer.  Same as jobs.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the irony here is I haven't thought of this before.  I should have put in the book. Right.  That's what does I said in my in my book, which I don't have with me  to point point right now, but  that Apple was the grand exception.  It did everything ungoogly.  But in the end, maybe not so much like that.  Now that you mentioned it, Leo, that that having Larry and Sergey on top  and having jobs on top as visionaries all, that's what ties them together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of the auteur theory meets corporate governance.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it's technology,  well, technology as some as a creative act.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, they are listening, just so you know.  Matt Cutts tweets Jeff Jarvis, we think that's a useful navigational link.  It's not advertising.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I've been playing with it.  Looks like an app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but it's OK.  And by the way, this is a fabulous  speaking of ads, a fabulous book that everyone should get.  What would Google do?  What you know, you got to write a second edition, Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the book is in its 11th printing.  Congratulations.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Pretty cool. Thank you, Leo.  It's really great.  That's my co-host.  Triggers were buying it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How many books is 11 printings?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's unless not as many as you think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're only printing 10 at a time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's technology makes it makes me able to hit the HP button.  Then it goes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's neat. That's so cool.  Yeah, really, really neat.  There's more changes to the front page, as long as we're on the front page of Google.  A Google Chrome advertisement.  Install that, click away, and then you can click the X and I get I presume not see it again.  They must have that droid ad must have done so good that they thought, well, we'll do more of that.  That's kind of a change.  The Google front page has changed quite a bit.  To have this, there is a little a little odd.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny.  They move pixels and we say, wow, it's changed a lot.  You look at Yahoo and AOL, and they're trying to remake themselves.  Right.  With their home page.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Any other autocomplete magic that we I'm blown away by what's what's happening there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I've just been experimenting with it, and it looks like it's really like a URL suggestion.  So if you if you search for if you type in Tiger Woods or the space between Tiger and Woods,  you don't get a suggestion.  But if you type Tiger Woods with no space, it suggests Tiger Woods dot com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's finding URLs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this appears to be this appears to act similar to the way that the Firefox, you know,  awesome bar, you know, the by the way, if you type Tiger Woods and look at the suggestions,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this is exactly what you do not want to have happen in your life.  Yeah.  Car accident, infidelity, affair, accident, quick golf accident, update, wife, car crash,  break from golf house.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, type in newspapers are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I love these.  I love it when we complete complete sentences.  Newspapers are dying dead, obsolete, underlined, not dying, written at what grade level?  Doomed, important, not dead, a waste of time.  I love that.  So much fun. I don't know who spent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, don't type in Leo Polaport is don't do it.  Don't do it. I'm telling you, don't do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm not going to do that now.  Oh, no problem. Let's get on with the show and talk about some other things.  Oh, how did that happen?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's nothing for me. Actually, mine is worse.  It doesn't suggest a thing for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says Leo Laporte is an idiot.  Leo Laporte is a douche.  And then I don't know why Leo Laporte ISP.  So are these where do these come from?  Are these the most searched?  No, somebody's searching for Leo Laporte is an idiot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Search. It's the what it finds the result.  It's those phrases in the documents that it finds when someone searches for what you are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Jeff, yours is pretty good.  If you type Jeff Jarvis, it suggests blog, Twitter.  What would Google do? CUNY, Dell, bio, jazz, Dell, hell, Wiki and BLM.  I don't know what BLM is.  Why are you getting that? I'm not getting anything.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you just type in Leo Laporte alone, you get all the right things.  Tech guy, Twitter, podcast, blog, anti-virus blog, Mike Arrington.  Yeah.  You're tied for life.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, forever we'll be tied together.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Income. That's interesting, Leo. Income.  Yeah, that was a big story.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we have a show called NSFW where that's a game that they play.  They it's really cool.  They give you they say we're going to we're going to give you the results and you try to figure out who this is.  Isn't that great?  And then and then you have to compete with somebody.  You should guys should go on the show.  You have to compete with somebody and say I could name that person in two two results or name that person in four results or or one result.  It's really a fun game.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like the Google age of celebrity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Matt Cutts just sent us another we got to have him on.  You should call him.  So if you type in a flight number into the search box, it gives you the it gives you the the departure and arrival times.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But do I have to type the search box?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not of the results. Just type in Delta 140.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, track is the search box.  You don't need the Web.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, try JetBlue 182.  This is the flight I always take to New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you will know this one by heart.  JetBlue 182.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, you're not getting it.  That's weird.  I got it. I got it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You did JetBlue one word space one word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  Oops. JetBlue.  We got to type it correctly.  One eighty two.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  That's great.  Now, but that's pointing to a non-Google site, flight stats dot com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then if I hit I'm lucky, I go to flight aware dot com.  Mysterious Google is so mysterious.  It's like a woman. I'll never figure it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, OK.  I'm not making any comments on that one.  No, sir.  According to Google Maps, the Googleplex is for sale.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That one came from an eight year old blogger.  Let's give him a give him a prop credit to Jake Smith.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A great eighth grade blogger. Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eighth grade blogger.  He says, do you have the money to buy the Googleplex?  I wish I did, because this place is truly amazing.  Obviously, this is a joke.  He went on Google Maps to the Googleplex and for sale for a mere hundred billion dollars.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A hundred billion dollars.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so.  Do you think kids, this must be an activity these days.  Kids go and search for stuff and see what they can find.  Somebody's doing that.  All right, so we've got a Google phone.  What else? What else is new?  What other new Google products came out this week?  Anything else we want to talk about?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got some Chrome extensions.  That was last week, wasn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's no this speed tracer.  That's new.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, speed tracer is new. That's a Chrome extension.  They opened up the Chrome extensions gallery this week with the launch of Chrome for Linux and Mac.  But sadly, the extensions don't work for the Mac version.  They only work for Windows and Linux.  That's a bummer.  But speed tracer is really something for web developers.  It's really neat.  It lets you monitor the speed of your site as it loads and it creates all these very cool dynamic graphs and shows you the Facebook JavaScript is taking too long or whatever.  It shows you where you're kind of your it's a sluggishness graph.  It's similar to why slow for Firefox.  Right.  Which is from Yahoo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  More more new things.  We have the fact that Google search results now include live results, though I can't get it to work from Twitter, Facebook at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about that a little bit last week.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't get to work.  That's right. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Real time. Yeah, real time stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google Apps has added some collaborative features, which kind of brings it closer to wave, including Google Groups, which is going to be my tool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But we can do it now.  No, I don't mind.  I like Google Groups and I was I kind of felt the feeling was falling off the face of the earth.  So I'm glad that they put it in apps.  I think that that'll keep it alive.  Why did we think it was just seemed like it was more abundant?  And, you know, Yahoo Groups kind of faded away.  And I really I use groups all the time.  You know, my poker my poker group, you know, has a group.  I just use this all the time.  And it's so useful.  Well, they've even redesigned it a little bit.  Looks a little slicker and nicer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, Google Groups has a has a serious spam problem, honestly.  I run all my software projects.  I have a mailing list on Google.  And yeah, and I have to keep them.  I have to have them moderated.  I have to moderate new posts to it because otherwise it'll just get killed at spam.  And I think I complained about it one week to Matt, actually on air.  I said, hey, when's Google Groups going to work on the spam a little bit?  And so I was really happy to hear that it's going to it's integrated into Google apps  because it felt like a renewed commitment to the product to the product.  And and also this week, Google Wave kind of came out of the closet about their Google  Groups integration, which a lot of users had kind of figured out that you can make groups  of wave participants using Google Groups.  But but Google finally came out and said, yes, you can do it this way.  It's really tricky still.  We're working on a way to make it easier.  So it looks like Google Groups is here to stay.  And I hope to see it kind of grow up and mature and maybe get a little a little better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're right, you know, it survives if it becomes part of something like Wave.  Yes. Yes.  So to that end, it becomes important.  The other important thing this week in my end of the world is living stories.  OK, which is the well, Google did in partnership with The New York Times, The  Washington Post, and it's basically the topic page graduated to what it should be,  which is that an article is surrounded by context and full disclosure, Daylife,  where my partner is working on something similar and has parts of this out now with  what they call smart topics and smart sections, living stories.  Basically, the problem with The New York Times topic page is that great.  It's an attempt to get SEO, but it was a cynical attempt to just list their stuff.  Whereas Google's saying, and Marissa Meyers been telling news organizations for a  year and a half now, don't just make the article what you do, make it a page that's  going to gather momentum and gather traffic and gather Google juice if you have  the good reporting. And to do that, you've got to give more than just an article on  the page. You have to give the context and the links and the timeline and the quotes  and all this other stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love this. So you'll go there.  If you get it, LivingStories.GoogleLabs.com, you'll see some of the big news  stories like Washington Tackles Healthcare Reform.  They link to the Washington Post for that.  But then underneath it, others.  Now, these aren't all from the Washington Post, or are they?  No, they should be from other other sources as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So what this is, is this is a format that so then this takes me to a page  Washington Post and other news organizations.  Basically, they're saying, you fools, you don't know how the Internet works.  You keep writing articles which are the artifact of print.  Right. Here's what a news page should look like.  OK, we'll give it to you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is great. So this is is this in conjunction with or is this they're just

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  doing it? Google's just doing it with the Washington Post and New York Times to as

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a demonstration. So the Times and the Post are cooperating.  Right. Right.  Well, that's really neat. I really like that.  That's a much better way to do news.  And you know, I mean, it's you've got some, you know, flash in here, interactive  stuff. And I mean, just really, this is neat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's nothing surprising about this.  Again, you know, Daylife has been doing this stuff to plug them for some time.  But the newspapers couldn't get out of their own mindset of what they produced.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're just putting the page printed page on the Web.  Of course, that's the yeah.  Really neat. That's I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It comes at a time, too, when Google's trying to make buddy buddy with news  organizations. And so one could say that it's just an effort to do that.  But I think it is, in fact, a helpful effort to get them to see the Web in a new  way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Eric Schmidt joined Twitter.  With the ridiculous E Schmidt zero handle.  I don't know what he was thinking, but he's changed.  Well, I think Twitter said, can we give you a better name?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think Anil Anil was one of the people that was like, hey, someone no one told  Eric that Eric Smith, that he didn't have to use his AOL name screen.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So now he has Eric Schmidt.  And yes, Twitter has verified the account.  And let me just see how many Mr.  Schmidt now has or 16000 followers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is four tweets and four total.  And he doesn't follow me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What the heck?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm hurt. Eric, Eric, how could you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, this is the guy who wrote the fabulous book.  What would Google do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And if you were wearing in the picture, it looks like he's wearing a bulletproof

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  vest. It does.  Wait a minute. Or a bib.  Wait a minute. Let's zoom in on that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It won't open the picture up for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eric, what the heck?  Why would OK, this is I mean, who who did this?  His kids did this.  Does he have kids? He must have a 15 year old who said, oh, dad, we'll make you a  Twitter account. Eric Schmidt zero.  And then and dad, you got to have a picture.  What about this one in the bulletproof vest?  That is bizarre.  So now he's Eric Schmidt.  Officially, I don't know what happened to Eric Schmidt zero.  And if you ever had any doubt, he's the man in the bulletproof vest.  Or overalls.  I don't know. It looks like Velcro on the front.  I don't know what the hell that is.  Why would anybody choose that?  What is that saying?  I don't know. That's very strange.  What is that? OK, chat room, what is what is that thing?  Oh, this is when he was in Iraq.  It is a bulletproof vest.  It is a bulletproof. This was when he was in Iraq.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's a bit of a wry sense of humor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. No, this is he went to remember they went to Iraq.  That's right. Yeah.  When they when they announced the library.  That's what that is. Thank you.  Again, you see, my brains are better than Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  God bless. It's a billion brains and a billion computers.  Look what it does. Unbelievable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like a million monkeys.  Google, will they buy Twitter?  All your listeners monkeys.  In aggregate, only in aggregate.  No individual is a monkey, just they're aggregated into monkeys.  Google to buy Twitter rumor resurfaces.  No, I don't know.  Apparently, Jack Dorsey was at the Web at a panel called European Gang Live.  And asked about the purchase of Twitter by Google.  He responded, there have been no announcements.  Oh, come on. This is criminology again.  But it's kind of interesting that he didn't say no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the other interesting story that came out this week, too,  in the Craigslist versus eBay fight is it turns out that Google was also bidding  to buy that twenty five, twenty eight percent of Craigslist that was available.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  And that. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So who did how would it be different if they had to eBay?  eBay got it. And now eBay and Craigslist are locked  in a Japanese monster movie legal fight.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's a nightmare.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because Craigslist, I understand it here.  And I'm not sure exactly what it is that that  the chat room will correct me.  But I think that Craigslist accused eBay of using its position and intelligence  to be able to create a competitor to Craigslist.  eBay accuses Craigslist of changing its rules to dilute eBay.  Hmm. And so it's not a friendly combination.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. We're going to I think we I think we've spent so much to talk about,  and I'm sure that with their stuff we've missed, but I think we have to move along.  Otherwise, Jeff's going to miss his pizza.  We hate for that to happen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm down at Mom and Dad's in Florida tonight.  Pizza. You see me behind me in the pizza.  Now we're having something off the grill.  But Jake is down here as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, how fun. Yes.  That's great. Maybe maybe concrete.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sun City Center is an amazing place.  You have to be 55 years old to live here legally.  The whole town. It's not just a complex.  It's a town.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But but the people under 55 can visit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can visit and you can work here.  But you can't live here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is wild.  That is really like a Twilight Zone episode.  Yeah. No kidding.  And is it well, what?  Yeah. Is it a nice place?  I mean, you like it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a nice place.  All right. Let us get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah, that's the problem.  I got to take up golf before I go to go down there somewhere like that.  Let us get our tip, tool and number of the week, starting with Gina Tripani  and her tip of the week.  You have many choices, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do. There are many choices.  And actually, this one is kind of a tool.  Last week, we talked about how Google released Google Public DNS,  which are public DNS servers that they say are faster, maybe,  than your service providers.  But if you want to know whether or not Google Public DNS or Open DNS  or your other choices are faster, there's a free tool called NameBench,  which you can download for Mac, Windows or Linux.  And basically, it benchmarks your DNS servers.  So it takes Open DNS, it takes Google Public DNS,  and it takes your service providers DNS.  And it just pits them against one another in a DNS server takedown  and creates these charts and tells you which one is your fastest and best choice  based on your browser history or the Alexa Top 100.  It takes a little time to run. It takes a few minutes.  You want to start NameBench and go kind of make yourself a sandwich.  But in the end, you'll see, you know, what your best choice is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My friend, Steve Gibson, who does our Security Now podcast,  has a very similar free product that you can run also  that gives you a lot of information.  In addition, it will put Google on there.  And I ran it on on my system.  And Google's DNS was not that fast.  I use Open DNS, and that was by far faster  than Google's DNS.  So it is worth running just to see what results you're getting,  because as Google has said, speed is very important.  But you can also get you can get that one from GRC.com.  We'll give out both of them that way.  You get to choose slash DNS slash benchmark.  And it runs a also very thorough benchmark.  It's small because Steve writes an assembler.  Nice. Yeah, it's 170 K or something like that.  And and it's really it does.  It gives you really interesting results.  It also tells you, which I think is valuable, which, you know,  if this DNS provider redirects 404s to its own page,  or a number of them do, including Open DNS.  So you get a search result instead of this page not found.  That may not be what you want or may be what you want,  but it's a good thing to know.  And you can add your own service to that, too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that Steve Gibson definitely looks like a good one.  In fact, when I wrote about name bench, everybody said,  hey, you should look at Gibson's name bench is both free.  Yeah, they're both free.  And they're both definitely, I think, worth looking at.  If you're not sure whether or not you should switch.  I agree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, is the time difference noticeable to the human eye and brain?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It can be. Really? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it can be depending on your service provider.  Most people just use their ISPs

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and there's a security issue with that because some ISPs  are not fixing the bind problem that is a really nasty exploit.  But you'll notice if when you enter in an address  and there's a lag between the time you enter in that address  and the time the page starts loading, that's DNS.  Right.  And I mean, I think we've all seen a lag there.  I love Open DNS. I'm a big fan of Open DNS.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you see in your browser status bar, it says looking up example.com.  That's that's the DNS call.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's truly DNS. OK. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Our number of the week for Mr.  Jeff Jarvis. All right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is one million six hundred sixty one thousand four hundred sixty three.  Two one zero.  What is that? How many people live in Sun City?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's how many seconds I have left.  It's how many seconds there are left in the year.  If you go to Google and just say, I feel lucky with the blank box.  It will come back with how many seconds there are left in the year.  So it's great.  Right now, I'm watching yours and mine on the same screen.  I see the lag of broadcast.  You can see the exact the exact lag.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that funny? It's great.  So I presume that we should go there on New Year's Eve and watch it  because I imagine something wonderful will happen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, a page will explode and just become part of our browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's it. Google goggles everywhere.  Something wonderful is about to happen.  Actually, knowing Google, I just go to zero and say, OK, we're done.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got to set up some sort of screen capture because I want to be a  love one at midnight.  I don't want to be looking at Google's home page,  but I'll still be curious about what happens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But we're going to a New Year's Eve party.  I'm finding the biggest screen in that house and I'm putting Google up on there  and I'm leaving it there. I mean, why not? You got the countdown.  That's the perfect thing to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Back in the day when webcams were hot, I got a webcam on  at four Times Square in the County Nass Building when I worked with them,  pointed at the Times Square thing.  And I remember Jake and I sitting at home during screen captures  of the web photos as a countdown and putting them up on the web  on a web page. It was so cool, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, come a long way.  Isn't that father son bonding? It's so sweet. So sweet.  Has Jake found out about CMU yet?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no. I don't know what's going to happen there, but.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My daughter finds out Monday.  Oh, it's a nerve wracking time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Anxious weekend.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have somebody in the chat room who has been bugging me,  sending me emails saying, you never mentioned this tool.  This is my favorite tool on Google.  Everybody should know about this tool.  It's not a new tool, but it is a great tool.  If you've used SketchUp, which is absolutely free,  Google has created a building maker that is kind of based on SketchUp  that allows you to create 3D buildings that you can then embed in Google Earth.  And it's really cool when people have done this  to go to these locations in Google Earth.  And instead of getting, you know, you know how Google Earth kind of gives you pictures.  They're 2D. You can zoom and stuff, but it's still kind of 2D.  These buildings are actually like physical buildings.  It's really, really neat and it's free and it's fun to play with.  It's called Google Building Maker.  And probably easiest just to Google, Google Building Maker,  because it's a long URL to find it.  It's part of SketchUp.  And you, of course, have to have SketchUp to do that, but that's absolutely free.  But many, many cities, it's really fun to browse around  and Google Earth and see these buildings.  This is how it's being done with Google Building Maker.  And I would like to give credit to that person, but  I don't know what his name, but he was the guy who really wanted me to mention this.  Google.com slash building maker.  OK, maybe it's not such a bad URL.  Was it MXX?  OK, thank you, MXX, for the tool of the week.  Also want to remind folks, I know many of you know that I wear Scott  e-vest clothing everywhere.  That's the wonderful many, many pocket jackets and pants and shirts.  I love Scott e-vest and we want to give you a little gift.  They have Scott e-vest merchandise with the Tweet logo,  but you can also get it without the Tweet logo for 20 percent off.  If you go to scottevest.com slash twit 2009,  it's not really an ad. We just we just like to do this every year.  It's our gift to you.  S C O T T E V E S T.  Scott e-vest.  This is great geek clothing.  And I think I know Jake would love some Scott e-vest stuff.

So scottevest.com slash twit 2009.  We've got the beautiful twit army jacket, which is fleece available.

Twit 2009 on all of the products from Scotty Vest.  We're big fans of theirs. Scott's a great guy.  And frankly, I do this because I don't have to ever buy clothing.  He just he just sends me clothing with lots of pockets.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't mean to compete with Scotty Vest, but I just got to mention this.  I think it's funny.  Fred Wilson, the blogger, venture capitalist in ABC.com, got off a flight one day,  not too long ago, two weeks ago, and had to blog.  The fact that somebody had a hoodie that has a built in neck pillow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that's a good idea. You blow up your neck pillow and you just put the hoodie  over and they think you're a comfortable terrorist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good idea until you're on a bus or something.  You're driving around with a neck pillow.  It's amazing, you know, what you can what you can find in clothing these days.  Gina Tripani is the best.  We just adore her.  And she is, of course, at SmarterWear.org in her book.  The Complete Guide to Google is available.  A complete wave guide.  I'm sorry.  Click guide to Google.  Wave is available at CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You got it.  You got it one time before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of these days.  But I know Jeff's book. See, it's easy.  What would Google do?  Jeff Jarvis is, of course, the great journalist at BuzzMachine.com,  the author of What Would Google Do?  Always fun, you guys.  We really love doing this show.  It's one of our most successful shows we can.  We are now happy to say it is all on video available to you.  If you go to Twig.tv, you can download it.  We are we are working on the iTunes feeds as we speak.  Those will be out soon.  All of all of our top five shows now are available on video  and, of course, on the Roku box and everywhere else.  But if you want to see Twig video, in fact, I think let me just see  if we have last week's show already up.  You go to TWIT.tv  and you'll see now you can you can listen to the audio,  but you can also play the video for many of our shows.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. Yeah.  Will I be able to embed those things on my blog someday?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the next thing that we really want you to be able to do.  And I think the key there is getting some help from Google.  Anybody know anybody at Google?  Because because what I'm trying to get is the Google account  that we could upload full length shows to.  You know, they don't normally let you do it.  YouTube. Oh.  And then then we'd like to do that.  We have no reason not to do that.  We put all our shows on YouTube and then you can embed away.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, email somebody now, but I'm sure Matt Cutts has already done so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Matt, if you're listening, I just I just I have we have a producer's account.  We have a director's account. We have all the different.  But but you have to get some sort of dispensation from Larry and Sergey  or something before you can upload full length.  I think they're worried I'm going to upload, you know, full length versions  of Happy Days, but I'm not. I really am. I'm not.  I mean, I'm really not.  I really am not going to do that.  It'll just be Twitch shows.  Everybody, thank you for being here.  We will see you next week on This Week in Google.  Bye bye.
