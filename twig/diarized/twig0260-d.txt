Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is the show that covers Google, the cloud, the Twitter, the Facebook.  Whatever our esteemed panelists want to talk about.  That's because they are so esteemed.  He's just steamed.  That's Jeff Jarvis, the king of the rant from the City University of New York.  Cooling down my bursitis.  Oh, ow!  What is bursitis? Is that a painful butt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually that's where it is. Yes, it's an inflammation of the bursa.  Oh.  Don't be 60 people. Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all downhill now, Jeff.  I thought it was an inflamed bro.  Anyway, I'm sorry. Jeff has had a no good, terrible, very bad day.  A flat tire, a broken Mac.  A light bulb just blew out.  You should just get under the covers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yesterday I had a three o'clock appointment and a four o'clock appointment,  and I transposed them in my other calendar.  And so I then told them both to change, realizing I was wrong for each.  I tried to get back a hold of them to make sure it was back where it was.  I'm just, I'm telling you, it's just not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's just take it easy today.  It's going to be a nice day.  Relaxing, fun day, gathering with the friends.  Jeff is a blogger at BuzzMachine.com, author of Public Parts.  What would Google do in many other wonderful things?  Gina Trapani is here, founding editor of Lifehacker, host of All About Android.  She's the creator of ThinkUp, a fabulous analytics platform for your social media at ThinkUp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Hello.  Hey.  Happy to be here. I like, I like kind of chill days.  We're going to chill today.  Yeah. We can talk about Jeff's computer decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about my computer decision. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. What computer decision?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, my Mac is, is Bort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're going to, you need, well, you know, it's perfect because Apple just came out with new Mac Pros.  Do you want a desktop, a laptop? What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, no, you're going to make fun, but, but this is the advancement in the world that you're, you're living in the past.  I'm debating getting anything.  You don't need a computer. Hell no.  In the cloud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get a Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The idea that you have to have a computer upon which you download things and store things was a, was an idea for a while.  But the structure of phones where you have, you know, local apps, but basically all your data is up somewhere else.  That's the way it operates.  And the apps can operate anywhere. That's the way Chrome operates.  The same architecture.  I'm thinking I'm the only, the only reason I got your, what's your, what's your box?  Your thing, your, your, your, what's the, what's the printer box that you advertise once?  Oh yeah. The expert server. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. I got that going. So my, my Mac had two reasons to exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One was as a print server.  Yeah.  I then messed up the, the, I can't get the printer back into the, into the Google print because I deleted it and I don't have a working computer to put it in there.  So, but I'll figure this out.  And the only other reason, the only other reason for the last year I have used that machine was Skype for you.  Oh, wow.  Well, don't get a new one.  That's it. So I was thinking maybe to go get a mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only reason I have a desktop computer is so I can have big screen real estate. That's the only reason.  And I have, I mean, I have at home on my desk, a 31 inch monitor, 4K monitor and two 27 inch monitors.  That you need a computer to do that.  It could be a laptop, I guess, but I have a Mac.  You can do a laptop. I mean, I plug this laptop.  So, you know, but you're not saying when you say computer, you mean laptop or desktop, right?  Yeah. Yeah.  You're just thinking I don't need to get anything to replace this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're getting rid of all local storage, basically, is what you're saying.  You don't need local storage, like a hard drive, a physical hard drive, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So, so this is this, this is the show about the cloud.  I think I'm about to become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the cloud needs an end point in your home.  You can't just have something at home that attaches to the cloud.  My cloud doesn't flow into your mind.  So Chromebook, I think Chromebook is enough.  You have a pixel. You have several pixels. That's enough.  Yeah.  Why would you need anything more?  You don't edit video.  You don't do.  You're not a photographer.  Oh, but I did.  You don't play games.  If you were a photographer, you would not want a Chromebook.  Well, no, but if I'm going to do a hundred photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the use case, I think, for regular folks or for someone like Jeff,  who primarily is a writer, right?  But like the photo thing is where I kind of stop because I and I know you can upload all your photos to Google Plus photos.  And I do that. I have my auto backup on my phone now.  But I have gigabytes and gigabytes of photos that I took pre Google Plus that I don't really want to upload to the cloud because I know to get them out,  you know, it would be multi a multi gigabyte download.  And why wouldn't I just have the hard drive in my, you know, myself?  But I get I get the argument for not maintaining your own.  You know, I've got a stack of external drives at home and my archives of stuff, you know, before the cloud ever happened.  And I don't know, though, it just makes me nervous.  I'm lucky there, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I have never been organized.  So I don't have any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to be fair, you have a use case that doesn't need a desktop computer.  You don't have video.  You're not a serious photographer, serious photographer, the shooting camera raw, serious photographer with a bunch of volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the photo is not the photo.  It's not purely for storage is because of raw processing photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all you need light room.  You cannot do that on a Chromebook period.  So so there's certain things that you need to have a computer for, but you don't do any of those things.  Yeah, I don't design.  And you're not alone, by the way.  Most people don't know.  And the kind of photography most people do with their smartphone, it automatically uploads to Google Plus.  Google Plus gives you all sorts of great features that for a normal person is plenty.  Most of my photography is done on Google Plus.  I don't use Lightroom for a lot of it.  So that makes sense.  I'm just trying to think of if there's anything that you might want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do Microsoft Word documents for those who still use it in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the greatest, but I don't think you need a computer when you sat down at your Mac.  What would you do?  You do Skype.  You do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing.  It's it's off to the corner over here off off camera.  I think you're fine.  And the poor corpse and get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save some desk space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm even thinking I got my pixel, which as you know, I adore.  I'm thinking for trips because because they're so interchangeable, you know, I might get the HP with or one of the new ones that has eight or 10 hours of battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a great idea.  We I would like to get that Dell, but I think they've taken that off the market.  The new one coming.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  So we got the for Michael, who's in sixth grade.  We got the Acer C720.  It's 200 bucks.  It's little. It's light.  If you lose it, no big deal.  And that's the best part about the cloud.  You log into Jeff Jarvis at Gmail dot com.  And now everything's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm the same as if I am anywhere.  Yeah.  And really like.  And so, yeah, the picks.  The only thing about a pixel is it's it's it's between five and six hours of battery, which is when I'm around town is absolutely fine.  No problem.  I go to the office.  I come here.  I plug it in.  I go to the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't do photography.  You don't do video.  I mean, there are a lot of uses for a computer, but none of you do not.  I think you're a good candidate, actually, to live in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole idea scares the crap out of me, but I think it's great for you.  You're a programmer, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to program in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing. I can't I can't do it because that's right.  The software that I spend most of my day in is is a text editor with a bunch of plug in.  I guess you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've seen that's going to change to there are some web based editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  Hooked in to get it.  You wouldn't argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you want to run your debugger locally on a local CPU.  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  Well, I would I would feel like programming is hard enough.  Here's my issue with cloud is if it makes anything at all harder than I don't want to do it.  It's the same problem I have with using the iPad as my main computer.  Yeah, you could do it or your phone.  You could do it, but it's just a little harder.  Why would you make it a little harder?  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what I'm trying to say is directionally where this goes.  That you wouldn't have ever stored all your documents up on this somewhere else.  It's been offered for a long time.  Apple offered it ages ago and it was awful and you didn't do it.  But it's fine.  It's now reached its its its usable critical mass.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's reliable enough.  It doesn't go down much furthermore.  So because we've gotten used to this idea because we have multiple computers at home at work, maybe several at home, several at work.  And what you want is the same data set on everything.  And the cloud is the only way to solve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we as disorganized as I am to be able to sync before I was awful at it.  Right.  Terrible.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, you probably have reams of documents that you produced over the years.  Jeff, what do you do with those?  Have you just uploaded all of those to to to drive at this point?  Do you use Dropbox or everything that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I have I have boxes of clips in the basement, which my wife hates.  Yeah, you get rid of yours and yours and years ago.  But no, you know, once once my book is done, I don't care what the file is.  Can you?  Here's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not I don't know the answer to.  Could you take a large USB drive, plug it into your Chromebook and download your entire Google Drive onto it as a local storage?  Can you do that, Gina?  Do you know?  You can.  Yeah, I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can work offline.  Right.  There's offline support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm thinking you could do that without the USB to save your but be able to save your stuff locally, which I think is a good thing.  I mean, Google's not going out of business, but why rely on some third party corporation to store your stuff?  You should have a local drive.  Or if you can do that, then that's fine.  I could sink it to Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dropbox.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, you know, we're doing this in in in in entertainment as well.  Do you buy discs anymore?  Do you rent discs anymore?  Very much.  Now we stream everything.  It's all in the cloud.  Even you know, I don't I don't want to buy a random thing.  I don't want to buy a rent movies.  I just get them on demand.  I mean, I do rent them, but I guess I don't I don't want the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't we all moving in that direction?  Is physical media is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or even downloading the giant file legitimately or not.  Like I got tired of that.  I was like, I want to download two gigabytes.  I don't want to wait that long.  I want to start watching right now.  Yeah, I'll spend the whatever 15 bucks on Google Play or wherever I need to buy.  Just just get it right now and not to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing with music.  We used to have record collection while your every time you move to biggest pain in the ass.  You box up these records, you move them.  All of those.  You have them all.  You don't even have to buy them now.  Anytime you want.  You listen to Google Music and it's all 20 million songs.  The entire collection is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That entire bookshelf behind me.  Now, on the other hand, I went into sometimes like my favorite rabbit hole is to go to the New York Times Time Machine.  Love that.  And go to old clips.  I found a great one this week.  I wrote about it on Medium.  What happened to newspaper illustrators when photography came?  And it was right in the moment of disruption.  When Lincoln died, the illustrators rushed on train from New York to Washington to go and look at everything and sketch and draw and then draw their finals on the train the way back to get them in.  When McKinley died, photographers existed and they didn't have to exist.  One daily newspaper had 85 people in the art department.  Many of them eliminated.  It's a picture of what we have today.  This is a wonderful piece.  So in this process, I found another book about fire and electricity.  And that was the third thing.  But 1901 book about, oh my God, technology.  And it just so mirrors the thoughts we have today.  I love it.  So I bought that good old book.  And I like it.  But the truth is, I can also because it's so old, I can buy that as digital.  I don't need it as a book.  It's an emotional thing.  I kind of like having the book, though.  I know.  But you're holding on.  What I'm trying to say to you is you're holding on to your computer the same way you're holding on.  Yeah, no, I agree.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I am sort of clinging to it just because I'm like, I need my hard drives.  They make me feel better.  But yeah, you're right.  Realistically, I don't use them during the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels like what Jeff's doing is a little risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  It feels like he's leaping off a cliff.  I'm trying to imagine just having a Chromebook would freak me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I wanted to raise it today.  Yeah, to see what you thought.  But but I'm not seeing a reason to go out and spend six hundred dollars.  The minimum I can buy, I'm not going to buy a Windows machine.  Sorry, Paul Thurot, not doing it.  No, you'd be nuts to buy a Windows machine.  I'd be I would drive insane.  So the minimum purchase would be seven hundred or six hundred dollars for a Mac mini.  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could even hook up a big screen if you wanted a big screen monitor and a typewriter keyboard.  You could hook it up to your Chromebook or get a Chromebook mini Chromebox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My keyboard is is great.  I don't need a mini.  I mean, I can hook this up to the right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the truth is, tell us in the chat, I'm saying it's very risky.  It's not risky. In fact, it's less risky because you're you're trusting the cloud provider to keep your data safe.  And I think that it's mature enough now that that's that's a reasonable thing to do.  The only issue is privacy.  The only issue is if you had stuff, nude pictures of yourself that you didn't want to trust in the cloud because the NSA would pass them around because you're such a stud, then you would want to keep those in some local fashion that is not connected.  Or you want to encrypt them.  Or you encrypt them.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Oh, wait a minute.  How are you encrypting them?  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't encrypt them, not reliably, because you no longer have a computer.  The only way to do that reliably is to do that locally in a local CPU.  Yeah.  Or I could email them myself.  What do you in fact, what do you do for a Chromebook for encryption?  Is there a plugin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Is there a true crypto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Email? Yeah. You mean email?  Well, but okay. So if that's happening, then yeah, Google has this new thing where there's some JavaScript that's doing the encryption.  Is it possible to do a public key crypto with JavaScript only?  Now, the other thing is...  It's not exactly trust no one in that case, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Back to the risk piece. I accidentally screwed up.  Pardon me, I'm writing this long, boring thing now and I screwed up and erased five paragraphs I've just written.  And by God, Google versioning, it was there from last night. It was fine.  Boom, one button, I was done and I was happy.  So I never versioned my stuff that way.  Trying to get to Microsoft Word versioning was torture.  It never stored the version you wanted. It was, hey, hey, it was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the doc stuff is really great.  I mean, it's really great. In fact, today, my coworkers pointed out, and I actually think I missed this in the changelogs.  I think it was the week I was on vacation, but you can do like suggested edits.  You can either give somebody edit rights or you can give them the right to comment, which actually turn into suggested edits where when you can then sort of accept or reject.  We didn't do it. It's great. It's fantastic.  It's like, yeah, this is the way this is supposed to work. I mean, they really have.  And the versioning is awesome. Yeah. And you all get that for free.  You never have to actually physically save your file.  I mean, it's great. It's great modern software. It's great.  So, Jeff, what happens when your publisher sends you some crazy word template that you have to use for your book, which is what Wiley did to me.  They sent me this like crazy word document with like all these different templates and formatting and like roundabout thingers.  And I had to I don't know.  You remember what I had to do, but I had to hunt down the right software to open it. Does that I mean, I guess I guess an author would be torture.  I screw you. I'm going to use the template I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. It's just it's just words.  I think the next thing the thing that I'm writing now is this is this probably about 50,000 word white paper on now that your friggin Internet has ruined everything Jarvis.  What now? And and it's all my thoughts on new relationships, new forms and new models.  And I put the relationship stuff up on medium already.  So there's now a Google add on.  I can't live real or something like that that will turn your Google Doc into an e-book.  Most of the format.  So I'd use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charm says I should just the Charm says I should just buy you a computer and send it to you.  But I thought we're trying to be pure. I don't think you should.  I don't think what you're doing is risky in the least.  In fact, let's face it. It's much less risky.  How many people have lost data on their home computer?  Many, many, many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, my IO error, IO error, IO error.  That would have been enough to put me into cardiac arrest a year ago.  Now I just said, oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ben, that must be me, says, what if Google locks your account?  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's the big risk.  That's the big risk that your account gets locked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be it would be a good idea to have a backup of some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I need I need to know how to sync to Dropbox.  I haven't I'm sure it's just well, that's why I ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this would be the best way to do it.  If you can plug in a hard drive to a Chromebook and say, Google, give me all my data and put it on the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But even better. But then I've got then I didn't do it for a week.  Which is what the case always was. I never backed up.  Right. So what you want to think of drive is it does it automatically.  What if I had a structure where it did automatically?  So that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So obviously, I have TTT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if this then that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Like if there's a new dry document and drive, then stick it to Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know what? The problem is there, Gina, there's a new document to drive every three characters.  Yeah. So what you probably want to do is do a daily.  Right. You do an IFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  IFT if this and that at a time, it only does it every 15 minutes anyway.  It doesn't. It's not real time.  That's fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty good. I mean, you know, even in this case, you said you saved it last night and you deleted.  I mean, that would still have the it's drop off revisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need I need. I need your help.  We want some way to sync all of your Google data in real time constantly in the background to some other service.  It could be Amazon. It could be Dropbox.  It could be what Backupify did.  I did. Unless you back up if I used to kind of do this.  Oh, yeah. Are they still alive?  They have been much constrained.  I know that they sent me a note saying we're not going to be doing I think they've gone enterprise.  But I wonder if I back up a fire for Google Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I have the time is the Apple time machine in here in the home, but that still stop what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you want is a time machine for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to you want a virtual time machine. You want a cloud time machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This will this will do it every day.  Set it. Forget it with backup of eyes. Automatic.  It's only three times a day. I think that's sufficient.  Google Mail, chat, drive, calendar, contact and sites.  It uses 256 bit encryption uptime.  You actually answered our question, Jeff.  Backupify. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody should do this regardless of their Chrome OS only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is for apps. This is not for public.  You have to have the paid and that's what happened.  They went enterprise. They used to do it just to they do it for Salesforce, for social media and for Google Apps.  Well, that is a great idea.  That is that is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's back up to back up a fire needs to be a consumer solution for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And that way you're just you know, you're it's not it's not a lack of faith in Google.  It just answers that question. It's that it's that security blanket.  Google real time API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from Bb16 in our chat room.  This oh, there's an API. So you could somebody could easily write using the API.  You'd have to give them your credentials.  Gina, why don't we do this? You and I will do this.  We'll write this. I'm a little Python. You're a little bit rock and roll.  It'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just give me your username and password. Your two factor off credentials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need to give access, obviously.  All right. Here's another one from Cloud HQ.  This is great. Chateram, you're great for this kind of stuff.  Cloud HQ dot net synchronize how to synchronize Google Drive and Dropbox.  Oh, well, so this is a product, I guess I gather that will do this.  It will back it up to a variety of services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because the ideal is it just does it for you.  So you never think it's just like the essay I wrote about about the death of control less.  I'm not saving that way anymore. Yeah, right. Who needs that?  And so you want a backup that you don't ever have to think about. It's just there.  And yeah, you're paying for it for pure security. You may never look at it for five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, so so Cloud HQ does this between a variety of things ever note everybody pretty much.  This is really interesting. Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, Box, ever note, OneDrive, OneDrive, Pro, SharePoint, Web Dev, which means you could Web Dev would be great  because then you could go to somebody and say, I want to set up a Web Dev server on software and then you'd own it and it would be your private thing.  And that would automatically make SugarSync, which is a backup solution. SugarSync might have a let me see if SugarSync has a Google Drive solution.  So this is the only safety net that I would I think I would say that if you had this, I would have no problem, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. None at all. Right. And then the my presumption is that more and more and we're going to go to gig connectivity.  And we're and we're going to go to absolutely costless storage and processing with a cloud. Yes, that's pretty obvious that that's going to happen.  So so then your arguments about photo. Why? No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's certain things you need. A lot of local storage and a lot of local CPU.  And among those are high quality, you know, professional photo editing of raw files, video.  No, I'm sorry. You're never. And the reason is not that, of course, the cloud servers will have more power than your local CPU.  Yes, it's the transporting large amounts of data back and forth that's required by this kind of stuff.  But if it's a gig line. Man, OK, maybe. Yeah, I mean, maybe down the road is certainly not doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it doesn't make sense to do it. It's nutty to do it now. I'm not I'm not I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that someday we go there.  I mean, there's we video you can edit video now through the cloud.  And the difference in video is you actually get an advantage because rendering locally on a slower processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree 100 percent. But it's the transport of the data that is prohibited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference here is you transport it once and then you render every time on the cloud.  You may be better off than having to render slowly locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I understand that argument. Try it and you'll see why you don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know now. But again, I'm just saying so go to the next incremental improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And someday everything will be the size of a dot on your forehead and you won't have to even have a keyboard.  But for right now, I wouldn't recommend that.  But the things that you do, which is writing, writing is very small amount of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why you know I used to work on a green screen with a mono cursor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to talk to my buddy at Carbonite and ask him, why don't you do that?  Because this would be a great product. It really would be a consumer product.  And there are a few. This cloud HQ looks like it does. It looks like it's the personal plan is 100 bucks a year.  They don't say how much data, but it will synchronize Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not. HQ is not storing this stuff. It's just a transport. It's a synchronization. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the data is not that much. Yeah. So you could say have one drive, you know, the Microsoft solution or Dropbox and synchronize them.  That seems like a I'm going to try to try doing this because increasingly everything I do is on the cloud.  The other thing you're giving up is you don't I mean, desktop word is I think you could argue better than Google, the Google Word app or I.  But I don't edit it anymore. It's the only time I would have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't care at all at Word. I don't use it at all. I write entirely and drive now.  And I see advantages doing that. Right. The versioning is automatic. The saving is automatic.  The functionality is easier. I'm not doing fancy formatting. Right. I'm writing text.  If I were doing fancy formatting, I'd be doing it in Quark or what should we call it? InDesign. InDesign. Thank you.  But you can't do that without a desktop. No, if I were doing a print print. Right.  Right. Where are we now? We're in it. We're design is separate from content. Right. Presentation is separate from content.  That's what the Web did. So what you really care about is your underlying data, your content.  And then design is a new is a layer on top of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As you said, there's a point where the phase change happens, where you no longer use Illustrator.  Suddenly you use photographers. And we haven't quite come to that. I think we might be at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe we're at that point for right for me and not for some people. My video students. Right.  So we're at that point for writing. Yeah. For transactions, for communication. And it's happening very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think a lot of how I mean, it wasn't every time I said two years ago, I'll forget physical media.  You will no longer be buying DVDs or Blu-rays or people still yell at me when I say that. But it's true.  It's true. For all but the most, you know, audio file or video file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, people still like Blu-ray. But I just want to know that I am living. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  La Vida. Cloudy. You are. I mean, Jeff, you've been kind of fixing to make this transition for a while.  I think at this point, you know, it makes sense for you to just to drop the default assumption that you have to have a Mac.  You buy just don't buy a Mac. And worse comes to worse. You need something. You need a Mac for you.  Go to Apple Store and buy a Mac. You know what I mean? Like just but you know, see how long you go.  I'll be interested. Yeah. I think you don't need to. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My one with what was it? 64 K in 1981 cost, I think, thirty five hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Jeff, this is this is a momentous moment. You have bought your last.  It is. I think so. Now, here's the question, Leo. Here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happens when you get pissy and you start cursing me coming in on Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we have to live with that. Hangouts going to get better, I hope. Web RTC will get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're doing it for the show, Jeff. I appreciate you've gone totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we OK with him? He's on Hangouts now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the one the one issue that we're having and it's it's on our end is I think we need to upgrade our processor here because Hangouts for some reason does not frame.  It's not great. Yeah. And you can see it. And this is my assumption here.  I'll bring this back up here. And this is this is what I assume is happening is that our processors are just getting maxed right now.  Yeah, because Hangouts. Well, I don't know what is going on there.  Wow. But yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah, they are pegs. Look at that.  Jesus. And see that. So, I mean, that's that was a very quick, you know, it could be some other issue.  But that but that was, you know, my my quick diagnostic was that for some reason Hangouts is using up tons of CPU usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other issue is that it may actually use all it can get. So maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if it's doing that, it's still the frame rates real bad. I mean, it's still not great. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's that's the next issue. If I look at the other problem I have is that I paid for the 50 megs Verizon service.  Jesus is only about 50 percent. Yeah. Yeah. And they give me 25.  So I've got to call them. And this is where I started conversation last week.  I have to take the breath and a day to call my provider.  Say I'm paying you for this. You're not giving it to me.  You know, I don't want to have to do. Tomorrow's my day off. It's Comcast Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Comcast Day? Friday. Oh, Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just did the same thing to upgrade mine. But.  And kind of equal up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll have 50 with it when they give me what I pay for. I'll have 50 up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Up. But 50 down. You know, increasingly, I my calendar, my to do list, my phone book.  This is all in the cloud. I have to say this isn't actually actually what.  No, I am going to have one day for going to the DMV and one day for for Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you want to go to the DMV together because I need to go to the DMV, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's go to the DMV together. OK. We'll make it a day.  It's like saying I got to put aside a day for a root canal. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we'll get breakfast, go to the DMV and then get dinner. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, great. I decided with Comcast, I'm going to go to the store.  I've decided that of all the options, phone chat.  Yeah, you can stare at somebody there. I think the store is the best.  I've always had the best service in the store because, yeah, because you're actually looking at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're looking at the person. Yeah. The only problem I've had, Leo, is I've gone into the store.  I'm going to bring a box of chocolates.  They're not the best at the whole system sometimes, so they will mess up something else in your account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that could happen with anybody.  My experience with the store is they're usually pretty, the most competent people in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they're nice, and you've got to face them. And they're nice.  And you bring a box of chocolates. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had great results in the store, so I think that's what I'm going to do is,  hey, I just want to add Turner Classic Movies. Can you help me?  And then we'll see. Should I record it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wear your Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know what? That's called Defensive Google Glass,  where you don't use it, but you just wear it.  The threat that I might be recording this.  The observer effect.  You've got to use the observer effect upon them.  You've got to think that Comcast, particularly right now, they're very sensitive.  So if you started any Comcast conversation with, do you mind if I record this?  You'd probably get better service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw Craig Newmark yesterday at an event here in New York.  Wonderful, amazing, delightful Craig. Sweet guy.  He pulled out from his pocket.  I hope I'm not telling the story of the school, Craig.  Pulled out from his pocket because he watches Twig.  He pulled out his pocket a Verizon executives business card.  And he said, I just saw this person this morning.  They're aware of you. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, dear. That could be a mixed bag.  Next is seven. Oh, dear. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're aware.  And I have my next seven with me.  Oh, is that the next seven?  You know, is this the one that's going to have to go to a museum?  All right. So normally we'll do news on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's actually a good amount of Google News, but none of it really got us excited.  So what I might just do is run down the headlines.  And if either of you have anything to say, just throw it in.  How about that? And then we still want to do the change log.  I think we've decided no more computers for Jeff.  When did you buy your first personal computer, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My my Osborne one in 1981.  So this is you know what? It's been 33 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's time to stop. Stop the madness.  Now, Leo, when was the last time there was this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First, when was the last time you did serious photo editing?  Oh, I do it every day. Not every day, but I do it frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You really do? Yeah.  The most recent one I put on plus.  Lisa got her. Not plus.  No, no, no, no, no. But I know.  So Lisa, I posted it plus.  Lisa got her 49ers season tickets.  So I took photos with my 5D in camera raw.  So these are 40, 30 or 40 megabyte files.  That's a beautiful. OK, was imported into Lightroom,  processed it in Lightroom, uploaded it to Google and posted it.  It's a wonderful photo, Leo, but with all respect,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  would your phone have done that much of a different job with those kinds of photos?  See, Jeff, this is why you can live in the cloud, because you can't tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm saying if you're doing your Hawaii landscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm telling you, Jeff, you can't tell the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why you can live in the cloud.  Believe me, my phone cannot do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, fine. All right. That's what I'm saying.  All right. All right. Gina, it's really it's interesting.  Like I'm of two minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think about this in kind of the context of, you know, what kind of computers are is going to use?  How am I going to introduce my daughter to computers?  She's one. OK, and I realize that, you know, on one hand, I want to build a PC with her.  I want her to understand how to snap the RAM into the motherboard.  And I want to know what it is like to buy a case and put a computer together,  because I want her to understand what's going on underneath.  On the other hand, I want her to understand how to do that.  On the other hand, most likely, I mean, first of all, she's already started to use my phone.  Right. So she's already been introduced to her first computer.  She she picks up my phone and goes like this.  It means that I want you to start my app because she's got like a little toddler lock app.  So on the other hand, I think I'm going to get her phones and tablets and Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. She is never going to have a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never. You don't think she's ever going to have a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, no, that's my point. That's my point, Gina.  By the time, of course, the edit is going to come on.  You know, Jake was starting them at three years old.  I do the big moment in our family was when we thought that we had to, you know, take Jake through living Bill Gross's magnificent living books.  And we had to do this for him. He'd say pointed that we go click on it because this mouse was really complicated.  Then my parents went up with him. Of course, they didn't know what the FML mouse was.  We just grabbed something from them and starts doing it.  And he's like, here, let me show you.  So Ed is going to be using things and creating things.  There's great. There's a I forget what the name of it is.  There's a there's a there's a programming app for kids that's called Turtle something in tribute as an homage to the old turtle MIT stuff.  It's really wonderful. And there's great stuff.  Yeah, but she'll be she'll be creating and doing phenomenal things without the need for this notion of a computer.  It's like saying, Son, you really ought to know how a carburetor works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I know. I just I learned a lot of patience and I learned a lot about computers by building one myself, by installing windows from from from scratch, by Googling.  What the hell is this DLL and how do I fix it?  Editing, I know this is really old school stuff, but like this was like this was like me figuring out.  And I was figuring that out is is gaining the confidence that I can fix anything that happens that comes my way because I fix so many things to begin with.  And I think like like so to give her a tablet or to say, you know, you've just got Chrome, right?  You've just got access to these web apps.  And if the web app is down or if you run into an error, there's nothing you could do because that's all that's not what we're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She doesn't have to. She doesn't have to put in the motherboard know how to do that.  Right. Right.  I mean, listen, I ordered a Heath Kitt ham radio once.  Mm hmm. Am I am I less fun?  You know, because because, you know, I don't know how to fix a radio and put a new tube in, you know, and that things change.  No, I think what Ed is going to need is she's going to need no code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to need no Python. She's going to need no rest APIs.  That's that's the building a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said that's true. Rest APIs.  And yeah, that's true. That's the rest APIs is sort of the new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's getting no AngularJS and no chance she's going to.  Those are those are the bits and pieces that are the Heath Kitt of the future software.  It's not hardware hardware commoditized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a done deal. OK, that I accept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's fine. You know what? A great thing to teach her.  Python and when she's six. Hell, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it even goes back, Leo, full square, but as old as we are, is you what did you do in the original days of computing?  You went to the lab and you got time on the mainframe.  Right now, everybody has time on the mainframe as much time as they want.  Sorry. Oh, I was afraid of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was shocked. I had already pulled on my headphones because Jeff was talking to me, so I couldn't tell that you were talking off mic.  I thought you're talking on my shot.  It's that that lower third overlay problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, right. I fixed it. OK.  Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't teach a kid how to build a crystal radio set.  You wouldn't teach. I mean, it might be fun.  And there is this whole make movement that is really retro in many respects.  And I don't have anything wrong with that.  But really, if you're saying, well, from a practical point of view, what are the building blocks of the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I ordered Bill Gross's $200 or $300, whatever it is, is his three printer.  He has an amazing. He really reduced the price of a three printer phenomenally.  So what's going to do and is going to be able to do CAD software to make things that she can then get physically in the three printer and make them fit together and do things with them.  And Jesus, that beats Heath kids. Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, also, what's that project that Google project project, the one with the snap, you know, the phone that snaps together the different components?  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess that's similar to putting together a PC. Right.  And it's just smaller and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the other thing, too, is we learn different ways.  I mean, the story I always tell about Jake and programming is that I thought you had to learn those charts with the with the diamonds and the arrows.  And you have to plan everything out because every developer says you got to know everything before you do it.  And what do you do? You show them how to dig into a program, tear it apart, put it back together, see what worked.  That's the way you learn. Times change. Yeah, that's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I accept that. All right. Listen, don't buy a Mac. I want to see how I want to see if you ever come to a place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's right. I have to give in. And I'm glad I'm actually glad, Jeff, that you raised this issue, because I think you're absolutely right.  I don't think you I think it's the time has come. It really is occurred to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was it was a step change in the cloud world. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm going to continue to buy computers because of the stuff I do. I need a computer.  But I'm sure that time will come for me at some point, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is for you, then they go half your shows. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's fine. We will move on. We'll do more code. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean, code's exciting. Frankly, I prefer to talk about code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's much more interesting. And it's very similar to the day when I started watching, you know, watching Twitter and you guys will start launching into specs of a monitor, a new monitor is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, you're not a computer enthusiast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, I'm not that way. But I'm saying even now, we don't care anymore.  Well, some do some do, but not to the detail that we used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's very much like stereo equipment. Remember how in the year old enough, I'm old enough to remember where there were people who are just really into stereo command.  And the fact that the music they were listening to was totally secondary to the fact that they built the perfect stereo.  And if they listen to music, it was the 1812 overture because the cannons and the bells are really a good test of the subwoofers on their on their clips horns.  And there were stereo magazines, how to build stereo people talked about total harmonic distortion and RMS wattage.  And it was, you know, then there came a time and I think it happened in the 60s with when Rolling Stone came out where the content became more important than the hardware.  And that happens. It happens over and over and over and over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me play to your point, though, in a different way. Right. So so my father was not a mechanic.  I'll tell you this way. Confession moment. So for my my sixth grade science fair, which I won, I built electronic bongos.  What does that mean? What did they do? I don't tell me it just it was little egg cups with metal and and and you could tap them in it.  And it just caused the amplifier to go bing, bing, bing like a drum. Right.  But it was a kid. It was not a kid. It was instructions.  And I built it and I did the chart about why it worked this way and all this kind of stuff.  But I had to build the amp or I had to take an old radio amp and put it in a new case and a new speaker and to build that.  And the thing just tilted every which way. It was it was it was as if as if designed by Escher.  Right. And and my father, this is this kind of a Howard Stern moment.  My father came down and said, you're so clumsy. You could stick your finger up your with two hands.  It's mean. It was it explains a lot about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This reminds me of last last week's Masters of Sex. It's all about the mean daddy.  Did you watch it last week? Oh, one of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.  Really? Oh, most of it takes place in a hotel room.  Yeah, it's really in the backdrop and I fall in love with her.  Jesus. Oh, my God. Yeah. Well, I loved her from day one.  Yeah, she's gorgeous. Lizzie, Lizzie Kaplan, Lizzie Kaplan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, so my father and I never went and tore apart cars and did all that.  Right. Let's say that you did. Let's just say you did.  So he was was he mechanical or no, he was an engineer.  He's an engineer by training, but electrical engineer.  So he wasn't a Greece kind of engineer, no physicals.  Anyway, so, Edda, so let's say that Edda enjoys physical engineering.  She's not going to build a Google self-driving car because it's too complex.  It's too delicate. It's the you know, you're not going to.  Yeah, maybe you can plug in some things to it.  But these days with cars, a lot of us run by computers.  That chance of really being able to run the thing is gone.  Is gone, Gina. You're right. And there is something lost there.  I'm not denying that. But Edda is going to have so much more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is. She's going to. She's going to.  And I'm going to have a lot of fun. It just changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, there's a guy and there's a guy said, I didn't tune into this show to be less techie.  This is not less techie. No, no, no. If you're a hardware fan, this is very disruptive to you.  And hardware doesn't go away, by the way.  Hardware persists. Hardware has to. Servers and all of that.  And there'll be plenty of people who build servers and all of that.  But the but what happens is the mainstream of technology moves into software.  And I think that that's been coming for a long time.  It's you know, that's soft. And Gina, I think you'll back this up.  Yeah. Software is where it's at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's my prediction. Edda's revolt is going to be that she goes to Renaissance Fairs and ends up carrying nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just just play the flute. I'm going to be making buggy whips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the future. I'm going to be like, are you excited?  The FCC approved this GPS chip that I can just embed under your skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now we can always be in touch. And I'm like, no, no, mommy.  Nope. I'll take my my spiral notebook and a pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to get technology ruined the world. I got to tell you that, though.  Neither of my kids is is technical. They both use computers, but neither of them is like are geeky.  And I don't I wouldn't count on it being anything that you want her to be.  Let's put it that way. Oh, yeah. No, you're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And certainly the novelty of it isn't going to be there for her the way that it was for us.  Right. Because it's not it's not new. Right.  I mean, she's it's just going to be around her to be part of her life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wish you know, the happiest day of my life was when Henry said, hey, can you teach me how to hack?  And I said, great, we're going to start with let's start with Python.  And then we're going to and then he said, no, I just want to get into get into my grades and change them.  Well, you've got to learn to code for that.  It's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I guess we should never think my father loved golf and he tried to get me out the golf.  I hated golf and it all ended once on the driving range when I ended up pulling back my driver and hitting him in the shin.  Accidentally, be very clear, because I'm clumsy.  And that was kind of and then he ended up hitting me in the head with a ball off a drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A good walk ruined.  All right. Here are the headlines.  According to the cable companies, it's not the cable companies that threaten net neutrality.  It's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a classic reversal, but I still don't understand what their argument was in a filing to the FTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time Warner Cable says the controversy over Internet providers charging websites for access to special fast lanes is a quote red herring.  The real danger is that Google or Netflix could demand payments from them.  See, they live in a cable.  They're living in the cable world, which is exactly how that works, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And they think that Google is going to put up a paywall right then, which is absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're living in the past.  They're living in the days where you pay HBO to carry HBO on your cable company and then charge the customer.  And that was how the finances all worked.  Right. It's not going to happen because Google's like a set of a paywall.  No, no, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  It's not their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't mean it's really a very old fashioned way of looking at things.  This is, by the way, what's happened now with the debate.  And I'm not sure exactly what to think about it.  We were talking about on security now, the debate between level three and Verizon over who's causing the congestion.  And Verizon says, well, it's Netflix slash level three, their carriers fault because you're pumping.  It's all asymmetric.  You're pumping so much data one way.  And so it's not really a peer relationship in the sense that we're symmetrically sending data back and forth.  So we want money from you because it's not.  And that's how pairing works.  And I don't know what a good argument against that is.  But that's just a deal with AT&T.  Yeah, you know what?  That's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to do deals.  So the cable companies are indeed charging for service.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google X has a new project to collect anonymous genetic and molecular info from people to help detect disease earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what I think is the most important thing about the Wall Street Journal.  What actually about this one was that Google X Lab really is the closest thing we have, I think, to Bell Labs.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Maybe it's better.  It's big.  Yeah, I think it's better than Bell Labs.  So that's what I wanted to talk about.  So how?  What technologies could make AT&T money?  I think always.  No, no, no, always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did things.  They did pure research.  Things that they didn't know were going to have an impact on them.  Give me an example.  There's even an argument that Unix wasn't going to be terribly useful to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Unix was probably one of the great Bell Labs invented the transistor.  They invented Unix.  They invented so much of the technology that we used to know.  They did a lot of astronomy and weird stuff.  OK.  It seems like Google's even going farther afield.  I mean, Google's business has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles or the human body.  This reminds me of 23andMe in some ways.  The baseline study will collect anonymous genetic and molecular information from 175 people initially, later thousands more, to create a picture of what a healthy human looks like.  It's being led by a 50-year-old molecular biologist named Andrew Conrad.  He joined Google X in March of 2013.  70 to 100 experts.  I think this is a Larry and Sergey are a little bit more open to the idea of putting money in for I think for the public.  I think you're right there.  But it's also smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Another question.  I live near the old Bell Labs and it's is it massive or two major facilities and it's phenomenal.  It's huge.  That parking lot is just empty now.  Yeah.  And it's quite sad because so much happened there was phenomenal.  Does Google X have to be as big as Bell Labs?  Do you need as many scientists to do things?  Is it more distributed?  You know, if Google is our most successful technology company as AT&T was in the time and they're doing this for society and for the future, which I believe they are, you know, is Google X big enough?  Yeah.  Some people complain it's too big.  They're doing too much crazy stuff.  But maybe maybe they're not doing enough.  I don't know.  Maybe you saw this in school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hemo the Magnificent.  This is from Bell Labs.  You wouldn't see this in school today.  They're quoting Leviticus.  No, this is 1957.  I guess they did a series of educational videos.  So that doesn't help AT&T.  No, they did a lot of stuff like that.  Frank Capra produced this.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When they were doing this.  When they rolled the projector into class, weren't you happy?  Oh, they had major Hollywood movie stars.  Yes.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love the movies.  I know you keep explaining to me that this is a picture of a home.  Jim, come on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's get cracking with this.  Look, you know, this is the film for my science screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take care of it and keep it in focus.  Yes, sir.  Okey doke.  All right, guys, let's get set for rehearsal.  Everything works this time, boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like a real Hollywood movie.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm a magic speaker.  I'm a magic speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A real Hollywood movie.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My magic screen film all set up, Jim.  Well, the screen is ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's his name, the guy on the right?  Oh, you know, he's a great character actor.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Fiction and science.  That's a pretty good team.  Say, what's the big show about today?  He-mo the Magnificent.  He-mo?  He-mo.  That's Greek for blood.  Oh, blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was entertaining to us, Gina.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, don't get any on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The class was just not having to do classwork, was it?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just, I think we could watch TV.  Yeah, I think he was the voice of Winnie the Pooh, but I'm trying to place his name.  Wait till you see what I've got.  The chat room will tell us.  And who's that guy?  No, the chat room's far too young.  He's a movie star.  Come on, magic screen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Magic screen?  See, it's in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, what's going on here?  Why, that's Mel Blanc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they really, I mean, this is Big Bucks, and I think you can safely say that this is  not a moneymaker for AT&T.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an educational video about blood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a whole series of these.  There are quite a few of them.  Wow.  So, you know, Google doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sterling Holloway, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that who that is?  Maybe.  I might spend, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, I read this article about Google doing this, and I think, why is Google doing this?  Why isn't a medical?  I mean, I know that Larry and Sergey are particularly kind of obsessed with health issues because  I forget which one of them has the predictor gene for some disease.  I forget which, but I don't know.  I think that their intentions are good, and of course this data is being collected anonymously  and all that.  But I just wonder, it just seems like whenever they do projects like this that involve massive  amounts of data collection, and of course data analysis and data collection is what  Google's good at, but there's always that question of what are they doing with it, and  there are privacy concerns, and I know, I know, Jeff, like they shouldn't be, but there are.  There are.  And I just, it makes me worried that they're going to do more harm than good, you know?  Because the headline is, you know, why is Google indexing your DNA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in fact, the MIT Technology Review, Antonio Regalado writing, says Google X's  project to study human health, that's no Apollo 11, it's a secret lab.  He really poo-poos this.  It says it is in the moonshot.  I mean, come on.  I don't know, it seems like, I mean, we can be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think Gina's got a really important point here, which, but, and I believe that  these guys really mean it, that health data should be open for the good of all.  It's a cause for them.  Yes.  And you're right, Gina, there's a risk that if they mess this up, then they ruin their  own cause.  But if they do it right, we are limiting the knowledge that we have, we're losing lives  because we don't know enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Google the right, is Google the best, like, organization to do this?  I guess is my question.  I wonder if Google's the right...  Or Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, so there's an interesting argument here.  You remember the Human Genome Project, the project to map the genome.  There were public sector scientists working on this, and there were corporate people working  on it, and it was the corporate people who solved it very quickly, very much quicker  than anybody thought.  And I think at that point, people, it opened people's eyes to the fact that this could  be done in the private sector.  Right.  And that, if, and of course there was some incentive to do, map the genome, because maybe  you could patent it.  There is a project that's been going on for considerably longer, the Personal Genome Project.  I tried to get in on this.  Esther Dyson is one of the people who has donated her data to this.  This is from Harvard, so this is, this is a public sector.  And they're get, they've collected, I think, both the genome and the medical information  for something like 100 people, or this was the plan.  And the whole deal with this, and the reason it was very difficult to, and I've asked to  participate and have not been invited, is because you had to be willing to give, I mean,  there was no privacy involved.  In order for this to work, you had to consent that your name would be, they said, well,  you're not going to be able to keep this private.  So your name will be known, your phenotype, your genotype, everything will be public.  Researchers will have access to it.  And there you go.  And because you can't keep this private, if you're going to participate, you should understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was talking to Esther Dyson about this issue once, and I said, well, I suppose, Esther,  that by talking about my prostate cancer, I've revealed something about my son's genomes.  He said, oh, Jarvis, get over it.  Everybody gets prostate cancer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true, eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  George Church is doing this.  And we talked to George on our show, Futures in Biotech, some years ago, and I tried to get in on this.  And I think it's a great thing.  And I just, I don't know if, you know, if you sign up, you agree to pay for the tests, which are several thousand dollars.  And I wanted to do it because I felt like this would be a contribution.  I agree.  But you have to do extensive medical questionnaires, because they're trying to match your genotype with your history.  It's great.  And this is totally for the public good.  And I think somewhat similar to what Google's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was, there was, I went to the privacy event, the all hands at privacy event at Google about two, three months ago.  And the guy, I think his name is Mikey Dickerson.  He's a site reliability engineer at Google chat room, maybe no, and tell me if I'm getting his name wrong.  But he was the guy who went off to rescue Obamacare's technology, along with a few others.  But he was the main guy.  And he came back and he gave a really, really eloquent, wonderful talk about having a lack of what a lack of knowledge has done through history of health.  Right.  And the classic example is is Stephen Johnson's retelling of was it typhoid?  Yeah, the water, the water, the water, the one well in London water.  Yeah, water. Right.  It was knowledge that cured that.  Yes.  It's data that cures that.  And keeping that data private, you know, still seeing illness is something to be ashamed of, is something to be punished in society.  So that people do hide it is only going to hurt us.  And yes, if you have Ebola, there's a reason that we want to keep you off and keep you separately and the family, you know, kidnapped that victim.  And that's not good for society either.  And I understand that there are still always going to be strictures about about health information.  But in general, more information is good.  Full stop.  You could misuse it about privacy.  You could misuse it in bad science.  But to choose to have less information is insane on its face.  So I think it makes sense of Google.  I think who's better to gather and analyze large amounts of data at a consumer level?  Now, you know, who's better at it?  No, I'm only NSA, but I don't want them to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but then there are people who equate the Google with the NSA.  It's the private sector version of the NSA.  All right.  Let's say there's a good conversation.  But I think it's time to play the drums, play the trumpets, play the horns, put Gina Trapani to work because it's time for the Google change log.  Google change log.  What's new with the Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina has the latest Google Maps got a pretty big update or a new feature on iOS and Android.  It's the new Explorer feature.  I don't know if you've gotten this this already on yours on your phone, Leo.  So you launch Google Maps on your phone and there's a brand new button on the bottom right.  And it's the Explorer nearby button.  And you tap that and Google looks at the time of day and the weather and your location.  And it basically just recommends like what's what's the nearest best thing kind of nearby.  Very similar to Foursquare.  Clearly using Zagat, clearly using your social connections.  It'll tell you from your circles who have who has gone places or rated things.  It's it's pretty nice.  So the new feature expands Google Maps is more than just kind of a directions app.  It'll it'll make suggestions for you and adjust the results on context.  I do have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's next to the next to the bullseye that says pinpoint where I am.  There's a new button that has a little pin dropped into a circle.  And if I tap that, it says here's what's near you within a 10 minute walk.  It says it's the afternoon.  It's 88 degrees.  Here's some quick bites.  Mary's Pizza Shack.  There's some parks.  Here's ice cream.  Tea houses.  Bakery.  They think I'm a fatso.  Where's the nearest gym?  Here's some Zagat stuff.  This is I'm glad to see Zagat.  It's on the maps now.  So I get maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it's literally it's a it's a new button right on the interface.  It's not even buried in the menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it also maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is kind of nowish, isn't it?  It is kind of nowish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I was saying on all of an Android last night, like it's great.  I normally would use Foursquare for this kind of thing.  But I went to to explore near my office.  My office is kind of like an industrial area in Brooklyn and there's not a lot of lunch  options and it actually found a place that I hadn't heard of before that I wound up saying,  I'm going to check this out.  So it's pretty good.  Lots of images, lots of ratings and, you know, takes a consideration open, open and closed  times.  I believe it does not recommend places that are not open at the moment that you're  checking.  So it's pretty good.  This is sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, my favorite thing that Google does to me now.  What?  On Saturdays, only on Saturdays in my Google Now, it tells me how long it takes to get  to Bridgewater Commons.  And the reason is because on Saturdays I go to Chipotle there and it knows that I go to  Chipotle.  It says 70 minutes to Bridgewater Commons.  Yeah.  OK, it's time for burrito.  It knows when to do it.  It knows when I'm there.  Of course, Germans would find that freaky.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was actually thinking, I think we've talked, I've talked with Mike and Elgin and others  about the Android Wear watch.  And if there's a negative to the Android Wear watch, it doesn't do enough of that.  Enough.  I agree.  I want more Google Now, not less Google Now.  In fact, that that would be I mean, I guess you've got a constrained screen.  You can't just load it up with stuff.  But I really like this new maps feature.  I love it.  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, it could be like, oh, I see that you it looks like you pick up coffee  most mornings at 9 a.m. at this place.  Have you tried this other place down the block?  You know, your friends, you know, Jason, Sarah like this place or something like that.  Oh, look, we're on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're we're we're here.  We're a popular attraction in the play and see section.  LLC.  Yay.  Well, there's not that much stuff within five minutes.  So I guess that's that's that's probably a popular attraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, you guys played is the new Foursquare out because they did the split off of the  check in is a separate swarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use swarm, which is the check in part.  The check in thing is the new core Foursquare out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I haven't gotten the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so they're going to redo that at the same time.  Right.  I'll be curious to know that's where Foursquare and Google are going to compete again.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Google.  I mean, they own Zagat.  I mean, I mean, they really they have Google Places, so they have all those businesses.  Seems like they know where you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To me, to me, the huge trove of data that's just waiting is they know what restaurants  we go to.  Right.  They know how many people of what type go to what restaurants.  I mean, American Express knows that, too, but in a way, they can't really use the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's been fairly judicious.  They obviously don't want to go too far down that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google also knows, gee, Mr. Leporte stopped for 12 minutes at this address.  Yeah.  That's a gas station.  Hmm.  Everybody seems to be going to that gas station.  What are what the price is?  I mean, you can there's there's there's there's more data to play with there.  That's phenomenal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're talking about the passive tracking of your phone's location.  It's so so Leo's not checking in at that gas station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, exactly.  It just knows where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is what which is what Foursquare tried to do.  Dennis Crowley tried to get to by having people sign up for the app and just do it, but it  was still he was still stuck with the with the check in motif and wants to break out  of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So explore there in Maps.  You're right.  Now it's interesting.  I didn't I hadn't really thought about Google now, but I guess Google now does do that, right?  Like you don't necessarily check in at Chipotle every Saturday, but Google now says, Hey, it's  Saturday.  Are you headed to this this place?  So I started to do that habit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Yep.  What else do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Google Voice.  Google Voice is now offering web based calls through Hangouts.  No Google Plus profile data.  No Google Plus profile needed.  So this is this is a little bit of a minor minor new feature.  But if you use Google Voice, it might come in handy.  So now this means just Google Voice on the web.  If you go to Google Voice on the web, if you search for a user and you click on the call  button, you can choose which phone to call for that contact.  And under that under that choice, Hangouts is now a new option.  So you can call the person through Hangouts and you don't have to have a Google Plus profile  set up in order to use that.  A little tiny minor move toward integrating Voice and Hangouts.  I want to see more of that.  I want to see Voice and Hangouts merge completely at some point.  Gmail for iOS is getting the update that Android's had, I believe, for a while now.  Not not for a while, but a few weeks.  Gmail for iOS just got insert from Drive and save to Drive.  That update released this past week.  And just like with Gmail on the web, that means that iOS users can now insert files  directly from Google Drive into emails and save attachments from emails into Google Drive.  When you if the recipient of the email that you're sending doesn't have access to the  Google Drive document, you can send them Gmail for iOS will inform you and then you can  change the sharing settings, sending settings before sending it.  And that update is rolling out now.  I think it came out this week.  Google Translate has added crowdsourcing features to improve its translations.  I got to say, crowdsourcing worked really well in a lot of situations, translations particularly well.  So Google established the Google Translate community, which is open now, open to everyone.  So that gives users who speak more than one language fluently the option to offer their own  translations and validate current translations.  So if you are bilingual or multilingual, you should go to translate.google.com slash community.  You can tell Google what language you what languages you speak.  And then if you click on the get started button, Google will just show you a phrase and say,  here's a phrase in English.  How would you translate this in another language?  And the more people who do this, the better translations we'll get.  I think that Google will also show you current translations, translations that it has and let you let you correct them or update them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that an acknowledgement that machine translation just is never going to get as good as human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Definitely given Google's inclinations, they probably would like the machine to do it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Even I mean, even with Android apps, when you when I localize my app into a few different a few different languages, it just there's so many there's just things that are, you know,  there are different translations and you want a human looking at them and even and even Google, you know, they had added the developer console for Android apps that you could basically sign up for a service that had actual humans reviewing your your translation.  So they're definitely they have conceded that machine translations don't work completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we've all known that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've known that anyone language is just a little too hard.  Finally, Chrome beta for Android, which is actually my default browser, and it's been it's been great for me.  So I recommend it got the material design makeover or a material design makeover.  Ars Technica has a nice rundown of the changes.  You know, it's just that the changes are subtle, but also, you know, very, very nice, just kind of open, flatter, whiter, just much more sort of material design.  Then then you think a little simplicity, fewer lines, more space.  The logo got a little bit punching up a little more colorful.  A couple of things are broken because it is a beta.  I think that I think the numbers and show up on your tabs button anymore.  They've combined the address bar on the search bar and some contacts.  Incognito mode.  The new tab is completely black and has got a new icon, just really kind of neat.  Yeah. So really nice update there.  I've been running the Chrome beta.  Like I said, it's my it's my default browser and I really like it.  I like it a lot.  So material design, the materials on makeover for Chrome, the Chrome for Chrome hasn't been completed yet.  I think Google's still I think it's still a work in progress, but it's kind of neat to see material design rolling out to Chrome and to the Play Store and to the kind of proprietary Google apps before.  Android L drops.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  Boy, it's really depressing when you go to volunteer to help with Google Translate and says, select the languages, you know.  And you're like, oh, none of those terrible Americans were terrible.  Look at all the languages I could know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to fake it, say Italian, even though that is totally not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speak fluently, speak fluently when you like to be one of those people, you know, has but it won't let me check more than five.  Why limit me?  I can speak so many languages.  Is Klingon listed there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see.  That's a good question.  No, they're not looking for Klingon translations.  Sorry.  Did they?  They also had like Leet speak in but none of those in here.  This is these are actual languages.  Cherokee.  That's interesting.  Chitwa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Igbo.  Tlugu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm just saying nonsense words.  A lot of languages.  There's a lot of languages.  Right to be forgotten.  Let's give Jeff a chance once again.  There's so many.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't even know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  50% now.  The new frontier is Spain.  What's going on in Spain?  Spain has passed a law that requires payment to link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  It's called the Google tax and it's a it's a prior payment to link and then they're going to give the money to big old media companies to save.  It is just beyond.  It even goes beyond the rest of Europe.  So what is Google going to do?  I mean, they're not going to pay people to put links and search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course not.  And I think it was as Boeing Boeing that pointed out that even if you're a small blogger, you can't opt out because it's now considered like a human right in the bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a I don't think it's gone all the way through.  Ridiculously stupid.  And now I understand why Google wants me to come over and speak and full disclosure, they pay for my airfare because I'm not going to lose money on this.  But they don't pay me at a big 10 event in Madrid.  And now I have a wife.  They want to come to Madrid.  Yeah.  It's you idiots.  How do you say idiot in Spanish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, how do you chat room?  If we were fluent in five languages, we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's that.  But but there's there's a ray of hope this week.  The the Lords, the House of Lords in the UK has said that the people who are going to be in the house of Lords are going to be the people who are going to be in the house of Lords.  The UK has said that right to be forgotten is undoable and stupid.  Good. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Lords know.  Yeah, it's the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the Google advisory committee is going to hold a bunch of basically public hearings and they've invited people to send them their views as if the advisory committee is kind of a faux FCC now.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they should have open hearings.  They should let you watch the sausage being made and then it would become very obvious very quickly how untenable this is.  Fifty percent of all the requests over one hundred thousand links from ninety one thousand people have been granted so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's a list of questions that Google and Bing and Yahoo were called on the carpet.  Shea Woodshed about their their implementation because they weren't happy that Google was notifying the delink that they've been delinked as media stories, which write stories about that.  So there's this list of questions of what they demanded of them.  And it's just again, it continues the tremendous idiocy of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What information do you request from a data subject prior to considering a deleting request?  Do you filter out some requests based on the location, nationality or place of residence?  Do you delete results?  It makes it sound like surfs.  What explanation do you provide to data subjects when you refuse to delist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we decided not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is God.  So hyperlink.  Hyperlink.  This is like I guess it's a it's a jobs project for for the EU.  Like Google's going to hire thousands of people for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But in both places is a war against the link and the link is the fundamental architecture of the web.  Yeah, no, it's a war against the web.  It is the link is subversive and government has finally figured that out.  And they're trying to subvert the subversion of the link.  And let's hope they fail.  They fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has made another big acquisition, according to sources, venture beat and others reporting.  Google has paid one billion dollars to buy Twitch TV, the Justin TV spin off that allows you to watch live game streaming.  Sources familiar with the matter told Dean Takahashi a billion one billion dollars.  And you know what?  I don't think anybody's saying it's not worth it.  That's certainly the number one thing to watch on YouTube right now is gameplay.  Right.  PewDiePie and others.  People love it.  I watch Michael.  He's 11 years old.  That's pretty much all the television he watches is YouTube videos of gameplay.  That's it.  It's big money here.  This is the future.  Both Google and Twitch and declining comment at this point.  They bought they bought YouTube for one point six five billion.  So wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitch has 50 million.  It's not that big.  Fifty million monthly active users.  More than a million who broadcast members members who broadcast videos each month.  But that's big growth.  They've grown considerably over the last couple of years.  They also distribute shows from people like CBS interactives GameSpot joystick and Destructoid, which are gaming news sites.  Thirteen billion minutes of video are watched every month on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said it with last time we talked about this.  I don't get it.  Well, you're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm old.  Yeah, I'm old.  You're not a gamer.  We interviewed on triangulation this week on Monday, the first really successful professional gamer, Dennis Fong.  His handle was Thresh in 97.  He won the tournament to be the best quake player in the world.  Got a John Carmack's red Ferrari as a prize.  And he pointed out that now these tournaments have prize purses in the millions, tens of millions.  And these tournaments really make their money by broadcasting the gameplay of the tournament, you know, and then having big events and so forth.  So the what was it?  League of Legends tournament?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the tournament that the League of Legends by Riot Games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's pretty it's pretty impressive.  I have to say it's become big business, but it's not for you and me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I guess I guess I should celebrate that the entertainment becomes interactive and people are more involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should watch.  Some of these are very exciting.  Some of these videos are very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see.  I don't even I can't play them in the first place.  I'm not a game player at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why you don't need a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can watch Twitch on your Chrome OS.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can.  You can.  You do need to have some context, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it's totally exciting if you have some context.  Like what's what's this game about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the point?  You want to watch some Twitch video right now?  Give us.  Was it this show or was it Twitter that we showed the Pokemon Red victory?  We did on the show.  That was on this show.  So you've already seen some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's not really all that much about the game.  It's it's about whose personalities of the people who are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it is.  Yes, absolutely.  Well, it's a mix.  I mean, Michael watches a lot of these to learn techniques and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like right now, I think what time is it?  No, he's stopped.  There's a few streamers that I tune into just to watch their screens.  Really?  Because of what they say, because they're funny.  Right.  They're they're great people to hang out and the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the thousand people are watch this guy playing.  You saying I shouldn't do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, they're fine.  It's usually profanity, right?  Absolutely.  And then also you went into an area that is probably the least appropriate.  So this is a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, look at what he's doing.  He's on a green screen, I would guess.  And there's his there's him.  And in the background is his his his screen.  So this is a fairly sophisticated setup.  Where should I go?  Games channels, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, games is perfect.  And then they are rated by most viewed.  So right now, League of Legends is on top.  Yeah, it's boring to watch League of Legends.  Sure. Absolutely.  So go go watch Minecraft.  All right.  Minecraft. That's fascinating.  Right. It's number six.  Who's up there on the mat pack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got the John Bams, Wild, D Field, Mark, Beast Machine, 9-11, Chaos Chunk, Ketzel.  Any of those ring a bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, none of these guys.  Let's look at this.  We've got fifteen hundred viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're. Oh, this is for mature audiences.  Yeah. So they'll let you know that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But probably people are playing Plague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's ink on here.  That's not exactly an action game.  We're going to start watching.  I might warn you, there may be fleeting expletives.  So this game is not exactly this is a tablet based game.  Well, Plague is now a PC game.  Yeah, you can play it on any platform, but it really came out of tablet.  And it's really a touch game where you're trying to conquer the world with your plague.  So you design your plague adding capabilities as you go.  It's not exactly as you could see an action game.  So you're saying it's this guy.  That's the thing. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in order for these people like, you know.  I feel like I missed a bet.  There's a guy named Bacon Donut and every night he has seven thousand people, you know, tuning in to watch his stream.  If I search for Bacon Donut, can I watch one of his videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he probably has stuff archived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Making bacon donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Sevenus, you know, is another big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chad knows all about this because he's under 30.  And he streams seven days a week, you know, for four hours.  Does he make money on this? Absolutely.  Bacon Donut is the tastiest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does he make money on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Donations are a big ploy.  People give him money.  Yeah. And so what they'll do is they'll have a ticker that shows the latest donations, the top donation of the night, the top donation of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you Michael's watching Bacon Donut.  So there's Bacon Donut. He looks like a bacon.  So he's doing like a podium. He's on a green screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Some people choose green screen.  Some people choose face cam box.  I like the green screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You really look like you're putting your head in the low.  I mean, well, anyway, so let's hear it.  Let's listen. What's going on? You have it muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have it muted? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's unmuted. Let's listen to all the Twitch glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the record? Our record is two hours and 30 minutes. Right now it's about an hour and eight minutes.  He's doing a speed run.  And we'll increase it by an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's got somebody narrating because he's obviously busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was actually in a call with someone that's not bacon.  Oh, that's not bacon donut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things that I find less interesting in this is the expression on people's faces when they're playing video games is pretty much that.  Is pretty much that of an unconscious zombie.  There's no affect. There's no smiling. There's no laughing.  They don't look like they're having fun.  That's true. That's true.  Dragon, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As you can see at the top of his video, you know, top this month, top today, most recent.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was about to say that I hope my surgeon has this much concentration.  But of course, after you die, he laughs.  I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, there you go.  That's an example.  And he's making a living doing this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also like I just feel a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's five bucks a subscribe.  Like control a first person.  Watching someone else game is like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's even more passive than playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, I mean, like the movement of the camera, it's just very.  Oh, yeah.  It makes you crazy.  It's orienting like.  We're just all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all too old for this.  Clearly, I missed a bet.  I really think I could have done a good job of this had I been a little younger.  I think I'm funnier than a lot of these guys.  I could have done a good narration as I play the game.  I blew it.  I could be making millions now instead of sitting here talking about Google on your on your table with with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Table with with lines in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to get a new table and I can I afford it?  No, bacon pancakes is taking all the air out of the room.  Google offering three months of free unlimited music to celebrate one year of Chromecast.  You got to buy a Chromecast to get it.  Chromecast has been now used 400 million times to cast sessions to TVs.  Are they are they counting?  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That doesn't it seems like that's a small number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four hundred million or hundred million casts.  And they sold how many a million Chromecasts?  OK, 400 per device.  OK, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Services like YouTube.  And let's see.  People are Chromecasting.  All they all they say is they've sold millions in 20 countries.  Millions.  It was not one million.  OK, I know what millions means.  It could be anywhere from one to nine.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So even if it's two to two million or three million, it's probably in that ballpark.  It's we're talking about 200 cast per device.  That's good.  That's active use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that is active.  And I would say most people have a Chromecast use it fairly actively.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I finally got a smart TV where I watched TV most of the time, I don't use my Chromecast.  You stopped using it.  Yeah, pretty much, because I'm Netflix or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we care that the judges, the FISA court, the FISA courts rotated in and out.  The judges come from a pool and but that some of these judges own Verizon stock.  Do we do we care about that?  Is that a big story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fun to be able to find any fault we can with this whole system.  But the truth is, it's not like Verizon makes money out of her fist from.  FISA decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FISA court Judge Susan Wright purchased Verizon stock valued at.  Unfortunately, we don't know the amount.  Fifteen thousand or less on October 22nd.  Dennis Saylor owned Verizon stock, got a dividend of less than one thousand dollars.  Government disclosures don't include hard amounts.  So, you know, you've said many times you own what I don't know, a handful of shares of Google.  I don't think that I don't I don't know.  I mean, normally a judge will recuse himself or herself if it's ruling on a case that he has a financial interest in.  So if he owns stock, he should recuse himself on a case that involves Verizon, I guess.  I don't promise all of this is so secret.  You just don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  Are we going to see a Nexus six, a Nexus phablet?  Sources say Google and Motorola are working on something.  Android police.  Of course, just as soon as I buy the one plus one, of course, is a new five point five point nine inches is a little bit bigger.  The information, Jessica Lesson story corroborates the earlier report provides additional detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's I wonder whether doing a Nexus phone on Motorola was a condition of sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lenovo. Oh, interesting.  Just just speculation might be who would make that condition.  Google or Lenovo? I think it's good for Lenovo.  It's good for Lenovo gives him something to sell.  The code name is Shamu, as you know, a killer whale.  So it would make sense. It would be a large device.  I'm waiting for the new Motorola, whatever they're going to call it, that they registered a trademark for a Motorola Max.  They already have the Droid Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the Max, the X successor or the X plus one or that's what I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one I'm very interested in.  We haven't heard a thing. Motorola has trademarked Moto MOTO MAXX.  They already have Max for the Droid.  I guess they don't have a Moto.  All right. We have now gone through every story that seems of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we made a show out of it. There wasn't much news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we talk real quick about the Twitter hashtag, well, Twitter's announcement and then they ask Costolo to hashtag getting taken over a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. So Twitter stock went up 30 percent.  They beat their street on their Q2 user growth revenue and they even turned a profit.  Congratulations, Twitter, in their most recent quarter.  And so what Evan did a Q&A?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Dick Costolo does a Q&A on CNBC and CNBC says, OK, you know, hashtag your questions for the CEO of Twitter with ask Costolo, which is his, you know, instead of ask Dick, ask Costolo.  Probably better.  A tremendous number of users, particularly in sort of my community and the sort of the the the folks who rail against harassment and abuse on social networks, particularly around gender and race and ableism, all that stuff, really kind of took over the hashtag demanding to know like what is Twitter going to do about abuse and harassment?  Because, you know, look, the truth is, it's a lot easier.  It's a lot. It's very easy report spam on Twitter and spammers get dealt with pretty quickly.  But when you're being called names, when you're when you're being threatened and abused or whatever, often there's no response or or or very small response or response that's two months later.  So it was interesting. It was very interesting to watch the whole thing go down.  I was a lot of people who I follow were participating in the hashtag and then retweeting questions that people were posting.  And I actually participate in hashtag. I don't do that very often.  What did you say? What did you ask?  I just said that I hope that he was that he was listening to those questions.  I knew CNBC wasn't going to pose those questions to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And so people ask, does Twitter call violent accounts?  Does does Twitter? How many times do you have to report an account that exists solely for smearling people?  There we by the way, I get abused mercilessly on Twitter.  I just block the accounts so I don't ever see it, which seems to me fine.  I don't you know, my my Twitter stream for a long time, I just didn't want to even look at it because it's so negative.  So I just realized, well, I could just block those people.  I don't I just block them and I don't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, someone like Adrienne Richards, for example, when that whole thing went down, she was she was actively threatened and abused.  I mean, to to the to you know, there was a huge spike in activity for that kind of thing.  And you really you do feel helpless.  And when I defended her, I got I got crazy.  I mean, I get a sort of low level of harassment.  Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just because you don't see it and it's going on about you.  That's not a lot of fun to just have this unimagined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. I don't I'm completely in the dark about it unless somebody comes to me and says, says it's going on.  I don't see it. Maybe you guys see you probably do see it.  But I don't know. It doesn't bother me.  And and frankly, it seems like I'm well, I don't you know, of course.  And there's a good article, a blog post about the least Twitter could do.  Dental campus writing about some of the things that Twitter could do, for instance, block users who account.  You should have a block all users.  Allow users to block all users who accounts are less than 30 days old.  Because the problem with this and I can understand Twitter's position is the same thing as saying to Yahoo, hey, you got to stop spam.  Good luck is it's easy to create a Twitter account.  People do it all the time and they do it particularly to harass.  So I guess giving us better tools, right?  So Danilo is saying give us tools to block users who are accounts or brand new block users whose follow accounts are less than a threshold.  A lot of the accounts attack me have, you know, 10 followers and they were created last month.  Block new users whose at replies include any words the user decides.  So you could say, hey, if they say, you know, screw Leo Laporte.  Well, I don't want to see that block.  Any user has been blocked by more than a certain number of people I'm following.  You know, I just it's it works pretty well for me just to go into my feed and whenever somebody says something I find trollish, I just block them and I never see them again.  And it's really made my Twitter feed a lot more pleasant.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you have a concentrated attack, you know, if the I don't know, you know, if some Reddit board decides to attack a particular user, you know, what could Twitter do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how could Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I think that some of these suggestions that he made are pretty good.  I think it's you know, this gets into free speech issues of free speech and what could they possibly do?  And is it Twitter's job to police what people can say on their service?  But it does sort of get down to that, you know, if if this was the same question, what happened with Reddit with the troll who was posting, you know, whatever it was, you know, posting photos of young women and bikinis or whatever.  I forget violent acres, the violent acres story.  And it kind of came down to this thing was like we're a platform and does the telephone company moderate what people say on the phone and this whole question?  And I mean, I sort of land on the side of, you know, Twitter has built spam filters, right?  Like like these and so has Reddit like these platforms for communication have built algorithmic ways to deal with spam in order to improve the user experience.  And I think dealing, you know, creating algorithms or offering users more control like some of these controls that that deal proposed is is a way that they can also improve the user experience.  But they typically don't because these are usually folks that get threatened and harassed on Twitter are are disempowered groups of folks and people, you know, the people of color.  They're women. They're not they're not, you know, privileged folks with lots of free time and lots of money and lots of power.  Don't feel threatened by someone. What are shopping an image of them?  Right. You know, so anyway, I thought I thought it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean it goes to the right to be forgotten question, too, because it does.  It does. Does the law of certain things.  And I'm objecting greatly to the right to be forgotten.  People some people say to me, well, hold on, Jarvis, you know, they kill certain stuff.  And if you go back to Brandeis and Warren and their their groundbreaking essay on privacy in the U.S., it came down to a right to be let alone.  And that was their definition of privacy in the end.  And so it's part of what you're saying really is in a sense that if you're if you're not well known, if you're not trying to be out there, if you're not trying to get people just coming after you, do you have a right to be left alone?  And it sounds right that we should.  But then again, you know, you have to you have to get pretty far down the road on harassment in real life to to get a an injunction slapped against you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, would it be would it be sufficient for you if Twitter provided some of these tools that Danilo is suggesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that these are these are some ways to give users control.  I mean, I've certainly been in situations where my mentions column not only made me feel, you know, sort of upset as being called names and whatever, but made me feel like helpless because I felt like I can block this person.  They can continue to say things about me that I will no longer see, but will still be out there.  Like, is it my job to sort of monitor whether or not these people are going to show up at my house or what?  You know, but and it's that feeling of helplessness.  I think that if the platform is built well, you want to give users a feeling of of control.  So, yeah, I think that some of these the best controls are are good suggestions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best they could do is make it so you don't see it.  It doesn't that does not respond to your issue of right.  Exactly. Should I pay attention to what they're saying in case they're actually going to commit an act of violence?  You have to read those to do that.  So I think the I mean, I don't in that case, what do you do?  Does Twitter have to? Well, I want faster responses from Twitter to say they should ban if it's abusive speech, they should ban that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, and they have to make that person instantly create a new account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it takes no time. Right. That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it feels like there are ways that, you know, program both programmatically and with a little human intervention that you could you could detect those those kinds of locks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's IP address. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you could detect if it's coming from the same IP address, you could detect to see, you know, we do that in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We actually do that in the chat room. We enforce those rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I think I think part of the issue, though, is that, you know, somebody I'm not going to I'm not going to give this person a moment's attention.  So please allow me to be very generic. Someone wrote a really nasty piece about me some time ago.  Well, somebody wrote really nasty when you know about a long time ago, but but but little more recently.  And I could tell what was going to be a paragraph in and I just read that. Right.  And I saw a couple of people tweet about it at the time and I just, you know, ignored it.  I'm not going to give the person the slightest satisfaction that they can you do. What else?  Yeah, I didn't see it. And so to some level, you know, I've had I haven't had anything the women have, but I've had a few not jobs come after me.  And at some point, if they get absolutely no satisfaction from no, if they know that you are not seeing what they're saying, it takes away some of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example. Some of the people who are tweeting against me are tweeting that to sponsors.  Now, what do we do? Right. Right. And the concerns of sponsors, the sponsors don't understand.  I mean, we tell the sponsor, they just trolls. Don't worry about it.  But that concerns them. That concerns them.  So that's an economic I mean, I mean, violence is a whole different thing and much, much worse, obviously.  So but I don't know what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's also like I think the three of us have been public figures to some extent, you know, for for a long time.  I mean, life hacker, my first two months at life hacker.  I mean, I was like getting thrown in the boiling water of being just exposed to so many people.  I mean, I was shell shocked. I just never had such a big audience and I had never been criticized so and nitpicked and just discussed so publicly.  And it's very jarring if you've never had that situation before.  And now I feel like I have a much thicker skin. I'm much I can much more much more likely to just brush off somebody who you know.  But in the beginning and for someone who's not used to it.  And I think that this is happening to people who, you know, don't, you know, have a couple hundred followers and this is the first time they've really had any sort of public persona or, you know, they're gaining some sort of following for whatever reason.  I think it's it's genuinely frightening.  And I don't think the solution is, hey, just don't pay attention to worry about it.  You know, because I think I think in the moment you feel really alone and you think what have I shared online?  What can somebody find out about me if they, you know, if they're really dedicated to making my life miserable and you start to reevaluate and feel unsafe and disempowered and helpless.  And, you know, it spirals. I think it's I think it's a hard experience for for noobs.  I think for us, it's easy to say, all right, this is just another crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all true. But I don't think the solution is an algorithm that's going to cut it out because you're right to be forgotten, right to be let alone.  You're going to wait for the next law to come out of Europe to say that people have the right to kill people who are being abused, comments by people being used to them.  And we're back into the same discussion about freedom of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is there is at least one of one of my trolls is mentally ill.  I mean, that's diagnosable. So and perhaps could be dangerous.  Who knows? Yes. But what do you want?  So the process exists. And I've done this before, where you get us, you go to Twitter, you actually go to your police.  And if they if if they think that that's reasonable, that you should be in fear of, you know, for your personal safety, they get a subpoena.  They go to Twitter. Twitter won't give you this without a subpoena, but Twitter will give it to you with a subpoena.  They give you the IP address of the person.  Then you have to get another subpoena and go to that person's Internet service provider.  We have done this and track that person down.  And then the local police in that jurisdiction go to that person's house.  That's all you can do. What is Twitter supposed to do in that?  Would you want a Twitter that just says whenever I ask, oh, yeah, I'll give you that person's IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they should. There's a few things that you can do.  Go ahead, Jeff. Well, just just just there's a range here, right?  It take for a moment. The person needs their meds out of this because, yeah, nothing can fix them.  You know, believe me, I am sympathetic to mental illness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's not a mental illness is a disease.  I mean, literally, they need their meds.  They need their and that's they're in trouble and I feel for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But for the people who just troll for the sake of trolling, the sake of getting at you,  what we need is for society's norms to mean that people pile up in defense of you and and and deal with it and reject.  Is that the right thing to do? There's a horrible show on ABC.  I think it is. You know, what would you do show?  Yeah, you know, they'll have a guy, sleazy guy picking up on some girl who's alone in a cafe.  I hate that. And they wait for some. I hate the show.  I hate the show because it tries to make people look bad. Right.  But some some some brave grandma will go and defend them and say, get away from her and come here, honey.  And then that shows that there are still decent people on earth.  But there are. And and and why won't a sleazy guy go in any cafe and just, you know, hit on any 15 year old girl?  Because there are norms and somebody will stand up and somebody will do something at some point.  And we have to be in a society to figure out ways where that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is, yeah, it's true in a cafe that that works.  It doesn't work on Twitter. It's the opposite on Twitter.  It encourages that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter can offer tools that would make that happen.  So, for example, Leo, if I see somebody abusing you and calling you, you know, making threats toward you, I can't report that person for abusing you.  You have to report that person. Right.  And that doesn't really make sense. Why shouldn't we all be able to look out for one another?  Why shouldn't I be able to say, see, oh, ten of my friends have blocked this guy?  Because, you know, that that would make me feel less alone.  I mean, I just it just feels like, you know, when I was when I was a little kid and I was getting bullied, my sister marched around the corner and told told the girl she punched her in the face.  Like this is this is how it works sort of in life.  And I feel like Twitter could provide more tools to help people feel to help users feel more empowered.  I felt like the point of the hashtag yesterday is that a lot of users, Twitter users and the majority of Twitter users are people of color.  And at least I would guess about half are women. Right.  I feel disempowered and feel helpless and feel like their reports are don't get don't get any sort of response and don't feel like they have the tools that they need to to deal with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's my guess that Dick is pretty sympathetic to this.  And I would expect him to the degree that he can that he would respond to this. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or do you? Yes. He said that he was in a meeting with his abuse team today after this whole thing happened yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like he's a good guy. I don't feel like he's evil in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, I don't either. I don't either.  It's interesting, though, that this the earnings report was what spurred this takeover.  I found it. I found it really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, he was a victim of Twitter's malleability, flexibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I guess. Well, I guess the dick bar was pretty bad as well.  Right. That was that was also the hashtag movement right against the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to think Dick Costello, the CEO of Twitter, gets more of this than anybody.  Right. Don't you think he gets a lot of abuse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He can afford security. He can afford security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. We're it's you know, we this is the only show that we talk about this stuff on.  It's a good conversation. Thank you for letting me indulge me on that one.  No, no, it's very important. It's really good points.  As always with the show, we talk about the big bigger philosophical issues, the bigger issues that, you know,  we are faced with in this new world of ours.  But now would be a good time to get to the back of the book.  The tip, the number and the tool of the week.  Let's start with your tip, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can now ask Google now for directions to my hotel.  Oh, I like that. Yeah. Yeah.  So if you got hotel reservations stored in your Gmail account, Google, Google now knows about it.  And you can say, show me restaurants near my hotel or get me directions to my hotel from here.  And Google now will automatically map the phrase my hotel to the hotel where you're staying.  Pretty neat. So it's kind of an extension of, you know, get me directions to work or get me directions to home.  And it's just now a temporary, you know, a location if you're staying in a hotel. Pretty smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. My hotel, my hotel.  Does it have you have to have a confirmation from that hotel in your email or something like that?  Yep. Yep. That's how it knows.  Cool. Jeff, you have as usual many numbers. Pick as many as you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll go over this one. OK.  So after the stock went up this week on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, you might have seen, is now worth more than the Google founders.  Wow. Not that that's terribly meaningful, but what the heck.  So it's thirty three point three billion dollars ranking him at number 16.  The Google founders are 17 and 18. Bezos is 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Bill Gates used to be the richest man with a mere thirty two billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, who's number one then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm afraid you're going to ask me that, Jan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.  This is the I don't deal in number six or seven, Jeff. I want to know who's number one.  Who's number one? This is OK. This is just the tech guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably Warren Buffett or something. Yeah, probably.  No, Bill Gates is still the richest man in the world. Eighty four point seven billion dollars.  Wow.  That's with him giving it away.  His net worth has grown eight percent this year, but it's not just Microsoft.  He also has significant investments in the Canadian National Railway Company and Republic Services.  I don't know what they do.  Is four hundred million dollars in dividends alone this year.  Number two, Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecommunications tycoon with the best name in the world.  Carlos Slim, New York Times stock.  He sounds like Carlos Slim. Sounds like he's a poker player. He has seventy eight point eight billion dollars.  So Bill Gates, still the richest man in the world. So he see inflation. That's all that is.  Just give me one billion, just one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just one. That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're greedy. I'll do the hundred million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll go hundred million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, all right, all right. Each of us gets a hundred million.  It's only three hundred million. That's just three hundred million. That's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we got to convince somebody to give it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And my tool is, I think it's pretty obvious.  So it's a great story because you cannot get the one plus one phone, at least not at its face value, which is a remarkable three hundred dollars for the 16 gig, three hundred fifty dollars for the 64 gig.  Top of the line, they call it a flagship killer.  And it is, you know, the Qualcomm 801 quad core Snapdragon with a great camera.  You saw probably Jason's review on before you buy or yesterday on all about Android.  He's been using this phone.  So but we we've been trying like the Dickens because you have to either play a contest.  I mean, I entered all the contests I could and I wasn't going to destroy my phone on video, but I did everything else and asked for invitations.  And we never got finally one of our viewers very kindly.  Did you get the same person I did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. No, I think they were different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Offer us a phone.  And so we said yes.  And and Jason bought it, reviewed it.  Well, I bought it. Jason reviewed it and Jason very kindly has let me take it from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he poor Jason gets Google Glass and you get the one plus.  Not fair. Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe I'll give it back when the Moto X plus one comes out or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I want to I want to give a shout out to Ryan Suzuki, who tweeted.  Is that how you got one?  Is that how you got it? Yeah.  Yeah. And then he offered Gina one, too, but Gina had already gotten a kind viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So thank you to all three of our benefactors.  But what the hell is going on with one plus?  Why are they making it so hard to get this phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if it's a marketing stunt, it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But but at this point, you want to pull the you want to say, OK, now we've got a million of them.  Right. Maybe they don't.  Well, there's some I think I'm calling shenanigans.  Yeah, I think it's my first of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said they said in their shipping email that like their startup and they're still refining their processes and to be patient.  Like and it took them a couple of days, like several days to process my order just to process the order.  So I don't know. I don't know. Maybe here's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're selling it below cost. I think there's no way this cost three hundred fifty bucks.  Yes, they it is definitely marketing, but it is not marketing for one plus.  One plus was founded by two people who I think may even still work for a company called Oppo.  Oppo. One plus one.  O P O. And Oppo makes a phone that is virtually identical.  It is. It's virtually identical called the fine seven.  And it costs a little bit more.  It costs what it should cost around 700 bucks. Right.  This is currently not available yet either in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the websites look so similar, by the way.  So here's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is actually the effect in some ways, the fine is even better.  It's got a higher res display, et cetera.  This is a they're selling their loss so they don't want to sell too many.  It is a marketing ploy, but not for this phone.  It's a marketing ploy for Oppo and the fine.  That's my interesting. Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. Oh, you turn on the light.  Jason complained about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too easy to do because it does these gestures of V turns on light.  Because I can't otherwise I can't figure this out.  I'm convinced now that you know, the website is basically exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you might I think you might be right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oppo very cleverly said, OK, we're going to create this dummy company, fund it,  build this phone that is essentially the same as the fine.  Fine seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to ship Cyanogen and we're going to invite.  We're going to get the most influential and dedicated Android power users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, the the find also runs Cyanogen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the fine does run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think what they've done is that they're selling this.  We got this at half the actual cost.  Although I saw a was it I supply one of the companies said they cost should cost them around $200 to build.  So maybe they are making some money on it.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the find unlocked in the whole deal?  I mean, maybe their play edition.  This is their nexus.  This is the developer enthusiast phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Oppo.  Well, that and that's the other thing is you can't yet you can get the older fine.  You can't get the new one.  That's really close to this.  You can get the N1 the fine five.  But this new fine seven is just about to come out.  I think this is all marketing play for the fine seven.  And that they're selling it.  The reason they don't want a lot of people to buy it is because it costs them.  That's my guess.  Otherwise, why do it?  I mean, you at some point you got to pull the plug.  You know, you got to end the marketing and give and make millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one plus one is slightly larger, a millimeter wider.  It's thinner and lighter than the find.  But I think functionally, it's pretty similar.  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  You tell me.  But if you can get an invite.  Now, there are companies selling these at a premium.  Expanse US has it for five hundred dollars, two hundred dollar markup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if the fine seven in Germany, they quoted US dollars is five hundred bucks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just curious.  I just don't understand anyway.  But it is my tool of the week.  This is a I am really impressed with this phone and it feels good.  It's five and a half inch screen.  The other one that you probably would want to look at is the G3.  If you want to get a big screen phone.  But I'll be curious.  So you both getting one pluses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, but I mean, with the exception of one of the nexus is this might be the first time that the three hosts of twig have settled on the same phone as our daily, everyday phone.  That's saying something.  Yeah.  We hook line and sinker man.  I got to change the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That that just probably be able to go back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is not a nano salmon as a micro every time I change the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something goes wrong with my unlimited data account.  Oh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to have a Comcast day to.  Well, apparently there's an adapter.  You can snap a nano SIM into a micro SIM adapter.  Well, if you because when I use my SIM cutter, I save the frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I can only find that.  But yeah, it's just a little bit that goes around it.  I have somewhere.  Maybe you want to try that.  Yeah.  Yeah, it just it pops into it and then it's a full size every go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's every time I go to T-Mobile.  They're like, how did you get this plan?  And I'm just like, don't change anything.  Just give me a new SIM.  Just don't change anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes a very fine this week in Google.  I was nice.  We had just a little time to sit back, relax, talk philosophy.  And I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
