Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did I did I really miss that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the Higginbotham letter I would subscribe sight unseen to the Higginbotham letter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Great to have you both  Next week, you'll be happy to know  Wendy nather is gonna be joining us on the show because I think  We're gonna miss Jeff Jarvis for a couple of weeks in a row. Oh  Would be Jeff and Wendy and Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually then I may bow out because I'm getting the the Botox done for the migraines

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh and we should say this is not a cosmetic treatment because you're already perfect  But just the way I had not heard this but Lisa was telling me about this you can  They but they put it in your shoulders and stuff so that you don't get tense

Transcript:  Take it easy. Don't go. No, there's no need. There's no need relax. Enjoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Enjoy the Botox. Hi, it's more important to schedule your dental appointments right before twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We like that. Is this real life? This is the show we talk about real life really sometimes too real  I'm sad to say Facebook of course as well as Google as well as the Twitter  I'm actually bummed about this first story. I'm gonna get out of the way  Oracle I remember it was suing Google over Java in the Android devices and  They have managed they lost in court  Google has now I mean Oracle has now revived it and  Google may owe them eight point eight billion dollars  the federal court  US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, that's the best the patent court out of DC, right?  That's the one that really is kind of out of sync. I think with the rest of them ruled on Tuesday  That Google's use of Java shortcuts. This was not by the way  That they stole Java, right?  This is the API  So shortcuts isn't quite right. It's what's the point?  I can't write an API. Yeah, but the but this stupid court

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're one ignorant judge away from a really disastrous rule. That's a good way of putting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're all one ignorant judge away from disasters

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well API's are the bedrock of the modern like tech economy. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Having to put yeah, this is really distressing the dispute according to Bloomberg technology, which could have far-reaching  implications for the entire software industry has divided Silicon Valley for years between those who develop the code that  makes software  Steps function. I don't know. I think that that's typo and those who develop software programs  Develop the code that makes software steps fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think this is this is a mangled Oracle's trying to milk it because I mean as as Steve was saying on on security now  this week  The number one scenario for developers is their companies force them to use Java, but they'd really love to use Python

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is that was from Stack Overflow. There was a they they actually they actually had that is one of the one of the  Things that they deduced from Stack Overflow usage. I think that that's true, but this isn't even  Exactly, this is that they use Java  This is that they they use the Java API

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it makes you kind of not trust Oracle as much as a developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean you get you this Bloomberg story by the way is so messed up  I'm sorry. I even pulled it up by using the API's programmers don't have to write new code from scratch  No, this guy whoever wrote this doesn't understand an AP what an API is. That's a library. Sorry Susan  I'm gonna have to explain to Susan Decker what an API is. I'll explain to you all what an API is  What's an API Leo stands for application programming interface and it's what allows you to  For instance, I'll give you a good example. Twitter has an API  We decided when we redesign our website that we would do it in two parts that we would use Drupal  Which is a very good content management system, but we'd use something called headless Drupal  You never see the Drupal Drupal sits in the background and we use it for all of our workflow when we create a new show  And so forth and you can  Get keys to our API and then interact with the database through the API  It's something we want you to do because then you can write an application our application was our website the website  talks to the database through our twit API and  Generates a beautiful website. There's also an app my twit  There's several apps now, but my twit's one of them that actually pulls from the API  And we prefer that because that means when you have an app that's a twit app  Even though we didn't develop it. You will always have the latest information because you query our database  That's a good thing you publish the API. It's published. We publish it on a Pieri  Which is a site for API's so that people can use it and the only reason we make you get a key is so that  Everybody doesn't scrape all our data and kill our bandwidth, but it's an API is supposed to be open  That's how we communicate so copywriting an API meaning you can't duplicate an API is gonna have a horrific chilling effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As if Walmart sued Amazon because Jeff Bezos walked through the front door of a Walmart that's essential

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so I think you guys are being maybe a bit naive or maybe a bit  tech focused here and I'm not I'm not just I totally agree with all of this, however, I  as I said before API's are becoming the bedrock of  Kind of the economy especially with IOT because we're having so many devices and services talk to so many other services  So what's happening is instead of just a tech?  Kind of layer to this we're getting a political and business goals layer to this and so  Oracle's case isn't a technical case. It's a business case and they're saying hey  We don't want you to use our API's to build a competing platform  There are a lot of people who keep their API's private just for that reason and and so I  Would say that we do need some sort of legal framework around API's  But we also need to understand that they are no longer just a bridge between services and I think  Your definition is wonderful Leo, but I just explain it to normal people like hey  It's a bridge that lets my software talk to your software and speak kind of the same language

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But my question is why can't Oracle use technical means to prevent Google from accessing the API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's not that they were acts. It's that they duplicated the API, right?  right, so in if if if Google wants to  Use Java Oracle says that's fine  But you need to license it because you're making a commercial product and you made 42 billion according to them 42 billion dollars off of Android  So Google says oh, well, then we won't use Oracle Java. We'll write our own code  But in order for it to work with Java programs, it has to support the Java API  Mm-hmm. So this is kind of like what Microsoft does with the Linux  for Windows system or  Wine does wine does this to Microsoft to allow so they duplicate the API so that a program that's sitting on an Android machine  Doesn't know that it's not talking to Java. It could be talking to Dalvik, which is some other, you know Java compatible  And I guess there you could make the case if your Oracle well, they should use Java and they should license Java  But this is there's a long-standing tradition of companies  Duplicating API's the API by itself contains no knowledge  It's not a program. It's like how to connect. It's how you talk to me. It says it could be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this will be like the Carter phone decision for the API era  Think about it that way because they're trying to govern how someone talks to their software and  They're saying we have and they have a business case for wanting this to be and  technologists  historically and rightly so or like hey, we want this to be as open and  Be as generous so we can all have things work together and talk to each other and we don't have to make our lives miserable

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This isn't this has been going on for six years. Remember judge all sup who taught himself Java  He ruled in 2012 that API's are not copyrightable  And I think that's the correct ruling because to do so would basically  tie up I  Mean I kind of I do understand Oracle's point of view, but but but but we need to have open API's  We just really do and to say you can copyright it is not you can block somebody from using Java  But you can't block how you interact with a Java like program

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's inappropriate seems like Oracle's the wrong kind of company to be in control of all that. Well, that's another issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this is a lot of this has to do with personalities, right? Google's got a lot of money  They made the the circuit court even said Google made 42 billion dollars on Android. They should give some of it to Oracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No  Larry Ellison already owns in a Hawaiian Island. He doesn't need Larry's just fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you want I went I'm gonna pitch my stuff  I wrote a story on this actually two weeks ago not on the lawsuit  But on the role of API's and how they're expanding from pure tech to a business tool  So if you're excited about API's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. So  This is a weird case by the way because it  Changed over time because of various rulings and Oracle trying to find ways to keep it alive. So after I'll sup  Turn it down in 2012  It went back federal district Federal Circuit in the 2014  reversed Al Sop  Alsop found the Java API's are copyrightable, but gave Google an out saying this is EFF a little more accurate giving  The possibility that Google could have a fair use defense, right?  You have a fair use of a copyrighted thing now  That's frankly what all of the subsequent court decisions have been on not whether you could copyright an API that actually was considered  settled  What isn't settled is is there a fair use defense against reusing the API?  Google asked the Supreme Court to review it. The Supreme Court said no  The case went to district court for the fair use defense and in 2016 a jury  Unanimously agreed that Google's use of Java was fair use of the API's was fair use  Oracle appealed again and they appealed this time with that  Washington DC Federal Circuit Court, which has historically been problematic for tech companies. They've really upheld strong  Intellectual property rights and this is what just happened is they said no no you have no fair use defense because you made 42 billion dollars  On the API and you know on that very narrow  Interpretation I think that that's probably the case  How can you say it's fair use if you use it commercially and you made 42 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They didn't make that much money on the API they I mean how much money did they make on the API itself that have to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Calculated on the other hand would Android have been successful as successful if you couldn't use Java to develop for it and use the Java  You could actually have your own API that wouldn't have been a hard thing to do Google and hindsight probably should have done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they wish they did now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  8.8 billion dollars is a significant portion of their other island. That's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Congratulations, Larry all that money they spend developing wave. They could have been doing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Rebuilding Java API's I don't think there is any more to this case  I think it's that's that but I but we'd need a lawyer to tell us because  One would have thought it was that was that after the Supreme Court said no, we're not gonna review it. But that it's  Oracle kept it alive somehow people should pay in Bitcoin  Just a thought so yeah, if you take the personalities out  It's an interesting case. Actually, you know what Friday this week in law tune in I'm sure Denise Howell and company will  Discuss it because it it isn't really about API's even though we I feel like API's should not be copper  Writeable that is already decided. It's whether Google had a fair use defense on their use of it weird  Weird so  Yesterday we got up early to watch Apple's classroom event  Every once in a while Apple does one of these in my opinion you you guys can say I'm wrong  clunkers, yep, where they had an opportunity to  Really do something important instead. They released an updated iPad for the same price that has a pencil support  They made a lot of hay saying how great education is great PR and educators love that  Yeah, but fundamentally I don't think they changed the landscape at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's problematic. One of the problematic things they did was that they they said okay if you're in the education space  You get all this iCloud storage and I think this is problematic because the rest of us are like, wait a minute  What about me? I I spent no I personally me and my family spend  $30,000 a year on Apple stuff and they give us and then and then they spam us  I mean I got I'm talking about my son his wife, you know  And then I'm sorry that I spend and then I'm spanned  Mercilessly to pay for more iCloud storage and I it makes me want to quit Apple  Yeah, I'm so sick of being spam as an example gives classrooms unlimited storage Apple gives them 200 gigabytes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's new. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's like it seems like that's kind of like okay  You see see how easy that was to give people 200 gigabytes of iCloud storage do it for all of us  Regarding the the problem with the thing that bugs me about all of this  Of course Google came out with their with their chrome tablet that the Acer tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just take before the day before three hundred twenty nine dollars strange price exactly the same as the iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  clearly  You know sort of like going after the same thing  Tablet is not ideal for a regular Chromebook is fantastic for education. I think they did it just good

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Stacey does your daughter use Chromebooks or iPads? I forgot so they use actually Macbooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At her school, but they are on Google's education right platform ironically even if you use iPad you can use classroom Google's classroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And there's a really good. There's a really good comparison to Apple and Google  Apple has a new homework or whatever it's called toolkit, but you have to use Apple devices to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think about how?  Disadvantaged that is for anybody who doesn't have the thirty thousand dollars a year to spread an apple price  You can't give that to a kid and be like oh, I'm sorry can you not afford?  You know an iPhone you're on a crappy Android phone well

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sucks to be you  Quick funny story my son  Pointed out when he was in I think was middle school. He said that they have a  brand new Mac and Mac for every student in the school  Wow I'm like how did like what he's like yeah, my friends Gary my friend Gary his dad bought them all  What's what's your Gary's last name wasniac?  He's in Los Gatos

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, so if you don't have to go to school where the wasniacs live exactly  You know I was well. I'll give you an example Lisa was saying this  Yesterday morning before we went to the event she said I'd like to see my wife  I'd like to see Apple put aside some of their vast trove of cash  few hundred million half a billion to  Subsidize schools if you're gonna if you're gonna have this expensive stuff, and you really believe in education

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe some subsidies wouldn't hurt well buy them for the teachers what if they would have Apple bought every single teacher

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and I just paid their taxes like a real company and  Then the local districts could do what they want with it instead of having to buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple products I know it's crazy. It's crazy, but but I by the way real companies don't pay taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I believe real companies should pay taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, you do, but I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I still think that you know I just think that Chromebooks  Chromebooks are just the greatest the whole the whole system

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think if you're completely objective, and you think about what would be best for a classroom a  $200 Chromebook that the IT department loves because they can maintain it. It's  Robust has a full keyboard you can get more expensive Chromebooks that have pens that do much of what the iPad does  You've got the Android store. You've got Chrome OS  You've got lots of curriculum  I feel like on an objective basis a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chromebook just and the kids can go home and log in with any device and get exactly what they were working on when they were  It's cool. If money were unlimited. I would say buy a MacBook that'd be better. I don't think that would be better  Here's here's the thing that nobody talks about except teachers  Because I've interviewed a lot of teachers about about education devices  What nobody talks about is if you have little kids walking around with Apple devices in their backpacks they get mugged  Those things have resale value somebody if somebody finds out that all the kids at the school have an iPad in their backpack with a pencil  Okay, those kids are gonna get mugged and that those devices are gonna get stolen  Right if they're left at school then they go home and they only have Android and Windows  It's they can't do that the stuff that they were working on  The best solution is to have Chromebooks  And if you if the kids if you leave them at the school  It's fine because then they can log in at home if they take them home  That's fine, too, because nobody mugs a kid for a Chromebook  Not a $300 Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My point only I didn't think it was muggers  I was just thinking about how destructive kids are to things

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That too and by the way Apple with all of its ads shows these kids with bare naked iPads  You drop in watermelons and mattresses and yeah  And then the real truth comes out that logitech is offering for schools only an $80 case keyboard case  That is built out of like a brick of solid rubber  And they know that that's a problem. They know that that's a huge problem, but I okay now tell me if this is  Maybe a political pie in the sky, but I feel like education especially public education  Should embrace open technologies not proprietary technologies should not vote with its dollar for  Companies should vote with this dollar towards open well that seems like what public I private schools  Go ahead and buy whatever you want, but public schools should be open this yeah, not too open

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not too open. I mean you don't want kids using Linux for God's sake. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually just a little open get ready for this in the age of Betsy DeVos  I'm kind of surprised to see this the United States Department of Education  Has a page obviously Betsy hasn't found it yet  Hashtag go open where they're saying why use openly licensed educational resources  Oh to increase equity to keep content relevant and high quality to empower teachers to save money. Oh, oh  All of those things  This is very contrary to the current administration which wants you know private school vouchers and really doesn't really support public education  I think directly but at least as little as they can but I do think that that truthfully  Educators want open now admittedly open hasn't always have been the best solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was gonna say open can be a bear to use and you don't really want to think of Moodle  Yeah, you don't want to encumber not kids could probably get there but teachers that their life is really hard I mean  God learning new software is just no fun. I know I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No  I a hundred a hundred percent support that and that because I see Silicon Valley all the time  Come into schools and give them technology say hey enjoy. Thanks. We got the tax break. You got the you know the stuff  We'll see you later  Yeah, and it never gets used because no one knows how to use and that's actually been a big problem with iPads  I look at the LA  Department school department that just suing Apple and Pearson because their iPad experiment there tens of millions of dollars  I've had experiment was a flop  Many jurisdictions made the state of Maine not happy at all  But I agree also open but see this is maybe Google's a good solution because I think Google's solution is basically open

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't so as technologists  We have a very clear idea of what open software is open source software is we know what that is  But but there's it but conceptually having everything beyond the public internet is another kind of open  It's not so true if a school uses a classroom because you can use any hardware with it exactly  And so on a Chromebook that sense you can you know, it's if it's in a browser. Okay, this is this is the whole internet  This is available to everyone  It's like you and the schools can then go ahead and pick and choose educational resources that are that are served through a browser  and those can be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not non proprietary. You just described my children's IT department  Yeah, or the school that's what they do you access all the Google services all the software they use is through the browser and  They've got their sign-ons for various different things. That's actually that becomes the most cumbersome part is  You know figuring out what their  What their password is for various?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well and this is Apple's this is why Apple is appealing  I mean it's appealing to us as end users is appealing to educators too because  It is its closed nature means it's easier  So one of the things Apple's gonna offer is an IT they have you know, this new classwork  framework and they have this IT  Support and the IT administrator for instance can issue Apple IDs to everybody in the school instantly and oh my god  They're not real Apple IDs Apple keeps doesn't have any view into that. What's going on with that ID?  So there was good privacy. They can be later converted to Apple IDs. That's interesting  I wonder why anyone would want to do that, but but so Apple make it is easier. It's it's pretty it's clean  It's easy. And so you can see the same reason consumer you're using an iPad the same reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google Docs and stuff are not hard. No effect many schools are using it aren't they the only reason I use a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  MacBook for example is my main  Device is there's a there's like two applications that I need to use  One is a sound editing app and the other one's like, I don't know something else  But it's like I would be on a Chromebook in a second and because it's easier  It's it's not only easier in terms of how hard it is figure out  You have to remember that when you use a tablet that's you know, like a like an iPad  You every app has a different way to use it and different security things  It has to be and then you need like a pretty robust tech support department in the in the school  School district or the school to sort of manage that whereas if people are using everything through a browser  You pretty much don't even need it  IT support you don't need to issue IDs. You don't need to do any of that stuff  The teachers can personally manage what we say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Doesn't your daughter have a Google ID that the school gave her I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, she has a Google ID that the school gave her and she also has her own email address  But she and her classmates and I can't actually email her right on her school ID which drives everyone nuts because well  But that's how they keep it. But that's I get it. I get it  So but she and her friends chat on it and it's all lovely. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mean I understand and the school administrator is gonna be swayed by Apple's promise of privacy  And they're gonna say well, hey after Facebook, we don't is just as private. They do not take no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not thinking they have a document that describes all of this. Yeah. Okay. I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  cuz so  Megan Maroney was telling me that she had said something  Disparaging about Google privacy or there remember there was a kind of a fear about Google and I think Google responded to that a  Year or so ago, but she had somebody from Google Education called her and said no, let me tell you it's completely  We are we make sure the kids privacy. We don't want the kids information  We make sure it's safe and I believe that I trust that if face by the way Facebook if they offered an education initiative  I think I might stay away. Yeah, but no messenger for kids for you  You know what Facebook by the way was gonna do I didn't know this a voice assistant  Right, they canceled it or at least they delayed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they deferred it and then the information talked about how they're gonna do the on-device process or the processing on the device as opposed to  In the sir in the cloud so in their servers  So I thought that was kind of an interesting twist

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And it have a lot more horsepower than the echo and the Google home and all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends on how I mean, I think the Google home it or sorry not the good the echo has a decent arm

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is it a yeah, but it doesn't do anything locally does it it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Doesn't it could though like the hardware the hardware is built into a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I think the thing they're talking about is that the voice processing is done locally and that voice yes, and that's you know  Well, nobody's gonna trust Facebook. I mean regardless of what the facts are in the device  They have worked hard to earn our distrust. Yes  And so on their best it's it's hard enough to get an Amazon device into our homes  Google and Apple devices as he goes down easier, I think  But man face a piece of hardware. I don't think I saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg on the BBC  A few years ago make it let me play this this clip

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Mark Zuckerberg and the BBC who is going to own the Facebook content the person who puts it there  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This media cannot be played. I'm having my usual problem with Twitter video. Here we go  Let's do that again, but content a person who puts it there or you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The person who's putting the content on Facebook always owns the information and that's why this is such an important thing and and why?  Facebook is such a special service that people feel a lot of ownership over right? This is their information  They own it and they often want to know of course not. I mean they they want to share it with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With only a few people just to be clear you're not going to sell or share any of the information on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say what the terms say is just we're not gonna share people's information  Except for with the people that they've asked for it to be shared

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, that was from 2009  Has a young young sweaty mark still sweaty but very young. Yeah, was he lying there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or did they change? Here's the lie  I'm sorry. Here's the lie. The lie is  The the idea that users are aware of what they are giving permission for so Facebook is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  technically saying the truth because sure because they have to give permission the whole business model of many companies especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Companies like Facebook is user ignorance. That's the business model  They take advantage of users who don't know what's happening because if they didn't know and they were given a clear permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They would not approve it. So Stacy's it mark that's naive or the users

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Know that that is a very good point. I also think mark has consistently because he was so young  He was very naive with this idea that we remember him when he was like who will want privacy?  No one will want privacy anymore. I mean he's better when we're connected  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was in college. He said, you know users are idiots because they trust me, right? Well in that's right  I thought that was that him or was that the social network? No that that was real. I can no longer distinguish

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg saying creepy awful things or the social network saying them. Yeah, it's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but if there's a there's a larger issue  I mean the the whole EULA thing of almost every product they know that nobody's gonna read that stuff  They know that nobody knows what's in it  You know people would be outraged if they understood that that you're when you agree to all the stuff you agree to when you buy  A smartphone you're agreeing to the notion that you don't own that smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right well in some of this has changed over time which is worth noting because I  Look at the privacy erosion in like some of my connected devices and I'm like, oh you punks  You just took this away from me and I've got this thing installed in my house and it's frustrating  so I think that's also what happened with Facebook because they remember there are two steps forward and  eroding privacy and then the apology step backwards and then you know two steps forward again and so this is  You know at the time maybe he was telling the truth. I don't remember  I've been through so many Zuckerberg privacy scandals

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to remember Silicon Valley companies often have a cult like  Culture and Facebook is especially bad in that sense when as a journalist when you go to Facebook and you confront them with  With you know pointed questions about what they're doing  They have this  Glaze look in their eyes like we're just making the world a better place because we're not everybody and that just makes everything wonderful  I don't know why you would think that there's an affair. No, no  Facebook exists to make billions and billions of dollars out of giving  Advertisers stuff that users don't want to give up necessarily and that's the business  And it's just like the business of Congress is for the most part in the conflict between the public and the you know  the the powers that be including the massive corporations they're in the business of of  giving the corporations taking stuff away from people and giving to corporations  All the while making people think that they're getting what you know, they're being served  That's the whole business. And so if you if you have a super cynical view like that, you can understand Facebook a lot better  They're not trying to make the world a better place  They're trying to be the world's most rich and powerful company and they're on their way. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  if you if you are  still of  two minds out there whether mark is  Just innocent or  From day one planned this a  Few years ago after the Winklevoss lawsuit during the Winklevoss lawsuit a hard drive  Mark's hard drive from Harvard was recovered and the judge decided he did not want to see it  But then Business Insider  This is in 2010 very very only a year after that interview on the BBC  Had sources who say they had the contents of that hard drive and they published the New Yorker later confirmed it  They say and published it themselves with it a few interesting instant messaging  Conversations that's where they trust me. That's where he said they tried  That's what I did is I was trying to find the source of this. Yeah  And by the way, one of the things he admits to in this exchange is that yeah  He did screw the Winklevoss twins  He says unless I F the dating site people over and quit on them right before I told them I have done it  He says I don't think people would sign up for the Facebook thing if they knew it was for dating  I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too, but the guy doing the dating thing the Winklevoss is is gonna promote it  Pretty well. I wonder what the ideal solution is and he goes on and on  This is this is kind of a smoking gun  but he also is very clear that this guy is  pretty  cynical  and and what cynical people do when

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When necessary in order to make lots of money and have an IPO and do all the things that  CEOs of big tech companies do is they have to they have to represent themselves as having a kind of Disneyland view of the world  Where everything's great? It's utopian. We're trying our best. We're doing this that the other thing  I actually don't think that Mark Zuckerberg is immoral or unethical. I think he's a moral and a ethical

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a word. Well, I also I want to say he's not alone  We talked about surveillance capitalism and Shoshana Zuboff last week  It's pretty clear that Facebook is the poster boy for this but we'll get a lot of companies are engaged

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but you recognize a pattern with Facebook where they they they  Again and again and again, I'm not talking about dozens of times but hundreds of times over the years  They push the envelope beyond where it should go  If they if there's no big public outcry they keep going if there is they have this whole process where they say  you know, they sort of  Apologize and they sort of go through the motions to do a fix whatever will it's they I've heard somebody and I  Apologize to whoever said this because it was some brilliant tech journalists. I think who said this might have been Stacy for I know  Basically said they treat ethical issues like a programming problem, right? Right. So they so does Silicon Valley  Yeah  Less so than faith. I think Facebook is really the poster child  There's something about Facebook's culture where they really really try all these things and  You know and and if you look at their research there doesn't seem to be anybody saying wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We probably shouldn't do that. That would be unethical, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  just have a clue about what is the right thing to do and wrong thing to do that that's just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know a bizarre question that adults a lack of adult supervision Stacy should search  Cheryl Sandberg or somebody like that be saying boys

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not enough so much sexism in that whole construction there a  Girls can be immoral be Cheryl may still have the same a moral issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I was given a credit. I know but that you're is that's why you call it a bro culture, right? It's a bro culture  It's a it's a bunch of guys  Yeah, but I have met very much a gal could be a gal culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There could be there could be ladies who are also unethical

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Defending women. I'm sorry. I besmirched them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We could be jerks too and make money lots of money. I  Do think that I mean you see it in their culture and you see it in there the people they hire tend to be very  technologically astute and so they're just not thinking about these things and  That's that's what happens when you don't have normal people to say hey guys or if we do this  What about that and they'll be like what?  and you see it just in the like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In this idea of yeah, look at knowing everybody with the with the filth the racist filters and things like that  It's just you really wonder is there is there I honestly see it feel like it's like there's no adult supervision

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not female but it's not just adult super  I mean like adults have the same it is a lack of diversity and people hammer this home  And it's not I was trying to say in my imperfect fashion not yeah, but not color not necessarily gender

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But just in terms of life experience with real experience. Yeah. Well, I think I think the lack of diversity is in ageism  I mean if you have some people who've been around for a few decades

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there's a there's a ton of lack of diversity in Silicon Valley

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I know there is and I tend to disagree with the reason for more diversity if I can just have this quick aside because  I hear it talked a lot about on on a lot of shows  And people always often say the reason we more need more diversity is that the customers are diverse and so in order to understand  Minorities and women and stuff we need minorities and women making decisions so that they know that's not the reason that's not the reason  The reason is is that there are geniuses and brilliant people in all these groups?  In fact, if you look at a super non diverse exclusionary society like Saudi Arabia  They're not very successful at things. The reason is that they exclude almost everybody in the country. They're good at oil  They're good. They're good. They're good at finding the oil that is under their feet  But but but but and the reason likes a country like the United States is is more successful is because we're more diverse  And if we were much more diverse, we would be much more successful because you don't know where the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Grace Hopper is you don't know where the next would you rather have a stew made with just potatoes or a stew with some beef some  Carrots some potatoes a little bit of marjoram some celery I could go on but I probably should stop panda meat  But no, that makes sense anyway, I agree that the more diverse the recipe the better the flavor

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But but but I do really I think that there is a toxic element about a morality in Silicon Valley  But I do think that there's something about the person of Mark Zuckerberg who just sees it as an abstract and largely  Business related problem. He hired a lot of people around him that matched his we drove the culture. Yeah, so  But that's just a guess on my part. I have no firsthand  Knowledge of that I just you know, you I think that there's a place for ethics  I'm gonna the chat room said that the business is a moral. I don't think that's true. Normally when Jeff's here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey and I pile on him, but he can defend himself  But now it no Jeff were just all all just going after  Did I tell you I just learned this I didn't tell the folks at home Mike has registered for on Jeff's behalf  panic calm special domain

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's right. I know he's gonna write that book one of these days and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Good I'm just hoping to get a free copy. We miss we miss you Jeff and I'll I know I'll take it on myself to defend  Whatever it is Jeff defense  Google who knows what?  Now I don't yeah, I have a hard time defending Facebook. I have to say, you know, Steve Gibson insulted me mightily yesterday  He said finally Leo you're finally coming around to the privacy point of view  You know, I've been saying this for years and you've been always mr. Open sure everything  I'm still kind of that way. But if somebody is maliciously seemingly maliciously taking advantage of you  You probably don't want to be in that environment

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I get the feeling as a as a longtime listener that you're you're not you're not as he described you you're a  Conversation maker so you play devil's advocacy and you bring in a lot of other things and stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But I do share pretty broadly  Maybe way too broadly  But that's also a hazard  That comes of being on the air for you know constantly. Yeah, it's a hazard, but it's also a privilege to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  say  Like I don't share my life nearly as wildly because I am a woman and a woman and a mom and I'm like, yeah  You know what? Lots of and also because frankly, I'm very dull very dull. We have I mean, there's there's reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  we have an armed guard at the front door there as  Admittedly I don't run the same hazards you do but it isn't completely answered free  Well, yes, there are there so  but I have to say I feel and maybe this is a  pathology  but I do feel better when I am more honest about myself one of the things I learned really early on in broadcasting is  authenticity wins and honesty wins and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I've always kind of tried to do you don't conflate being honest with being private or being or being private with being dishonest

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I mean the way I open yeah open I think that I think well the authenticity thing  I think the first public figure who was honest and open in a way that was like clearly  Demonstrable was Howard Stern  Yeah  And and that was huge for him huge for him and that was the whole  Point of his show or he said things that people think but didn't say and nobody else on radio was saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think people misunderstood him and thought he was a shock jock by the way, Jeff Jarvis loves Howard's right  Yeah, thought he was a shock jock  It wasn't it was shocking but that was but the appeal of it was that it was honest, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this why I think the podcasting is a far superior medium  I think that as we with every new medium that comes out the the currency is authenticity  This is why I don't like these inauthentic and PR style podcasts as much as I like the real part

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you know, you and I are alone by the way in this yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean one of the biggest one of the most one of the biggest podcasts out there is Joe Rogan now  I got is authentic this super authentic. That's wrong  One of the things I don't like about Joe Rogan is that they are almost always have no idea what they're talking about  But they're hilarious it's entertaining and and they're very authentic they they they they blurt stuff. Oh my god. It's like Donald Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's entertaining and he doesn't know he's talking about there's a thread here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if you want to pull it the sweater might evaporate  But I think that that's exactly right and I do think that's a good, you know  if you ask people who support Trump that is I just read an interview with Roseanne Barr because  Her show is back. Yeah, I heard that Roseanne's back. I want to watch it  I like Roseanne Barr, but she's a Trump supporter and and the New York Times was very affronted that she was a Trump  Order and kept hammering her on it. Yeah, and but but every time I talk to Trump supporters, and I know quite a few  We have a lot of family members. That's what they come back to he's honest. I you know what you're getting  Yeah, he maybe he's got flaws  He's a flawed human but but he's authentic in a way that politicians have never been but he

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Points out the difference between authenticity and truthfulness. He's very dishonest, but he's very authentic  Like he's authentically dishonest. Hmm. That's an interesting one. It's like magically delicious  But it's the political version of that. It's very refreshing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He is kind of like Joe Rogan though, isn't he?  That's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he's a trial balloon pilot he throw he says stuff as fact just to see what happens or see, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  when you you know when you're I I have some sympathy because when you're  Constantly have to on the air and have to talk and say things you have to eventually  You hit the end of things you kind of reasonably thought about and have a reasoned opinion about and pretty soon  You have to just say stuff off the top of your head. You've noticed that Stacey. I have I you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do it I do it when I write things sometimes I'm like, hey, I've been thinking about this  But then I research a bunch of stuff and then I'm like tell me more guys. That's the discipline of writing that  That's true. It's very different. Like I I noticed that when I don't write about the things that I'm talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's much worse. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's true for me, too  Which is why I hate writing so much. Oh  It's so hard. It's hard work. It's so much easier just to blather

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But then you know what you're actually talking about. It's so exciting. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Find writing much easier than podcast podcasting is really hard. It just I am a good blatherer  You can blather with you've got the gift of gab

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did I tell you I've kicked I've kissed the Blarney stone I have I have  Google to exp this is interesting again. This is a little bit before Apple's announcement  They announced that they were going to expand Google's classroom software, which to everybody  I've talked to so far is widely agreed to be very good. Mm-hmm to outside the classroom  They're gonna make it available as part of the G suite  Now I haven't used classroom Stacey. Have you used it in conjunction with your daughter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, what is classroom exactly? Maybe you have I never know if I  Megan's daughter sons use it. Oh, no, we use a different we use this crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Blackboard there's Moodle, which is the original open source join our class  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's that's that's an analog to classroom  Okay, so it's a cloud based software that lets teachers create classes make assignments communicate with students collaborate with students  It's on the Google Cloud. It uses G  You know the G Docs the document suite and Gmail and calendar it's obviously  You know, oh no, she does have that. Yes. Okay. Sorry. Yes. Yeah, I'm now recalling  I'm not that involved as a parent. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would be very interested in using this this this would be their

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  alternative to  Solutions from Facebook Facebook work, right? Yeah, I wonder if anybody's using Facebook work  You can just use it as a tool  Work right? Yeah, I wonder if anybody's using Facebook work you could use it to give your staff homework assignments

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that'd be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Work day, which is my my employer. I have a job too, you know premier uses workday  Which I and I really don't like it at all. Yeah  Amazon web services. I mean there's other solutions. So that'd be interesting to see Google  Expanding that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just worry that they they see that as a  Bucket that they just throw everything into that's Google right there in that show

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Specialized on that stuff pixel is in our chat room and he works for a  company that does a  solution called canvas  LMS I guess is the category learning management management  Yeah  And he says now there's an open standard which canvas adheres to which is interesting. Hmm, so  Ixl I'm glad you're in the in the chat room today. We should  We should get you on to talk about this. Are you a developer for canvas or what do you do for Ixl?  Ixl  And is this and is this your picture?  Are you a real person? Yes, he's the he's the one with blue eyes. Oh, they all have  Creepy  They're all blonde hmm except for the bald guy that looks like a witty harrelson the bald guy  Woody harrelson works for canvas. Yeah, he's the community specialist which means Ixl you would be a good authority for us because you deal with  educators  He says this is the number two. What's number one blackboard? I'm aware of blackboard. I've seen a lot of these actually

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Enough education. That's because schools have a lot of money to spend even though you don't think about it and in aggregate sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's what I'm yeah  Yeah  Yeah, individually not so much $15 a student a day. Yeah, it starts to add up after a while. Yeah  Google is now  taking steps against a  Vast number of Android devices that don't use Google services  This is from XDA developers  Unlicensed devices you you can get a you're not even allowed to call it Android if the Amazon's stuff is Android  But you can't call it Android, but many apparently in especially the developing world many phones come with  Android not called Android on and then you download a side load of Google services  Which puts the Play Store on there and then suddenly you have something you really want  Google's now starting to say  Device not certified by Google and we're not gonna users who purchase the device device manager has pre-loaded Google apps and services  without certification for Google  Contact the manufacturer and ask for a certified device  And if you're an unlicensed manufacturer, you need a license to distribute Google apps and services

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I understand that there are approximately 1,000 companies that make smartphones and almost all of them are in China  And so this is this is a this is an issue for China almost exclusively and Google doesn't do business in China, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Didn't they pull out? I think they pulled back in slightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a it's a mixed bag. I think I I'm not really sure what their stuff. That's a good question  I should look into that what's happening with Google. We're on a Mario at ours

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Technica says we once imported a Xiaomi redmi 3 smartphone from China to review on booting up  We were surprised to find him it came with the Google Apps pre and service  Surprised to find him it came with the Google Apps pre installed because Google does not install Google Apps on Chinese devices  After we posted the review Xiaomi contacted us with some very scary news  The redmi 3 should not come with Google Play pre-installed because it is a China only product  It's very likely the Play Store you saw was pre installed by the importer or seller  Wow, this is a common practice with unauthorized importers. So  Another thing to be aware of and this would actually impact you if you got one of these phones  You thought you were using Android and suddenly you got that announcement you couldn't use the preloaded stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think this is the the the constituency here is the authorized  Phone makers right as they they pay money. They're sick and tired of having to compete with

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and there's also a security component to this right? Oh, yeah, so that's it's not like this is just pay me more money  This is also like if your users think you're getting real Android and you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Then yeah, what are they getting what they get there where to come from and what is it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah. I just wanted to give the motivation here behind all this because you know  It's the why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In the five W's let's take a little break Jeff Jarvis not with us, but we are doing our best to defend

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Us against techno panic. We are not doing our best  We've got the techno cynic over here and then I'm like, oh maybe it's not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's Stacy  Dot-com don't forget to subscribe to the newsletter to at gigastacey on Twitter Mike Elgin is El Mike Elgin on on the Twitter Elgin  Dot-com and don't forget gastronomad net and there's still room for two. It's a couple in Provence in Provence a couple  Yeah, it's a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll send you a bottle of wine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or a barrel well we like we like kind of the more northern like  Drones and the Bordeaux's and the burgundy. Yeah, I can't remember what I was drinking in Provence

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is this is a long time. Well, you know, it's the funny thing is this is why we cherry pick because there are  so they're the radically traditional ones and then the the the sort of like the  Here's to the crazy ones type type of wine. That's the stuff Van Gogh drank right exactly. Yes  Exactly. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I did I we insisted when we were in  Arl I guess it was  The cafe that he painted the night cafe is still there and they painted a bright yellow to look like the night cafe  But it's still there and our guide said  You can go there. Don't eat. Yeah  So we went we had a cup of coffee there because I wanted to sit at the night cafe where Vincent van Gogh painted and sat  many times and then we went to the  Asylum a little farther north where he was he was incarcerated and later died and yeah, it was very moving  Yeah, it was I'm a huge fan of his work

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm really interested in following genius beyond understanding one of the things that I get a kick-house when we go to Paris  It's like oh Hemingway used to drink here with his buddies and all this stuff and I'm like, you know what now  It's a tourist trap because gastronomic experiences  We you will live like Hemingway for a week  Right, you won't go to the place where you know that and elbow your way through all the tourists where he once was there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I still do that. Like when we were in Venice, I went to the Hotel Cipriani and I had to have a  Hemingway daiquiri, I mean you just you kind of have to do that. I'm a huge movable feast. Yeah fan  Hey when you move, I know you take a ring doorbell with you. You might want to take this with you  This is our newest sponsor. It's called lighthouse and this is the camera for inside the house  now I know that a lot of people and I'll include my wife in this do not like the idea of a camera monitoring them and  While they're walking around in the house and that's one of the reasons we love the lighthouse  She loves the lighthouse in our house because it's smart  Not just a camera. It's got a 3d sensor. It's with it uses time-of-flight LIDAR  To actually map the indoors where you are  It sees the difference between people and pets inanimate objects. It does face recognition  It's the only camera that understands that life is more than just a bunch of motion alerts  So you wouldn't I mean really truthfully we actually had a camera and I took it out  Partly because Lisa said I don't want it on she could see the blinking light  But also because I was getting alerts I mentioned this before  My we had some a birthday party and we have to mile our balloons left over and it kept thinking there were people in  The house. It was just dumb mile our balloons lighthouse is not fooled by mile our balloons or anything else and  When we get home we've set it up and it's very smart this way when it sees Lisa or me come home  It turns off the camera. So our privacy is  respected you control the camera turn it on and off whenever you want or it'll turn itself off because it has AI and  Strong encryption for all your data, of course  Here's the cool thing. There's no other camera like the lighthouse. It can say I know you I know you I know you but when  I see this person in your house, I'm gonna let you know and you set this all up  It will then send you an image with the person outlined. It knows pets and it has an AI query language  It's very powerful show me when the kids got home after three o'clock and it knows  You can weigh the kids can wave at it  See this they can they can wave at it and the lighthouse will  Ping me and we can have a conversation because lighthouse not only has the cameras it has a speaker  It has a microphone in it so we can talk to one another  So even if you know you have a younger child that wants to say hi to mommy or daddy  They can do that you can say if you don't see the kids by 5 p.m. On weekdays  Let me know if you do see the kids home before school  Let me know if you see the dog by itself in the living room. Let me know if you don't see the dog  After 3 p.m. Let me know on and on and on this is incredibly sophisticated  Lighthouse uses AI to notify you only when something important happens and you get to say what's important and what's not important  No more false alerts because of shadows or pets or mylar balloons  Go to light house to learn more and if you use the promo code tweet  You'll get 15% off your lighthouse camera and early customers get 90 days of AI service at no cost  This was for a long time a very limited  Edition we had some just for our viewers now it is available for sale 299 for the camera we have several and  Just $10 a month for the AI service that powers lighthouse  And as I said 15% off if you go to light house right now and use the offer code tweet 15% off plus  Early customers and you'd be an early customer get 90 days of AI service at no cost a very mature product  By the way, we got it before it was even out and it was in pre-production and it was an I blew my mind  One of the scientists used was a winner of the DARPA Grand Challenge, you know  That's where they had the cars that drove themselves across the country and stuff like that very smart AI guys  Light house you were Stacy was the one who told me to get this actually now that I remember it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One of those for for my travels because I mean we're living in somebody else's house  Yeah, and who knows who's actually these and that's a great, you know, I mean, it's like I totally need one of those  It's fantastic. I love it. I'd give you this one, but  I  Would tell it to track I want to keep track of all the balloons  Mylar not mylar  Tell me I'm afraid to come over to your house cuz your camera would your old camera would think I was some gas bag like

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was a mylar balloon and you can actually say if a pet enters the house. It's not one of ours

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, so so if a raccoon comes in through the doggie door bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which does actually does have we we used it because we have a cat that's gone feral. I mentioned this before  Hamilton which is interesting because in the play Hamilton  They talk about George Washington's wife having a feral cat named Hamilton  We shouldn't have named our cat Hamilton because he went wild made him feral. He said that name it's humiliating  I'm out of here and we thought well  We were very worried because we hadn't seen him in a week and then Lisa looked at the looked at the tape  And he comes in right after we leave for work. Wow eats he naps. He likes the house  He just doesn't like you  I'm believe and then he leaves before we get home and we have timestamps I can it's like dude you're busted  He doesn't understand it. I see that  That's hilarious. Google has changed its search to  favor mobile indexing  This is really kind of a measure of how the world has changed. Yep  The company for a long time did only desktop  Sites. Yep. They started experimenting November  2016 with even having an index at all of mobile  and now  mobile first

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, this is this is very much the trend  I wrote a column I think like a year ago or something like that talking about the desktop  Gettin because with each passing month desktop getting the desktop web  Gets worse or gets worse in comparison to the mobile web  There are lots of apps that ship where they don't even bother to do a desktop version  There are lots of things that you can do in mobile that you can't do on the desktop and I think on on the  Whole the balance of power including am for example  The the mobile web is clearly better than the desktop web now and this just even more of a phenomenon

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the app experience. I was gonna say like most of my devices come with  None of them can run on a browser. They're they're all they're all at face

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that interesting all the IOT stuff isn't it? You're right. They're very few

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean there are a couple they don't even bother  They don't yeah, there's nothing there for them. I never thought that makes sense because you're you're by a device  You're like setting something up, you know  You're gonna be on your phone and just deal with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there are a lot of services that do have a website and they do have mobile apps and they roll out new features  But this is only for the mobile apps the desktop version doesn't have the feature lots and lots of examples of that  So it's a mobile first world and I'm just looking forward to the day when when  Apples laptops are Iowa run iOS and all the all the so-called desktop stuff runs mobile operating systems  That'll be a good day now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey is it an example of the bro culture or is it example of the Austin culture that Google's research team calls their speech  systems the Taco Tron

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm gonna go with Austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, you were the one who told me about breakfast tacos  The taco Tron is apparently this is a blog post from yesterday  from Google's research team about more  Natural voices they've been working on this for a while, right? This is really interesting and scary. Yeah, you want to hear some  Yeah, I think it's great. I don't think it's scary  This so I remember in the early days of speech sympathies you're old enough to remember this to you would if you wrote  Because it was I mean we've had speech synthesis for decades years a long time you you could write  When you wrote the text you could write in pauses you could write in inflections  You would actually when you were writing speech tell it how to say it  It still sounded crappy and like a robot  But at least it would go it would go up at the end of questions and it would pause with commas and stuff  So the idea is they now want to do this  Independent of phonetic information and idiosyncratic speaker traits  They stress intonation and timing and they're doing this with an inference engine  so it isn't  The way it's written they're actually  Well, it's not understanding but they're getting a lot closer to understanding what they're saying. So here is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it understands how most people say those phrases together most of the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but but not based on the question mark or the commas but really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so based on what words appear next to each other. Here's an Australian version. Is that Utah travel agency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so there's a difference between is  That Utah travel agency or is that I mean I you know, we understand that that's that Utah travel agency  That that's that sounds that Utah travel agency that's without prosody which is what they're calling this  That's how right now the Google Home would say it  Is that Utah travel agency and you had that experience where it's just a little clunky  Maybe you don't even know why when Google Home says that this is with prosody is that Utah travel agency? I  Don't know. I'm not sure what that's supposed to be. Is that Utah travel agency?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just put nonsense words in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's try this one here is without prosody or prosody for the last time in his life  He had been handily embarrassed. That sounds pretty good. Let's see if they do some

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prosody for the last time in his life. He had been handily embarrassed. Wow. It doesn't sound particularly American. That's a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Holy cow, let me play better  Let me so this is the without for the last time in his life  He had been handily embarrassed by the way, the voice is very good. Yeah  But it's a little weird because it's the it's too consistent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mono for the last time in his life. He had been handily embarrassed. That sounds like a human. That's fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an audible book reader. Yeah, that sounds like a human doing like a seventh grade play  Okay, it's not perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's your best dramatic friend right there. That's like yeah, it sounds like a British actor trying to do the last time in his life

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I say this is scary because the more naturalistic fake things we have out there the harder it gets to tell  real  From manufactured and so that's that's I think this is cool. Do not get me wrong, but  It's gonna be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah to have better voices in our lives and stuff like that  But I actually think I've been thinking a lot about this lately  I think we need to start thinking about how we teach children to interact with machines  There's a there's a turtle robot that came out and its sole function  I'll come up with the the name of it in a sec, but its sole function is to teach kids how to be nice to robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So basically it's this robot and no kids should not be nice to robots. Well, they're robots  They should be nice to should they be nice to toasters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They should be nice to robots  But not because the robots have their feelings hurt because this is what it teaches it the road  The turtle gets upset and it withdraws into its shell if you mean to it if you're nice to it it no  It's a machine. Why it's somebody's property. That's why you shouldn't Oh Lord. This is a slippery  Yeah, so I think I think we need this we need we should teach kids to not  think that because something talks really well, it's got a  Human mind in it. Yeah, that's gonna be hard to do because we're hardwired

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. I was about to say that is like what we do as people. Yes, it is. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's see prosody transfer from unseen speakers onto a single speaker  Model this is from the paper itself  Audio samples from towards end to end prosody transfer for expressive speech synthesis with taco Tron  That's a great the page contains a  Set of audio samples and supported the conclusions in our paper  We suggest that the reader listen to the samples in conjunction with reading the paper, okay  So I'm not gonna read the papers. So sorry all utterances were unseen in training  So oh  This is a complicated thing. The idea is that you could record  Uninflected real human speech not synthesis  Uninflected and that the prosody train I think I'm gathering the prosody training would then deflect it appropriately  Does that make sense what I think this is all text to speech so it's it's it's not  Because it says this is a promising result as it paves the way for voice interaction designers to use their own voice to customize speech  Since this is oh, I misunderstood so you would train it with the prosody information, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would use AI to say okay. This is how they talk. So here we go. Here's another one. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  with  Ref without prosody and so first of all, this is a normal human  giving the prosody reference to the AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Swallowed a polywag. That's a real person. It says unseen American speaker. That is not an American accent

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, what is happening? Okay, she's following the potty wogs. Did you hear? Okay, that's a real human  This is the speech synthesis without any reference. I've swallowed a polywag  It's not bad  But it's not as good as this. I've swallowed a polywag. That's amazing. That's pretty good. Yeah, it's not as good as the human

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've swallowed a polywag. I  Think it must have been trying to the American must have been trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  British who says I've swallowed a polywag anyway, the last two were labeled as British  Yeah, I think that's an error that's just an error in the in the text, okay  So here's the text that they have to synthesize  United Airlines five six three from Los Angeles to New Orleans has landed the robot will read that but they're going to now  They're going to add inference time select or modify the combination weights for the tokens allowing us to force  Tacotron to use a specific speaking style without needing training from a human

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, that's let's try. Let's try a few of these United Airlines five six three from Los Angeles to New Orleans

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Has landed she sounds a little put out. Yeah United Airlines five six three from Los  Angeles to New Orleans has landed. I like that. There's a lot of mystery

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just want to point out that they're applying something like, you know weird or angry or lively to this and that's the interpretation  This is all generated by a computer without a human reference at all. That last one was the Agatha Christie felt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, United Airlines five six three from Los Angeles to New Orleans has landed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, this is fun, I don't know about you United Airlines five six

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  three from Los Angeles to New Orleans has landed I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't want to hear that coming through the airport speaker. That's just you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Has the same gravelly voice the whole time which is really interesting did they just like that must be part of the programming, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is not the prosody part. This is the voice  So they know yeah, talk of trunks got a gravelly voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, talk of trunks a smoker heavy smoker United Airlines five six three from Los Angeles to New Orleans  has landed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Queen is apparently manning the speaker system. How does this work?  Okay, well I don't know what to make out of this  I just wanted to play a bunch of funny samples it all falls into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  category of pretty soon we won't be able to tell their machines doing it and  The fake news industry is gonna go audio and visit visual just so we are clear here taco Tron

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unrelated taco truck taco Tron is an AI system that uses neural networks trained to mimic human speech  So it is completely computer-generated. I think it is kind of amazing  I do so maybe that's where the gravel comes from Stacy is that you know those weird neural network dream  Images, that's the  equivalent of  Gravel right dream images

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although although are the others maybe or a British accent is the oral equivalent. Yeah, maybe that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz we don't know what they trained it with  So the problem they were trying to solve is that taco Tron sounds human  But the inflection sounded a little mechanical and frankly, I'm with you Stacy  I think there's gonna be a law that says you can't make it too human because that's not good you could impersonate  I mean they could make it sound like me and the thing is  imagine what could happen if they took the taco Tron and  Did the voice and made it sound like my voice train it with I don't know where they get  20,000 samples of my voice but train it with 20,000 samples of my voice and then  Did he get a human to go through my different speech patterns say that's Leo angry. That's Leo lively  That's Leo sad and and then they could apply that to the text. I think they wouldn't need a human

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's unsuper. I mean, isn't it the prosody is well, oh, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we gave you two examples one trained by a human from a human reference and one without reference and the one without reference was the  Polywalk that was the weird kind of weird one  But the one with reference was kind of surprisingly good  I know I think this is fascinating and I think you're right Stacy. It's a little troubling

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has the potential to be troubling hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But think about it remember would do now I don't know how genuine this was but remember it went around last year that there was  that that you would get a call from a  recording voice that the only purpose of the recording was to get you to say yes and  Then they were going to sign you up for long-distance service. Yeah, it was like  Is who's is am I talking to somebody right now and you say yes and they'd and then they'd hang up and they'd record the yes  And then they would yeah, they would sign you up for stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Long-distance company called I don't care right back in the day

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but it who needs that if you've got taco Tron to and prosody right now with prosody. Am I saying that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Could be prosody because it's pros. You went to Harvard. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He says I'm saying it right  That's what Harvard says Harvard. Here's what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prosody

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Prosody prosody  Prosody because it's pros right from pros is the root word  Prosody is the pattern of rhythm and sound used in poetry

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know prosody back in the day  We at every legal every time we talked about legal issues on this show and other shows  We'd talk about the good wife because it was so relevant right now  The the follow-on to that is an even better show called good fight you watch that and the most recent episode had this very  Technology where that a lawyer tried to trick them into doing something by using a faked voice and all this kind of stuff  They are so relevant. It's unbelievable and they're they're dead on to what's happening like, you know, something happens and then two weeks later  They got a show. Yeah deals like it's ripped from that tech  It's and and they're very there's a lot of tech in it too. So it's like it's really fascinating  They have like what is it like? They've got some fake Google company that they've you know  It's really good it's really really good so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's the easiest thing in the world  I mean that we talk about faking photographs, but he faking a voice with this kind of thing would be easy. Yeah  Yeah, so I guess just as we do not trust  Photographs anymore don't trust voice anymore. Yeah, definitely not

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And soon we will not be trusting video

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the hardest one though  Yeah, that's the hardest one though, I mean even if you watch those what were they called the  The pornos with somebody else's face. Oh, right. Yeah the fakes those were I was hard to do and it was hard to do  Well, and they didn't look that real they couldn't even get Superman's mustache removed properly. Exactly  They will get there. They'll get that I was get there. No question. But yes deep fakes. That's what it was fake. Yeah  Because and you had to pick some but you had to match the faces pretty closely it was imperfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but it will become perfect. I mean, there's no doubt this is the thing that you know  When there's specific information about progress in this realm  That's not that doesn't freak me out  More than the certainty that it's only a matter of time before all this stuff is perfected voice video and all will be perfect  It's only a matter of when to adjust. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although think about what that means for biometrics. There's some interesting like what can you do from a voice?  well  Presumably you can it's just how how accurate will it be?  How accurate can you bake these and what are the ways to like I guess hack these neural networks?  So like if you replace, you know  a pixel on the face or if you use different if you're using a picture or if you put weird makeup on so  Surveillance can't understand who you are. There are ways to  Go against these systems. It's just we've got to figure with that. What those arms. I was really shocked. I say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  my mom I  Don't know. I guess I should use this  I shouldn't say which I won't say the name because I don't want to give out too much information about my mom  but uses a online brokerage and  One of the ways of authenticating was your voice and I told her don't do that  Yes, that just does not seem like a good idea  Not that I could sound like my mom, but it just it feels like that's not a secure. I know even now  I don't think that's a very secure thing to do  Facebook is being investigated by the FTC. There was some question about  Facebook had had a consent decree right in 2011  With the FTC and there was some question whether this Cambridge Analytica data release  violated that consent decree  FTC has now  Hasn't said whether it's well, let me see they hadn't said but now it's  Confirmed on Monday that the FTC is investigating Facebook's data practices and  Even though they did they wouldn't confirm it last week. They have now confirmed it and  By the way, it's private. It's a private non-public investigation  The penalty of the consent decree is forty thousand dollars per violation  Which means per user fifty million times forty thousand dollars is how much I?  Can't even go that high  That's a lot. That's a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's not gonna happen. So here's it. Here's it dark  It's like a pedibillion  What is it? It's a big number

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're gonna have to take a chat room fifty million dollars per  You're gonna have to take a chat room fifty million times forty thousand dollars. What is that? How much money?  Yeah, that can you take a check the chat room stopped because everybody's like working

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But here's here's a question for you that that makes me really nervous our  Congressional investigators going to be pulling their punches. This is a quote non-public  Investigation already. They're they're going soft on Facebook before they even begun they're making it non-public  Are they gonna go soft on them because they know that Facebook can just with a little bit of lines of code make sure  They never get elected

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have that power huge power huge power and conversely with a little bit of lines of code maybe make Zuck the president

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Although he why would he why would he want less power than he has now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What this on House of Cards many years ago? Yeah, is that a plot subplot? It feels like it. Yeah to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  trillion dollars  To that's that's not you could fund two wars in Iraq for that. That's right. That's right to  trillion dollars  That'd really help go a long way towards settling the deficit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have the feeling that they're gonna get a slap on the wrist and it'll be business as you can be a two-trillion dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Fine. I know I can assure you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe we could get so maybe we'll get something like GDP are here in that because Facebook's gonna  Because a lot of tech companies already have to  Work towards those goals anyway and build those systems  Maybe we'll see them acquiesce to something like that here in the US. They might lead the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Testify April 12th, by the way, that's my birthday. Happy birthday  It's your birthday gift from Facebook Mark Zuckerberg find out exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What they're doing so we're just watching get yelled at so here's what's happening in Menlo Park

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're coaching Zuck on how to seem like like a normal human because his inclination would be to answer everything just like you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's like data from Star Trek and it worked with the Tacotron to mark. You should try prosody

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're coaching him on how with prosody express feelings and and all that. I am sorry  Some of this is gonna be great for the screen are you yawning my great humor and made you yawn no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does the yawn help

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just sort of actually I get you a cup of Botox  I was I was gonna get a cup of coffee in a minute  But I did find out that I have a package downstairs. So their next ad read I am gonna show you the Ness doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here is the here is the working work in progress. We go see this see what I'm saying the more of your data  I gather the more I understand what it means to be human says mark  I'm sorry, we shouldn't pile on mark because frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody's doing it. Everybody's doing it. He's that is not a good excuse if everyone jumps off a bridge

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, mom, they'll be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and I think his perspective in life has probably changed some over time now that he has a kid right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That he didn't kill you know all those YouTube videos we saw in the World Series  Get ready to get NBA finals same thing  They play buttons on Shaq's butt. I  Don't know Shaq even in it. Does he even play anymore? I don't even know. I'm so I'm already without outdated basketball reference  By the way, if you do feel sympathy for mr. Z you're not alone  Tim Berners-Lee the creator of the World Wide Web  Says I can imagine Mark Zuckerberg is devastated that his creation has been abused and misused

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some he's just sad because the web is the broken. He does because some days I have the same feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not a humble brag it's humble empathy. What is that?  Yeah, I invented something massive that everybody uses and you know, I've lost control of it too mark I know how you feel  Yeah, yeah  That is a humble brag. You're right. You nailed it. It's a humble brag. Oh my god, Tim  I am excited about this. There is a great sci-fi a novel out of China that you  Mr. John Selena got me to read called the three-body problem, right?  Amazon  Is earmarking one billion dollars to make  The three-body problem into a blockbuster sci-fi  Series, it's a trilogy. I've read this too. Yes. Yes. It's a fascinating book  And it will make it'll be better than Game of Thrones  I could see why Amazon wants to put a billion dollars towards this this comes from the financial times  But one billion dollars is not to make it  One billion dollars is to acquire the rights to it  Dear Wow  I'm gonna write me a novel. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm gonna write one called the four-body problem. I should get a billion and a quarter for that. Here is  The other public like it can't pick something else popular how much how much yeah, how much George R. R Martin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Again, that's a lot of Greek fishermen hats. That's yeah, I mean Wow  Here's a picture of the author of the three-body problem  Leo Chi Shin  Soon he'll be next to a robot  I don't know why he chose this is his publicity  Photo, but there is a mechanical man sitting on a toilet next to him. I don't I'm puzzled  I'm sure it means something I didn't finish it. Does is this show up in the book John? No  Just one of the bodies is doing that it you know what if they spent a billion to the rights  They're making this could cost a billion right Stacey. I mean this has  Egypt in it. It has other worlds it has I mean this thing is amazing  There is a lot happening there. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I'm trying to find the rights for other things and I'm not I'm not my googling skills are

Transcript:  Okay, I'll be back. She'll be back ladies and gentlemen  So will we with the thrilling gripping conclusion of this week in Google but first a word from our sponsor  And I love this sponsor, let me tell you a rocket mortgage  Look if you if you are buying a house, you know that most people unlike Zuck are not writing a check for the house  You're gonna be getting the home loan, right?  And I gotta tell you if you've done this before you'll remember it is not a fun process  You got to get all dressed up go to the bank  Say please may I have a large amount of money and the bank they're nice about it  Say well, of course, but first  Here's a 20 page application and we'll be in touch so you fill the thing out you go home  Then they call you or they send you an email or they usually they send a Pony Express  Messenger because it's really stuck in the 18th century here and they say well we need this this and this can you fax it to us?  Okay, let me find a fax machine then let me find the pay stubs for 2012 or the bank statements from 2011 or whatever  It is and it's the dad saw the last time I bought a house. It wasn't even the end of it  We just took two months. This was back in 2011 took two months. They kept it coming back for more and more  We were on vacation. We had a call at least his sister Debbie to say could you fax them some stuff?  Fortunately, we have a fax machine for some reason in the office. I don't know what normal people do  Go down to the the kinkos  You know what here's what normal people do they don't do it they don't go there anymore  They go to rocket mortgage from quick and loans quick and loans the number one lender in the country number one in customer satisfaction  Year after year after year according to JD Power and they have decided to make this a modern process  They call it rocket mortgage quick and loans to the rescue  Rocket mortgage makes it easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No time you're in town come on over  You could do she'll do you could do the chair Lisa do the reformer it'll be so much fun. I  Was holding this story just for you Stacey. Oh, thank you. So sorry y'all no no no Amnesty International  77-page report  16-month investigation  Talking about abuse of women on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, all you have to really do is go on Twitter and you could find a little bit of that  hashtag toxic Twitter the issue is  is  There an issue is this free speech or is Twitter failing to?  implement its own policies to protect women on the platform and  Amnesty International  says Twitter has not taken sufficient steps to effectively and adequately to address reports of violence and abuse and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most importantly implement its own guidelines. I'll let Stacey go first because I have a prepared statement

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kind of want to hear your prepared statement and then I can respond to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, so the problem, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, it's not just women the research highlights the experiences of violence abuse against women of color women from ethnic or religious minorities  Lesbian bisexual transgender women non-binary individuals women with disabilities  Everybody basically except white men and they're they're not having a great time on Twitter sometimes either. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So first of all, I love Twitter  I use it heavily and and they do have problems their problems and I've said this on this show before  Stem from the fact that Twitter won't give up control of moderation right on every other social network  You can delete other people's comments  When they invade your conversation with trolling and harassment and hate speech  Whereas on Twitter you have to go to Twitter itself and beg them and plead with them to take action and they'll go  Nah, doesn't know it's up to them and they have to they have to sit there and go after every needle in every haystack  Whereas on other social networks, you can just go and delete the offending comments and it has a big effect on knocking down  People the trolls gravitate to Twitter for this reason Twitter specifically is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Giving the information Amnesty International wants about its reporting process and content moderation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not even telling them how it works. Let alone making it work. It's another black box. They're there once again using ignorance  To their advantage  They claim free speech, but but really this is a huge huge problem  I think it's a big problem for the tech press because the tech press is the most vocal champion of Twitter and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Probably half of the users. Yeah the press in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Other outside the tech press is a journalist political journalists are heavy user Twitter as well  But the tech press itself is the one who's always going yeah Twitter's, you know heavy users of it and  You were talking on on twit the other day. I think  Somebody brought up the fact that I was having that I was championing Google plus saying this Facebook thing is a real opportunity for Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Plus and I said well good we're getting Mike on twig today  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and so and so the in fact what I did was I I do I try to do what you do on this show all the  Start a conversation with smart people so we're gonna learn something I love that and so I  Created a post on Google plus saying hey is this is the Facebook's problems create an opportunity for Google plus to have resurgence  And then I went to Twitter and I said hey everybody go talk on Google plus about this conversation because we're having this big conversation and  That's what I did and people on Google plus. They're like we don't want the Facebook people. We got a good thing going here

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Please don't have don't know actually Google plus has been much better since everybody left it. Yeah. Yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so this is but this is the thing so the tech press the way the tech press and I understand why they do it  But the tech press doesn't actually use arguments to dismiss Google plus they use  Snide or everybody knows that Google plus is nothing right so probably this audience for twig probably  25% of your audience uses Google plus to great effect there are great conversations. There's there lots of problems on Google plus  Lots of problems on Twitter lots of problems on Facebook  But what I was trying to convince the the Twitter Ah, he to embrace is the reason to to use a social to the reason  To advocate a social network is not because everybody's there  That's why we have Facebook everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook and nobody's on Google plus because nobody's on Google plus  Those are not good reasons in fact you talk about moderation Google plus has a new feature that's barely been mentioned  This is the greatest feature that ever existed on any social network in history with a single click you can block  report and  delete a  comment  One click all three of those things happen and then on the way out it says you also want to delete all their recent comments  And you say yes, and it's like the most it's like wow that's nice  It's like it's like I might go later rates the trolls and the haters and it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Eliminates all there's been a spam problem lately though on Google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this but this is the thing you have to use that feature use it a little bit and pretty soon  It's like it'll go away. Yeah all right and so again  I'm not saying that Google plus is the greatest thing in the world actually use Twitter more than Google plus  so I am also a hypocrite, but  Let's be clear about why we recommend  You know people talk about Macedon right Macedon is like this wonderful place. We're all supposed to go  Okay, if you're gonna diss Google plus for not having users Google plus has way more users than master

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And way more engagement way more activity recently deleted all my circles because I was getting Google plus circles in my  Contact yes, yeah, but I don't think you need the circles really right they've kind of moved away from circles

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead so that was that was creepy weird  Okay, so back to Twitter. I'm gonna say  My thought on all of this is it's the same  They've created essentially what is a public square and  Anytime people who are not the majority go into a public square. There is a risk  I mean you see people being catcalled and that sort of thing  Twitter's problem is that no one can step up much like Mike said no one can step up and say hey  Yeah, we don't do that here. We don't treat people like that way here  So there's no moderation and then Twitter itself doesn't have you know, if something gets really egregious you can call the cops and  Twitter you can't call the cops on Twitter  You don't even know really what the rules are that they're gonna follow and when they follow the rules  They do it unevenly and it's disturbing and people complain because they're like it's the public square  I could be as much of a jerk as I want in the public square, but that's not actually true because we have rules and  We have rules and then we have society morals and basically one can't be enforced on Twitter and  One Twitter doesn't want to take the role of enforcing on so that's that's the problem  So yeah, I say Twitter's a hostile place for lots of people. Yeah, I reported like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  2025 user accounts on Twitter where they're using my profile picture and my name and  Said they and Twitter said no, they don't violate our terms of service  Those are those are all parody accounts, even though many of them had never posted anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so do accounts too

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's I don't know how many it is, but it's a lot if you search for my name

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You'll get lots of unfortunate because it's really because of twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, probably probably but the but the and but the point is what's the point of verification?  If it doesn't protect you from people copying your name and your face and and so anyway  So it's just they have serious problems that they don't address and the way to address those problems is give users more control  I think and I think that would help a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is why I can't quit Twitter  Brianna who's  tweet  Really impressed with the graphics and far cry 5 the fictional game about white supremacists taking over America's feels so realistic  Great job, Ubisoft  But of course those are images from Charlottesville  I love you Brianna  Wow, she's good by the way big interview in the New York Times  Oh really with Brianna woo and how she's changing the Democratic playbook

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's gonna be exciting. I'd love to see a lot more nerds running for office. Not me. I'm not doing it  No, I got a good thing going if you think Twitter's bad try running for office  Yeah, exactly  but but Twitter is the is the  world it's a greatest place in the world for snark and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually it's so I love I know I know but I love Twitter. I follow  The nerdiest people. Yeah, if you're not following like the real scientist account  I don't know what you're doing with your life, but you can learn so much and there's I find a lot of good conversations  and I think I  Don't know. I mean every now and then I get somebody who's like a jerk to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you know, I just delete them and move on I have to I really probably should just unfollow everybody and recreate my Twitter list  But I did find it a hack a life hack that works very well for me  I use tweet deck which is so far still a very good service, even though Twitter completely ignores it  Yeah, tweet deck dot Twitter comm and what I have learned is that and this is actually I wish a tool Twitter would give you  But they only give it to you in tweet deck you can exclude retweets  Yeah, so a lot of the problem on Twitter is just this kind of like three-quarters of the traffic on a Twitter feed is people  Retweeting and off often somebody pointed this out. I think it's really true retweets are the most  Obnoxious content the stuff that got people to go retweet the most outrage the most you know, that's this so sometimes retweets are good  But but but now my home stream and by the way the other thing tweet deck does which is nice as it's live  Yeah, so it continues to scroll my home stream  Is retweet free and that is really slow a slowed it down. Yeah, and and be focused it  Mm-hmm. So the next thing is and I keep saying this I'm gonna just sit here and watch it  And when I when I see something a person I don't want to follow in that feed because I followed them  But I shouldn't have I'm gonna I'm gonna start  Unfollowing but I haven't done what I'd love to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I have I have two main account  I have one account that I use for following and I have another account that I use for just  People follow me basically and for me to engage in this system before and I have multiple that gets really complicated  But basically I I'm very careful about who I follow because I don't want a firehose of not of nonsense and some of the people  I want to follow  post a lot of nonsense and so  That's the trick one of the things that's great about nobody's consistently interesting  I mean one of the great things about Twitter is that you can say, okay  I want to follow all these people but mute the following words. I want to mute stuff about politics  I want to mute stuff about sports in my case and just get tech right, right and that's a beautiful thing  Unfortunately, I don't think that conveys over to the third-party clients  I use Twitter bot or one of those others that's like tweet tweet deck and it doesn't  Those mute filters don't apply on the third party. I'd love for them to apply

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I've got kind of you need a better API integration then maybe Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Copyrighted exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know that may be an endgame for me is to write my own Twitter client, you know  Yeah, all you know four more years of computer science classes and I'll be ready. You could call it Twitter. Oh wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look there's a wider harness good nor good Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no cuz this doesn't fit on the back here, which like the ring they do a bypass. Yeah, this is a sticker  So this is gonna go  Inside my actual doorbell. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The bell doesn't do a bypass the ring wires itself as a regular doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The ring Pro actually the new one does the new one?  Bypass because otherwise when you hit the motion if the motion sensor goes off it would actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have that problem at home. My doorbell does not ring when somebody walks up to the doorbell  They have to press the button. So I don't know what ring did we should mention rings a sponsor just as long as we're saying  Ring oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Okay. Oh, yeah, and actually this week there sponsor my show too. So I am also sponsored by ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we are so I can't unscrew it for them because I don't have do I have my little mini screwdriver? Hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they're gonna work with the nest has said because they're Google they're gonna work with the Google home mini and the mail  This is interesting. Not only will your doorbell ring the home mini will say someone's at the door  I'm sorry. Someone's at the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I think it's also going to  Work with them. I don't want them cast. Can I have Gollum say someone's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like show up on your TV like you'll see a picture on your TV all of a sudden if somebody at the door  I think that was the thought process

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Already on Chromecast with your

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right you have to call it up you can't do it you have to say Google home  Show who's on who's at the door on my nest on my living room TV and by that time they've gone away  So this would be if it's a little more automatic  24 7 streaming continuous video recording. That's something nest does with their cameras  And that's something that others do not do for by three HD video showing people from head to toe  That's just what we call a in the business a wide-angle lens. Oh, it's jargon jargon  HDR video shows sharp details even in bright and dark areas  Person motion and sound alerts to detect visitors can recognize family and friends and send a special alert. That's kind of cool  That's like that  White house so it has face right but but I think it's interesting  So it has face right but but you know my experience with the nests  IQ its face recognition it never learned anybody's face ever  That's the one that saw the mylar balloons and that's the same probably the same technology. It's exactly the same pre-recorded quick responses  Oh, wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is that pre-recorded quick response? Go away? Oh, yes. That's what that is. I just ate a polywag  I think it was swallowed  Okay, i'll add that if I can  But I just swallowed a polywag

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh my god, all right. Well, will it you know what next week?  Will you be will that be enough time for you to review this? Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. Oh look i'm adding it to my app using the scan the code function

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that on the nest cams do that too. They have a barcode on the back and you can just add it very easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although it doesn't see it very well  Because the barcode is not  Not the best. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe it's on the box. That's all the only thing I don't like about that is if you want to change the wi-fi or whatever  You've got to go outside unscrew the doorbell  Scan rescan it's a bit of a process  Uh to do that, but but I guess that's probably a good thing with my ring video doorbell what I do I sponsor

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I um, I have I don't use the screws  I just basically slide in and I use tape on the top so it doesn't slip out  That's a great idea and then I just rip off the tape and nobody's ever stolen it. No never

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What would anybody do with it? Anyway, uh, let's steal this guy's doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, it's a pathetic kind of van when I was living in mexico for some reason everywhere I live  Like people ignore it completely except in mexico everyone who came to the doorbell and lots of people come to your house  And to sure in mexico because they're selling water  They're doing that's where you buy it and every single person to a person was just like looking at it and they're like wow  That's fascinating and there was a video of mexicans like looking at your doorbell by my doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, wow, but nobody's ever stolen it. Maybe we don't need a wall. We could just put door bells along the border

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. Oh and they can ring if they want to if they want to immigrate they can ring the bell

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then truncate. I don't know if that was a racist thing to say or not. I am like in setup mode. I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're totally in iot. This is stacey on iot mode is what this is. This is me. This is me in real life  Sorry, you guys. I know you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're  I that's why we love you stacey. You're a complete nutter nerd  Just just a nerd

Okay, there's gonna be a long  I also got so I will do this for you guys. So next week we'll be able to talk about this and then  You know what you could do stacey? You don't have to put it on your front door. You could put it on your office door  So I can't actually put anything. Well, i'm gonna set it up on my  Oh  This is this is my issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I also got more but wait, there's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a keypad. Oh, I didn't know they had the yale lock. Oh man. We've been waiting for this for like two years  I didn't even know about this one  Yeah, this is their yale lock that's going to I think work with the doorbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Most locks are made for keys says nest. This lock is made for people  Actually, technically it's made for people with fingers  technically, yes  Comes in nickel  oil rubbed bronze  Oh, I have satin nickel or pat polished brass  Yeah, the back side looks like this just so you know, so it's not as this is like the schleg though and other locks  Right. It's a dead bolt that you can open remotely

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes  Does it also unlock with bluetooth?  Proximity, oh, I hope not because that's I think dangerous. I don't like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh key free connected so it will unlock with

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The pad or bluetooth you can control it from your nest. Wait a minute. Okay. This is the deal breaker kids  And if your lock loses power you can quickly charge it with a nine volt battery to unlock the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's actually in complaint because that's actually a big complaint for the august guys  Because and here's why these things lose their battery power really quickly and  Oftentimes they lose it in the dead of winter when it's super cold and you don't want to change it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So people just keep ignoring it. I am not gonna buy something that I have to unlock with a nine  Yeah in my pocket  Oh, yeah, honey. I can't get in i'm gonna go to the store and get a nine volt battery. I'll be right back  This is ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is why non-starter  I'm like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, doesn't look like it has bluetooth. It also works with their nest secure alarm boy  You know from a company that had no products for like five years  Like all they did was a thermostat suddenly. This is overwhelming. They've just that's good. They got rid of that guy  Whatever it was was it fedella? Tony fedell was slowing it down or  It was it's good. They put him in  Got him out of alphabet put him in google. I think is really what happened. Yeah  Holy cow thermostats cameras doorbells alarm systems locks smoke and carbon monoxide alarm all new products. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The smoke the smoke alarm came out under tony. Yeah, they took that off the market though

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because you could wave at it and disable it forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and they brought all the security stuff out because originally no one knew what the smart home was going to be like  But the thing that people pay for  Is security right? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's that's the number one that and lights yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People actually that's the third use case. So the number one use case has been security  Um, the second is energy efficiency and finally is automation and lights  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the thing is the thing is that if you compare the world of lights and how it's implemented  What people go through and the world of security like the ring video doorbell?  Sorry to suck up to a sponsor here and that's not my intention, but it just works

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It just works i've never had to use a nine volt battery  I see people struggling with their lights. They they they tell echo. That's the real problem with home automation. Yeah  It's uh, we all have kind of not good experiences. Well, just ask stacey someday or maybe ask her husband about the  Yeah, you were wondering what she's on. She's on iot. The window blinds just ask. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't tell him  I set up an automation. Oh, I should have checked. I didn't check when I went out there  I set up one today. So it's going to finally be working. I think
