Transcript:  You cannot participate in what we're about to do  No  Oh I'm not  Is this left over from All About Android last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it is and it looked awful on that show so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the mystery Oreo flavor I see it all over Twitter have you tried these yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't eat Oreos  Oh you're just a cop out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh wait wait no that's a cop out  That's a cop out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man no they're so nasty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well some of them are some of the flavors have been absolutely phenomenal  Apparently this one's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is so the idea is they don't tell you what the flavor is and oh I see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No the idea is they had a bunch of cream left over in the bat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guess the flavor for a chance to win $50,000  So you haven't tried these yet?  I have not  Nor have I now we're told I've been told you need to smell before you eat it  I will try one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoa  Really?  I will not I mean  Just sniff it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes  You can at least smell it  I know exactly what that  It's a double stuff  No this smells like a children's cereal like a  Fruit Loops  Fruit Loops  It smells like fruit  It smells like Fruit Loops  Oh I don't know if I want that on my cookie  Oh it smells just like Fruit Loops

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't sound good  Alright so I'm sorry Mike you're left out of this  I am going to eliminate this because I know this is chocolate right?  I don't want to eat the wafer just the creamy filling  They don't still make this out of shortening do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it lime?  Is there an answer on the back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's definitely Fruit Loops

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh  Yeah that was how it  No no  My little mouth size

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no no no no no  Here you go  Thank you  That's for you  Father Robert K  Oh wow  Where is the water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's horribly bad  We'll get you some water  So the grand prize winner two way center text mystery to 59526  There is no winner with that thing  26 and follow the link to submit your guess or go to OreoMystery.com and submit your guess  And I don't know how you would do this to enter without making a purchase  Or guessing the correct flavor is the official rule so you don't even have to get it right to enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait so we don't know what the flavor is unless we text them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No this will be a big unveiling  Hey Jammer B can you grab me some of that manure so I can get the flavor out of my mouth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I get some flamethrower and some coffee please?  I know that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You like it?  I like Fruit Loops  I like Fruit Loops too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Fruit Loops but not between a cookie  Not between a chocolate wafer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wafer that's oh thank you sir you are really awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the only thing the only way this ties into the show in any way is that the newest Android is Oreo  That's completely a flimsy justification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been a great bit though because he's got enough Oreos for every week of the year  And some of those flavors sounded nasty and they turned out to be quite good actually  Jason has 52 Oreos  He bought a bunch and all his guests who come in they bring Oreos from around the world  I didn't know this there's Oreos flavors that you can only buy in other countries  Wow  That is true  Go figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is definitely Fruit Loops

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would really like a Tim Tam for like tea and I would like that to come on  What's a Tim Tam?  I think we have Tim Tams  It's an Australian cookie  Can you get her some? Do we have any Tim Tams left over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Australians bring us Tim Tams all the time  So you know the only thing that would confirm this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a biscuit with a chocolate coating and they come in different flavors  Oh okay yeah all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Delicious  Who owns Fruit Loops? That's what would confirm this  Kale O's  Is that an Abisco brand?  Aren't they all?  Some of them are General Mills

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually we've got someone from the US Patent and Trade Office  He's in a pharmaceuticals  Oh I guess that's the same thing  This is a pharmaceutical is it not?  Yeah it ought to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It ought to be regulated like one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're definitely changing my feelings and a little dry mouth happening right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike can you get us any specific Oreo flavors from Russia and Turkey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No  They taste like sad  He can but he won't  I can  Exactly  They actually have all kinds of really awesome cookies here that do not taste like Fruit Loops  I'll bring some of those how about that?  I'll bring some non-Australian non-flim flams or whatever they're called  Flim flams  You'll love them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard in Moscow you can buy Caviar Oreos I'm thinking those are probably pretty good  That sounds delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kellogg's is a direct competitor to Nabisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's not Fruit Loops Flavored

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay so maybe this is a Patent and Trade Office thing I think someone just stole a recipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah this is Mondalese  Leo is actually entering  Mondalese  Is that how you pronounce it?  That's how you pronounce it  They put the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Z is silent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They put a bar over the E like E it's supposed to be Mondalese  No it's Mandalay  Mandalay would be the French pronunciation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mandalay? Wait Mandalay?  Mondalay  It's Mondalay  So it's Mondalay based

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I write Fruit Loops?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would go with lime actually I think they're lime or lemon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that really smelled like Fruit Loops  Like that was early childhood Fruit Loops

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright well you could enter twice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way Fruit Loops is spelled F-R-O-O-T if I'm not wrong  Is it?  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be li... it would deceptive trade practice if it were  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're one smart cookie  Thanks for submitting your daily guess so you can guess as many times as you want  That kind of takes the challenge out of it  Upload a receipt  While we can't help you eat the evidence we sure could help you earn a bonus entry  Just upload a receipt showing your purchase  Or submit a photo  You know what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Send him the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually want to complain about something  Okay  And it's T-Mobile  Did you watch baseball? You didn't watch the World Series last night  And I know Mike you probably couldn't get it  I normally watch baseball but I'm not watching this series  So Fox which is broadcasting the World Series at Game One was last night  Has apparently sold two second or three second ads in the game  So they'll be... this is during the play by play  Which I'm telling you I don't want to watch anymore  I'm so upset  And T-Mobile bought a lot of these  And so every like... every batter it seems like  Texts something to T-Mobile  Oh I hate those  To send two dollars in hurricane relief to Puerto Rico  Which I don't... which I support  But instead I'm going to send him a hundred dollars instead of tweeting  So it's brilliant though because you get for two dollars  You get lots of tweets talking about T-Mobile  You get these ads in the middle of interrupting the biggest baseball game of the year  I was flabbergasted but the best one is... did you see the YouTube ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, okay that is brilliant  That is the best bit of trolling I have ever seen by a corporation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So YouTube bought... you know they have those interchangeable banners behind the batter  Right?  And YouTube bought that thing behind the banner  Oh that is awesome  Where does that play button show up?  Where does the play button show up on the TV?  You're watching TV, you're watching the World Series  Where does the play button... right in the middle of the screen  Where... you're like you're trying to tap it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OCD meters around the world went off the scale  Because they're going what's... no play play

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This should be banned

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh really? I thought it was funny  I thought it was very clever  Or I think it's... I didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you didn't have to watch this for two and a half hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So who's the demographic here?  Because don't only old people watch baseball?  Do young people watch baseball on television?  That is a real question, I'm not trying to be a jerk  Okay wait, Mike do you watch baseball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it has nothing to do with my age  I never watched sports ball of any kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watch baseball  You don't have to have a punching machine to hurt me  I'm sorry, I'm just... I don't...  Do young people not watch baseball anymore?  Is it over for baseball?  Maybe it is  God that's sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the thing about this is  YouTube doesn't need to advertise  They've got brand recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I see what you're saying Stacy  Like what demographic is... who's this...  In fact, when old people like me watch this  How would we even know that that's a YouTube button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense though because  Essentially lots of people are watching lots of things on YouTube  Especially nowadays with the new YouTube features  There's a lot of sports  And who is... who are they trying to get?  They don't need to get young people  Young people know about YouTube  But the young people are the only ones who don't get to control

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And remember this is not an ad for YouTube in general  This is YouTube TV which is their cable cutters

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My dad actually subscribes to this  So he can watch golf, another old person sport

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, I know a lot of young people who play golf  Don't make that an ageist thing  Not playing golf

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ScooterX says YouTube bought the tickets  If you bought a ticket for the World Series  YouTube was on the ticket  They spent a lot of money on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's the only sport they can get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, aside from the fact that I think it's a brilliant trolling  I just love that  They didn't really need to do this, right?  Look at the size, everything, everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They must have... I mean that is exact...  That looks like a play button  It feels like an algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it wouldn't if the angle was just slightly off  Or the elevation was just slightly off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's perfect, it's like they really... they tested this sucker

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you say it's a lot of money  But is it a lot of money in Google dollars?  It's probably just one monthly payment to the EU  As part of a... I mean this is nothing  This is like lunch money for them  Look at the tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The location of that YouTube logo  Has me wanting to touch my TV to start the video  Keep trying to play on my screen  Hey, somebody tell Fox to get rid of the YouTube logo  I don't play, it's driving me nuts  No, you're confusing Fox's strike zone box with YouTube logo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like Padre said, this is excellent trolling  Everybody's talking about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's really all you need to do  Congratulations  Well done  Now if they had YouTube TV  And it was showing the World Series  Without that, they take it out  Okay, I see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I should check on my YouTube TV  If I can get the World Series  Can you pay for the World Series?  Well, it's on Fox  I think it might be on my...  Let me go to my YouTube TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on a second  I was going to say, my husband watches baseball  I'm not sure if he's old or not  I watch F1

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  F1 racing  That was just this last week in Austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How was it?  I can't do it in Microsoft's Edge

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How dare you try to use some other product to watch YouTube TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you like me to look and see if I can get the World Series on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you subscribe to YouTube TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is for YouTube TV  So  Oh, was it there?  Yes  In my home?  Oh, wow  Game two  And if I press this plus button  Now it's going to DVR it  Okay, that's kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know they did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's good because I could skip through the two second commercials for T-Mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you like YouTube TV?  Does it give you something that no other service gives you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's an advantage for people in certain metros like the San Francisco Metro where we are  Because we get live TV  Live local TV  So you see I'm getting channel two, channel five, channel seven  Oh, so it's geo-located

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are my local stations  And not every market has locals  But don't you think this is the greatest interface?  It actually plays it live so you can see what's on  That is cool  I mean if nothing else TiVo and the others should learn from the UI  The UI is I think spectacular

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you pick your location?  So like for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're going to get what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, could you VPN to it?  Or are they going to snag you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I figure Google is probably smart enough not to let you do that  This is and you have I know you have a younger daughter who probably watches some of these young kids stuff like Disney and  She has not she grew up on Netflix and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She can watch Phoenix and Ferb without any network

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you like DVR and then take it offline?  Record 12 hours of shows for your kids?  I think you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone actually was telling me they subscribed to this so they could bring how-to videos  and programming videos on the plane with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have let's see I have Fargo here because I DVR that  Let's see if the menu lets me to remove Fargo go to Fargo  I don't maybe not  Well, if you take your take related on YouTube, I have to get to stream it  Which you would expect right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, some shows probably you can do that all of them. Yeah  All hail DRM making life difficult

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But for instance you can have with one subscription you can multi-bubble family members each with their own DVR each with their own  Channel tunings and so forth. I think this is it's 25 bucks a month  I think for 25 bucks a month this is if you're in a market where you can get the locals a pretty good choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, but for me that's it 25 bucks a month. That's all I'm gonna pay every month for entertainment  So I could I make YouTube TV the only entertainment I buy a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know that's the problem and I think that's the real problem with court cutting is then you have to add Netflix Hulu  Probably no, you wouldn't need Hulu if you have this as much you don't have to do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just gonna point out that well right now the only service I pay for right now is Amazon video because it comes 35  35 I don't do Netflix. I don't do Hulu. I don't do YouTube TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you but so this 35 plus 10 bucks for Netflix, which is a you know, you can't forget that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe another 15 if you wanted HBO then you're then you're talking but then but then you rolled in the cost of your connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too, right and then your connection it's the same as cables and that's yeah, frankly one of the reasons cable companies have slowly ratcheted up the  Internet prices is because they want it so that well, we'll get you either way. They need that 160 buck ARPU or the triple play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just hooked up the community I live in in San Francisco to Comcast and so we had to do business class  That's the only way they would come out to our side of the street if we got it if we got just the Internet it would have been  Two hundred and eighty five dollars a month getting this exact same Internet connection plus a hundred channels is ninety five dollars a month  But you're gonna have to contact them every year, right? This is true. This is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But actually I went into the Comcast store and that's for the representative said I'm gonna save I could save you money now  But you have to keep in touch with us every year. Otherwise, this will go back to the normal pricing and you'll be sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did this before in DC. He actually said that and they charged us the higher rate and then I called up and I threatened to cancel  And they refunded the three months that they had already charged us. So it's they don't care. They don't care  They want to get that you on the cable plan because they actually sell that advertising, right? That's that's their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nailed it. Yeah, but I think you nailed it though Leo that the killer thing about this is families because  imagine a family where you got a kid in middle school kid in high school kid in college and  This is not about  Another way to get local programming or different types of programming on a TV. It's about getting TV on a mobile phone  And so kids are gonna want to see their shows on on their mobile phone  They're gonna want to have their own DVR and the parents are gonna want to have the kids have their own DVR, right?  So because you don't want to wade through all your middle school kids DVR and shows to get to your shows  And so I think I think really if you think about a family where you have kids going up through the schools or whatever  It's really it's basically so inexpensive to just take care of everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's for convenience. That is like the first worldiest problem. I think I have ever heard  I hate scrolling through all my kids shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another reason and that's to stick it to the man and people hate cable companies so much that they will actually pay more  Just to stick it to the cable company right Tom Merritt did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz I don't like them and he had to stay on the right for an hour and a half  Oh, they hate you pay more that's so arcade. So this is a perfect example

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're we Stockholm syndrome. So my cable and my internet have been kind of dropping very quickly briefly  But I'm watching a show and I'll go in the core and then I come back and I know that's the cable cuz it's on two  Different you know, I have a business class in a home class and I know that it's them and I know I have to call Comcast  It's just it's like we can put up with this can't we we can live with this for a while?  It is actually less painful to have the TV stop every 10 seconds than to call Comcast to get it fixed. That's horrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you just tweet about it and then they call you that's actually yeah, okay faster way to do they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I did this many years ago. I when I you know still believed in the Twitter. I tweeted  It was back when Comcast cares and all that. Mm-hmm. I got a call from the executive office  You know what they said, can you stop tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't say we'll fix this then you say will you fix my cable? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really their real impetus was not to fix something. They didn't say I'm sorry. You're having these problems  We'd like to fix it. They said we'd like what can we do to get you stop tweeting? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I said that's really simple just come out here and fix this  My work  Take away the reason for my tweeting that it just tells you it wasn't about customer service was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right  I'm gonna get the bad flavor of the Oreo is out of your mouth and I'm gonna put it back in when we talk about  the pixel 2  Stacy's using her pixel to the pixel 2 XL display and all of that  Do you want me to show you're gonna have to tell me when it's time for me to show that almost?  Okay, I'm ready. But first we are going to cleanse your palate  With some luscious blue bottle coffee  We love blue bottle coffee now you can get it by subscription and it is the most amazing  When you have a company like blue bottle that has an insane dedication to coffee like I do to be honest  You're you're getting by the way, I don't know if they sent it to Georgia and I'm sure you have good coffee there  But boy, you might want to not that good this, you know blue bottle. It's awesome  And I was just talking to somebody who says oh I only do the single  single farm single source  So this is a Costa Rica  From Chiripo Regalode Rivas. Oh  Man, just wait a minute. Just smell that collect them all share

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good oh my god, that may leave with me. I know you can take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This coffee is the definition of homemade grown processed even dried milled on the urania family farm along the mango trees of Rivas  Costa Rica doesn't that sound wonderful years of tinkering have brought its sweetness into focus with a tart complexity  That should please its farmer the ambitious  Regaloh her ardo or anya as much as it astonishes anyone with a good fortune to taste it  It's got Rainier cherry dried fig and creme brulee notes  You know, we're gonna make some how about if we make a little bit we could taste it the beans by the way  One of the things is really critical  It's wonderful to get a coffee from a farmer directly so that you know  They're getting the proceeds directly and you're tasting the unique flavors that they are bringing you  That's why blue bottle works directly with farmers all over the world  85% of the coffee they buy is certified organic. Most of their blends are certified organic  But the key is they bring the beans home  They don't roast them until you order there all the beans you're gonna get are roasted within 48 hours of your order  They even have a date and time on it  So that you know and shipped to you so you're getting and this is critical you're getting the beans have just been roasted  And they have something for every palette from the lighter fruit flavored profiles, which we just described to the deeper chocolatey espressos  I'm a big fan of the blend  My mouth is watering the giant steps blend. It's it's a really good  Ugandan and Sumatran  They described with the note says viscous  Fudgy and  substantial  Doesn't that sound like something you want? Wait with cream in it. I  Like it with cream. Yeah, you not like cream. You got to taste the coffee. You could taste the coffee  I like cream. All right, we'll get another one without it. This is the Kenya Mbu  Chikurima  Roasted how does that even possible October 24th? What day is this? This is into the future. It's a 25th

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is that even possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on you should just try it's not a lot of cream I already I put my order in okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is really good. That's why he took it away from me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is really oh man I go to there's a blue bottle I go to in LA and I just I love that place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The coffee is always just beyond fantastic. Yeah, I don't know what it is about  I really don't but it is is qualitatively different than any other coffee place. It's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not doesn't do just to say it's it's better. It just tastes different and I like the different it's cleaner

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it's like yes. It tastes like what it's you think something. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if you have the temerity to put cream in it  I know do you not put any anything in your coffee drink it black. I sometimes put sugar in my coffee  I would submit the cream isn't as bad as sugar or honey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't normally put sugar in my coffee  But when I go to blue bottle sometimes I order there's a couple of drinks  They have that are kind of like these caramely forgot what they're called. Then it's like having candy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they don't over sweeten it. It's just enough so you can smell it just now the aroma

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did as soon as they open that box. It was you'll like you like opening that every other week. Hey, this just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it answer your question. I'm sorry Leo, but coffee in Georgia. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's not great  What they do have in Georgia is is something like also has notes of mango and whatever. This is where wine was invented  That's right. That's right  Yep, absolutely. If this is the this is I think it was travel  I was saying that big travel travel the big travel guide company. What's it called the website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh trip planner trip advice trip advisor. That's it trip advice just just named

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tbilisi the number one city in the world for wine. They just did this  last week  And it's absolutely true  Absolutely true. This whole country is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insane obsessed with wine. Well, everybody makes at home. We have some neighbors to the north who might disagree with that  Canada, right? Well, it's on man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Don't think they're really  They're more better for you know, Tim's Tim Hortons  This this just in so we all know about DXO  They're the ones who give the grades for the cameras on the phones and lenses and so forth  And they're the ones that Google very happily said we have the highest score ever  What Google didn't point out is the honor the new honor make 10 actually has a higher still photo score of 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it what is the scale on this thing we zero to 100, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although now that something's got a hundred I think they're gonna expand it  You what if something's better than the the Leica lenses in the main any way they have decided and I'm so happy to hear this  To take over the Nick collection from Google  So these this was something Google bought and used mostly what they wanted snap seed which Google distributes is a free app  Which is a great app  But Nick was very famous for making photo editing tools that everybody all the pros I know loved especially  Silver effects, which is their black and white their monochrome filter and it has been neglected by Google Google started giving it away  So it wasn't like they were charging for it  but they have neglected it and so I'm very thrilled to hear that somebody is gonna take over Nick and  Keep that alive, especially silver effects because that is a plug-in that is hard to live without

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are plugins for Photoshop and for Lightroom, right? Which one do you use? Are you a Photoshop? I'm a Lightroom guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can talk about Lightroom too. That's a big change  This last week at Adobe Max Adobe announced that they were gonna eliminate the buy it once keep it forever  Model from Lightroom, which is a very popular pro photography tool and require a subscription  I've been subscribing for a while because the creative cloud subscription Lightroom included Photoshop Lightroom $10 a month. That was a good cheap enough  Yeah cheap enough. Well considering Lightroom's 200 bucks by the Photoshop's like $800. So that was a good deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I'm one of these guys who I'm on an old version of the suite  I'm five point five because I don't want a subscription. I want to own my software and forever be able to use it  Yeah, you're well, you're that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Adobe's model anymore. It's not Microsoft's model anymore. I think it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand why they want their model. They're gonna make far more money. But at the same time, it's like well  I want to pay for it. I take my money and let me own it and then I'll buy the next version

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, because that's what their model was if we would update it every year  They you know, and then you'd pay it for a little extra for the updates. Anyway  It's a completely new interface on Lightroom  So we'll see what they they're keeping the old right room is creative  Lightroom CC classic CC and then the new Lightroom is just like Lightroom CC  Anyway, so actually that opens up and it's maybe one of the reasons DXO mark is acquiring Nick  It opens up I think an opportunity in the marketplace for companies to make Lightroom  Replacements because I think a lot of photographers are looking for something better and I know a number of at least two companies  Sarah which makes that great affinity photo  and Mac fun  Which makes a really fabulous kind of Lightroom like program called Luminar are both working towards making their products be a challenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when Google got the collection and I was hoping that it would just become part of Google Photos  I was too. I think I just thought never happened  That's what I really thought would happen and that would have been amazing. That would have been credible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wish they'd integrate snap seed into Google Photos. That would be fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snapseed is so good for most people. I think snap seeds all you really need you get great results with snap seed  I think what Lightroom what's happening in Lightroom is really Adobe acknowledging that really most photography is now done on a camera phone and  Processed in the camera phone for posting on social media  That's mostly what people are doing now and and that's kind of where they're tuning their software  All right, you got a pixel 2 and by the way, your case looks great on your pixel 2

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that theme Leo? It's a people reading people reading in space women reading in space

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not women reading in space. It is women astronauts. It celebrates

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Women astronauts, I've unfortunately confused Stacey by asserting it doesn't look like that at all  But so that is a woman astronaut. Yeah, and that's the planet Earth and she's in the module of whatever it is  Obviously, she's not wearing a suit and the book is floating because she's no gravity. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it's a nice case. It's a nice picture. Well in and I activated the live cases screensaver  So my screensaver is also a woman in space. I think it always at the same picture  No, it's not the same picture. It is hold on  It's the other side of the side of the portal. Do we have it over the shoulder?  So you see my pretty yes, I think we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  questions trying to figure out where it is  Let's see, I think I can change all your colors to kind of match to like so this is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and  Let's see. Oh wait, go to settings. It's a little out of focus  Oh, sorry, look bright is mostly with the promise. That's cuz that's cuz Padre asked me to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to see how bright it could get turn it down even more. I would see that white is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys, I can't do eight things at once  That's perfect. So this there's a ten-minute documentary where they interviewed three women who were in space  And it was actually kind of cool because I showed it to my daughter because I'm like go ladies in STEM and  There was a there's a moment where one of the astronauts who was a mom talked about saying goodbye to her son  Before they did the lift off and my my daughter looked at me and she's like  Moms can go into space and I was like, yeah, they can so it was pretty cool  Anyway, did she then say when are you going in space? You know, she didn't she's not a teenager yet  She likes me. She's sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing is that is no longer a rhetorical question. It used to be a generation ago now  It could be well actually that's possible  Yeah, I could buy a ticket

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, they're they're a woman just came back in the international don't think there's a woman currently in orbit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is not one in orbit, but was she a mom. I don't remember. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't not that that matters. Are there dads in space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope so. Yes, they're definitely dads in space because once you get packed from space  You may not be a dad because of all the radiation right? Well have your children first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just had that astronaut come down after it was a year plus  And he is his blog is filled with all the readjustments and his bones. It's not easy. Yeah  Yeah, after all of the exercise that he did to simulate gravity. It's just no the human body doesn't like zero g  Likes it when it's up there, right? It loves it when it's out there you come back down though into a grab  Which is uh the expanse has that they built that into the storyline how people who grew up in zero g  It's a great show a great book series when they come down into a large gravity  Well, they just can't cope robert just interviewed the author

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On triangulation. That's awesome. Scott. Scott kelly now has his uh book out about his year in space called endurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and he was interesting because he had a twin and so they were doing all of these medical experiments  Oh, I didn't know that on him  But yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were kind of on him because they were they could compare his bone mass and so forth with his brothers to see they were going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To compare their dna to see it. Did they do that? I don't know that would be amazing to see if it like his dna has mutated  Because of his exposure to radiation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now he has superpowers that that doesn't happen. No, unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not what i've heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let us uh talk about the pixel 2 xl's display. First of all the pixel 2

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you happy with it? I am happy and I like the intentional squeeze. I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried it. You let me squeeze your phone. Thank you. And uh,  I like I didn't squeeze it that hard, but you can hold it firmly and it doesn't trigger  That's true. You really have to kind of intentionally squeeze it, but it's not that hard  I thought it was just right actually and you can actually so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was an option when I set it up to actually kind of customize it  It asked me to squeeze the phone how I wanted to squeeze it. And so I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you said it nicely but the point is  There is a clear distinction and it buzzes gives you haptic feedback when you squeeze it and it launches the it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I turn a lot of my haptic feedback off because you leave that one on I get irritated  And it's nice actually when i'm reaching in my bag with intention to like oh I need to find this out  When you're reaching you can just squeeze it as you're reaching into your bag

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it's like i've heard people say that that that's kind of like a natural thing reaching your pocket squeeze as you're pulling it out  And then speak immediately  Uh, the screen looks good. You like it. It's an lcd screen  So it doesn't have any of the burn-in issues like it's i'm so glad everyone was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh the screen on the smaller one is not any good. We hate it. It's fine. I'm like, oh here my head's in the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you there. Um, there are people with very  picky eyes  And those are the people the picky people who tweet and review check review and write on reddit  And I looked at the pixel 2 xl at a verizon store when it was available and I didn't I saw the what they're talking about  the modeling with the  Dimmer screen that did not bother me in the least. However, I am very concerned about this burn-in issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is that is a huge issue that feels like quality control and I don't know what google's going to do  And then there's also on the pixel 2  There's complaints now and I just had this happen about ticking during the phone calls  So you're getting that I did get ticking. I didn't get there's apparently also a high-pitched audio thing that happens from the speakers, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh, it strikes me the ticking has happened before and uh  I think it's an nfc radio issue. I think that can be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, if it's a problem physical hardware ticking is yeah, that's a hardware issue. That's not something that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably a firmware update that they can do they're gonna have to take the dbs down exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The firmware means when they turn on the cellular radio for talk, they basically kill off all the other rf which  You're not supposed to do that's not good design  It means that if you're on a call and you go to use say the nfc it just won't work, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's I used to be on verizon with the 4g and the cdma right that was that was always exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's alex adobe's tweet. This is the  I can see the first one to talk about it  And what you see is the back button the home button and the recents button  Those are the buttons that are on all the time, of course  And they're going to be the ones you're going to have burned in but you even can see a little line from the dock there  um  And so and that's after a few after seven days  He said so that is really a cause for concern. Oh leds do have burn in issues. It's not unheard of  Somebody was telling me I think renee richie yesterday was telling me that on the samsung  Oleds like like the note 8 they jitter the  Display they move it a pixel left pixel right every once in a while just to avoid that specific kind of burn in  Samsung is the display used in the iphone 10 the oled and of course the note 8 and the s7  It is the best display i've ever seen. I think I think everybody agrees even in the note 8 oled is fantastic  It's beautiful. Yeah, I mean it's rich. It's bright. It just really looks good  But that's not the one that google got they got the lg display the same as in the v30 and I think some are worried that it might  Not it might be a subpar a third generation. Oh led that's so weird because this is a known quantity on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oleds you know it it's it's not like lcd where you're shining a backlight through through a filter  You're actually burning the oleds in order to make that light. Well, okay  We've known that for what six years now  So for you not to build that into the firmware where you you jitter or at least play with the pixels so that you're not  Unevenly wearing them. That's that's almost negligent  Uh, you know, it's as if they just decided not to listen to their engineers anymore or their engineers  Part of the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's there's engineers at the company and then there's engineers at the suppliers  There's engineers at the factories and the manufacturing and all that kind of stuff and this is uh, to me  This is most likely an example of what happens when you're not apple or samsung  You know the the if if you're apple and you're building and your component suppliers are building  Uh parts for apple you don't mess that relationship up because it's the end of you and and it's you know, the the volumes  That apple and and also samsung produce displays at just puts them at the front of the line  And so somebody like google comes along and they're they have a fraction number of units  They don't have the history. They don't have the backstory. They don't have  You know any of that stuff, uh, they're going to get you know, the truth is they're they're going to be second in line for the top tier  phone makers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's been true of every manufacturer in the age of apple  Apple gets they get the lion's share of the trough they can get the best parts and they can lock in  Manufacturers for those parts even if they're not going to use them. They're they're famous for doing this  It's they may they may need 10 million screens  But they're going to sign a contract for 20 million just because that's 10 million that another manufacturer can't get  Which it's kind of funny, but at the same time it means all all the devices I love are going to get the sub par parts  Yeah, it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not just google that's suffering with its new uh flagship phone this morning  And some suspected that apple had leaked it to bloomberg bloomberg had a story that apple had reduced  Face id accuracy in order to get the iphone 10  Out the door. We've known of course that the components  For the iphone 10 were behind it pushed the iphone 10 back a month  It's you'll be able to order it day after tomorrow at 1201  a.m. Friday at pacific time  for delivery next Friday, but  I wonder if people are thinking twice about this apple has  Denied it saying blueberg's claimed that apple has reduced the accuracy spec for face id is completely false, but it was  A strange denial by the way bloomberg's response. We stand behind a report. It was a strange denial  Because it didn't exactly deny that they had done that it was more about  well  We haven't  The quality and accuracy of face id haven't changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they didn't say since when so apple i i've been on the wrong end of the stick reporting on apple and things that have  Gone wrong and they are  They fight you they fight you and they are very  Nitpicky in a way that is hard. You're like, oh if only i'd put that one word in my story  Yeah, so I cut you off mike. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but also no  But also the the other thing is that these aren't black and white issues at all a company like apple always has 10 possibilities  That they're looking at as they're going into a manufacturing cycle  And at some point they they do the cost benefit on each of the different possibilities and maybe that one they  There are technologies where they're on the fence where either we put the really really good one  At a higher risk into the current model or we keep perfecting it and put it in the next model  And lots of people are involved in that  Process and so a lot of these leaks come from component suppliers and others who are  Who think maybe their part is going to go in and then they're informed by apple  No, your part's going to go in some later phone or maybe it won't go in on later phone  And that from their perspective apple has made a decision  to  Step back the quality  Whereas with apple I I don't you know it you see what i'm saying. It's it's a gray area  No, no, this is what we always plan to do we were thinking of something better we decided

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the point is that at the announcement apple said  There is one in a million chance of a random person unlocking your iphone with face id and they say we stand by that number  It is just as accurate in that respect  so  Yeah, that's part of the accuracy but there's other things having to do with accuracy does it recognize you twice in a row?  Does it recognize you if you were wearing glasses does it there may be other areas that apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That the spec has changed and they could change something like the algorithm  And that that governs this sort of act they could change the model they could do all that and as long as it fits what they said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right all their claims exactly right all they're claiming is we it continues to be a one in a million  So that that's what they're saying hasn't changed, but there are many other parameters that might have changed  So i'm not sure I think they in other words, they could both be right as you point out  Uh mike, it's just uh, it's it's a little bit of a semantic parsing

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know apple's very good at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as you have pointed out so I think really the  For the consumer the real issue is going to be how fast it is how convenient it is  Not whether there's one in a million chance somebody could duplicate my face because we're very happy with touch id  Which apple itself says is one in ten thousand, right?  That's not nobody said oh i'm not gonna use touch id. You uh, somebody might spoof it  What we look for is reliability so it works every time it works fast  Uh, it works even if my finger is not right or my face isn't right  Those are the things that consumers really care about and so i'm not sure those aren't the things that apple cares about what apple cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About is this this an emoji thing is part of the face recognition  Process an emoji is where it looks at your face and then it animates the facial expressions of a an avatar  As you're chatting and that sort of thing  We're right on the brink and this isn't just an apple thing. This is going to be in all the android phones  We're right on the brink of emotion detection and monitoring all the time  So everything you do with your phone the phone will be watching your face and gauging. Are you happy?  Are you sad? Are you thrilled? Are you bored? Are what's going on with your and this is going to be the new privacy thing  So right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually about cookies and so that's really what apple's caring about is  So how much data can I get out of your facial features?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there I I talked to a free scale engineer and you could tell how long ago it was because they were still free scale  And not an xp and now not possibly qualcomm, but they were already doing this kind of emotion detection using  um  Face recognition there and so they weren't doing on handsets yet  The goal was to put it on handsets and that was always the goal and so imagine if mark zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had the data as you're looking at the facebook timeline. Oh, she looks bored quick  Facebook feed in some kiddies  Imagine I mean, but that's the data facebook would kill to get right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and and facebook has the best face recognition technology is better than the fbi's  And so that's a it's a short road from that to to emotion detection

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so best they have the best for recognizing a person  Um in all like all around them. So yes, not just their face, right?  Not just but but it's also context related so it's in the context of other photos and that sort of thing the the best context

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aware solution that i've seen actually belongs to a company that was seeded  By the cia they're one of the cia startups  And they've made a software solution that can do not just facial recognition, but body language recognition  And they they built that for obvious reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, but google has gate recognition. That's another way to authenticate you is well you walk like you  Uh, what was the video i'm trying to remember? Uh, maybe it was you who was talking about it stacy  It was at a self-driving car event. They had people in the self-driving car  Mock-up and they were looking at their moods and their feelings as they were driving to try to figure out what to play  In the self-driving car because you're going to be kind of bored  You're sitting in this box for five hours. You don't have anything to do on a long road trip and they were actually doing emotion  and uh  feelings  Testing to see what?  So we clearly we can we can already do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not like there's no question about you got to remember when you when you do the uh,  The setup for the face id on the iphone 10  You do this  So you get all the different angles. It's not just straight on left right  They they take all angles so they should be able to recognize you even if your phone's not dead on right and I  I i've heard  That it's it's actually quite accurate. Uh, it but that also depends on lighting. Uh, so if you've got decent lighting  It's almost 100 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mood sensing. Yes. Yeah  so, uh, but really more to the quotidian concerns of uh,  Audience  Should you worry about an iphone 10 or a pixel 2 xl? Should you hold off on ordering?  It sounds like maybe it would be prudent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To stick with what you got. You're happy with the pixel 2 so until the ticking which i'm hopeful will be they'll fix it  So I I love this phone. Yeah, I really like it. It's very fast. It's got great pictures. It's  Oh  I like always on don't you like always on I do that's i'm like i'm sneaking glances at it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, and you see the oleds have always been able to do that  So I think motorella x was the first to do it robert how do they do it on an lcd though like this?  I mean, isn't that  Are they turning the whole screen black with white text? How are they?  So that's a lot more power hungry than it would be on an oled where they just turn on those individual pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, also the uh the screen on the pixel 2 I believe they can do segmented backlighting. Ah, okay, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see how much power it's consuming

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, that's another issue by the way and lisa's really noticed this the iphone 8 a lot of people are complaining  Especially with ios 11 has terrible battery life. I haven't had that problem at all in my 8 plus  But so maybe specific iphones but a number of people are saying there's battery issues with the iphone 8  So the overall story may be here that at this point in late stage smartphone technology  Companies are now pushing so hard to get a differentiator to get an improvement to somehow make this new phone  Better than last year's slab of glass that they're maybe pushing too hard didn't samsung do that last year with the note 7 they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It exploded in flight. I mean before before the explodey things the note 7 was an amazing phone  I remember seeing it at ifa before they released it and I love the note 7 and I have to say I love the note 8

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as much. This is a great phone. My parents charged theirs in pyrex baking dishes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they did not want to turn it in they were like it took it took verizon like threatening to turn the phones off  They got my mom off the the note 7 but here's the thing the note 7 the note 8 the iphone 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the the pixel 2  There's thousand dollar phones  And this is not a thousand dollar. Well, right, right, but I mean 650. I yes  Yeah, i'm i'm more of the range of a three to five hundred dollar phone guy and my my five hundred dollar phone is fantastic  What do you use right now? I'm on a one plus five  I just I just moved from a one plus one to a one plus you like an essential phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna say do you want an essential because the price cut makes it kind of attractive i'll give him mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love it. Okay, it's yours. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got an essential phone and I got the 360 camera on this  This this I feel I you know what this actually kind of makes me sad  Uh, andy reuben who found and created android solo to google left google after working on robotics for a while  And as well as android to start his company. It's going to be a home. We've talked about this before you're gonna  I'm sure be reporting on their whatever home automation solution kevin just bought an essential phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the first thing I asked him was look for any secrets to the home stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there is any it's just a kind of stock android phone and actually I really like it ceramic and titanium  The when I got I did not do a pre-pro model and a lot of people who did got bit by bad cameras  But I don't know if you remember when I opened up my phone and I started taking pictures it crashed to me the camera  Crashed and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hard reset not even when you were taking a picture when you opened the app it crashed. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It crashed the phone the phone reset so but since then there've been two or three maybe four  Updates to the camera at least three that I noticed updates to the camera and it's fine now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we had such high hopes for the essential it looked good. You don't get a second chance though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the point is in this market. It's so competitive if you come out and you look bad  So they're dropping it what by 200 bucks 200 bucks, but if you spend 800 on anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You unless it's a house. I mean  Our houses break cars break well an $800 car I expected to break but  An $800 device by golly that better be a really good device when you get a new car often

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's defects you don't you expect them to fix them. I don't buy the first model year of any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it was the $300 essential phone, I would be willing to put up with bugs at an $800 price point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It better be a finished product. Well, you're gonna enjoy this free essential phone. I really  See isn't it amazing?  No, I like it because a little smaller right? Yeah, it's a big screen because it's edge to edge. It is beautiful  I think it's a gorgeous phone  You know, there's the problem is nobody's gonna make a case for it  Um, you know because there's no ecosystem they sold 5 000 at sprint and but I think it's a very very nice phone  And I have had zero problems once those camera updates came out  And it has a nice black and white monochrome mode in the camera that I think is quite good  I think it's I mean it's look it'll be pretentious mode. Yeah the pretentious mode  It'll be the best  What is it if it's 200 less it'll be 600 bucks something like that I think it's I I can't remember the exact might be 500  It'll be I would say it'll be it's the best 500. It's right up there with a flagship phone  So people should not hesitate to buy it for 500. I think but but meanwhile, there's another thread of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interest that's starting to emerge  And just to throw a wet blanket on this whole conversation  Uh when smartphones were new they were solving problems left and right they the app stores enables to carry all these things  We don't have to buy different devices. We don't have to buy a radio  We don't have to buy this don't have to buy that because they were all apps. There's an app for that  They had all the stuff they're solving our problems  Now we're spending more and more money on smartphones and what problems are they solving what problems for example?  Does the new pixels solve that the old pixel?  uh  Gave you as a as a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, my old picture broke  This works that problem perfectly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But meanwhile the smartphones themselves are causing problems. What are our real problems?  Our real problems is work-life balance. Our real problems are we're too distracted from our smartphones  We're addicted to social media people are getting dumber  Students are the grades are plummeting because they're using their smartphones and they can't help themselves from using their smartphones in class during lectures  um, there's a new study that came out today that said  20 of babies under the age of one in tokyo  Are using smartphones daily  Under the age of one, what are they doing with them?  Their mothers are showing them videos to keep them quiet and stuff like that. Anyway, so we  There's a there's a growing problem around smartphones and I would like to see google  and apple  And other companies start to solve the problem. So andy okay two things because jeff isn't here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna say techno panic and then i'm also going to say  andy rubin  With the essential phone is actually trying to solve that he wants you to keep  The phone in your pocket and to have contextual computing that is aware and gives you what you need when you need it  He doesn't have a watch. What does he use for that? That's the home side of it. That's what he's trying to do there  And I think I might want my essential phone back. Okay, I think there are things that are happening  It's just it's gonna take a while because we're gonna have to build an entire new user interface  The big ecosystems are like I want to get in this ecosystem and they're trying to like lock everybody out  Which makes it hard for users to use the services they want  But we're we're getting there  And I don't I I think there's so much that phones do that is really good for kids and people  That I I don't want you to be like, ah smartphones are terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think asking tech companies to respond to the cultural dislocations their technologies are  Creating is like asking a butcher shop to put a sign up promoting veganism

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it's they will it's no but they will at some point they will have to at some point because essentially there's this arms race  Uh between the social media companies between the app creators between youtube and all these other companies and the smartphone users themselves  makers themselves  To get more and more addictive and distracting for example  One of the great greatest features of of stacy's phone is the always on though  One is always sort of like you and she said I want to look at it even more than I did before  She's made it face down so she doesn't yeah, that's what but this is the  We are no match for this. Is that their job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's their job. Look we have we have a archive at the school that I live at  And there are articles that I just pulled up what like a month ago  From people who were complaining about this new technology and what it was doing to the society to society in san francisco  The new technology was the cable car  And they were saying people are no longer walking. They're not talking to their neighbors. They're on this cable  So I mean you can go down the line of human advancement and they always say the same thing. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. And of course we have abandoned the cable car haven't we?  But but I mean look at look at megan's uh, uh digital cleanses and lots of people are doing digital  We have to respond to it where they're stopping  Yeah, and and so there's going to be more and more of that where people are there. There are actually some startups that are creating  There's the light phone. For example, there are other phones that are creating solutions  well, yes, they are but the the the  This tiny little these tiny little movements of obscure people on the fringe  That grow into mainstream movements eventually and I think that  I think that's inevitably going to happen at some point because at some point and people are walking into traffic and doing this kind of stuff  Mike could you could you go back to a feature phone?  Um, i've i've considered it seriously in fact, in fact, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The funny thing is a feature phone wouldn't do anything for me because I never use the phone right me neither  All I want is the other features

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The end of the show and mike's tool at the end of the show, okay  I'm going to tell you about the perfect phone  Okay  It's an android phone and it's the greatest phone  It's the phone that everybody should get and it solves all these problems. Stay tuned boys and girls

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so I don't think this is a problem because I think if you have like I look at my phone and always on and i'm  Excited because I can see what time it is, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really love that's the main tool, right? You can't really see the notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and if you cultivate and maybe it's just my  Contrarian introverted personality, but I mean I don't  I don't let it rule my life and I  I try to be very conscious about things like if i'm like, oh am I really enjoying reading the entire internet after dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but but so part of the part of the problem here is that we're all we all do this for a living  We we get distracted by our smartphones for a living all of us  Well, I've carefully cultivated my life for so that that would be the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are all kinds of studies that for example one of the most dramatic studies found that if your phone is just sitting on the table  For Sherry Turkle, we you know, we interviewed  I love Sherry Turkle, yeah, she's great  And she talked about his her conversation reclaiming conversation or her book reclaiming conversation. She talked about how  Conversations are more superficial if there are smartphones on the table and there's a similar thing in terms of iq tests  If you put a tape if you put a phone on the desk and take get an iq test  You're like five iq points dumber than if the phone is taken out of the room  Than if the phone is taken out of the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am dumber if like i'm trying to do something and there's anything that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exciting that's a very good point a chocolate muffin would do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something more though and i'm going to take mike's side on this because at the school I live at  I I say masses for the student body and so we'll have 1500 students in in the chapel or in the auditorium  And it's funny because they have to leave all of their electronic devices in their bags in the classrooms  Because you know what they'd be doing otherwise and you see them do this they keep yeah. Yeah, it's it's it's unconscious  They're reaching for the device that's not there and that if I can agree with stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly like a chocolate muffin  The difference is that the food industry has recognized that we have a massive health crisis and that one third of the population is now  Obese because of chocolate muffins and they're now producing solutions  All kinds of diet things and only to preserve their business, right?  So we spend money on the smartphones. They'll have to do that  It needs to do exactly the same thing for exactly the same reason their product is addictive and it's getting more so there's a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a difference the food industry can say that because they realized all of the that luxury food is a luxury  I will pay so much for the tech industry can make a good case for saying everything we sell  Can increase your productivity pretend you're pablo eskobar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, pablo your cocaine. It's far too enjoyable. It's far too addicting. You're gonna have some problems up here in the united states  Can we just ask you to make it a little weaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kill him  Studies are showing that the productivity is declining in terms of personal productivity  The not the amount of time people spend that people now only work less than like two hours and 20 minutes a day  And the amount of time they spend on social media and their computers is actually more now than the time they work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of our productivity is crashing. Mike you need to come back from georgia. You're turning into something weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you're all like talking to people. I bet you smile at strangers. I'm just an early indicator

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all going to be talking about this within over the next  Year or two or three years because it's it's it's becoming a growing problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think about this and I I train my daughter like a she's 11 and she actually doesn't have her own smartphone  and  she talks to  The echo I want madam a or google in our house to do a lot of things  So she's not even encountering the phone in ways and the rest of the time  she's actually on her laptop chatting with her friends on google hangouts and so  I obviously can't keep this up forever  but  We're also spending a lot of time talking to her about what it means to not be able to get off social media  And she like told me the other day. She's like, I think i'm watching too much youtube. I was like well  She's aware of the fact that she's aware of that is amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we watch a video a quick one I put it in the rundown near the bottom  It's a it's a psa from funny or die  Okay  Uh carsten if you have that I can pull it up too first anything  Yeah, this is a perfect uh along the lines of what stacy's talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going back and forth with my daughter about there was something when she was a kid called neopets  And uh, there was a great article about neopets  In which it talked about how a young woman who is now a professional computer programmer learned to code  in neopets  Because it was like myspace a little bit  And you had you could create a store and she she you know, they talked about her dad. She said um, hey dad  I when she was 11, I need to buy a domain name  And he said can I use your credit card and he said yeah  I bet she doesn't know how to do it. In fact, she did she bought a domain name for a neopets store  I sent it to abby abby said oh, yeah, I learned css and html when I was 12  Playing this game, which as parents we might have said, oh you're spending way too much time with this artificial  animal, um, I I think the  Every generation is going to have some issues as you said  There's a long rich history of us old folks saying oh it's gonna ruin your eyes. You watch the tv  You're gonna read books you're never going outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a rich history of us correcting it as well  I mean we we got to the point where we my generation watched way too much tv ate too much of this  Oreo flavored fruit loops, but absolutely but but there's but people are trying, you know  There's there's a whole industry of trying to get people off tv. And anyway, so where did you write this?  Where did you put this? It was near the bottom. It's a it's a psa. All right, I think carstens found it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. All right. Here's a public service announcement from  Funny or die, I should tell you something about that  No, he doesn't have it  He doesn't have he has it. He doesn't have it. Preston really doesn't want to play this. I have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be sitting down together. You can tell me something they did today. Um, I drew a horsey good for you son

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's looking at his phone. Obviously. I started smoking. I love you, too, sweetheart

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's will farrell out of our minivan. I got a tramp stamp. I'm getting implants. I'm dating your brother. Uh-huh  I'm cooking meth in the basement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great idea kiddo. That's why you're so popular at school

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Device free dinner hashtag common sense.org. That's awesome. Will farrell on his phone looks like by the way  That was a note eight. I'm just saying and I don't blame him because that's a gorgeous display  I don't know if you noticed that but I will say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my house, so I live with 12 other priests or 12 other jesuits  um  I am the one who never has his device at dinner  And some of the oldest priests are the ones who do so it's not a generational thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we don't we actually have done device free dinners because  We're weird that way, but so i'm like but we talk to the amazon echo so we won't we  So it's device ish free. So like  Madame a has a seat at the table essentially at our house because we're like we'll sit there and we'll be arguing about something and then suddenly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really use your echo that's really so your echo is the referee basically basically like yeah, or when did this happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or my daughter will come home and she'll be like  Oh, I just learned this and i'm like no way. There are not nine continents and she's like  That's what they're telling me. So then we you know in a very brilliant move. Google actually announced something like 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  new, uh google home or google assistant plugins, uh,  I don't know what google calls them for uh for kids for children. I'm excited about those. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My daughter and I we play okay  Again, if you have a tween would you rather on the echo we play that like non-stop?  My daughter loves it. It's like would you rather you know?  Do i'm trying to be guinness paltrow or robert de niro. This is a terrible example  And you pick one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or after uh, uh, what's his name harvey weinstein?  Um for all we know he hit on robert de niro, too. You just don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so we we play these games all the time and she she like loves it  so I think it's smart for google to get in on all of this because  This is not a device. It's it's less addictive. It's a little bit more fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's that's a strategy  This is not oh my gosh, all this technology is destroying us  It's we swing one way in the pendulum and then we swing back and people will realize no  I need to balance because if I don't balance my life a little bit i'm not going to make it to 50  And and that's that's generally if you look at the history of technology  It's not that we get rid of the technology that caused the imbalance in the first place  It's we figure out how to actually adapt it into our life and make it a healthy thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's where we are right now. Yeah, and I think I think voice interfaces are way healthier way healthier because it's so screens  That's the digital crack that and if you and it's also bad for your eyes to look at screens for 18 hours a day  So if you're talking to a computer it's like another person in the room and it's much more natural  And your brain doesn't have to like completely focus all of its attention on the device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or if you have to look at screens for 18 hours a day, you could get some felix gray glasses  How do you think I look at there you go? Hey, what a what a segue. I look  Hey, why don't you try some felix grays on just see if you can see the difference  It's gonna let stacy try some would you like to try some felix grays as well? Of course sore head. Here you go felix gray  No matter what you do for work if you're staring at your phone or your computer or a screen a lot  As mike has look you look good. Oh, these are yeah. Look at that. These are a little big for my face  Oh, you want trade because these are a little small for my face. I think that I think the same  Yeah, those are too small for your face  Those look good on you robert. You look like an intellectual priest  I feel like that's the same thing trade trade trade. Those are for stacy. These are the small ones here  Oh, okay, they give me the wide ones because I have a giant massive head  All right, that's good on you. Okay, what do you think? Those are perfect for you leo?  This is my size and let's see robert  Yeah, no robert. Yeah. No, come on. Come on robert  You can tell he's a teacher. Oh, yeah  So these are more than just good looking glasses, although they are italian made they're very nice  Frames italian acetate same stuff for sachet uses and all of that. These are you know, nice, uh, nice horn rim  uh style but  They're much more than just what they look like because if you're looking at a screen all the time  You know that dries your eyes out you get headaches you get migraines you get blurry vision  This is the what you need to wear. These are specially designed for people looking at screens. They filter blue light  And by the way, it's not some coating on the glasses that filters the light. You'll see that sometimes  That that makes them look strange to other people out there. It looks like you're wearing yellow glasses. These look completely clear  That's built into the optics of the lens itself. They eliminate glare  Uh, there's no there's no telltale yellow tint or color distortion  They look great on you. They fit great. There's all sorts of kind this one  Uh, you might want to try this one. What model is this? I really like it. This is um  The jemisin  Oh, that's named after an astronaut the jemisin jemisin  She's amazing c5 so isn't that cool mine's named after an astronaut  They're available both in space non-prescription and reading lenses. In fact, I would suggest I do this  I wear reading and they have they have readers from point from 1.0 to 2.5  But I would suggest even if you don't use readers, even if you're young  To add a little a tiny bit like a quarter diopter magnification 0.25 plus  And that helps it makes the screen easier to read  I find it really reduces eye strain all orders include free shipping and free return  So you've got nothing to lose except that annoying eye strain  Give your glasses. I mean your eyes the break they deserve go to felix gray  glasses dot com  f e l i x g r a y  glasses dot com slash twig  And try a pair of felix gray computer glasses  They're smarter way you look smarter, but you also  I'm telling you by the end of the day I and I don't wear glasses because of the reflection from the camera  But you know, I might start doing this because it really makes a very very big difference and they're anti-glare. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see any reflection leo. Yeah, I can probably wear these huh? Yeah, maybe I'll look at mine  I have a terrible reflection with that's why I stopped wearing glasses on tv. Yeah, because you can't because you get that blue from the

I don't have here  That is a it's not a full amazon echo  There won't do everything a standalone echo will do but of course it integrates into your sonos  It sounds better than this. I think even though it's a it's like a play one sonos. It sounds better than this  It sounds really pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we shouldn't buy this is what i'm hearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You brought another toy too. Do you want to save that for your pick or do you want to show it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we could show it now. Why not? So you actually took a look at this on tech guy a few weeks back  This is anchor's new nebula

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anchor we all know a chinese company and they've and we actually really like them for aftermarket accessories like batteries  Uh, but this is the first time they've done like a real product, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a collaboration with another company that they wanted to take their battery tech. So this is entirely portable  They're touting this as a theater quality portable battery powered projector  And it's actually really good. It's android powered  So and it will you can stream directly from the unit, you know  Just opening up the little lens is going to start it up. So this yeah, i'll just pass this over to you  Now there's a couple of things I really like about this. The first is the fan is on it's on. Yeah  Oh, yeah, it's warming up. Um, one of the things oh, yeah, you may not want to look directly into the lens  Um, that's going to be kind of bright. Oh look those glasses  This this will do its auto skew and auto tilt  One of the hardest things to do with a projector is get it to match, right?  It actually detects its angle and it will automatically fix the picture. Oh, no  That's pretty cool. I need that on tables at restaurants

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, this is getting kind of creepy it's apple face recognition phase two here you need a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you need a this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, give me a thing  Let's project it on this thing. Yeah. Now I I just got this yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I I want to do things like you know, take it out in the middle of a field because  The it's actually very very bright way bright. This is not definitely not a pico projector  This is more like a home theater projector. It's a little expensive. It's 600 dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually adjusting the focus. I probably shouldn't be doing what i'm doing. Oh, no, that's that's the thing  Yeah, it'll autofocus it will auto skew right back back there. Yeah, maybe we can get it back on  Yeah, see there we go. How long is the battery life on that? Uh, that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's going to depend on the brightness and how you use the features for it has built-in wi-fi  So you could just do use this as a standalone and play say netflix corgi videos or corgi videos a lot of corgi videos  Did you know he loves corgi videos? Oh, I love corgi videos. We've got the twitters. Uh-oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's even though it's a decent size unit. I can't see this lasting for more than three hours on a battery  If you're using heavy, so there's a big battery, you know, that's probably a 15 000 milliamp

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it won't get you through all of the lord of the rings trilogy, but it would get you through one precisely more than enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I I gotta say just in like the two or three hours that i've been playing with this thing  I'm impressed. The android integration is really well done. It's not just android slapped onto a projector. It actually it works  Of the uh, the controls are intuitive. The quality is really really good  even if you're you're projecting on a non-projection service a surface and one of the other cool things about this is  the fact that um, you know, they want this to be a portable unit and  And it's actually really durable one of the things i'm always concerned about when i'm carrying a projector is one good bump  And you've destroyed the optics this thing. I already dropped it off the table. I wouldn't do it again  But it's still working. Sorry anchor your review and it's gonna have a thing. Yeah. Yeah  So yeah 600 bucks not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally need that. Uh, we we we don't uh,  Have a tv because we're always traveling we watch all over tv movies on a laptop. That'll do it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Seriously, uh the other night I did um, what was it a?  25 foot wall at in our gym and it really looked great  Really? Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hdmi, do you know what the native specs are for the video? It does 1080 so it'll do full hd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'll actually take 4k, but I think the sensor is only 1080. Um,  Unlike see this is this is how I know a company isn't used to having a lot of complicated products  Anchor didn't send out like the reviewer sheet the spec sheet the spec sheet  They just assumed that you'd go get it which is like I kind of find that refreshing  They didn't have a pr person. They they literally sent me the unit  They said we'd like to know what you think about it wants to join our wi-fi. Yeah, I know right. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I have because that is android so in effect you can use its own user interface  Yeah, you don't need to connect this does it have a remote control it does so you could stream netflix on this directly from it  Correct. Wow  That's kind of neat. That's really kind of neat. It's very well made. I saw the prototype of this at ces  Roland is saying in our chairman 1280 by 800. So it's a 720p d lp in here. That's it. 3000 lumens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot for something this small. If someone came up to you, you could be like get out the light

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of does look like the town crier light type thing. Yeah, all's well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  10 o'clock  Time to go with bed with your sheep

Transcript:  Just fyi. All right. Uh, let's see. Um  Google is apparently having a trouble getting the  white pixel twos out  They are pushing out. They're they're offering they're pushing back some of the orders  And offering a free live case is a compensation. Hey  So you're lucky you got yours that's nice I I thought I didn't even ask  That's beautiful. That's but you didn't get the panda one. So you don't have the orange

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's only in the ad. It was only on excel the excel and i'm very sad because I love orange like nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I ordered, but it won't be for weeks that I get it. So  There's still something I kind of like white and by the way, this is a metal back  But they've done a soft touch paint on it, which I think is quite nice. It was very fancy  You like that color I think you're happy with it you don't ever see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't ever see I didn't care like I actually wanted the blue one. I've never felt the squeeze thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually I like it works. It's very cool. It's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there are little some delays on the one you got but you got it  Several people who bought the pixel two with an october ship date only have to  Only to have that date slipped to november  Are being offered a case as compensation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dang and I paid 40 bucks for mine the case of the missing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google phone did you get the buds the pods the google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you get the bugs? I was like, yes, I told you about the ticking  Um, I did get the google bugs the google pods bro pods. No, what are they? They're pixel pixel pods pixel buds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pixel buds the p buds pixel bros. I keep thinking of marijuana. So i'm like no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, but you are in california pixel buds, but  I I needed actually a decent pair of bluetooth heads headphones that are not like crazy expensive compare with it  well also just because I don't have any and  I keep i've only had this for like three days and I keep misplacing my dongle everywhere. I'm just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dongle is not a good solution. It looks so stupid your phone has this tail

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way  I'm sure that the the the handful of case makers that decided to make cases for this phone are thrilled

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The google's handing them out. Yeah. Oh, yeah pick one up today for free  Um, we have a couple of bluetooth  Um, all right, sorry i'm just logging into my um last pass  Yeah, so I can get into amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most secure broadcaster on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am did you turn on uh the app advanced protection for your google account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turned it on for a account not for my account because I found it incredibly annoying. It's it's pretty uh intrusive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The showstopper for me was it doesn't work  with uh  Linux and I a lot of my machines are linux. Let me show you the bluetooth  That we like and I think you would like this is from j lab  The audio epic 2 and it's not too expensive. Well, it's 100 bucks. That's not cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, because I lose my headphone like i'm a i'm a 50 headset headphone kind of person there are bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's good bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find another most of my headsets come from the plane the ones that they hand out you keep those  I keep i'm kind of cheap, but advanced protection by the way  This this is the little fob that google's got a dongle. Yeah, right. So this combined with a ubico key  That's what you need so that you can be on your laptop your desktop your mobile device. That's tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is a little well, you don't need them both at any given time  either use one for the use the uh ubiqui or  I need two final utf devices one. That's a usb and one that's bluetooth  and so I I have it too and I turned it on and then I turned it off because  You also have to use chrome. Yep doesn't work with linux  Although I suspect they'll fix that and one other issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I don't normally associate turning on bluetooth with adding security to a device. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All it's I think this all right. It's sending it's sending uh a one-time only code

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From that little digipass. All right. Well, i'm not worried about them intercepting this communications  I mean if you turn on the bluetooth device again, yeah  That's not great. It's like what can I lost my ubiqui?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay in there no, I have it with me I carry it around and all this is the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on i'm logging into leo's account right now. I am leo laporte. I usually have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  handcuffed  Via this chain. It's not a purse. It's european. It's a european carry-all. It's a man bag  Um, well and if you lose it  Which I may have done  Getting into your account there is a manual process as there always has been but it's in more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more astringent than it was before you have to spit into a tube so it can check your dna against 23

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will you turn on the super secret authentication on your google account? Oh god. No. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, also I should point out if you turn off turn on two-factor on your google account you get many of the same benefits  Uh, the the the most secure thing it does is the most  Inconveniencing thing which is it doesn't allow third-party apps to use your google account. So all of your  You're using an android device  But if you use an iphone none of apple mail won't work apple calendar won't work  Apple contacts won't work on your iphone. You have to use all google stuff, right?  and uh  For some people that would be a showstopper as well  But that's what and one that's probably the main reason it's more secure  Is that no no malicious third-party app or chrome extension can hook into your google account  You know, they have to they have to you know get past this as well  So it's in that respect if you know who it's for john podesta at the democratic national committee

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why they created this if you if you never leave your house, you're much safer. Yeah, which is kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we we talked about this with steve gibson and the whole idea is if if you enable great protection and great security and yet  It's incredibly convenient. It's not really great security. It's the rapunzel problem. It's yeah exactly. It's security theater  I'm not looking in his pocket. This is inconvenient enough  Where it actually does add security in in order to add security. I'm sorry folks, but you're gonna have to add inconvenience  That's just how that works

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is why they don't let me in the studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The wasco digipass which is similar what you have as a bluetooth you need the bluetooth because iphones don't have uh, any usb connector  so you need that  For bluetooth devices it works with phones and stuff too. You have surprisingly few fobs on your key

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like i've got a fob for my car. I've got it for getting into my daughter's school. I've got fobs for like the gym

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have more if I had one of those i'm like I have on the other end of that chain  I have a lot more fobs. Yeah, I have a ton of fobs. This is like the must-have stuff  anyway  life of  Somebody sent me this silicone case for the tesla key must have sent you one too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we bought ours because my husband the leather case was just too big. Yeah, it's like too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so and transform and the tesla key assumes that you know what it does because it looks like the car  So they don't have any legend on it. This has a legend on it. This was a listener who says thanks to you  I can now make tesla silicone tesla fobs  covers  And I do have a tracker on that by the way  Just letting you know it's also in the car. I got a tracker pixel on it. Yeah. Oh, that's right  You can't steal a tesla. Yeah, you can for a couple minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no there actually was a big thieving ring in europe where they would actually disable the gps  And then pop them on trucks and then sell them for parts basically rip out the gps  I don't know if it was ripping out or if they use it. We're using a um, don't tell me about this  What are those things called that they put movie theaters?  jammers, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you could do that. You could just wrap the gps unit in mylar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true  I used to live in a faraday cage and it was awesome. You guys lead you  I it was my house. It was stuck not intentionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, so you had you had one of those houses that had like a mesh  It was chicken wire basically in the walls and yes, that's great for wi-fi by the way. It was it was a fun  Do you guys remember orson bean?  Did he write a bunch of science fiction novels? You don't remember him. No, that's where scott carter. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, he was a regular on that to tell the truth. It's a different orson bean. What is to tell the truth? Nope  No, not that orson bean  You don't want me to show organ organ boxes  He was really into the into this kind of crank concept developed by willhelm reich in the 30s called the organ  Energy accumulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think they may be coming back. Oh, you can actually buy these so telco companies. There's a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't do the same thing  That the organ box was it was seen as a massless organ was a massless omnipresent substance like luminosity  for your whole body

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they so they're octo. I think is it octo cages?  So if you go into like any so any telco test lab, right or wi-fi they have to have them  Yeah, it's an anechoic chamber for rf. Now they make them small though, which is super fun  so you could actually buy when they're still like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $30,000 but i'm surprised no one has offered one of these as a super super wealthy luxury item

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean they make hyperbaric chambers, right? So you do that so you the emf people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can you sleep emf free completely emf. Well, ironically the fda banned the orgo box  There's probably a good reason. Well, yeah, because it's you're living in a box. Well, no, it's harmless

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just spend an hour a day in that it's not like that was that was like a therapeutic thing  Yeah, well, that's why the fda but i'm telling you this is this is basically a faraday cage, right?  I mean, it's a little more than you need but it does the job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you could do it with just mesh you can actually see through. Yeah faraday cage is just copper mesh. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Established electrical wine, right? That's what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that that was a problem in hawaii. They kept stealing the copper.

Oh, it's like marking it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? So so were they so radioactive that you would be if you lived in the house would you want a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it just it just means they wouldn't recycle it because if they if they drop that into their vats  The it would irradiate whatever else is in there and it make it all be like a granite countertop. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know my my favorite story about the whole amazon headquarter search is what san jose did they did a study and they said look  It's not going to pay off don't do it. Don't come here. They decided we're not going to do this because  50 000 jobs sounds very tempting until you look at the cost of the 50 000 jobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there were some there were some reverse psychology  What was the town karsten that did the amazon reverse psychology like amazon? We decided don't come here  We we've showed it on the new screensavers on saturday  um  Raleigh was it raleigh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1 000 products purchased and reviewed every review  A reason for amazon to move to kansas city  Tell amazon so I guess the idea is telling the citizens citizens sly james the mayor of kansas city  I mean, that's nice, but come on amazon's gonna know he wrote a thousand reviews  He wrote a thousand reviews  In each review had a line promoting kansas city like I live in beautiful kansas city where the average home price is just  122 000

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now he's banned for life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could buy a thousand reviews for about a dollar 25 each just fyi

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the mayor really cares. He really does hey in case he got google fiber. So well unless it's kansas city  If it's kansas city, missouri  Not kansas city kansas kansas city kansas kansas city kansas

Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually really fast we have a house there that got google fiber  They weren't gonna get it until I kept telling them do it just pay the fee  So that is a jezu party house. That is a jezu party house. You got crazy super faster internet super super  I put a server there just so I could hit it when I need to here. This is frisco, texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know that's nearby right? No, no, isn't that uh, it's like just outside of outside of dallas this you can call frisco  Oh, I don't know. Just don't call san francisco frisco. Well, I thought that's what's when I first saw it. I don't know why it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well their internet speed is not super fast. Yes, that's exactly why you shouldn't go there  Yeah, no kidding. Um austin is in the running and  Except for our transportation woes would be a good place. I I actually I really hope that's you're sorry  You said no to lifting uber now. We got them back because our state legislature decided that local  Governments can't make your own rules overruled

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep it weird austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a very nasty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, oh we're talking about reaper. I was gonna use the amazon segue to talk about the amazon key

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead amazon key and then we'll talk about reaper. Okay, boy. You're really you can read my mind. That's good amazon key

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so amazon key is  this smart security camera plus  A connected lock which I I love connected locks for me. They're quickset or yell and this idea so much amazon basically you can let  People amazon delivery people or amazon service providers that contract through amazon into your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if you're not there they can get in there's a special like lock that they have a key to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually not a special. I mean, it's not super special. It's a yale or quickset. Oh, it's one of them bluetooth  I think it's actually gonna be a zigbee lock because it looks like a nest cam, but it's not is it?  No, all cameras kind of have that look. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that way you can monitor them what they're doing when they come in your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's to give you that peace of mind like oh there's amazon person coming in and dropping off a package. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the the mail us mail has a similar system a two key system where uh  They do yeah, but not into your house  They do the big mailbox the box at the end of the of the blog. Oh ours gets broken into all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well this one so if you've got a package  There's a larger box at the bottom of the mailbox palette and they put the key in your box  You put it in your package. Yeah, now this actually makes sense. Would you let people do this? I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, Ia have that lock so  Like it doesn't unfortunately fit on my front door, but it fits on my garage door. So I would do it in heartbeat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, but so usually it's a ups or fedex driver, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes us postal service and sometimes it's an amazon driver anymore. I have amazon drivers show up  You have actual labeled amazon drivers. Uh, their trucks usually aren't labeled, but they are amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They started up a new project the first in india, but it's now on the west coast of the united states called project seller flex  And this was a way to make the third party seller experience on amazon more like the amazon prime experience  What they're going to do is they're actually they're taking ups and fedex out of that part of the transit equation  Now people are speculating that this means that eventually they want to remove fedex and ups entirely which means they're going to have their own drivers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that is one of the caveats on this new amazon delivery service  You can only use amazon's own delivery team  So it may not be appropriate for me because I have never seen an amazon delivery team  250 you get the if you want the bundle that includes the smart lock the connected camera the installation even

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it includes installation. It says and free installation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, holy moly once you have the system in place in home delivery will now be an option every time you order something on amazon  with no additional charge  But uh, it's only available in 37 cities where amazon logistics handles the drop-off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why how big a problem is theft off of porches. I mean is that it's a big problem here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a huge problem for retailers. I I want to say they lose like four billion for things not actually arriving  But I could be making that number completely up. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have uh, we have drop cam as a sponsor  Of oh, sorry ring the ring video doorbell is a sponsor of the twit tv network and the one that I installed at my parents  house caught two  Two trucks stealing packages from the house across the way. Yeah, so were you able to where were they caught?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you use the video to prosecute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they the officers went down and they asked any of the residents if they had security cameras  And we had ours we gave it to them and they used it in the in the prosecution

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there you go. So they so that's that's what you need. You don't need people opening your door. You need uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess yeah, if it's amazon official amazon employees. I have a camera actually this all makes sense  But you have to live in one of those three seven cities you do obviously I think I might um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now my question is do I actually need the amazon camera?  Because I don't really need the camera because i'm fine with them just walking in with the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you do just because they need they want to control every part of the system. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to be sure that it was verified if they have control of your door lock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they need to be able to make sure someone's not spoofing a system through third-party hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you went to  Kfc's twitter account  And you noticed it's following only 11 people. It's got 1.24 million  Followers, but it's only following 11 people. Would you be?

There's five  spice girls and  The rest are named herb it's six guys named herb it's 11 herbs and spices  This I don't know how long that's been going on for uh, they joined twitter in july 2008  And it took us this long to figure that out. I would love to think that they did this from the beginning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's taken us all these years. That's like the best easter egg ever, right?  There's been some guy in their marketing department going come on. Come on  Just notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I just love that that is brilliant marketing and they're gonna get a lot of press worse as a result

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost as much as youtube putting the play button on the back of the world series. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey good news. Well, maybe bad news for some no more revenge porn on twitter. Uh, it's official

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter has it out. There's no good. There's no there's no bad news here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all good news except for twitter's promised these kinds of things before and not delivered  And that it's just very weird to see that they have a timeline  For this like starting  Well, let me let me get the timeline up for you. I don't know why my yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The announcement is that they will stop watching it not that they can actually stop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll no longer tolerate it. There it is  october 27th  Why that's soon tomorrow saturday no more non-consensual nudity it's out. It's got to stop no more  Uh, that means upskirt photos. That means hidden webcams. Nope. They'll be banned. What they not weren't banned before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this has been I mean this was an issue with I think it was the massachusetts legislature with upskirt photos  That was technically legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I must have been on the nicer side of twitter because i've seen some hateful things  But i've never seen revenge porn in my feed until I until was it ted cruise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't realize there was porn on twitter. I did so I had I thought that was automatically filtered

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ted educated us all I was like, I mean they they're saying that they're they're gonna ban, uh, uh,  People who condone or threaten violence  And does this count against the president threatening north korea or but I would say non-consensual pictures of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's probably okay that is yeah, that's compromising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Non-consensual organization so starting november 3rd, which is a week from uh tomorrow  Uh, no more advocating violence  Oh, but you have to be oh see that's the weasel words organizations or groups so individuals  You you're okay hate in the same time hated images hate symbols.

Mm-hmm. No more after next friday hateful display names. Oh, you got a few more weeks  That's november 22nd. Yeah, and uh, it won't be till december 14th just in time for christmas  That the content that glorifies or condones acts of violence that result in death or serious physical harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because then every movie studio is going to lose their twitter account, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not that they're not literally advocating  Duct violence and harm. It's just a movie. Wait that glorifies glorified  I mean come on every action. Oh, it does kind of glorify it, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well there again, this is the problem with everything twitter does it's always up to twitter  To decide what is what?  So you have to go to them and appeal to them and if you're not verified then you don't have laws are that's why we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  courts and I mean like  My my definition of things that are violent or offensive or different, I mean right community standards  This is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean look everyone at this table has had and and over skype has had some hurtful hurtful stuff aimed at them on twitter. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But somebody once said he thought my hair was a weird. I mean nobody please don't send me things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've only had people be nice to me on twitter. Really? I'm not i'm not kidding. I can send some of mine your way  No, no, I mean that i'm telling you that's a bad thing I know and please please kinahora

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean but the problem with with this I I applaud this they they need to move towards something like this  But I could see the spiraling out of control really really fast in july

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On july of 2013 twitter prepared to extend reporting abuse to all users couldn't do it before 2013  December 2014 twitter takes small steps to finally deal with this harassment problem. That's worked. Well  2015 in february of that year twitter ceo said we suck at dealing with abuse. Yes, that was dick costello  Uh, I don't know. Maybe that was jack coming in coming. No, I think it was still there. That was dick. It was march 2017  Twitter is finally rolling out. This is march a smart fix for its abuse problem  And finally october meaningful safety updates next month. This is axios pointing out that it ain't the first time  right  Well in okay, so I think you nailed it it's it it's hard to define what these things are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay  Some of them are not hard to define like some of the things that people are sent is really just reprehensible  So I feel in twitter has historically not taken care of those even

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you're famous now are okay in this group. Are there any bright line examples?  Someone puts a swastika  As their profile pic is that is that 100?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  100% you cannot mistake it. Is it a buddhist or a hindu symbol? Exactly. Well, no, no, it's it's it's the swastika

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not the reverse. Okay, it's it's the actual nazi swastika and let's say they put a couple of iron eagles and armbands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the legal system requires proof of intent right and that's how that's the hardest thing to define intent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, is this intended to be hateful? I don't know. Well, see that's why it can't just be an automatic system  They need to have people who actually look through the account. Yeah now if it's a profile pic plus  15 pages of this person saying horrible horrible things. All right. Yeah, that's done. But this is the real problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you ban that guy right? What happens next starts up another account. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only way to make twitter more civil is if there's skin in the game  If I can make another account in 10 seconds and be right back at it. How are you going to stop it unless yeah  I mean this is like okay. We start tying twitter accounts to something that can be tied to actual people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that is such a massive change  And and twitter is going to say no and what they point to is the arab spring  We talked about this on sunday and other times when twitter has been very effectively used by dissidents by activists to change  uh repressive governments to look at turkey and the  The protests in tari or square. These are all twitter claims twitter powered. I'm not sure that's true  But but they certainly twitter was part of it  And they're going to say we can't force people to use their real identities because that will suppress  But those people are probably not on twitter anymore. Well, my guess is that twitter wasn't really ever that important

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need pseudonymity. So all you need to do is that you need to verify who you are to twitter  And then once they know that you are you and then erdogan just says okay twitter put any public name you want  Who is this guy?  Yeah, but to the public you're you're anonymous you use a fake name to the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When twitter decides they want to be big in turkey or big in russia, they'll say oh is this guy bothering you here  Let me give you his account information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what you need is an organization there. There are also gray areas like uh, the palestine liberation front  Yeah, is that a hate group? Well to some it is to others. It's a freedom fighters  And who's going to decide that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many gray areas there's the example of threats of violence  A typical example you can you know in the old days somebody could say i'm going to kill you and then that was banned  So they said somebody should kill you right? Um, you know, what if somebody kills you like you there?  There's a whole spectrum of ways to threaten somebody and everybody gets a message. It's the same communication  using words that are  Increasingly difficult to ban. There's really no hard and fast black and white rule that you can establish

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't condone violence, but I I wouldn't weep for you if someone were to kill you at this rally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expressing an opinion. Well, and what's really uh significant is that this is happening in the white house. This is happening. That's yeah, and so uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the first lady said she was gonna attack take this on and i'm sure that's no more bullying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just be kind, okay, just be kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the only way that something like this works and you can extend this to facebook as well  Is if you had an organization that enough people trusted to keep them anonymous  Could do their verifying say yes, this this is a verified account

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then you've got they've got to have awesome security which means they're gonna have big company backing and they can't turn down government subpoenas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So suddenly, uh, you could if it was say a nation state like at the vatican were to start doing this  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we do we have anything to fear father robert now that they have how many catholic  Now that they have some special projects superior technological skills at their behest and command i'm just saying  So this is something actually that is serious and you should worry about we covered it on security now in great detail. It is  An iot botnet that is growing really rapidly already two million  Iot devices mostly routers have been compromised  They are the botnet is growing at a rate of 10 000 per day now  A botnet that had one-tenth the size the mirror eye botnet  Brought down on christmas day. You may remember the playstation network and xbox network  Uh was used and that took advantage of flaws in routers some of the same routers that we're seeing by the way  And this those routers in this in this new botnet iot devices like ip wireless cameras  Uh, just unpatched devices  Uh this this new one  Which we're calling reaper  Although checkpoint is uh is calling it. Uh iot troop  Uh, they say a new is going to get the headlines a new iot botnet storm is coming  It's recruiting iot devices at a far greater pace and with more potential damage than the mirai botnet of  And if you look at the attacking ip addresses this graph which is growing  Pretty much almost well, it's almost exponential straight line right now. This is since the 29th of september. This is in three weeks  How much this has grown it is uh growing really rapidly, but what we don't know is who created it  Who controls it?  And most importantly, what do they plan to do with it?  Uh, there's nothing more to say except  That's the facts jack was discovered by checkpoint security  uh, and uh, you know the the devices involved  Our cameras d-link routers a number of d-link routers a number of t-ping link routers and netgear routers  avtech micro tick  And link sys and we've seen many of these before your favorite the uh, sonality disk signology disk station manager

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's that's a nas that someone put on the internet. You're not supposed to do that  They they create a router the srm, right and that you can put on the internet so many of my sonologies on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh through your router  Yeah through my router. So you think that that as a result couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now this this was people because there is a function that you can add to a sonology nas to say be a router  That's a really bad idea. That's a horribly bad. Well people are doing it. Yeah, uh, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, um, can can we not call this an internet of things botnet because while these are routers are I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's unfair to call them. These are things on the internet. That's right. And I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, your old routers my god burn them in a fire you guy. Okay recycle them responsibly but  in a fire  They they really you've got to unplug them. You've got to update you've got to look for over-the-air updates  You've got to look for a company that actually does them and cares like for example  I'm gonna call you out links this because with crack  There I asked I was like, hey, what's up with my routers?  What are you guys doing? They're like we are aware of the problem and we are addressing it and I haven't heard boo since  and  I want to see way better way more rapid security from these companies  And that is that is going to stop this that is all well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then we also have the d-link lawsuit right now  And they've thrown out a lot of that half of that lawsuit has been tossed because you can't really show any damages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can show that the equipment is vulnerable. Is this the ftc one? This is the ftc one. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's that that kills me. It's like wait a minute  We need some leverage against these manufacturers that will release a product and then they won't update the firmware for five years

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well in what you need is damage  I mean the become and this is the problem with security up until now is it's all been an externality  So the people who pay for it I as a consumer spending my money on my router that is super cheap instead of super secure  I'm not paying for when it takes down, you know dying or  my netflix so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I I had a know-how  Segment planned for what lat late last year where I was going to show people how easy it was to scan a range  of comcast ip addresses  Figure out which ones were vulnerable and then get in and pivot and it was it was basically a point and click type thing  And I thought better i'm like this is too dangerous  But the fact that it's too dangerous also means I can't believe that this is still possible  These these are actively supported devices by comcast  And I can exploit them with a script kitty toolkit and that's that's ridiculous and that's not unique. That's common  Just go down the list of all those devices from all the major manufacturers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What might be interesting is unfortunately like traditional like the actual when I think of an iot device  These don't have the bandwidth or the computer to be interesting  But if these could ruin something like that in a giant network, they do you pivot you pivot so here's it's an amplification attack

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't you don't care about the power of the device as long as they can reflect something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're happy now, but it's even worse than worse than that  That's that's the one thing if I own the device and I can just make it send traffic  Already that's valuable to me as as a black cat use it as a ddos  But a lot of these that do remote that allow me remote code execution. They will allow me to pivot  So now I can see inside your network. Now, maybe I don't care what's in your network, but if I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's as if you don't have a firewall and that's the problem with the crack attack, which is clients mostly iot devices that join networks  Although actually not mostly iot devices including phones and laptops. Yes, all kinds of things. Yeah, all kinds of things anything that joins a network  Uh is vulnerable  The sad thing is well the interesting thing to me is the mirai botnet had one  Flaw that it was taking advantage of  This one is much more sophisticated which makes me nervous makes me suspect  Maybe a more sophisticated actor is involved here like let's say a nation state  uh, it's uh, it is a broad range of  vulnerabilities  Being exploited and as a as a result, that's why it's a much broader range of internet connected devices  And what's also interesting is many of these devices do have patches, but people just whoops people just don't patch them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People just don't patch them. That's because it's a pain. It's a pain. They don't make it easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes the patches aren't available in a way that is easy for you to do it  One some of the one of the reasons why I suggest the synology routers is because they will automatically update  I like that some people hate that I love it because a consumer like my parents  I can give this to them and say just leave it on right will take care of itself  All of these attacks are taking care of taking advantage of something that that we've done very poorly and that is make the transition  From the the late 90s mindset to the new millennium. Well, the right took advantage of the fact that there had a hardwired login

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's pretty pathetic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean the philosophy I don't know if that's any mindset from any decade  Well, no, but the mindset used to be you protect the core the cores were all the important stuff  Now it's the edge the edge has brains  And it was about six years ago when people started saying I don't need to own the core  Right if I can own the edge and use the edge to disrupt the core

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to correct myself the mirai net was not the one two years ago that affected the playstation network  That was the one last christmas that affected the dine dns that almost brought the internet down  By bringing down a big a big dns provider dine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't see this problem being solved through user action. It will never be solved through user action, right?  in terms of their their purchasing what they buy and then what they do after they buy because  most of these attacks don't directly  Affect the user like right now for example  People listening to this some percentage of the people listening to this show or watching this show have that on their router  Okay, what is what bad thing is happening to them right right now? Nothing really?  It's kind of an abstraction and you know  You think about the the number of users who don't take action when they have phishing attacks when they have trojans when they have all these actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Problems. Yeah right in front of their faces  You could be you could be part of the mirai botnet or this new botnet and and and not know it  There'd be a lot there'd be excess traffic coming out of your broadband may slow down maybe a little bit  But it didn't need to slow down much by the way, not only does it take advantage of at least seven or eight different vulnerabilities  It has an entire  lua-based back end  That allows new code modules to be downloaded to infected machines. This is a this is much more sophisticated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a malware that can be updated more easily than the more than the routers. That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So even if they were even if checkpoint a chinese company chihoo 360 also found this  Even if they were to analyze and say it does this it could do something different tomorrow. They know at least that it's programmable  um, so this is  You know what in a couple of weeks we'll say oh now we know what reaper was designed to do  But right now we don't we just know it's out there. Well, no and it might be designed to do something different later  And it might well, yeah just dropping a new module I asked steve well, what can't they figure out what the command and control?  Network. Sorry. He said another variety of i-peat addresses. They're very smart. Um, can you I mean  All all people should do and the problem is it's not that people watch this show because they know enough anyway to keep their stuff  Up to date is look at this database of infected devices and unplug them  As you said donate them and responsibly recycle responsibly recycle with a hammer  Yeah, uh because yeah, you don't want to give it to goodwill someone else now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, so unless you really don't like that person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it it it affects all of us not them. I was joking but yes, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's here's the fun part your neighbor who might be having compromised equipment  It's not just your neighbor's problem your neighbor's on your segment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's less but it's even less your neighbor problem than your than the world's problem  That's the funny thing is the burden of this doesn't as you point out lie on the guy who's infected  And so there's even less reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you ever want to get depressed just secure google like security and externalities and you will just be like  We will never solve this just like we will never fix the climate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, I feel bad about uh snap though because they made a whole bunch of spectacles you have some I have my snap  spectacles  Remember how cool they were everybody wanted like you couldn't get them. You had to go  No, i remember that  apparently  According according to the verge snap is stuck with hundreds of thousands of unsold spectacles and spectacle parts in warehouses  They oh actually, this is the information  uh  The snap expects demand to continue after the holland or thought demand would continue after the big rush last year  And ordered hundreds of thousands of additional units  But once it opened sales to a wider audience the demand dried up and this is the whole thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were cool because they were scarce and they created a glut and nobody cared

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a silicon valley thing like they were cool because tech people were like it wasn't even a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not even tech people tech journalists. Yes some some tech journalists. I thought they were ugly. Exactly. I never wanted to put these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I liked them, but I wore them once and that's I never wore them  It didn't look fashionable and fetching like google glass did could you get me my spectacles so I could show people how how?  Good they look at least compared to the phoenix grace. They might be in the drawer on the lower left there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well the big issue wasn't even in the closet up behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think they're behind the june oven and just to the left of my gear vr and  Oh lord, I have a lot of crap  That better be on your counter top june is still in use. Okay. I'm sorry you were trying to make a point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The average snap spectacles user used it for what a week? Yeah, something like that  So even the ones who did use it, they realized yeah, this is not ideal. Don't worry. They have 2.8 billion dollars on hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although they're burning at the rate of remember when they said they were a camera company  I wonder if they still say that six months. They almost bought a drone a chinese drone maker. It fell through  So these don't look bad at all. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's go with with the hip. Oh, see look. Okay. Actually on you. They're not bad. They're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, do you feel that i'm not hip enough to wear this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just feel like you exude a certain gravitas that maybe these spectacles do not accentuate. I save higgins

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, what you're saying is I look I look like a cartoon character wearing them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do kind of see I I thought that they should have the the yellow circles both on the same side  So it looks like you look that it looks like you that uh that emoji looking up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need little googly eyes for these. Oh, you know what if they had an emojis on them, I bet they'd be amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they had this nice weird rubber case with proprietary charging that if you lost it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember when there was a time that people were paying for four or five times over the uh, asking price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was just tech journalists who had to write the story. No, we had we had an engineer here. Kara. Cole  Who told me I will pay you up to 600 dollars. Could they open source this could they put this like and give this to like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called a phone. It's well, it's a camera. I mean, I doubt this is anything too. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just thinking like if I could  If I could use that and build apps against okay. Yeah, that would be cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have been nice. It would have been if it had been an open platform  You might have more people buying them. I'm just saying and like a couple hundred thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, what can you do if you could quickly record something?  or  I'm trying to they don't show you anything in the glass. So they would have to make them not sunglasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you talking about? Sunglasses are appropriate everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At night indoors ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna take a little break i'm recording this right now  We're gonna take a little break and come back with picks of the week numbers anything you guys think is interesting and worth  highlighting to the world at large  First a word from our sponsor  Ah rocket mortgage, I knew I had it here somewhere

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love rocket mortgage from quick and loans. Actually, I I can't really say I love rocket mortgage  I love the idea of rocket mortgage and I know that the next time I buy a house  I will use rocket mortgage because when we bought our house lisa and I four years ago  We didn't use rocket mortgage. They weren't around yet  We used that big bank and everybody knows the number one lender in the country with the whips  And the horses it's like devo has a bank. Yeah, devo has a bank  Don't ever borrow from devo's bank it's well first of all you have to go you have to go to the bank  You have to go and then there's somebody there and this is like four years ago, but you might as well have been 1895  No, it might be a little later because he didn't have an abacus. He had a calculator  That had that you had an amortization table key on, you know  So he was so well and he had a sheaf of papers if we gave you this loan and then we'd calculate  Your monthly payment based on the down payment would be  400 now that's wrong. It was crazy, but that wasn't the worst part. Then we go home. We said, okay fine. We'll take it  Okay, and he says good, but we'll be in touch because there's some things we need  Well, we were in touch for weeks for two months  Sending them stuff every week another batch of well now we need pay stubs from your job four  Jobs ago and stuff like that. I mean literally it just went on and on and on and on and on and on and on  I mean literally it just went on and on we almost lost the house. I've told this story before  I won't belabor the point. It was not a good experience  incomes quick and loans best lender in the country  Fabulous very forward-looking number one and customer satisfaction year after year. They realized this is this is old-fashioned  It's not keeping up with the times. We need a client focused technological solution  So they created rocket mortgage and they had three goals  Goal number one they wanted to make it simple to apply so they do the entire thing online. There's no paperwork  Literally no paperwork to apply for the loan. You have to sign you have to sign papers at the end when you get the loan  But to apply no paperwork no going to the attic no searching through you. It's simple. There's it's fully transparent  they tell you exactly every step of the way what's going on so you understand fully and  Then based on your income your assets and credits they have relationships with all the banks and everything  So they say okay that you you give them some basic information  They say this is is this you is this your bank account? Do we have permission to access it? Yes  Okay  Now we know what we need to know and within minutes of you sitting down to do this  On your computer on your laptop on your tablet on your phone  It'll say you're approved and there's a big button that says print out your approval letter. You bring that to the open house  You're done. You've got the loan  Rocket mortgage you apply simply you understand fully and then  Your mortgage confidently with quicken loans. It's rocket mortgage comm slash twig if you're buying or refining  In my in my mind. There is just no better way to do this rocket mortgage comm slash twig  They're an equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 30  Don't go back in time to get your next home loan  Go to quick and loans rocket mortgage comm slash twig. I did this entire  Advertisement wearing spectacles wearing snapchat spectacles  Someone's got to do you think you could hack these on know-how?  Probably I mean they're kind of encased in plastic Bluetooth, right? I mean if they're Bluetooth, they can be hackable. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you could modify them so they don't look dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't look that dumb  I'm Stacy, but I'm you have to have a certain facial you have to have a good face you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't need a fist you just kind of beat me with your words just beat me with your words Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a pick or anything? I do yes. It's not a physical thing because it's I'm here as a surprise  Yes, I didn't even know I was gonna be birthday to me. Is it? Oh, it is almost your birthday. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm not  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How old are you now Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is kind of iffy this is a startup it is a startup called well Leo and you sign up for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Newsletter you mean well Leo  Don't you?  Well, Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't mean that actually  So yeah, we ll I oh and it in some places it's even cooler  So what it does is it sends you three recipes. Oh, I need this I need this and then if you're in an area where it's awesome  You can actually order it on Instagram. Oh look you probably is this it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is a test of your no, that's some other well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna tell you where to go. I went to the wrong well, you know dot-com go get well, you know, I'd like to  So my newsletter this week features apples and my recipes my three recipes of the week are  Apple goat cheese frittata with walnuts. It gives me six dollars per serving and the opportunity to order it now  Oh, they'll actually sell you this stuff here. I can show I can show you on my magical computer  You just can't see the email and then so if I go to order it now, it'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and these are  designed for weight loss or  Heart health or is it just general clean eating good clean eating good clean eating? Okay, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can either in you even if you don't have so this is kind of like a blue apron, but not I mean  So well, okay  If it will order all of the items from the grocery store for you  So you get a list and it says you can add it's like you're it's like a personal shopper for food  It's the recipe plus you can order the food  Yeah, I can't order the food because I don't live in an area where they have a they're in San Francisco  But yes in the Bay Area you can okay  If you do this, I would recommend looking at the ingredients before you just click order because sometimes they double up on some of the rest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you may not want an apple goat cheese frittata. Okay. Well, yes, then you don't click on that recipe and say oh, okay. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cuz I really don't so they some others for this week are sausage and apples and then chicken plus apple salad and you go through

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can browse through recipes. I'm not sure I get the value proposition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The value is like I sit there every week and I'm like god what I cook this week  So I can look at this and then I can just easily instead of looking at my recipe book and then writing down there  Down the things of on my grocery list. I just it's creative. It's meal planning a little bit with them  It's yeah, it's meal planning made slightly easier. Yeah, is that gonna set the world on fire?  No, but it's free right now. Well, what's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because this this blue apron hello fresh meals in a box model is super hot on Wall Street right now  Right. And of course with Amazon getting into it. Mmm  you know  People think Amazon's gonna eat this one up once they because now they own Whole Foods  But it's a very hot category and this is an interesting way to kind of sidle into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think and they're doing machine learning on you know what you have and that sort of thing. That's that's it free  This is free right now, it's just a little fun are they selling  This information to anybody so what if you order it and you buy it they get a cut  I think it's like an affiliate fee for the groceries that they're the grocers that they're working  Yeah, I just think it's nice because I like to cook different things all the time, but blue apron a lot of times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is more open open-ended meal planning, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz they they want me to do a lot more work than sometimes I want to do  Yeah, sometimes you just want to eat. Yeah, I don't want to cook send me almonds. Well it in just  Yeah, I'm not gonna get blue apron every day of the week. So this is kind of a fun way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I like to cook. It's it's it. Yeah, I like to cook too. And that's why I like blue apron  But we only get it three times a week. It's not like we're always doing it  Well, he was first intelligent platform helps you plan shop prepare and enjoy healthy meals at home. Okay, anything to help with meal planning  That's that's that is a nightmare. Isn't it? Yeah. Yeah  I actually I mean it's not related but I  I'm a follower of the good doctor firm, man, and  He will also do that for you. But this is more very much more specific to  Dietary health he's very very a trarian diet  Nutritarian nutrition the theory behind it is you eat high nutrient density foods like spinach  Yeah, okay, and you focus on that, you know, and and so you'll say I get a recipe  I think every day from him. He doesn't order food for you  They start to shop you good for you. You get lots of good free recipes. Yeah, okay. Yeah, you should try it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will I like pretty dense right? It's dense. I don't know if it's a trick chocolate torts or even denser or more dense  Fudge is crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dance I feel dense just thinking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Michael Elgin in Tbilisi, Georgia home of wine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right. I have a tool of the week  And I promise that I would tell everybody about the ultimate Android phone that did everything you would ever dream of  specifically  Preventing you from being overly distracted Leo. I have a dream  I have a dream my dream is to have I love everything about going full-on  With a watch that connects to the internet and so on  And you can make calls with a watch like the new Apple watch some Samsung watches and  but the only problem with that is photography because I  the only thing that the new expensive thousand dollar nine hundred dollar phones have  That I really want is a really really good camera. That's a very good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This really become about the camera more than anything else rates. The camera is everything you could carry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. And that is what this phone does. Oh  The ultimate Android phone is the L 16 camera it's an Android device that has 16 lenses in it  16 camera modules in it and  That is a joke  No, it uses at least 10  lenses simultaneously for each shot sometimes 11 12 whatever  The the picture and then it fuses them together into a massive 50 something megapixel image  You can focus it later and it's not it's not like this phony baloney portrait mode stuff  This is optical focus that you actually focus later  It takes breathtakingly beautiful shots. They claim that it's DS DSLR quality  And it's the size of a phone  It's 2,000 bucks that's the downside. Oh my gosh, look at all these sensors

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait, is this the one that has a subscription fee because it stores everything in the cloud for you  Do you have to pay? Oh, yes, it's computational. It's a computational camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't think you can do it on the on the device. I've seen this camera then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen it there were prototypes and I've written about the this one  It was kind of a sort of a research project or here's some images. Wow  Beautiful images you zoom in on those photo you zoom in on the images and it just like  They look like incredible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and because it has so many lenses it has real zoom up to 150 millimeter optical zoom from 28 to 150  It has as you said you could pull focus after the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really interesting. Yeah, it just seems and it fits in your pocket  So I you know, I I'm always torn between using my camera where the photo is kind of  Inferior or my my my big cannon camera where suddenly I'm a photographer  Which I don't want to be sitting in a restaurant with a big camera or whatever  And this is like solving all those problems  So so the dream is carry this plus wear a watch that connects you to the Internet's and gives you your notification  Yeah, and I think that's a better scenario than actually having a smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how many cameras are front-facing all of them? No all of them know like towards you nothing  Oh, no zero because then I can't take selfies. I mean, how am I gonna use this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a selfie cam. You can turn it like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Selfie cam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna wait for the model that has 17 cameras because I'm a bit yes, you know photo snub

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but seriously, you know with 16 16 of them as the selfie camera, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when they when they first released or talked about this and I it's an incredible idea  But now that I'm looking at I'm thinking the first thing that's gonna happen for me is I will put my fingerprints all over  At least five of those those camera lenses. I have to clean that off every single time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is an amazing piece of technology. Yeah, and the other thing I love about it is of course  They'll be able to refine and hone the software over time because this is like really a big soft  You know the stitching and the modification of the of the images afterwards is something that can be improved year after year  Even with the same hardware Snapdragon 820 256 gigs storage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  three custom light a6

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, you can't think of it and I mentioned the name it's called the it's called the l16

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the light the light co if I don't know more like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't think of this like a regular camera because we think of regular digital cameras in terms of megapixels  That doesn't work when you have a computational camera, right?  It's even it it's there is no megapixel. It's technically infinite megapixel. It you must think of the algorithm exactly  Yeah, but that also means like Mike said it means you could take the same picture and when they improve the algorithm  Five years down the line. It becomes a better picture. Mm-hmm. That's the amazing part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is and the scary part because yes, I know what I'd love to see though  I mean really the chief benefit of this is the size  Yeah, but what I'd love to see is this kind of computational photography and I think Sony in particular is starting to do this in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DSLRs or or actually their lenses with full-size Sony camera lenses 16 of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's not gonna work I don't know if the multiple lens thing is really  Trillion megapixel could probably do the same thing with the zoom. But anyway  Yeah, I think it's very interesting and I do think you'll see some some stuff  The problem with Canon and Nikon is they've been really slow to adopt these kinds of new technologies because they have such an investment in  Existing models. It's always the innovators dilemma, right? Yeah  Sony's been able to kind of somewhat eat their lunch because they don't have such an investment in their existing platform  And I wouldn't be surprised to see a company  Remember the ray tracing camera that light like the light road the L Y T  R O everybody was so this reminds me a little bit of that  Everybody was so excited about what the light row was gonna be in do and it never really went anywhere  But at some point I agree with you my computational photography. We all agree is the future of photography  But you know, this is a step on the road  I'm not sure I'd want to spend two thousand dollars on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could get a well, I mean you can buy five of these for the cost of that nice lens Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What nice lens? Yeah, the one on you're looking at me like that  I mean, I'm the nut that bought it. I mean I buy crazy stuff much more expensive than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but your pictures are incredible the ones that you took back from the Galapagos. Yeah, those are pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not as good as Lisa's but anyway  This is an interesting idea. I mean when you get one Mike, I'll be sure to look at it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna put it in the holiday gift-giving guide. Yeah, sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should get we should probably get one to review you want to review it. Yeah  Actually, I think Lisa should review it. She would be a great she's got a good eyes  He's a better photographer than anybody. She's a man two of them. Yeah, you're a two one for each eye

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well when the one for the selfie you just tape them front back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's myself done. Well, no, then you could have 360

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many lenses would you need for 360 that's more than like all the lens all the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, can you do if you do a 180 then you just need to and then you've got it they'll stitch it together, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Master father Robert the right Reverend father Roberto. Well, I already showed you my projector

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wanted to show something a little lower. I just kind of steal your pick right? No, that's all good  Jason a while back. He kind of challenged me. He said, you know, you can use a Chromebook instead of windows  You fell for that? I did well, I wanted to see if it would work. So I picked up one of these  I actually bought one for my dad too. This is an Acer r13 and this is a this is actually all aluminum body  It's a good looking laptop. It's actually really nice. It's convertible. It lasts about 12 hours on a charge  It's a 13.3 inch screen quad core on processor 32 gigabytes of memory 4 gigabytes of I mean 32 gigabytes of storage  4 gigabytes of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you you can expand it? Yeah, it's got expandability. That's less important on a Chromebook because you don't really that's a lot for a Chromebook  Although Google's now has like ridiculous under 28 and to 512, but I mean this thing starts at 350

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're crazy low cost and for 350 dollars  Normally, it's well the keyboards bad. No touchpad. Is this this one have an i5 in it? Is this no, this is the quad core arm  Okay, it's a arm, but it does do Android apps  So this this will do like act as like a super large Android tablet and I have to say I've been using this on know-how  It's replaced my Windows notebook for know-how. It's replaced my Windows notebook for  for some of the other shows that I do and  I don't miss Windows because I just need something that will access Google Docs that can do Twitter can do email can do hangouts  Here's a little bit. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cortana got jealous. I was I was shielding her ears instead. I activated her. I'm sorry. Here's a little hint

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a little hint by a Windows notebook. Yeah  But yeah this thing I I like it this actually  For most of what I do would work just fine  Unfortunately not for everything because I also do video editing on my notebook and that's  Absolutely not with a chrome book any sort of coding as well. Yeah  Yeah, there's a couple of cluges for getting Arduino programming to work properly on this but they're cluges  But I would say for my for my parents because I bought these I bought one each for my parents  they are great because they're virus proof and  Incredibly easy for me to manage remotely and at three hundred fifty dollars a pop  It means that I'm not gonna get a call from my dad saying I just dropped the thousand dollar notebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sent me and yeah, so I bought the pixel book which was the base unit  This is 999 that won't come for a couple of weeks, but I would love to do a head-to-head

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that is definitely nicer the pixel is gonna be so beautiful and it's just it's stylish  But yeah, you could buy three of these things for the cost of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought my daughter the Samsung Chromebook plus  Actually bought two of those ones for me and one for her and that's really nice for 500 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's great choices out there. There really are and I remember a year ago even Chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The low price Chromebooks were just they were bad. That's all we called for a year ago  That's all we were saying is just give us a mid-range Chromebook. I think that would be a market

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So would that pass the Jeff test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question. Yeah, he got a pixel book. So he'll have his in a couple of weeks, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I find that people who have pixel Chromebooks, they're kind of snobbish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't want to use anything less because yes money we've got the best money to buy  It's like the $2,000 camera phone  Wow, this was so much fun, especially because you were in studio you guys and I'm sorry that you couldn't also be here Mike  But it's always a pleasure to have Mike Elgin gastronomad net  He's traveling the world with his wife Amira to create amazing food experiences for people.
