Stacey's got the day off again, but Matthew Ingram is here.  Matthew Ingram is here. So glad to have him.  Chief digital writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.  Hello, Matthew.  Hello. Matthew's coming in via LTE from Canada.  So that's two strokes. Sorry about the quality.  No, it's okay. We're going to.  You know, your sound is fine. And that's really all that matters.  We're working on different things. In fact, with Jeff Jarvis today, we're trying Zoom.  He's actually, you know what? The color's better.  Everything looks better in Zoom. I'm not so pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you look good. Jeff. Well, I had to go a little too far, but at least I'm not too pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At first I said, oh, let's not experiment with Jeff. But but they pointed out you live in Zoom because of all year you teach in Zoom.  Yeah, yeah, I'm used to it. We're going to we've been trying different alternatives to Skype.  I fear that Skype is fading away and Zoom is is I'm going to jinx this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Zoom has been really quite amazing and reliable for me.  Yeah, it looks great. And that is except for John.  Easy to use. Sorry, John. Poor John. He'll learn. I couldn't get in. He'll learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He'll learn. Also with us, Ant Pruitt on line four.  We've not used line four in a while. How you doing, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable as always, sir. Yourself? I'm great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good to see you. And the reason Ant's on line four is because on line one today.  Special guest. A special guest. Just for a few minutes, we're going to say hello to Trey Radcliffe.  He's down in New Zealand where there are count them zero, zero COVID cases. Hi, Trey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what's going on? Yeah, there's zero COVID cases, but eight million sheep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there is no connection. No connection.  No connection. Trey has been living down under for, you call it down under, even though it's New Zealand, not Australia, right? Or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Anzac. Yeah, people refer to it like that. But mostly down under means Ozzy land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't like to mix with those. Trey is an official Kiwi, has been for a decade now, which is great. Moved from Austin.  I remember your Austin days and I remember when you moved and you're very happy in Queenstown, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, moved here 10 years ago for a variety of reasons, you know, but actually on the list was somewhere down there was just in case of global thermonuclear war or a pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pandemic one. Thank goodness. So we played that. So I want to talk.  We brought Trey on and of course, Trey is an old friend, great photographer, one of the best in the world, I'm sure, as you will vouch.  Ant says he's been stalking you for years. And Trey used to do a show on the network.  He's been on many times. We've done triangulations with him if you want to learn more about Trey.  But the reason to bring you on is because you sent me an email the other day said, here's an NFT of one of my images.  And I was so taken with that. I said, let's get Trey on because we have been trying Trey for a month to figure out what the hell these non fungible tokens are.  And if anybody should know, it's you. You're not the first artist to do this.  In fact, this has been, I think, mostly a boon for artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not the first. I found out about it the first time.  But two years ago, I have a friend named Yash, who was one of the founders of Pinterest.  And he actually came out here to Queenstown, New Zealand, came here into the studio and was telling me all about NFTs and how big they're going to be.  Two years ago. Yeah.  And I said, like, I don't really understand. So he just explained it to me for hours.  So I almost did it way back then.  But I thought, well, sometimes it's not good to be an early adopter.  Sometimes it is. So but now I think the wave of interest is so high that it's probably the right time to get in.  Grimes got a lot of attention for selling $5.8 million of her art, digital art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of it animated. I think all of it animated for 20 minutes.  Almost $6 million in 20 minutes.  The National Basketball Association, the NBA's made $200 million selling basketball highlights.  Wow.  NBA top shot dot com.  The first time I became aware of of of what now we call NFTs was Crypto Kitties,  which was a site you would use a crypto currency, I guess, Bitcoin at the time to buy these digital assets.  At the time to buy these digital cats that would mate.  But Tray, it's kind of speculation, really, because you don't there's no tangible good.  Like if I have one of your pictures on my wall at home, that's a tangible good.  Not necessarily one of a kind, but it's a it's a thing, a physical thing.  You're not selling when you sell an NFT of your art, you're not selling the print, are you? Or are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but you can. You can attach real life goods to your NFT.  OK, but you don't need to.  I sent someone a link in in the Skype chat like this guy made some shoes and you can.  It's like a digital shoe that spins around. But then, like, if you buy it, you also get the real shoe.  And I think in 24 hours he made about three million dollars. Oh, my God.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you, Tray, can you can you restrict other can you put conditions in the contract about about what the owner does and does not get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you could put that in the contract because, you know, it's a smart contract tied to the Ethereum blockchain.  Yes, you can put the parameters in there.  You can really do almost anything that you like. You can do you can put it up for an auction.  So there's one of one. You can put up a photo or a piece of art that's an open edition and you put a price on it.  And if it sells five hundred sixty units, then those five hundred sixty things are minted.  And that's all that will ever be minted with that particular piece of art.  There's lots of different schemes and scenarios for for selling stuff.  I think this is there's so you said speculation. It's totally speculation.  And I know here's my to be fair. So is buying Starry Starry Night by Vango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you buy as an investment instead of just something pretty to put on the wall.  And I think that's where most fine art is sold as an investment.  You're speculating it'll be more valuable in the years to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And I think they're right to speculate on it because right now there's so many Bitcoin millionaires out there.  They're just all they're crawling with them.  And people don't know right now people buy Bitcoin and they just play the market the way for it to go up four percent or down three percent.  You know, it's like trading the euro for the yen. And that's a little boring.  It's much more interesting to buy instead of having an invisible Bitcoin to have like a digital piece of art and the art.  There's secondary and tertiary markets so it gets sold and resold.  So why wait for Bitcoin to go up three percent when you could buy a piece of art that will jump up 50 percent in a few weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it you think it's the case that people who are spending money on NFTs are not taking dollars say and turning it into Bitcoin or Ethereum and then spending it.  This is stuff they've had they have in their wallet.  And so it's just like buying more crypto. It's what it sounds like. It's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. OK. They're probably sitting on hundreds of thousands or millions in Bitcoin and having their Coinbase account.  And then these NFT sites, they often use this little wallet called MetaMask so they can just convert it to Ethereum, send it to their MetaMask wallet and they can just go stir crazy and buy all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it usually Ethereum when you're doing an NFT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually good news because Ethereum is not nearly so energy dependent as Bitcoin is. Right.  I've been told somebody said somebody said Leo, you're an idiot.  It's don't worry about it. Because I was complaining.  Actually, I was quoting Seth Gooden, who did a blog post saying, you know, the only thing bad with NFTs is it's going to hasten climate change because there's so much energy involved in these transactions.  But that's not the case with Ethereum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't totally understand the mechanics of Ethereum, but I do know that it can do a lot more transactions.  Yeah.  And there's new with the new Ethereum, Ethereum 2.  Yeah, they've got a lot of different wild computer science techniques that are happening that can, you know, makes it like 10,000 times as efficient as Ethereum 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's proof of stake is less energy intensive than proof of work, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the main reason Ethereum was developed was to do smart contracts like NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think it's a really interesting time because, you know, crypto has always been very esoteric for the common person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This does not make it any less.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just makes it even crazier.  Like the metals and people that buy all these NBA cards and all this kind of stuff.  And so these are like regular people.  And so now there's, you know, non computer science nerves like us that are getting into this collecting stuff.  So it's entering a certain zeitgeist.  It's still early, but it's nice to see so many people playing the game.  It's just a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does remind me of trading cards.  It is very much like that.  In fact, that's what Seth Coden used the the Hannes Wagner card, of which there are only 10 as an example.  That piece of cardboard has no intrinsic value.  Or Superman 1.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess if you're a Superman fan or if there's any Hannes Wagner fans left because he played 100 years ago, you could say, well, he's a fan.  But really, that's not why people buy people buy Hannes Wagner baseball cards.  They buy it because of its intense value and they spend millions of real money on these things.  Do you trade using the app?  Sorry.  Go ahead, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just remember the fine art.  Fine art.  It was a banana to the wall by an artist.  Remember that? Yep.  Which is another performance artist ate it.  Do you remember that?  I remember that too.  And then.  Yeah.  And so that was his art was to eat the banana.  But part of the contract for buying the banana taped to the wall was that the banana would be regularly replaced by the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's OK to eat it.  The banana, by the way, was priced at $120,000.  Maurizio Catalan, he titled it Comedian.  And then along comes another comedian to eat it.  This is part of Art Basel in Miami Beach.  So Trey, do you see yourself as selling your goods, your images this way entirely?  Or is this just kind of a fun little sideline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a it's a fun experiment.  I still sell big prints.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People want them on the wall, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  This sounds a little name droppy.  You guys know I don't take myself seriously.  But I did have two famous celebrities become collectors lately.  Edward Norton and Leonardo DiCaprio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  Nice.  It is name dropping.  It's OK.  If it were me, I'd do it the same.  Do you guys hang out or?  Oh, hey, Trey has introduced me to some major celebrities.  He's Hans Zimmer is a friend.  The last time you were in Petaluma, you came here with MySpace Tom and we went out for Korean tacos.  Wow.  Yeah. So I everybody famous I know I know through Trey.  He knows everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You met Hans Zimmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't meet him.  Trey is friends with Hans Zimmer.  Trey is like his buddy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We traveled around together.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wanted to ask from the standpoint of the artist that's a star of an artist and happens to be able to make the sale of an NFT.  What is it from a payment standpoint?  I mean, are we talking real money that actually shows up or is it just going to sit somewhere in a crypto wallet somewhere that they have to sit on forever and ever and just buy more crypto?  Yeah.  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd explain how it works.  So you take a piece of art.  It can be a photo.  It can have music attached to it.  It can be animated or whatever.  You upload it to one of these marketplaces like the one I'm going to put mine on first any day now is one called Makers Place.  And then so you upload it just like you're uploading a picture to Flickr or whatever.  You write a little description.  You put how you want to sell it.  What kind of price?  And then it goes live.  For example, the way that the money works is let's say they buy it for a thousand dollars.  Okay.  Makers Place takes 15 percent and 85 percent goes to the original artist.  So that's really quite good.  That's better than the usual gallery commission, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As soon as someone buys it, that money is transferred into your Coinbase account or your Metamask wallet.  And then you can convert that to U.S. dollars anytime.  So you can cash it in.  Yeah.  Even better, because this is a smart contract, if someone buys that on Makers Place and then they resell it, the original artist gets 10 percent of every subsequent sale.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll get 10 percent royalty on that piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I can see your interest in this for the artist.  This is a great deal.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Makers Place, huh?  Hmm.  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can see the gears turning.  Makers Place is digital.  These are digital art.  And that's one of the things I think that confuses people about NFTs.  As I said, I got from you, I still have it, a picture of the space shuttle launch.  It's beautiful.  And that's a physical thing.  It's probably a print, so there may be other copies of it.  That's very common these days.  But you know, you may also, if you have a Van Gogh, you might have the original.  A digital thing, the thing that confuses me is you can make infinite copies.  Does Makers Place prevent you from making infinite copies of the art you just bought?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a pretty tight authentication process.  Okay.  Because when it's authenticated in the blockchain, it trades the original creator, only 20 exist,  only one exist.  But it's digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can they keep me from making another copy?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, technically I could take the same photo and upload it on another site.  True.  You know, like Foundation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a certain amount of trust.  Gateway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But there's ways they can check the Ethereum blockchain to see if the same thing's already  out there.  So that's why it's just so trusted.  And the mind flip that people have to go through is, you know, these, you all know of Harare  books like Sapiens, that things only have, humans are the only animal on the planet that  believe in fictions, you know.  And if we all believe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We believe in a lot of fictions as it turns out.  Like money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't see a meter, you can't weigh it, but we all agree on how big a meter is so  that we can use it to measure stuff.  Right.  The same thing with money.  And now the same thing with digital art.  And you can see so many people are buying it that there's enough people that believe  in it just to keep it going.  Same thing with Bitcoin.  People didn't know.  We've got to get more and more people to believe in this story.  But now so many people believe in that story, the story grows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could put code into the image too, right?  Like sort of steganography or you could insert something into the actual image itself.  But that'd be copied, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I copy bit for bit the thing I bought, it's going to be copied with the bit for bit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, technically you can go screenshot my photos anytime and make them your screensaver  or whatever background.  But there's only one that exists in the Ethereum blockchain and it's authenticated.  That's the real one.  Okay, I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that's the real one.  Wow.  It's sort of interesting.  Trey, what's interesting is that besides pictures, images, which are physical objects as well  as digital objects, you do something that's fully digital, this machine elf site.  These are these are kind of videos.  You actually post them on YouTube so people can see them on YouTube.  You're not you know, do you plan to sell these at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually have a company down here with four people and we're going to be cranking out probably, you know,  60 or 70 a year.  And right now we have a licensing deal through a company called Tripp.  They make VR headsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you'd better be better in a VR obviously be better in a VR headset.  Oh, yeah.  Am I violating your copyright by playing this?  Are you going to sue me?  No.  Okay.  I'm a little gun shy these days.  That's another thing to point out, right?  I mean, frequently our podcasts get taken down because we're playing somebody else's copy of the material to talk about it,  which I deems fair use doesn't matter.  It still gets taken down.  Yeah.  So, you know, this is, you know, it's so interesting.  I figured if anybody understood this would be you, Trey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all made out of math.  It's all made out of fractals.  That's my background.  Yeah.  But we're building an app for iPad and stuff.  Not really because it'll be look nice in the iPad, but we want to have it ready for Apple's VR kit.  Yes.  Because I think they're going to be really cool.  And of course, they'll be showing off games and all that good stuff.  And meditation.  These are really visual meditations is, you know, a multi-billion dollar market, you know, common headspace or two billion dollar companies.  So we're kind of the first to have visual and audio meditations.  And, you know, it'd be kind of cool maybe for one of the featured things because people get tired of playing games or just want to lay on the couch and veg out.  Yeah.  Relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do I have to take Ayahuasca to do it or can I just do it?  It helps.  It helps.  Why not?  It wouldn't hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What makes you think that Apple's VR is going to be the business, if you will, versus what's currently out there now from the light side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think because they're so good with style and they're going to look cool and all these famous people are going to be using them.  You're going to see football players on the side, on the bench, wearing the gauze, just like the EarPods at the World Cup.  You see famous people and stars and sports stars using this.  They're like, oh, I want to be cool like them.  So they'll make it cool.  So there's just this Apple effect that's undeniable.  They may not make it better, but they'll at least make it more natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may not make it better, but they'll make it a little bit more socially acceptable, perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be light.  It maybe lasts five hours.  You can take it in the car.  Yeah, I think they'll do it right.  I love hate relationship with that company, but I think they'll do that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Interesting.  Is there sound with these machine elves?  There is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have a, one of my business partners, he's a composer.  So he composes custom music for it.  And then what's kind of cool is because these fractals are based on math,  I can take his music and make it one of the inputs for the coefficients.  So the colors will change perfectly or the shapes will flex with the sound.  So it's a very trippy experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's all just watch for a few minutes and see if we feel better.  Do you have the music now, John?  Oh, oh.  We're all hypnotized.  This is straight out of my 18 year old acid trip college life right here.  That's amazing.  And because they're fractals, you, we're just showing little clips from your, from your site,  but these are much longer and you, and you kind of dive into them.  I've actually seen quite a few of these.  I love these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey, where does the math come from?  Do you generate it yourself or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're pretty much all the fractals are pretty well known out there.  They're made by like, like Mandelbrot sets and so forth.  Yeah.  In the fifties and sixties.  So I use, I use a program called Mandel Bulber, which is incredibly esoteric and difficult to use.  I took me like six months to figure out how to use it.  And then so you can take, you know, any one of a hundred fractals and you see you combine a fractal  that was made by some Austrian mathematician in 1960 with one that was made from German mathematician in 1970.  And they merged together and create something totally new.  And you can change the parameters over time and then it extrapolates.  Right.  And builds beautiful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Fractals are one of the things you do early in your programming career.  It's a good way to teach recursion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And nobody owns a fractal, right?  Nobody owns like the algorithm or the equation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Mandelbrot owns it.  No, it's, yeah, it's a formula.  Do you want to hear my fractal joke?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Ben, Benoit Mandelbrot's middle initial is B. Do you know what it stands for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Benoit Mandelbrot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good one.  My only fractal jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, let me play a full, not a full length one, but because these are like half an hour long, but instead of the showreel,  let me just play an individual one just so you can get a sense of how it kind of you go into it.  You dive into it.  And again, these are available on Trey's YouTube channel.  So the music is Sam Wave.  Is that his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Sam Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you see we're going, we're going to go into this thing.  And one of the properties of fractals is that as you dive into a fractal, the fractal repeats.  So it doesn't, the resolution doesn't disappear.  You don't ever finish.  You just go deeper and deeper.  You are now, you are now going deep into.  Oh, these are fun.  These are fun.  You don't really need to take anything to really kind of trip out on these.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.  Either trip out or find your center.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I could see you selling these NFTs as well, although I think you want them to reach a wider audience.  Trey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we probably will cut them up and sell them with NFTs.  Why not?  People seem to like animated stuff.  Yeah.  And these are 15, 20 minutes long and a typical NFTs 15 to 30 seconds long.  And so, yeah, we'll see how they do.  They're already made, you know, so why not chop them up and give it a run?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to stop now because there are people who are driving while they're listening to the show.  They're about to drive off the side of the road.  It's really nice.  Let those doves there.  They're really amazing.  And I have spent far too many hours in your machine elf.  You're doing a podcast now.  You want to tell us a little bit about that?  Yeah, I have a couple different podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One, I walk around with a 360 camera outside with a friend.  I directed one with Kevin Kelly.  We just talk about stuff.  I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you going to do more of those?  Because I love that.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the new one is audio.  It's called Molecules I've Ingested.  And each episode is a different drug.  Like a hilarious story, but also very educational and interesting.  So the one I just released is Molecules I've Ingested, Ayahuasca and Hitler.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Hitler make an appearance in the Ayahuasca trip?  I don't know.  You just have to hear the whole story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd want that.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I'd want that.  I thought Hitler was the shaman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he was the shaman.  The kids were taking him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hitler's the shaman?  No.  Podcasts at Trey Ratcliffe.com is Trey's podcast hub.  If you are interested in the machine elf, it's the-machine-elf.com.  And I highly recommend checking it out.  The Amazonian giant monkey frog poison, AKA the cambo ceremony.  I think you told me about this one on triangulation, I think.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe so.  I still have the mark up here where the poison went in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stars.  Did you miss Burning Man this year?  What are you going to do?  Are you going to go- is it going to be back in September?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet it will be.  There's been no official announcement yet.  Last year it was off.  That was a bummer because I had gone 10 years in a row.  It was sort of a nice pilgrimage.  And I get so inspired by the other artists there.  It just really kind of fills my cup.  But I know people are anxious to get back out there, especially everyone's been so locked  inside.  And yeah, I think it'll go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trey, it's just you, I guess, because you always make me feel much more relaxed and  better.  But now I'm much less antsy about NFTs, but it might just be a temporary effect of having  Trey on the show.  We love talking to you.  I'm glad that you're doing so well.  Thanks, man.  I'm glad you're still making art.  You're still taking pictures, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I take pictures all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I feel so full of gratitude and lucky to be here in New Zealand so I can just kind  of jump in the car and drive around and see beautiful things.  You live in the most photogenic area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Where can we find your photos?  Same place, Stuck in Customs or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, probably the best is my SmugMug site, which is stuckincustoms.smugmug.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you get nice high quality versions there.  Plus you can buy prints and so forth.  Not at NFT prices either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I don't sell prints on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you don't allow people to make prints?  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because we keep them really limited edition.  Like we might only do three big ones that have been sold out forever.  And they're kind of, they're a little higher priced, you know.  And we have them printed.  It's placed in Germany and it's a whole big procedure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you use for software these days and hardware?  I'm just always curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still use Aurora HDR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Skylum.  Nice.  Skylum is what I use too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Full disclosure.  I help make it and all that stuff, but I actually use it every day.  And I've been flirting a little bit with Luminar, the new Luminar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the AI is wild, isn't it?  Yeah.  I'm so tempted to replace every sky in every photo I've ever taken with a much better one.  And Trey does have some Luminar filters, which are, because it's Trey, wild and fun.  Really great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Luminar is pretty cool.  Actually, I think they're just now adding that the sky replacement also works if there's a reflection like in the water.  I don't know, man, these guys are real smart.  I don't do sky replacement because there could always be a better sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know if I ever did it, people would say, oh, I know where that sky came from.  Because I mean, it's pretty high.  It's not my sky.  So yeah, I'm very nervous.  But if you use Aurora HDR, that program has saved some grungy drab pictures of mine and brought them to life.  And it really is an amazing tool.  And I actually bought Luminar AI because I'm very curious about what I can do with it.  It's pretty cool.  Everybody should follow Trey.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, a quick funny story about sky replacement.  A real short.  So I'm friends with this Russian photographer named Dima and he's really good.  He takes great photography and landscapes.  But he has this library of Photoshop with like 5000 moons.  They're big.  So he always puts these big moons in all of his photos all the time.  You know, a photographer, you know, it's fake.  But other people think like, oh, that's pretty cool.  And I say, Dima, why do you always add moons to every one of your photos?  He goes, it looks better with moon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trey does not have to add moons to his photos.  They look so gorgeous.  Look at this.  That's amazing.  That's what inspired me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a folder of moons myself.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it looks good with one moon, why not put a couple in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you still, I guess, have you not been traveling?  Because one of the things I always loved about your photos is the travel stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm here.  But it's been a great place to be stuck.  New Zealand, it's a lot bigger than people think.  And so I've been spending a lot of time up on the North Island.  How big is your town?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it's got two streets on its little maps.  It's tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a small little one-horse town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll put it this way, Jeff.  It's half the size of Petaluma.  It's 25,000 people.  Wow.  Wow.  I think.  Petaluma is not a big city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I'm not wrong, I think.  How did you pick that spot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did you pick that spot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's beautiful.  The mountains.  I feel really energetic here.  It's very outdoorsy.  Kiwis are really nice.  But actually Queenstown is having a really tough time because of the pandemic.  Oh, no.  Because it's 70% dependent on tourism.  So it's a bit like Venice.  It's a ski destination and all the outdoor stuff.  And they're depending on foreigners to come here and they're not.  I'm on my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be there.  Quite tough.  Be right there.  Did you sell your house, by the way?  I had no idea that you were living in the most beautiful home I have ever seen.  Were you able to sell it yet or is it still for sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I can't decide if I want to sell it or not.  It's big.  I don't blame you.  And I got divorced two years ago.  So I just kind of rattled around inside of it.  And I thought about, and I'm a minimalist.  This is basically my little studio.  You just stay there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I thought about, but there's still a lot of people moving to New Zealand and it's really  in demand.  So I thought, well, maybe I should not sell it.  Airbnb it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can do that.  It's so gorgeous.  I am blown away when I see it.  It's something you see in the magazine somewhere.  Yeah, it's like something you see in a magazine.  It's just so gorgeous.  Trey Radcliffe.  You guys are all talking at the same time.  I know.  I know.  And I've been meaning to come out and visit.  But then this COVID thing happened.  We'll see maybe a few a year or two.  It's always a pleasure to talk to you.  Trey Radcliffe.  The-machine-elf.com.  At Trey Radcliffe on Twitter and of course stuck in customs.smugmug.com for his portfolio.  It's amazing.  Have a wonderful day.  Wonderfully.  Yeah, I guess it's daytime now in New Zealand.  So have a wonderful day.  Thanks, Trey.  Lunchtime, right?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, lunchtime on Thursday.  He's a day ahead.  See you, Trey.  Good to see you.  Thanks, Trey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bye, guys.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a little break when we come back.  We've got the tech news and I'm just going to ream Sean Hannity.  I think you know what I'm talking about here if you don't.  No, I actually don't.  Oh my God.  Do you know about the Taylor Lawrence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.  No, it wasn't Sean Hannity.  It was Tucker Carlson.  Sorry, Tucker Carlson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I reamed the wrong guy.  Well, actually, probably not.  They both deserve it.  It's fine.  Sean deserves it.  I am livid about this Tucker Carlson thing.  And we'll talk about that and a lot more in just a little bit.  Before I do, though, I want to talk about our sponsor today.  We're brought to you by the Enterprise Tech 30.  A really exciting list of the top tech disruptors, the new startups, the companies that are about  to change the world.  It's a piece of really amazing research that comes to us from Wing Venture Capital in partnership  with NASDAQ.  I think as Roblox goes public today, I think when a company goes public, the world knows.  But there is a whole sector of not public yet private enterprise tech that is amazing,  but it's basically opaque.  You have no idea how the company is doing.  They're cagey.  They don't say what's going on with growth or revenue.  Sales cycles, especially for these new companies, can be long and unpredictable.  There are lots of lists out there that feature startups or tech disruptors, but I have to  say I never trust these lists because there's lots of reasons not to trust them.  They're often dominated by well-known consumer brands or a B2B maybe that's well-known.  There's also issues with lobbying and so forth, even pay to play in some of these lists.  So this is not that.  This is an absolutely editorially based, very good list.  The Enterprise Tech 30, enterprise startups, these are B2B startups that have the most  potential to tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better.  Awardees of the ET30 are on a fast track of growth.  They're changing how business is done.  Of course, they're expected to make an IPO at some point, multi-billion dollar exits,  but they haven't yet.  And that's the point.  You're getting in on the early, early stage.  It's not possible to lobby your way into the ET30.  You can only be selected by the editorial team.  The Enterprise Tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity,  not just startups, but not just mature businesses or not just businesses that you already heard  of and know and have traction.  And that's the beauty of this.  Consider it a buying guide for enterprise executives seeking to bring more validated  and credible digital innovations to their organizations.  Enterprise Tech founders should see inclusion as the highest endorsement of their current  and future success.  I know they do.  Founders that aspire to build publicly traded companies should see inclusion as a watershed  moment in their founders journey.  Tech executives and high performance operators will use this list to help guide their decisions  on what companies to join.  The brand new 2021 edition of the Enterprise Tech 30 is here, brought to you by Wing Venture  Capital and NASDAQ.  Head over to EnterpriseTech30.com to see who made this year's list.  That's EnterpriseTech30.com.  We thank ET30, Wing and NASDAQ for their support.  I just want to get this off my chest, but we got two great journalists here.  We got Jeff Jarvis, teaches journalism.  By the way, I didn't give you the full credit, so let me do that.  The operatic credit now.  He's the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School  of Journalism at the City University of New York.  So you teach young people how to be good journalists.  And of course, Matthew Ingram, longtime journalist, but also chief digital writer at the Columbia  Journalism Review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the Columbia Journalism Review for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Taylor Lawrence, who by the way is fantastic.  She writes, she's a tech reporter for the New York Times with a beat on social media.  We quote her all the time on this show, almost weekly on this show.  We're going to quote her again.  She's got an article about something really cuckoo.  We're going to get to.  The other night, this bimbo on Fox News, Tucker Carlson says, Taylor apparently tweeted at  some point, you know, hey, I've been harassed.  It's been hell.  It's ruined my life.  And this is a problem for all women on Twitter, all women in public view.  And I know it intimately.  I've seen it happen with friends and family.  And I know Taylor has been horribly harassed by these anonymous on the internet.  Tucker Carlson becomes one of these not anonymous by saying, oh, she's privileged.  How dare she complain about being all her life was ruined.  What an ass.  Not only, not only is he wrong to criticize her for that, but he's bringing down infinitely  more on her head.  And he knows.  And he knows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to Greenwald's is joined in too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Glenn Greenwald said pretty much exactly the same thing.  Why are they all of a sudden picking on Taylor Lawrence?  Of all people, I think it's partly because they see her as someone who just writes about  kids on Tumblr or whatever.  They don't they don't consider what she does to be real.  It's pure misogyny.  Anyway, it's the worst.  It's so misogyny.  Why her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, before Tucker Carlson had a famous episode where he interviewed Lauren Duker and she  just cut him off at the knees.  And what's above the knees?  They weren't there anymore.  It was a great interview.  Lauren was at the time a columnist for Teen Vogue.  And he said she should stick to writing about, you know, thigh high boots or some such thing.  And horrendous misogyny.  And I think that's the worst part of this.  Just like Piers Morgan, who's mad because Megan wouldn't date him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is related, by the way, to somehow I don't understand how Tucker Carlson related  this to the Oprah interview with Harry and Megan, because I guess it's part of a larger  tirade against privileged people complaining about how they're treated.  Right.  She's not a princess.  She's not.  Taylor Lorenz is not in the royal family.  She's not a princess either.  But that's another story for another day.  She's not.  She's a reporter.  She's a frontline reporter for a newspaper who is now going to be I can only imagine,  you know, she was harassed before this.  That's that's where it's unconscionable.  This this should be this is where you get taken down.  This is this is where the marketplace should revolt against not just this guy, but Fox News  in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I blame I blame Glenn Greenwald even more because Tucker, nobody really believes  what that guy says.  He's a complete clown.  But Glenn Greenwald, to say that she basically doesn't deserve to be complaining because  she hasn't suffered real harassment is is him saying, you know, it's only harassment  if I say it is or if it meets my test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, you're absolutely right.  And this is this is something that I'm hundreds to me.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to be doing more about this coming up.  I haven't done anything publicly yet.  So but but we in media tell Facebook and Twitter to clean their houses.  We in media don't clean our own house.  And Murdoch and his minions are a cancer on democracy.  And the fact that Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, who you almost went after, what the  heck go after him to and the big lie and everything they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the reason I thought of Sean Hannity because his defense when he was sued for  defamation was, well, everybody knows everything I do is fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that works.  That was Tucker.  Was that Tucker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I'm confusing the two.  The case equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole the whole argument was nobody nobody sees Tucker as a journalist and nobody  believes that what he says is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can't accept that all of the horrific minions of Tucker Carlson now are going to  be going after Taylor Lawrence, including, by the way, threatening her life.  I mean, look, Brittany Wu, who's a regular on our show, had to move her house because  of Gamergate.  It just stirs up the worst, the worst people in the world.  And they know it and they know that they know it.  It's not this is not what happened in the incited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's incitement.  And there was incitement against our democracy and from the highest of the government.  And there's incitement against these women who are are are are, you know, when I talk  about how good the Internet is, the thing I always have to say is it's easy for me to  say as a as a old white man and I don't get attacked nearly like women do and other people  do.  But they know what they're what they're what they're bringing.  And it's awful.  It's just awful.  And how any company can advertise next to this person apart from the F.E.  Kilo nut job, every advertiser on Earth should be leaving Fox News.  Every journalist on Earth should be saying that we won't appear on their air.  Every organization of journalists should cut them out.  The contact digital content text next gets money from Robert Murdoch.  Online News Association gets money from Robert Murdoch.  They should all be saying Fox News is shunned and shamed and is not among us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And frankly, Glenn Greenwald, who left The Intercept and is now doing a newsletter at  Substack, should be shamed.  He's gone. He should know better.  So we should know better.  Just as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand his worldview now at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I have to say, Glenn Greenwald's writing a little corner of the world that has almost  zero impact compared to Tucker Carlson, who I mean, people don't understand, but TV has  this huge emotional power and wielding it irresponsibly like that is for no good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not even like there's this on TV is authoritative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's no but for him to say that is completely gratuitous.  It's like, let me just pick somebody and beat him up just to show how much power I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's all it's this it's this it's this cancel culture B.S.  Where she's not allowed to say that she's a victim because I am the only victim.  We are the only victims.  The poor put upon right wing media of Fox News.  Oh, no, no, no. People are trying to cancel us and they're getting rid of Dumbo and and Dr.  Seuss and Mr.  Potato Head.  Never mention the 500,000 Americans are now dead.  Never put it in that context.  They're I said this on a show before, but I say it again.  I go back to Hannah Arendt.  What's happens in a totalitarian regime is that is that people give up their daily concerns for an abstract notion that they can rally behind.  So they rally behind not death, not about people's incomes in a pandemic.  They rally behind Mr.  Potato Head and cancel culture.  And those are made up things.  They don't exist.  They exist to try to make people mad.  And that's the power that Tucker Carlson has.  He demonstrates it, as did Donald Trump, by stirring people up, by inciting this.  And it's a moral.  Feel better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you really you really should not.  I mean, look, the job journalists do we carry some responsibilities.  And this guy has been given a very powerful weapon and he's misusing it against another journalist, which is just offensive as hell.  Actually, he's not a journalist.  Nobody takes Tucker Carlson seriously, seriously, except they should, because the guy is a menace to society.  So I've been on MSNBC's air, ask begging them to do something that they're never going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Matthew, we need to talk about this.  How do we get this done?  I'm talking to somebody actually Monday about this idea is we need somebody to start a feature that I call We Watch Fox News so you don't have to.  And what I want is a view of what is your uncle Joe being fed and not being fed.  What is your uncle Joe being fed and not being fed against MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times and the rest of liberal media?  OK, fine.  But but there's a skewed worldview that's being presented that I don't want to watch, but I want to understand what it is.  And media don't except for Matthew and Brian Stelter.  That's about it.  Media don't cover media.  And well, it probably especially Murdoch is part of the story now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It probably feels a little too separate, referential.  I understand that.  And normally, honestly, on this show, I wouldn't be talking about this except that I take it personally.  I mean, just that's really offensive.  She's a tech reporter.  She's not a privileged person.  And she's going to suffer the fires of hell probably for the rest of her life now, thanks to this asshole.  I mean, he's just he's a talk radio blowhard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like Sean Hannity.  It's all it's the worst.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, you can blame Rupert Murdoch for it, but I guess you can also blame Rush Limbaugh a little bit for it because he created it and drove that.  He did.  Trained a great success.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you look at I think it's Yokel Benkler talks about.  Yes.  You know, we're seeing the sort of terrible payoff of basically 50 years of this type of stuff has just become more and more mainstream in Rush Limbaugh.  Effectively started most of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  He was loathsome.  A number of people said, come on, you're going to say something about his passing, aren't you?  I said, no, absolutely no.  No circumstances.  No, because you don't want to hear what I would have to say about his past.  It's about time.  Well, I work so the radio company I work for was his syndicator.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which always made me a little uncomfortable.  They syndicate a lot of right.  But if you're in talk radio, as my radio show is in talk radio, you're surrounded by those people.  That's what talk radio has become.  Thanks to the success of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I called into Howard Stern a week ago and I said I had a theory that if Howard had not been hounded off of broadcast radio, that maybe we wouldn't have ended up with Trump.  What I meant by that was that there would have been an alternative.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There would have been an alternative for all the young men of America.  Oh, I saw on radio somebody other than right wing radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody was talking about poop instead of politics.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Howard said, no, I think that's wrong.  And that was the end of the call.  Matthew, let me ask you a question if I can.  Sure.  I was part of an original meeting that led to this.  And I think it's great that CJR has ombuds people independent of these publications for the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.  Do you have any insight into why Fox wasn't added to that at CJR?  I don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I wasn't part of those discussions, but I assume it's it's along the lines of, you know, nobody trusts them anyway.  I mean, it's not as though they're going to take our advice in any way or pretend that they are listed standards.  So it's it's kind of not worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do think we've got a report on what they do is they say Brian Stelter at CNN wrote a book.  He's got a new version, new edition of his book coming out.  But we Murdoch is a malign actor.  His people are malign actors in our democracy, in our society, in our culture.  We've got to we can't just sit and do it.  I also would recommend to folks, Kevin Rudd, the former neighbor of Tray's, the former prime minister of Australia,  two weeks ago during the whole Facebook thing, gave testimony to the Australian Senate in an effort to get a royal commission investigating media monopoly.  Read Murdoch. And it's brilliant.  It is an hour of gripping video in which Rudd ends saying to the politicians there, the senators up on the on the dais, let's be honest with each other.  We're all frightened of Murdoch.  He said I was frightened of Murdoch when I was prime minister.  We're all frightened of Murdoch.  And that shouldn't be.  And you look at the UK, Tom Watson, a former MP, tried to go after Murdoch and now he's out of parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Murdoch put two of the biggest tech companies in the world, Google and Facebook.  So I guess maybe you should be afraid.  Because he controls the government.  Yeah, he controls the government.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, the book that Matthew mentioned by Yoche Benkler is called Network Propaganda.  I read his Wealth of Networks book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's good.  He's really a deep thinker.  And it's nice to have him.  NYU study Cybersecurity for Democracy studying online misinformation came up with the unsurprising conclusion related to this story that right wing misinformation is just more popular.  People like it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, Leo, I put this on.  I put this on here.  And what struck me about that is I think that the presumption we make is, oh, right wing propaganda gets more engagement because that's what Facebook does to people.  I think it's much more complicated than that.  Much harder to solve than that.  And so we think that the intervention is get Facebook to do it less.  People who want it will seek it out and will engage with it.  I think it goes beyond Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just a societal thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it's not.  I mean, the proof is, look, what happened to talk radio, completely independently of Facebook.  As soon as Rush Limbaugh and the other far right talkers like Michael Savage got on and ratings went through the roof, they just took over talk radio.  And there is a reason ratings go through the roof.  I've listened.  Remember Air America, the left wing alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a regular on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't compelling.  It was wimpy.  Liberals are like, they're just not interesting.  There is the fire and brimstone of the right wing preacher that just somehow grabs you when liberals are going, well, we really have to consider the feelings of people.  And it's just not compelling.  I understand.  I've done talk radio and I understand.  I don't want to fall in the abyss of far right radio, but I'm surrounded by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you think about it, and this applies to Facebook too, anger is one of the most powerful emotions.  Outrage.  And if you can encourage people to feel anger towards someone that they blame for their problems or the problems of the world, then you will get an audience.  It's as simple as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patty Chavsky told us that in network.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.  We've known this as long as there's been mass media.  And apparently it extends not just to mass media, but social media just as well.  In fact, I would say Facebook and Twitter really are just expert at disseminating outrage.  I mean, it's the outrage of the minute just constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember an interview with a news feed, a former Facebook news feed product manager, and he said, what Facebook cares about is engagement.  And you know what's really engaging?  Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess you could also explain the conspiracy theories.  You know, they're somehow engaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's back to the beginnings of our business.  Watch out, Gutenberg moment coming.  Before the first newspapers, broadsheets and news pamphlets were the primary news and ballad singers and news singers.  And what was one of the primary topics besides war?  What?  Witch hunts.  We love witches.  And people got, you want to talk about cancel culture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come to think of it, the Salem witch trials are a perfect example of this kind of mass.  Yes.  Hysteria.  How interesting.  Yeah.  Wow.  So it's human.  It's a human failing.  Frailty that gets exploited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess there's, I mean, what are you going to do if it's a human?  It's like saying, well, don't eat fat food, fattening foods.  Right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what we like.  Well, it's at the end of the day, it's education.  It's humanities.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But can you teach empathy?  I think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you?  I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can.  You can encourage it.  For some reason, I feel like empathy is the root of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you could teach people to walk a mile in the other guy's shoes, then they wouldn't  be so hateful towards the other guy.  That's right.  Go ahead, Ant.  No, I say, I think so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not something that everybody's going to have inherently because we all are different  beings, if you will.  But again, if you put someone in that same scenario with the same deck of cards dealt  to them, let them see how they feel.  This is my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's nature or nurture, but sometimes I've convinced it's a curse, but  I've always, far too much, and this is why liberal radio sucks, I've always said, but  on the other hand, consider what's going on with them.  It drives Lisa crazy.  But on the other hand, they feel this way about this stuff, and it isn't compelling.  It makes people work.  Go ahead, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should walk a mile in someone else's shoes because then you're a mile away and you have  their shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Jim or B's mic's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can hear him laughing all the way over here.  He's just laughing loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.  I was going to say, can you teach empathy?  I was going to use Canada as an example about how you can, but then Matthew said that, so  Canada feigns empathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now let's be honest, Canadians...  Google had an interesting project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember the name of it now.  I think it still exists, and that's effectively what they were trying to do.  They were taking, you know, like terrorists and gang-mahangers and stuff like that, and  they were trying to encourage them to consider the people that they were attacking.  It was actually called Google's empathy lab.  Empathy lab?  Yeah.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when they did this.  I wonder what the...  I'm sure Ruth Porat came along and said, screw you with empathy.  Get the empathy out of here.  It doesn't make a lot of money.  That's the only problem.  I wonder what the upshot of that was.  You also have an effort by...  Sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble, which as I've said on the show, is pretty  much debunked, but Eli's a great guy, and Talia Stroud, a researcher at the University  of Texas who's just brilliant.  They have a project called Civic Signals, where they're trying to come up with measurements  for basically good behavior.  I had this discussion today.  I talked to my old friend David Weinberger, co-author of The Clutrain Manifesto.  Love, love.  The Clutrain Manifesto.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Greatest, greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David's brilliant.  Big fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a discussion with you too, offline as we say.  I redefine journalism every couple of years because I have tenure and I can do that.  So does Tucker Carlson, by the way.  It's our job to convene communities into, I first said civil, informative, productive  conversation.  I realized civil was bad because it's a top-down view of those in power, like the word objective.  So then I did respectful.  But now respectful is also not a good word because it's something that gets imposed upon  people.  And I don't have a word that simply describes the desire for a equitable, decent, fair,  human conversation.  Informed is easy to define and productive is easy to define, but I don't know how to define  that quality of being decent to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then there's Burger King UK.  On International Women's Day, tweeted, women belong in the kitchen.  The problem is this was the beginning of something better.  Theoretically, anyway, but nobody saw it because so many people were so upset about  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone said in a tweet, in an alternate universe, they tweeted Burger Queen and they got 2 million  new followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brianna Wu's response to Burger King was, go F yourself.  Simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was just something their Twitter account did, but they took out a newspaper  ad, like a full page newspaper ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a poorly framed marketing plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, stuff like that happens and you know that's a marketing department, which  means it has to go through a couple levels of approval.  Where are those approval people at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they weren't women probably in all likelihood.  They're not working there anymore.  Bunch of guys.  They were trying to promote Burger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did anybody sit and say, ah guys, you think?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me explain what they were thinking.  Not that it justifies it.  Burger King was, their plan was to announce their, her scholarship, AGR, helping equalize  restaurants for female Burger King employees who want to pursue culinary careers.  So what they were saying is women belong in the kitchen, but it didn't really.  Look here.  In no way does it work.  It was kind of like, and we have scholarships so that women can get better jobs in the kitchen.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guarantee after this happened, some marketing guy was like, but we got a lot of engagement.  Yes.  22,000 retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's fine for Tucker Carlson.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just really want a recording of that Zoom meeting.  Yeah.  It seems like a good idea.  Do you get it?  Do you get what we're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're flipping it on its head.  We're giving women opportunity, but we're going to tweet it like it's some kind of sexist thing,  but it's not.  You get it?  We're going to flip it on its head.  Because we flip burgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're marketing people.  That's what we do.  I don't need a story.  Just give me the facts.  That's all I want.  If I want a story, I'm going to go look at the art.  Tell me about the burgers.  But see, Steakums set that bar really high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Steakums wasn't at all about the product, but anyway.  Let's get back to Google.  This week in Google, Google's flock is a terrible idea, writes the EFF.  We're going to talk about it next Tuesday on Security Now.  This is what Google is replacing the third party cookie we talked about last week.  They made a big, big, lots of hay about how starting next year, they're going to,  Chrome won't support the third party cookie.  And Google said, we're not going to invest in any tracking technology.  So their new technology, which has the worst acronym ever, Federated Learning of Cohorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  They're going to replace marketing.  So some guy replacing a term called the cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We already know Google doesn't have marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're replacing a thing called the cookie, which everybody understands.  They know what cookies are.  Yeah, let's call it Federated Learning of Cohorts.  That's a great one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just commend the EFF for not using the obvious headline, flock you Google.  But anyway, so what they're better than you, Leo.  I know they are.  They always have been.  The idea is, and actually this isn't, in theory, this is not a bad idea.  It's something Apple does as well.  The idea is instead of following you directly, it aggregates information about you and your cohort  so that it's not individualized information.  It boils your browsing down locally into a behavioral label.  And then that is the behavioral label is what gets shared with other websites and advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is the kind of behavioral stuff that people had.  There are companies that say this is an outdoors person.  By zip code.  Well, not just that, but also other behaviors.  This is an outdoors person.  So you end up in an anonymized description useful to advertisers, but doesn't violate your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So EFF writes, we stand at the fork in the road.  Behind us is the era of the third party cookie.  The flock in the road.  Behind us is the era of the third party cookie.  Perhaps the web's biggest mistake.  Ahead of us are two possible futures.  And I actually thought this was good.  In one, users get to decide what information to share with each site they choose to interact with.  This is what Tim Berners-Lee is advocating.  No one needs to worry their past browsing will be held against them or leveraged to me.  Manipulate them when the next open a tab in the other Google's proposal.  Each user's behavior follows them from site to site as a label.  Inscrutable at a glance, but rich with meaning to those in the know.  Their recent history distilled into a few bits is democratized.  They put that in scare quotes and shared with dozens of nameless actors that take part in the service of each web page.  Users in effect begin every interaction with a confession.  Here's what I've been up to this week. Please treat me accordingly.  Now I'm starting to think this is a very, very bad idea.  And that's essentially what the EFF says.  It's going to introduce new privacy risks.  And it's, you know, it's there's all sorts of issues with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you're just asking one thing for another, right?  Before the data streamed out onto the Internet and companies sucked it up.  Now Google's saying, oh, well, we'll just stay on your phone except Google controls your phone and all the things you do on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the issue, too, I think, is this is is that and this is what Facebook ran across multiple, multiple times.  Right. Is is that if you want to I'm trying to think of something that would be useful here.  Adult diapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I'm sorry. I should not have said that.  I'm really sorry. OK, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The prostate guy. Fine. Fine.  But you could you could do the negative of an ad. Right.  So if you want to if you want to start a campaign on equity in work aimed at poor people, that for the best of reasons, that's good.  But then an advertiser can come along and exclude the poor people and only go to the rich people.  Right. Bad example. But stuff like that.  So the question is, what are the categorizations and how could they be misused and will they stay ahead of that?  Otherwise, you know what? The story is going to come up.  I tried to buy an ad for people, white men who were over 65 with white hair on podcasts, buying adult diapers.  And I could do it, you know, because Google let me.  Right. And and and and so any system that can be game will be game and be messed up.  Google's smarter about this in its history than Facebook has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe they'll do it. We still have to we still have to think about the regular consumer out there that is not going to take the time to go through and select what they want to share.  We're talking about the same people that tap except on every single app they install on your phone without knowing that it's saying, hey, I'm going to be listening to your microphone and tracking your location all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. This is why I donate to EFF every month.  Yeah. They say make no mistake.  Make no mistake. If Google does follow through on its plan to implement flocking Chrome, which, by the way, it did or has it's rolled out as a test in Chrome 89.  So millions of people have flock on their browser right now.  The system will probably be opt in for advertisers that will benefit from it, opt out for users who stand to be hurt.  Google will surely tout this as a step forward for transparency and user control.  Just exactly what you're saying, knowing full well the vast majority of its users will not understand how flock works and the tyranny of the default.  Very few will go out of their way to turn it off.  Google will pat itself on the back for ushering in a new private era of the web free of the evil third party cookie, the technology that Google helped extend well past its shelf life, making billions of dollars in the process.  This is the paragraph I like the best.  It doesn't have to be that way.  The most important parts of the privacy sandbox, like dropping third party identifiers and fighting fingerprinting, will genuinely change the web for the better.  Google can choose to dismantle the old scaffolding for surveillance without replacing it with something new and uniquely harmful.  Google needs to learn the correct lessons from the era of third party tracking and design its browser to work for users, not advertisers.  And if they don't, by the way, people will just stop using Chrome.  They'll start using Brave or Edge or something that's de-Googled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not just Google, Leo.  It's every single publisher, every single person advertising out there.  We're dealing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every advertiser wants us to put tracking in somehow magically into podcasting.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's not this is this is, you know, we talked about this last week, but Google has first party data.  They'll probably do it.  OK, I actually don't think that what happens there will be bad.  What happened is the publishers demonized the cookie and and, you know, be careful what you lobby for.  Now they don't have first party data.  They never they never got past having a mass relationship.  They use programmatic advertising.  They're F'd. They have themselves.  You know, there were two ridiculous pieces this week.  I tweeted this morning, start trying to blame Google for what the publishers didn't do.  Right. And so now Google is blamed for everything going behind a subscription wall because advertising doesn't work on the on the publisher sites.  Well, OK, but they could have made it work.  They could have had first party data. They could have built relationships.  And they didn't. They just put up taboo and outbrain and programmatic ads.  Right. So they became they became addicted to the cookie that they demonized.  And now when it gets pulled off underneath them, they've got nowhere to go.  So God knows what happens then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be interesting.  Google has found a unique solution to the the tech tax being lobbied in France since 2019 and starting in Spain this year.  The tax, which, quote, covers a part of the cost of conforming the laws concerning taxes on digital services in France and Spain.  It's really it's really a tax.  It's a tax on Google because they're big in tech.  And so in France, it's a three percent tax on Google's French operations in Spain.  It's also three percent.  What Google's done, though, is is add to their ad rates by two percent.  So so that tax that Google's paying, they're going to pay one percent of it.  But guess who gets to pay the other two percent advertisers and guess who advertisers are going to pass that cost on to.  Oh, yeah. So this is a problem with taxes. Yep. Yeah.  You have to consider where it ends up. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you also have to consider where the taxes go.  This is my argument with Australia is that fine.  Let's say you do tax the platform is more should it go to hedge fund owners of newspapers or should it go to Internet access or should go to go to help?  Yeah, you're going to education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I've French tax brought in 400 million euros in 2019 just to their general fund, I assume.  They don't they don't say it's earmarked for anything in particular.  But I think it's more just, you know, hey, how can we can we get in on some of this Google money basically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It's a deep pocket theory. Yeah. If you have money.  Yeah. Figure out a way to get some of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google just says, yeah, fine. OK, we'll just pass the savings on to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was a story we didn't talk about last week that says that I think it's new head of treasury is open to now some international treaties about this.  Oh, interesting. Would be really important because now what happens is every country says Ireland says, put your headquarters here.  We're nice people. We have nice accents. We have good beer.  What's not to love? Right.  And countries compete with each other the way cities do in the United States and Canada for factories and stuff like that.  So if you had some kind of regime across the countries that would eliminate the loopholes that countries create against each other, then there could be fair tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trump tried to get France to stop, but it effectively I think you're right.  I think it has to be broad multinational has to be a great.  You can't just say, hey, France, don't do that to our company. That's not going to work.  You mentioned Ireland. I have to read this. Then we're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't the best. It was the best.  It has nothing to do with Google, but I'm going to read anyway.  How did you find it? Because I put it on the rundown. I read it. It was well, I've treated it. It was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, probably found it on Twitter social, which is our mastodon instance.  They've been getting a lot of great links there from people.  This is from the Irish Times, Patrick Frayne.  He's writing about the Oprah interview with Harry and Meghan.  The headline Harry and Meghan, the union of two great houses, the Windsors and the celebrities is complete.  After Harry and Meghan, the monarchy looks anarchist. I'm sorry, archaic and racist.  Well, duh, but it's the lead that I love so much.  Having a monarchy next door. I should do this in an Irish accent.  Having a monarchy next door is a little like having a neighbor who's really into clowns  and has daubed their house with clown murals, displays clown dolls in each window,  and has an insatiable desire to hear about and discuss clown related news stories.  More specifically for the Irish, it's like having a neighbor who's really into clowns  and also your grandfather was murdered by a clown.  Beyond this, he writes, it's the stuff of children's stories.  Having a queen as head of state is like having a pirate or a mermaid or an Ewok.  Or an Ewok as head of state. What's the logic?  Bees have queens, but the queen bee lays all the eggs in the hive.  The queen of the Britons has laid just four British eggs,  and one of those is the sweatless creep Prince Andrew, so it's hardly deserving of applause.  That's all.  Keep going. No, keep going.  There's more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep going. I'll just keep going. It's just so wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The contemporary royals have no real power.  They serve entirely to enshrine classism in the British non-constitution.  They live in high luxury and low autonomy, cosplaying as their ancestors.  Isn't that great? I love that one.  Cosplaying as their ancestors.  Isn't that beautiful?  And are the subject of constant psychosocial projection from people mourning the loss of empire.  They're basically a Rorschach test that the tabloids hold up in order to gauge what level of historic battery  their readers are capable of at any moment in time.  The most recent internecine struggle is between the royal family and the newly disentangled Prince Harry  and his wife, the former actor Meghan Markle.  Traditionally, us peasants would be nervously picking a side and retrieving our pikes from the thatch.  That's right too. That's beautiful.  And he does a callback later to the pikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Luckily these days the pitch battles happen in television interviews, and he goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're regular rich folks, and we're not going to be able to do that.  We're regular rich folk, Oprah, no different from you or Tom Hanks or Jeff Bezos.  The couple says.  We cut sporadically to the couple's own property where Oprah and the pair wander in hoodies, jeans, and anoraks  among rescue dogs and chickens, as if to say we're just regular rich folk, Oprah, no different from you or Tom Hanks or Jeff Bezos.  Arch royalists will of course claim those dogs and chickens are crisis actors.  Oprah makes it clear from the start that the questions have not been vetted,  although she reveals her cards when they start discussing the royal wedding.  Oh, thanks for inviting me, by the way.  Oprah describes their wedding as being akin to a fairy tale.  Meghan says it was an out of body experience, and in fact they had a small private ceremony a few days earlier.  I didn't know that.  Meghan admits she was a bit.  That was on the interview.  Yeah, she was a bit. I didn't watch the interview.  I'm getting the best of it right now.  Did you blindside the Queen? asks Oprah, conjuring up an image of Harry sucker punching her with a karate chop.  I picture the wily non-engineering counter punching with the royal dagger between her teeth.  Anyway, it goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she bully staff? Well, no.  Also, isn't bullying staff part of what being a royal has traditionally been about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The Irish have no love for the royal family, I take it. And I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, right. For good reason.  That was so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The potential union of two great houses, the Windsors and the Californian celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we mention the authors? We should. Patrick Crane.  Patrick Crane. I did say his name. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, good. Just brilliantly done.  It is wonderful. It is wonderful. From the Irish Times.  And I apologize for my bad Irish accent, but I had to read it like that.  Let's take a break. Come back. More news. Change logs still to come.  Matthew Ingram joining us, filling in for Stacey.  I don't know if she's really in the chat room or just somebody doing some Stacey cosplay.  Queen Stacey to you. Queen Stacey.  We miss you, Stacey. Come back soon.  But we're glad to have Matthew here from the Columbia Journalism Review.  And actually, it's a good time to have you, although your former colleague at GigaOM.  Is that a GigaOM t-shirt you're wearing?  I wonder if Stacey has a GigaOM t-shirt. That's nice.  Thank you. You're muted, Matthew.  Yeah, look at that. Anyway, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a GigaOM running shirt that we got.  Oh, nice. I'm pretty good, but I'm no Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're both two of my faves. I miss GigaOM and I miss OM for that matter, too.  Should we have OM on? I feel like we should. Oh, that'd be great.  Yeah, we'll get OM on sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a piece on the rundown last week. His blog is great.  Last week, where OM was contemplating reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. His blog is a really nice combination of articles about technology  and deep philosophical thinking and watches and photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's quite a good photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's really good. I miss OM, so we'll have him on soon.  The Yoda of tech. Except he doesn't talk backwards.  We also have Jeff Jarvis here from the famous Craig Newmark, etc.  Radical Germanism.  And of course, from Hands On Photography, Ant Pruitt.  The Ant Pruitt.  It was fun to have Trayon, wasn't it? Talk a little bit about photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that guy. So cool and so just zen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's very zen. He's very zen. He is zenner than zen.  Our show today brought to you by the folks at ITProTV, old friends,  who do an amazing job if you're looking to get into IT.  You know this, Ant. You worked in IT.  If you don't have any experience in IT, it's hard to talk your way into an IT job.  The easiest way to get that first job is with the certifications.  Certifications. That's why the cert system exists.  Certifications like CompTIA's A plus cert or network plus cert or security plus cert.  Those show you have the baseline of knowledge that gets you in the door.  And then once you're in IT, and we have so many people I know who watch the show  or participate in the show who are IT professionals, you know it's part of the thing that makes the job great  is that it's constantly changing. There's always new stuff, new versions of the programs, new things to learn.  ITProTV is for both people who want to get into IT, but people also who want to brush up on their IT skills.  And they have amazing trainers, even a seasoned IT professional can respect because they are people working in the field.  They're not hired for their good looks, although they're good looking.  They're not hired for their fun, entertaining demeanor, although they're fun and entertaining.  They're hired because of their knowledge, but combine the three and you've got the best online IT training platform.  They do it kind of like we do. They have seven studios in their Gainesville facility.  They're open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., cranking out content.  The reason they do that is because everything's always changing, so their content is always kept fresh.  But there's always at least 5,800 hours of fresh, engaging video training online on demand for you.  So you can watch live, but you can watch on demand.  ITProTV works on your laptop, on your Android or iOS device.  They've got a Fire TV, a Roku, an Apple TV app, so you can watch it or listen to it wherever you are.  ITPro's business platform is awesome for anybody like us who want to support online IT training for their IT leaders and employees.  It's part of the ACI learning portfolio of audit, cyber and IT learning solutions for consumers and enterprises.  You get courses on every topic, malware detection, you've got to stay up on that, right?  Cryptography, pen testing, end user security awareness.  How do you train your users not to get you in trouble?  ITProTV is the only official video training partner for CompTIA.  You know you're in the right place for getting the right certs.  This month, Cisco Month at ITProTV, 12 Cisco courses, CCNA, CCNP, CCD, Encore, SLED, and RC.  I mean they got them all. They're also hosting a live webinar tomorrow with Cisco award winner David Bombal.  It's called Get Hands On with Cisco. You can watch that March 11th.  But even if you're not around for the live event, you can watch on demand thereafter at ITPro.tv slash webinars.  You'll see a lot of great webinars there.  And don't forget Don Pezzetti. He's one of the founders, great podcast tech NATO featuring industry guests, IT news recaps.  That's free. Everybody can listen to get a deep dive into the IT realm.  Also, I like to put this in because these guys are doing not only a great job for their customers, but for their community.  Last year they served 30 plus COVID impacted educational institutions with free training.  So, you know, that's one of the things they can do. Isn't that great?  That's one of the things they know how to do and they helped them out.  There's 225,000 members now at ITProTV and I think we could take a little bit of credit for that.  We've been sending people there since they started in 2013.  ITProTV. Here's how we're going to get you involved. You've been thinking about it. I know you have.  All you have to do is go to ITPro.tv slash twit.  If you decide to sign up for any of the consumer subscriptions, don't forget to use the offer code TWIT30.  That's TWIT30. You get 30 percent off and not just for the first month or year, but for as long as you stay active forever.  If you keep doing it, ITPro.tv slash twit offer code TWIT30 for 30 percent off the lifetime of your active subscription.  ITProTV. Build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey.  There's so many stories. I don't know if we're going to get to all of them.  Google has announced the Cloud Next conference will be coming up in October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In real life or digital?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They haven't decided. They don't know yet.  It's interesting because we were talking about this earlier today rather with Paul and Mary Jo on Windows Weekly.  Microsoft, it was leaked. Maybe it's not official, but leaked a slate of all their events.  They're going to continue to be virtual at least through March of next year. And why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Mobile World Congress says they're going to be in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did that last year. Do you remember that? They did the same thing last year. And then at the last minute they said, yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody bailed too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody's going to go to Barcelona right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Barcelona doesn't want anybody right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want Barcelona. I miss Barcelona.  Yeah, me too.  I think half the reason people went to Mobile World Congress is Hamon Iberico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For Matthew and me, it's Perugia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Are you going to get to do Perugia this year?  Not this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not this year.  Well, this year, no. They've canceled. It'll be about now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a big journalism conference in one of the most beautiful medieval towns of Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's the dish there that I love and I learned to love there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cacio e pepe.  By the way, ever since you started talking about that, I had never heard of it until you mentioned it.  Now I see recipes for everywhere.  Everywhere. It's suddenly like the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first time we went, I read and watched a bunch of Anthony Bourdain.  And the first thing he said was to go out and find a tiny little trattoria somewhere in the neighborhood, far away from everywhere, and have some cacio e pepe.  Anthony Bourdain.  So we did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So smart. Such a good guy. By the way, another guy Trey Radcliffe knew well.  What?  Yes.  I know.  Speaking of the wonderful, talented, brilliant, perspicacious, ubiquitous journalist, capital J journalist Taylor Lawrence, today in the New York Times article about a new app, which I immediately downloaded called Nunu.  In the app, you, as a contributor to a digital creator, get to tell them what to do.  You get to the creator.  Not sex, right?  No. Well, I'm not sure.  It describes this product as creating a human stock market.  I don't know if that's stock as in equities or stock as in cows.  On the app, fans pay to vote in polls to control some of a creator's day to day decisions.  A creator can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so dystopian. This is like Black Mirror. It's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the logical conclusion. A lot of TikTok stars are on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like a circus. It's just like, you know, going on the midway.  It's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A creator can use Nunu to post a poll asking which sweater they should wear today or who they should hang out with, where they should go.  Fans purchase, purchase voting power on Nunu's platform to participate in the polls with enough voting power.  You spend enough money. You get to watch their favorite influencer live, live out their wishes.  It's a real life choose your own adventure.  So I opened Nunu. Don't zoom in too close on this.  I started as I started. Nunu is very much like TikTok.  Right. So you swipe up. Let me see. This is trending.  And when I realized that a lot of what Nunu is, is people shaking their tuchuses for money.  It's pretty much what TikTok has turned into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, underage. No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's I don't understand it.  Here, maybe we'll maybe Cameron was get voting power to unlock.  See what Cameron's going to do. See, I haven't gotten any voting power, so I can't unlock what Lev Cameron's going to do next.  You do that with money, right?  Yeah, real money, not even Bitcoin. No, no actual money.  Don't do it. I always try to get you to buy things.  I'm not going to do it.  Don't buy Cameron.  No, don't buy him. No, I just assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume somewhere there's an app that's like that, but it's just for paying to watch people eat or something weird like that.  It was called Justin.TV. It's not Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think really honestly, do you tell me, when you when you do a Twitch channel, I know Chad Johnson, OMG, Chad told me this.  As you're doing stuff, people in your chat room can contribute, can give you money.  And for a lot of Twitch creators, it could be a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I do it on YouTube live. They have what they call super chats.  And basically, if they donate, their chat comment pushes up to the top and gives me a little notification so I could see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not so different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has anybody asked for anything weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, one of the weirdest things for me is this Wacom tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, yeah, it's one of those, you know, touch things you draw with people like people like this right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? ASMR. Oh, the ASMR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like that because I use that while I'm doing my post-processing on ASMR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just do it a little bit for us and we can make some money.  Just do it for us. Just do some.  That's amazing. Just a little ASMR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does nothing for me. Yes, listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get it out here. Damn thing. Get it closer. Get it above the mic.  I don't hear it.  No, no, it's making me hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to stop now. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Nunu, Taylor Lawrence.  See, this is why they mock her because she writes about these trends.  But you know what? That's because they're old, stupid, old men.  She didn't make it. She's just saying it's going on.  And it is going on. It's a big and it's part of this changing world.  But the youngs understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Taylor also got... go ahead, Beth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say everything new that I've ever found out about  has been from a Taylor Lawrence story.  They call the hype houses and all of that stuff.  I follow her like, yeah, she's brilliant.  She covers that stuff like nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She also suffered from male abuse on Clubhouse and after.  Oh, God. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm over Clubhouse.  A lot of that was pushed by some pretty prominent people  because she created a burner account to get into rooms that Mark Andreessen  had blocked journalists from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was doing journalism, right?  That's called doing journalism.  I mean, is there an ethical consideration there?  Pretending...  There is a bit of one, yeah.  If you're going to cover something, you should always go in as a...  You should go in as a journalist.  With a fedora with it says press in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So people do do undercover journalism, but you have to be justified by the...  by what you're reporting on.  So if it's child trafficking, then most people will say, okay, sure, go undercover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or proving that Chicago...  There was a great case where the Chicago sometimes bought a bar  just so that they could get hit up for bribery by the police and the city.  Wow.  So they didn't have a sign outside saying, sometimes bar, bribe us here, you know,  because otherwise they couldn't have gotten the story and it was a great story.  Yeah.  One of the classics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another bit from this Taylor Lawrence piece.  It's in the style section, so okay.  There's a potential to earn a huge amount of money, said Joshua Wanders, 30,  a YouTube creator with more than 8.7 million subscribers.  He said it's pretty much 100% profit driven by mania.  This week, Mr. Wanders, I love how the Times gives you the...  Mr. the honorary, Mr. Wanders.  Mr. Loaf.  Mr. Wanders and four other creators will release photos of their feet as NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so is there anything that she wrote about there any dumber than NFTs?  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The creators will upload their feet photos onto an auction site and livestream the bidding.  The livestream will also be monetized.  You have to pay to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Internet of feet is a very powerful phenomenon.  I don't want to know about it.  Don't look into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That explains a lot because I constantly see TikToks.  I'm going to stop using TikTok because it's been taken over now by young women who want to show their assets.  There's constant TikTok, show us your toes, show us your toes.  Is that why?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, many women who just post normal photos on Instagram and other old people,  things like that, if there are feet in it, you will get bombarded with messages.  Is it that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I know about I've heard of foot fetishes, but it must be this widespread.  I think maybe they're just more vocal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's just a tad something about TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's the great it's the great clay shirky story about the beginnings of Meetup that after they kind of opened up to any meetup that the trending meetup was witches.  Yeah, because they had nowhere else to meet.  Where are you going to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They haven't found a place to meet.  Right.  Right.  So.  All right.  Stacey's putting articles in here.  Man, Stacey's in the chat room.  She's putting articles in.  She can't keep away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe just John didn't give her the Zoom.  Is that what it was?  No, no, no, no.  She called in sick.  That's a joke because I couldn't get in on the Zoom, folks.  That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it's working.  You look great.  It was working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  I think I tried to tell you to do Zoom a year ago.  Oh, I'm sure you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure I was completely wrong.  I think we're now looking at getting, because of Alex Lindsay on MacBreak Weekly yesterday  saying there's no better solution than Zoom.  And he does this like you.  He does this for, but he does it for a living.  The audio is better in Zoom.  Is the audio better?  Yeah, they've actually improved their audio.  They've added new features.  I'm very worried that Skype is drifting off.  You know, Microsoft's already said we're going to merge it into Teams.  The last thing I want to do is use Teams for the show.  Oh, no.  OBS Ninja, which we had high hopes for because it's open source WebRTC, seems to have trouble  with our network configuration.  I'm going to talk to our network guy about that, Russell.  But Zoom's doing all the things right and everything.  So, yeah, maybe we'll, everything's optimized for Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the other, there was a story in here where I said there were the origin story.  Blue Jeans?  Well, Blue Jeans, Facebook used to use it because they weren't allowed to use anything  that was Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember Blue Jeans.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was another sort of open source one too.  I can't remember the name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't remember the name of it.  So Hopin just got around and I forget what makes Hopin different.  But interestingly, the founders said that he was diagnosed with a serious health condition  prevented him from venturing outside my home.  He was unable to meet people, attend events and conferences while on the question.  You're like, sound familiar?  So he made Hopin.  So here's Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how Clout started.  Do you remember Clout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, Clout was terrible.  Yeah.  With a K, Clout with a K that was to somehow raise your social network.  Measuring your value on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I met the guy who started it and he started it because he I think had jaw surgery or something.  So his jaw was wired shut.  And so he basically had to stay home and couldn't think of anything to do.  So we created Clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Let me drive people crazy.  I'll make Clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Stacey, here's the note.  Stacey isn't going to be here but wanted us to talk about this because wants y'all to talk about this because it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's a great tradition in this country going back to Ben freaking Franklin.  Ben Franklin.  The public library.  It's a great institution where when a book is published, the library buys some copies so they can lend them out to customers.  It used to be there was a library in every town.  But of course, as we enter the digital world, times have changed.  Libraries want to lend ebooks.  And there are ways to do that.  There are platforms to do that.  The limit the number of people can borrow at any one time.  You still have to check it out.  You get it for a limited amount of time.  Just just like borrowing a regular book, you know, two weeks or whatever.  And there's only a certain number of copies.  The publishers seem OK with that.  But guess who's not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They weren't crazy about it.  But they but they came to be publishers.  Hate it.  Yeah, that's better.  That's a better way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no way libraries would create would be created now if you tried to create the library system now, which is too bad because it's a great public benefit, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah.  So it's part of the culture to decide what goes into the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So thousands of public libraries offer ebooks and audiobooks free just like they would regular books.  There are various platforms.  One of the biggest is Libby, Libby app.  And with the Libby app, you got the first thing it says is, do you have a library card?  And it then says, here's your here's your closest library.  Use my location, Libby.  Allow location access.  He's look here.  Libby's found my library.  OK, good.  There's my library.  Sonoma County Petaluma Library.  Yes, this is my library.  And then I can use my library card to borrow books, except digital books, except if it's from Amazon, because it turns out publisher.  Amazon is the publisher.  If Amazon is a publisher.  Yeah, because in most cases, it's random house or Simon & Schuster or somebody else.  But Amazon does one company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yes, it's all pretty much random house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Who publishes Dr. Seuss?  Random House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's no.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we'll talk about that.  I thought it was his estate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, maybe.  Well, they own the rights.  But I don't know if that's the publisher.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Amazon has decided Penguin Random House.  Yes, same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's random house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They fool you because they have these imprints.  Penguin. You think penguins, penguin books.  God, I remember when I first went as a kid, I went to Europe and we're in England.  We can get Penguin Books.  They were the best paperbacks.  Remember Penguin Paperback?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The name of the company should be Random Penguin House.  Would you not agree?  Yes.  They're missing a good bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Want to borrow that ebook from the library?  This is in the Washington Post.  Jeffrey Fowler.  Sorry, Amazon won't let you.  He starts by talking about Mindy Kaling's book.  It's gone missing from the library.  Her new story collection, Nothing Like I Imagined,  isn't in there because she switched to Amazon as her publisher.  Probably gets a bigger cut, right?  Because she's going with Amazon.  And it says it's not going to sell downloadable versions of its more than 10,000 ebooks  or tens of thousands of audiobooks.  I wonder if this includes Audible, which I'll get it does because Audible is  a publisher of audiobooks as well.  The libraries, they don't believe in libraries.  Apparently they've been talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because people can also use the library to decide if they want to purchase the book,  not just to borrow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the main reason you use the library is so you don't have to buy it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the main reason you use the library is so you don't have to buy it because you probably can't afford it.  Can't afford it, that's right.  But then there's some people that they love to read, but they've been burned a few times  by buying a book that's stunk out loud.  And they get the bars and read a couple chapters and say, huh, maybe I should do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, in fact, often the case that I'll buy an audiobook from Audible or a Kindle book from Amazon  and then end up buying a hardcover.  But I can afford that.  And so the whole point of a public library is to bring education to everybody  regardless of whether they can afford it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently Amazon...  What's Audible's policy?  A book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get a chapter in a book and say, I just hate this and return it, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you won't find Audible in the library because I just found out, reading Jeffrey's article,  that it is also not going to the library.  Amazon publishes audiobooks and audiobooks under its own brands, including, I didn't know this, Lake Union.  Amazon loves doing this, making up these fake brands that have some snooty names like Thomas and Mercer.  That sounds like a nice English company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In business since 1746, I think.  Tweed suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Mercer has passed, but I still run the company.  No, no, it's Jeff Bezos.  Cosplay. Audible.  So those aren't going to go in there either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So can I give you a contrast to this?  Yes.  So I talked to David Weinberger today just because we hadn't talked too long.  And I didn't know this.  He edits a series at MIT called Strong Ideas.  And here's the fascinating thing.  I was trying to think about whether to try to do something like this with my book.  They sell print editions of the books in the bookstores, but they also are digital open access.  Oh, nice.  Available on the Pub Pub platform.  So you could print it.  There's another book.  I just, this is to your point, Ant and Leo.  It's a sales pitch.  There's a new book out called How Humans Judge Machines.  So I said, wow, it's open access.  I could download the entire PDF.  I did.  I read a few pages and I said, I got to mark this up.  I bought the 30 bucks.  I bought the hardcover.  Same thing with speaking of Yochai Benkler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did the same thing with MIT and his wealth of nation, wealth of networks.  And I did download it and I did buy it.  So that's your point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he did it with network propaganda, too.  Did he?  Yeah, I think this is his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People like Corey Doctorow, Benkler are deep believers in this idea of open access.  And Corey has always said, Corey publishes everything for free digitally.  He's always said, I do just fine.  Thank you.  People will buy my books.  Even if I offer them for free, people will buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've talked to the publisher, McMillan, and Corey does drive them nuts because he wants  the Corey way.  But he's so popular and so good.  He can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he can do it.  And thank goodness there are authors, because there's a lot of authors who don't have that  clout, who just have to go along.  Thank goodness authors like Corey, who have the clout and all the incentive in the world  to not make it freely available, still do.  So I would love to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might try to do it if they'll take it.  But that because an author wants two things, right?  An author wants some money, but an author also wants to get ideas out there.  Why do I blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some would argue they want a second book as well.  That second book deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a certain amount of faith.  It was in Paulo Coelho, who published The Alchemist.  Yeah.  He may have been the first to really embrace this a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I interviewed him about this for my book.  And he got caught by his publisher.  He pirated his own books.  I love that.  He created demand in some languages.  But it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Germany.  Yeah, he did it in Germany in particular.  And he said that he was someone said, but people will steal your books.  And he said, most of those people weren't going to buy my books anyway.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's always the point I've made about game piracy is those aren't people.  We're going to buy the game.  So The Alchemist, initial print run was 900 copies through a small Brazilian publisher.  And they decided, yeah, that's we didn't reprint it.  That was it.  So he had another book, which did well.  The Alchemist took off.  But a lot of it because he gave it away.  And he's a believer in that.  And it really has made him a star, a celebrity, a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has sold, you want to guess how many books he has sold?  How many copies he's sold so far?  350 million.  Wow.  Paulo knows what he's doing.  However, so I saw him at pardon me for this, I don't do it anymore, but you can make fun of me still at Davos.  So Paulo and I were at the same dinner with Sergey Brin.  And my publisher had sent over a box of what will Google do?  So I was giving them away.  And and policy don't give them away.  So they were rich.  No, he got mad at me for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy was giving his own book away.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, no, no, no.  You know, you're doing for the reasons I do it.  But when it comes to selling the hardcover books, you sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take the rich, take the rich.  Yeah.  So what's going on at Twitter really feels like Twitter is kind of reinventing itself.  They've talked about super follows as a way to build revenue.  Apparently, they're working on a big overhaul of TweetDeck and considering making it a paid service that would, you know, I have mixed feelings about that because I love Tweet.  That's the only way I use Twitter's TweetDeck.  But TweetDeck hasn't really been kept up to date for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, this is all stuff they should have done five years ago.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they Bill Gross, I don't know if this is known or not.  I don't think he'd be objecting to me saying this.  Bill Gross was an inch away from buying TweetDeck.  Bill, Bill of Ideal.  This is well-known.  Loved Twitter, absolutely loved Twitter and saw the potential and wanted to do things around it.  And so he was an inch away from buying TweetDeck.  And then Twitter came in and scooped in underneath of them.  And basically, the threat was no API for you.  And so we lost it.  And then Twitter just sat on it and didn't do anything with it.  Neelay Patel had a big article yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twitter didn't want him to do that.  But they didn't want any of the third party clients to succeed.  They really wanted it all to be first party.  Big interview with Kayvon Bakepour, who is Twitter's head of consumer product.  Neelay Patel yesterday on The Verge.  Lots of information about what Twitter's planning.  There's Twitter Spaces, which is basically their clubhouse.  Fleets we know about.  We've talked about that.  They bought Revue recently.  We talked about that too, which is a substack-style newsletter publisher.  Super Follows, which will let people pay creators on Twitter for special content.  I should try it with pictures of my feet.  Dude, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Can I pay you not to do that?  I'll pay you not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  So do that.  I start tweeting pictures of my feet and say, if you don't want to see pictures of my feet, pay me.  Subscribe here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's brilliant.  Pay me not to say moral panic.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd pay you not to say moral panic.  I would.  I know you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of these things that Twitter is trying started with, what's the name, Elliott Management, the hedge fund.  Oh, interesting.  They really put a fear into Jack and the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're one of those activist investors who pressures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they got into product ideas or just, no, you need to innovate?  You need to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I think they basically said, you guys need to make some cash.  We don't care what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need you to do some stuff.  Make some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to make some money.  You need to get those daily active users up.  We don't care what it is.  We don't care how.  Just do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you need some revenue.  Put that undo option in there.  I saw it there finally.  Yeah, pay for that.  Starting to test that out.  You getting it?  Do you have it?  I don't have it yet.  I just saw that they were testing out those new things.  They never let me use any of the new things.  Yeah.  I did get pulled into spaces.  Is that what it's called?  Did you?  Yeah, spaces.  Their audio.  Yeah, I don't have that.  No, I got pulled into someone else's because I didn't really request it.  I didn't care to.  But it was pretty neat to hop in and just chat and share information with other folks  and see other people popping in and joining and leaving feedback.  It was pretty neat.  But at the same time, I'm thinking about Clubhouse and all of the benefits there, but it's still,  it's just closed off.  If you don't have an iPhone, you're out of luck.  Yeah.  I don't like that idea.  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, worth reading the interview.  It's long.  It's not if there were anything like, oh, they're about to do this, I would say it,  but it's not, it's not immediately clear what they're.  They can create spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can create a new email newsletter.  They can go to the moon.  They can go to the Mars, but they can't give us an edit button.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Undo, edit something.  I believe the only way you can get your tweet back is if you curse in it or something, right?  If you put an exclutive in your tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well hell, then I can get rid of all mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe we tried it out on Twig not too long ago.  Mr. LaPorte said something pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said it's something bad to me, didn't he?  Pretty kind to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll just say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I couldn't take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, I missed that.  So Twitter is testing an undue option after sending tweets.  You can kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the way it works is with the progress bar.  And I suspect that what they're really doing is not sending the tweet for a period of time.  Same as Gmail.  Just like Gmail.  Because the same problem, Twitter has the same problem, is that as soon as it's published,  that tweet goes out into a lot of different places.  You can't take it back.  Right.  You can't take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is why the edit is a problem because it's RSS basically.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's difficult.  Or you can slow down your Twitter by living in Russia.  Oh yeah.  They don't like what people are saying on Twitter.  So they've slowed it down with the threat of closing it down.  I think.  Is this about the Navalny protests?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter didn't take down protest content.  So they're slowing it down.  Then they tried to slow down a bunch of other services.  I saw on, you know, I was using Google Translate on Twitter.  And evidently the government, I think, accidentally kind of slowed down their own sites.  So it didn't work so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and we mentioned, I think we mentioned, maybe not.  We mentioned on Sunday that India is threatening to arrest executives of Twitter and Facebook  for allowing posts about the farm protests.  India had required that these companies have in-country executives they could talk to if there were issues with the content.  And that's how they're going to talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, India's new regulation says that they're going to have,  all the platforms are going to have to take down things that are false or that threaten government unity.  Yeah.  Line 116, pages four and five.  Yeah.  You'll see a long list of things that they're going to require.  And what do you do with the platform?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to Andrei Soldatov, Russia's slowing down of Twitter caused the outage of some government websites.  Yikes.  It was meant to be a nationwide test of the sovereign roulette infrastructure,  partly a warning to global platforms and partly a soothing message to Putin getting emotional.  And it failed on all fronts.  So I guess when you build a great firewall, sometimes it has consequences beyond the people you're targeting.  It's like a Death Star.  You know, when you kill a planet, it all goes.  There's nothing much you could do.  Twitter is suing Texas, according to Fox Business.  They allege that the Texas Attorney General is seeking to punish Twitter for taking Trump's account offline.  Paxton, Ken Paxton, the beloved attorney general of Texas, announced and he's being investigated himself for bribery,  announced and invest. Is it bribery or corruption?  I can never keep it straight.  Paxton announced an investigation at Twitter and four other major technology companies for what he called the, quote,  seemingly coordinated deplatforming of the president.  Yeah, it's coordinated.  Yeah.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Line 122, similar story.  The governor is trying to get on the act now so people forget about the fact that they couldn't drink any water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wants to ban social media, wants to ban Facebook and Twitter from banning, where they're banned from banning.  Big tech's efforts to censor conservative viewpoints is un-American and we're not going to allow it in the Lone Star State, y'all, says Greg Abbott.  You know, it's not as bad as Modi's India.  But.  It's a slippery slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least we have a First Amendment that we can go to court on and say no.  No, you can't do that.  No.  Sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you thought maybe the Biden administration would take it easy on big tech, we mentioned Tim Wu is going to the National Economic Council.  But there is another appointment. This doesn't mention it.  I should find that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tim Wu, who wrote a journal article some years ago asking whether the First Amendment is obsolete.  Just want to add that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yikes.  I didn't know that.  What?  Maybe he was just talking.  Well, I think Wu says some good things.  I like the kill switch and the intention merchants.  And in fact, I think we interviewed him for triangulation, as I remember, on the intention merchants.  But he also is widely quoted for wanting to break up Facebook.  I'm in a moral panic.  And now Lena Khan, who's another Columbia University scholar, is, according to nominated to the Federal Trade Commission.  She is also kind of known for her anti big tech stance.  Wu was in the Obama administration and says he regrets allowing the Facebook mergers, all the big tech mergers that the Obama antitrust, the FTC and so forth.  Well, like it was up to him.  Well, he was an advisor. He was an advisor at the time.  He said, I regret it. I think we should have been harder on that.  So it's going to be interesting to see if this is a...  He's a pretty thoughtful guy.  But at the same time, I think more and more people in the Biden administration who are on record as being kind of, let's break up big tech.  They're too powerful.  This is, I think, a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a hearing.  I just sent to a representative a statement.  I got called for a hearing this Friday from Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee to see whether I would be a likely witness.  Then I told them what I thought.  And they said no.  I think not.  Maybe the Republicans will get you in there.  Well, no, I mean, I don't agree with them either.  But I wrote a statement.  I'll put it up online probably Friday when the hearing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they actually said, well, what are your feelings on breaking up big tech?  And when you told them, they said, oh, we're not going to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, it was a very nice, nice, wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't want somebody who's defending big tech up on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not defending big tech.  I'm ridiculing stupid regulation.  That's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's kind of ad hominem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they want to... Australia, that sounds interesting.  Let me tell you why it's not.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Let us play the drums.  Bang the gong.  It's time for the Google change.  Jason added some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last time I looked, there was three things here.  Oh, Jason's working hard.  Jason's working.  Oh, it's keyboard steaming.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New things coming your way from the big goog.  Camera based Google Fit heart and respiratory rate tracking,  which we've talked about before, was announced last month.  Is now rolling out with version 2.51.19 of Google Fit.  There'll be a new check your heart rate and track your respiratory rate.  If you have a pixel, I do somewhere.  I shall have to check and see if my Google Fit is updated.  I'm checking my version now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should see because...  Yeah, I'm not on 2.51.  I'm still on 2.50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be kind of cool if I could demo it.  I'll turn it on and we'll see if we can get it working here.  Google Voice is going to stop forwarding text.  This is really a problem for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Using Google Voice must be torture because it's just bit by bit.  They take off one finger this week and then they take off the one toe next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I'm not sure if this is going to affect me or not.  This is a feature I use all the time, which would forward text messages to my linked numbers.  This is the notice that you'll get on that setting in your Google Voice.  Important message forwarding to linked numbers will stop soon because mobile carriers have started to block these messages.  That's always been the problem with Google Voice is that that phone number has never been treated like a real phone number.  All right. It's all look like spammy.  Well, or just like you try to use that Google Voice number as a for, you know, text updates and stuff.  And people say, oh, you can't use that.  So carriers, I don't I don't think like that.  They don't like the gateway or whatever.  So SMS forwarding about to go away.  Just a word of warning.  Happy birthday, by the way, to Chromebooks.  Ten years old.  Happy birthday to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  One person celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Birthday to the best, inexpensive, wonderful laptop you can have without any problems.  Happy birthday to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a party if only one person goes in?  Yeah.  Hey, hey, no, I like Google's linking Android phones to Chromebooks with a new phone up feature.  This is a feature that Microsoft touted the your phone feature on Windows.  You'd think you'd think there'd be better integration between your your Chrome OS and your and your require a Microsoft phone.  No, no.  Is that funny?  Android phone.  No, actually, your phone works really nice on Windows with, say, a Samsung Chrome OS is getting a bunch of features to celebrate its 10th anniversary.  The biggest addition, according to The Verge, a new phone hub feature that connects an Android phone to a Chromebook allows Chrome OS users to respond to texts,  check a phone's battery life, enable its Wi-Fi hotspot and locate a device easily.  This is not I don't know.  Do you use your pixel to log into your Chromebook?  That's a nice feature.  I use that.  But this will be this will go a step farther, which is which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My pixel isn't logged in all the time.  I said that I've complained about this in the show because Google Maps doesn't know this spot on Earth.  So I have to I have to every single time I use my phone in my own home, I have to you don't exist here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, stop living in a bunker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were me, too, you know, you might have to.  It's it's it's enlighten self-interest, man, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me just see if I have an update for my my Google Fit.  I have a lot of updates.  There's so many updates.  I haven't updated in a while, obviously.  Aren't they supposed to happen automatically?  Seems like sometimes I'll go in there and there's 50 updates.  Well, I'll let those I'll let that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably something you did.  No, yeah, probably.  Google update me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  You'll find the phone hub in a taskbar widget that expands to show you recent Chrome tabs you've been browsing on your phone.  That's nice.  So some some real nice.  This is good.  This is the kind of thing Apple does with the iPhone.  Microsoft even does with Android phones.  Now it's on Chrome OS.  Chrome OS is also going to add nearby share between Chromebooks and other Android and Chrome OS devices, kind of like AirDrop for Chrome OS.  It let people send and receive files between devices.  This is going to arrive in the coming months.  New screen capture tool will be in the quick settings menu on Chrome OS.  It'll let you record your screen as well as take screenshots and you can access them quickly in a space that is called.  Tote.  Like everybody knows what a tote is.  Tote.  You tote your flocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They couldn't call it something like, you know, I don't know, screenshots.  They call it tote.  OK, I hear that word and I can hear my grandmother asking me to tote the groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The grocery is the clipboard is also being improved in Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can save five recent items to paste elsewhere without switching windows.  The launcher key will provide access to this updated clipboard experience.  Quick answers lets you right click a word in Chrome OS to get a definition transition.  Or unit conversion.  Again, a feature Mac OS has had for years.  The virtual desktop.  Do you ever use your Chrome OS virtual desktops?  I think that's a nice feature.  It's called desks.  When you reboot a Chromebook, it will now restore all windows to their correct virtual desktops so you can get it all set up, get it all looking good and it'll remember it.  That's cool.  You can even right click on the title bar and send a word to the desktop.  You can also right click on the title bar and send a window to another workspace.  So that's cool.  I have to play with that because I live on workspaces both in Linux and on Macintosh.  Like, well here I could show you.  I've got this is the article.  This is the chat room.  This is our ad.  I've got multiple workspaces set up.  And that makes it very, because I like to go full screen, so it makes it very easy.  This is Linux, but Mac has something very similar.  Windows does too.  I really like to work that way because maybe the iPad's influenced me.  I like full screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to do that, but I don't do it as much now.  But it was nice to be able to separate projects in different environments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's really nice if it remembers that between boots.  Right?  Really nice.  So that's going to be a good selling point for Chrome OS.  Happy birthday, Chrome OS.  Ten years old.  I guess so.  It was about ten years ago.  Jeff, we got our little black CR-48.  Well, you got your CR-48.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't there that year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you weren't?  I was jealous.  Yeah, Google I.O.  They handed them out.  Google Chrome is moving to a four week update cycle.  They were on a, I think, a six week update cycle.  So major versions now are released every six weeks with smaller security updates every other week.  This year, Google is going to move to a four week rotation.  So I think that's probably a good idea.  They say as we've improved security.  Yeah, probably.  As we've improved our testing and release processes for Chrome and deployed biweekly security updates to improve our patch gap,  it became clear we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly.  So it isn't for security because you're getting those security updates biweekly.  It's for features, feature updates.  They fixed the patch gap.  That's the good news.  Whatever you've heard, there is no patch gap.  You might be interested in this, Ant.  According to XDA developers, Google Photos is starting to roll out the advanced video editor.  I've been waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep checking for the update and I still haven't gotten it.  Yeah, it's in the March feature drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you have to be a Google One customer.  You know that some of the features of Photos, you have to be a Google One customer.  Right. I am.  Yeah, I am too.  No exact date because it's a staggered rollout, but expected to go wide this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like waiting for your COVID shot.  Yeah. You have both of them now, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's good to go.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one.  You got one?  Oh, yay.  All right.  And you have an appointment for the other one?  I got one of the good ones.  You got one of the good ones?  They're all good.  You know, as far as I'm concerned, if you avoid death, that's good.  Yeah.  I'll take whatever you got that'll keep me from getting seriously ill or dying.  That's good.  That's a good start.  Google Meet breakout rooms can now be set up before the call using your Google Calendar.  That's all I have to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you have TV kids profiles arriving on the Chromecast this month with parental controls  and time limits.  So, that's nice if you have that new Chromecast with Google TV.  A couple of nice features for parents.  And finally, Android Auto, and I have it, although I can't use it because my Ford has  some sort of incompatibility with Android Auto and causes a boot loop.  Really?  Yeah, every time I look at it.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.  There's going to be an update coming out soon.  So, I just use my iPhone.  It must be frustrating for people who are Android only.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's wireless CarPlay, which is awesome.  You just get in the car and all of a sudden the big screen is CarPlay.  And I can't wait.  Android Auto, I think in some ways is better than CarPlay.  And now they're going to add split screen support for wide screen displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have wide screen.  You have tall screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have wide and tall.  I'm big and tall.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about the tall part.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not compared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not neither big nor tall compared to Mr. Pruitt.  But I'm sorry.  Should I call you Mr. Ant?  You can just call me Ant.  I love it that everybody you talk about, you say, Miss Lisa, Mr. Jeff.  That's a southern thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's probably more like a Mother Pruitt thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was beaten to you as a youth.  That's right.  You're very polite.  I love that.  It's wonderful.  I try.  So I'm calling you Mr. Ant.  I have my moments.  Okay, Mr. Ant.  Brand new split screen options starting to become available for Android Auto users out there,  limited to those with large or wide in-car head units or dashboards.  But if you've got the split screen, whatever your primary app is will take up a bigger left portion.  Here's an example of the Android Auto display.  So there's your music.  And then I don't know how useful this is, but here's the little inset with the map in it.  The smaller right-hand section will play as to your secondary application.  So music and maps would be a good.  And I would presume there's some way to swap those.  Swap it out, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty slick.  It's kind of extreme.  It's more like 70-30.  60-40 might be better because it's a little tiny little wedge on the right.  And it's also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's just a little bar on the bottom.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they probably had to do it 70-30 just because of the safety aspect of driving.  Yeah, also screens aren't that big.  It's going to be a little more real estate.  It's going to be a little more real estate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other users have received the update or suggesting that split screen mode is forced when enabled,  meaning you can't switch between UIs or switch apps from one side to the other.  Oh, no matter what Android Auto head unit you have.  So once it's enabled, you know, you don't have to enable it.  Once it's enabled, you don't really have a lot of control over how it does that.  And that, thank you, Jason, for filling that up is the Google changelog.  Oh, here's the hop in.  Here's the I found the hop in.  It was down under other.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, where else was I to put it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I guess I don't have a hop in section.  Hop in section.  OK.  OK.  I am going to let you guys pick from these because there's a whole bunch of these little  little little stories.  Apple podcast is going to it's it's both giveth and taketh away.  It is for most podcasts, the number one tool people use.  For us, I think it's Pocket Cast, but it's but Apple podcast is right up there.  And it's always bugged me that the button says subscribe because I think most people think subscribe means pay like subscribe to a magazine.  And I don't know if you remember, but for years I said it's free.  But press the subscribe button, things like that.  I finally just gave up on that.  It turns out from Edison research like you tried not to use the word podcast.  Yeah, you know, I fight these fights.  There's no cast from people you love.  Yeah, we dropped that one, too.  According to all it wasn't wrong, though, according to Edison research, 47 percent of new podcast listeners think that when they press the subscribe button, they're going to be charged.  I never thought of that.  Yeah.  So good news.  Apple is going to start using the word.  I don't know if I like this follow instead of subscribe.  It's a very social Twitter word modern.  You know, follow kind of makes sense, except they're also changing the behavior.  When you follow podcast, it isn't automatically downloaded anymore.  Oh, because Apple has decided that most people are streaming, not downloading and listening.  So I can see that there's some concern in the podcast world that could cause a drop in revenue, maybe even because, you know, people may just stop listening or I don't know.  So anyway, that's that's going to be a big change.  We'll see if that affects us.  I would suspect, you know, we always tell people to subscribe because then you've got it.  Maybe you don't listen to me.  At least you downloaded it.  If you have to press a button and stream it, I think there may be that may impact listenership.  We'll see.  We shall see.  Anything I missed that you want to talk about?  Do you know about Internet Archive Scholar? Scholar.archive.org.  This is good for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Google has a Google Scholar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is now from the Internet Archive.  The full text search index of over 25 million research articles and other scholarly documents in the Internet Archive.  So they have to already be there.  The collection spans digitized copies from 18th century journals, the latest open access conference proceedings and preprints that they crawl from the worldwide web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before the show, I went in and searched, of course, for Gutenberg.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you find anything interesting that you didn't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about Gutenberg and Cicero?  It's in German.  Nouvelle du Gutenberg from the Cahier Gutenberg in French.  The Gutenberg Variations, a journal of rare book manuscripts and cultural heritage.  Roll over Gutenberg from Nature Magazine, 1999.  And they're all here, which is nice.  I mean, not only do you do the search, but you can actually read these, right?  Yes.  Farewell to Gutenberg.  2000 sexually transmitted infections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another Gutenberg biological.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say that's a usage of Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will Xerox kill Gutenberg in 1977?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that from G. Hardin, Science Magazine.  Wow.  Did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McLuhan thought it would.  McLuhan thought that this was the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine what McLuhan would have thought when he heard about digital copies of stuff.  Or NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's the one person who would have understood NFTs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe Mr. Jarvis.  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was from the AAAS.  This was all about students Xeroxing books instead of buying the books in school.  Yeah.  We got a lot of our reading materials in college where Xeroxed even back then.  Back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Mr. Jarvis put this in, that Stanford AI index on line 165.  I put it in there indeed, but I didn't read it.  It was pretty fascinating because it's looking at the effects of COVID from 2020 and some  of the developments around it.  If you just look at those takeaways, it makes you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for instance, the greatest amount of private AI investment in 2020, $13.8 billion,  four and a half times higher than 2019, went into what?  What do you think?  Drugs, cancer, molecular and drug discovery.  Good.  Actually, I think you can credit AI a little bit, can't you, with the mRNA vaccines?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  Within a weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Within a weekend, they were able to genomically sequence COVID-19 and come up with a potential  vaccine, which as it turns out is the one you just got stuck into your arm, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's fascinating that the woman who proposed mRNA vaccines was ridiculed by her

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  colleagues.  That's academia for you in a nutshell.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something new, we don't like it.  You'll never make that work.  I mean, all science only makes headway because you fight against the prevailing notion, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All progress depends on the unreasonable man.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just did seven words, put what I tried to say in a paragraph.  Perfect.  The industry shift continues again in the Stanford AI report.  In 2019, 65% of graduating North American PhDs in AI went into industry up from 44%  10 years earlier.  Everybody's going into industry.  This is something Stacey would love to talk about.  She always talks about generative neural networks, right?  AI systems can now compose text, audio and images to a sufficiently high standard that  humans have a hard time telling the difference.  AI has a diversity challenge.  Especially Google.  Yeah, what does that mean?  Especially Google.  45% of new US resident AI PhD graduates are white, 2.4% African American, 3.2% Hispanic.  We've got to fix that.  Not just lip service.  By the way, I was thinking the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is artificial intelligence just a really bad name?  Oh, it's a terrible name.  What would you name it instead?  Machine learning is better.  Machine learning is a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But still not there.  Machine learning is a little too rigid for the regular normal folks.  And it comes down to what you define this as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, because I am of the strong opinion that all people often think, you know, AI is just a computer program.  Computer programs, normal computer programs are deterministic.  Some programmers said if this happens, do that.  If that happens, do that.  And there's no, you know, you can't think outside those lines.  The whole point of AI is thanks to machine learning, a program computer can adapt itself by learning about the real world.  No programmer writes it.  In fact, often with AI, no programmer could read it.  They have no idea how the computer decides this looks like cancer.  This doesn't.  That to me is true AI and it starts with machine learning.  I mean, that's the to me, that's what distinguishes it from just puro programs.  I don't know.  We need a better.  We need a better name.  I agree with you.  I don't know what it would be.  The problem with AI, just like Tesla calling its adaptive cruise control autopilot, is it implies it applies a lot more capability than actually.  That actually exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there couldn't have been a more innocent name imagined than cookie.  Yeah.  But it became demonized.  Well, the kind of doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The real name for cookies.  And you'll see why they named it cookies is persistent client side state information, which PCSSI could have been pixies, which I think would have been better than cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might well have been.  Yeah.  Those little pixies are following me everywhere.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that better than cookies?  Pixies.  Anyway, again, like netcasts.  I'm just tilting against windmills here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I started entertainment weekly, I insisted to the staff they couldn't abbreviate it.  They couldn't call it EW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but they did.  And it's great.  I gave up.  Yeah.  EW.  It's great.  Finally, I'll wrap it up with this.  Thanks to science.  I think it's science.  Arby's has an answer to all that plant based meat.  You see it other fast food chains.  A meat based carrot.  Yes.  Arby's says we'll never have artificial meat.  We only have meat meat.  So they've unveiled a product, a carrot made from Turkey.  Would you like to watch it being made?  Sure.  They call it the merit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to see how the sausage is made, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can make veggies from meat.  Come on, Matthew.  Meet the first ever medutable, the merit.  Looks just like a carrot, doesn't it?  Take some turkey breast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Arby's, you have won me over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Salt and white pepper.  This is a great TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The opposite of the Burger King thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrap it up in cheese cloth and plastic wrap.  Tie a knot.  Then dip it in the deep fat fryer.  Now notice they tied it.  Suvete.  I'm sorry.  They're suveting it.  It's a carrot shape.  So it's suveted.  Now you're putting dried carrot juice powder all over it.  So it's authentically.  That's kind of cheating, I think.  Let it rest.  And then oven roast it for one hour.  What do you think it tastes like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turkey.  Oh, that looks delicious.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  So it's turkey.  Tastes like chicken.  I don't know if...  Arby's insists the merit is not a stunt.  We're actively determining, this is the problem, whether or not we can scale it.  They say it's about 50-50 that they can...  So this is a...  They're testing it in the test kitchens.  And they hope someday to be able to offer...  I would buy a merit.  Wouldn't you go to Arby's just to get a merit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd go after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right now.  Chat room's giving Arby's...  I'm sorry, it's Burke.  Giving Arby's B plus for effort.  Very lukewarm grade.  Very lukewarm grade.  I like the idea of a meat-based plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, if you could work in one fast food test kitchen, which chain would you want to work in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't mind.  Yes.  Popeyes.  No, Chipotle.  No, for sure.  Taco Bell.  Taco Bell.  Yeah, I thought you'd give it up on Taco Bell.  Taco Bell.  Right.  I know, I know, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even want to go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't blame you.  It would have to be Chipotle even though I don't eat there.  Really?  But it seems like there they would have a better run.  They do decent things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Jack in the Box, because of all the fast food chains, they have the most menu items  and the weirdest menu items.  They're always trying something bizarre and weird.  I mean, they have a new product every month, it seems like.  I was thinking five guys maybe.  Five guys, but they don't see that it's always...  It's burgers and fries.  What are you going to test?  Merits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But still, what do you mean?  It's burgers and fries.  What's wrong with that?  You can go wrong.  Meat taters, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best summer I ever spent in college was working in the Yale University test kitchen.  Why?  They bring in a fancy chef, a French, he was a Frenchman, to create and test recipes for  the dining halls for the upcoming school year.  And I was the pot scrubber, but he was great.  He was very frisky.  I said, Leo.  This was the only thing I remember.  He gave me his wisdom.  Leo, an onion is like a woman.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You peel it from the bottom up.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  If Stacey were here right now...  She'd be punching me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She'd be hitting me.  We're going to need a note in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't say it, this French guy said it.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pics of the Week.  First of all, there's more considerations in his flavor.  It has to be makeable.  You don't have to create a recipe that can be made in mass for a bunch of people by people  who are not particularly brilliant chefs.  So it was so much fun because he would cook all morning and lay out 20 dishes.  And I'd be scrubbing the pots as he's cooking because he's cooking like up a storm.  And then we'd all stop and we'd taste each of them.  So I have worked in a test kitchen, I guess.  It was my best summer ever.  I loved it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I learned how to peel an onion.  T-Mobile is stepping up ad targeting of cell phone customers.  Of course, they completed their merger with Sprint.  So you'll all be affected by this.  They are, it's opt out.  But of course, nobody will know to do that.  They're going to share customers' web and mobile app data with advertisers starting April 26th.  So just a word of warning if you're a T-Mobile customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This needs to be said a couple of times, quite frankly.  Because again, it's opt out and nobody's going to know.  So hopefully this is going to be said a few times up until April to get the word out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T-Mobile says, we've heard many of our customers say they prefer more relevant ads.  So we're defaulting to this setting.  T-Mobile, because of their merger with Sprint, has 60 million users under its main brand,  20 million more under prepaid plans.  The change will not apply to business accounts or children's lines.  But AT&T automatically enrolls wireless subscribers in a basic ad program  that pools them into groups based on inferred interests, kind of like Flock.  Verizon pools subscribed, of course Verizon remember had that super cookie for years.  Likewise, pools subscriber data before sharing inferences about them with advertisers.  So Verizon knows what you're doing.  Although, but they don't share with advertisers.  But a more detailed sharing program called Verizon Selects for users who enroll,  it's a separate Verizon media.  They also collect data from Yahoo and AOL, which they also own.  T-Mobile says it will masquerade into the prevented advertisers and other companies  from knowing what websites they visit or apps they've installed.  You get, this is very much like the Verizon super cookie, you get a special device ID just for you.  Privacy groups, note those IDs can be linked back to people by comparing different data sets.  So yeah, just be aware of this.  This is big bucks.  It's not really that new.  In the T-Mobile app, if you have a T-Mobile account, you can visit the T-Mobile app.  Visit the More tab, advertising and analytics.  Turn the toggle off to stop using my data to make ads more relevant to me.  I wonder what Apple's going to do on the iPhone with this.  They'll probably force T-Mobile to disclose, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to take one more break.  If you will, prepare your picks of the week.  Jason, do we know if Stacey will be back next week?  I hope so.  Stacey, we miss you.  I hope so.  Our show today brought to you by Linode.  You know I'm a Linux guy.  I'm using Linux right now.  I've been a Linode user for probably a decade, a long, long time.  I first became aware of Linode because they were offering Linux servers running on SSDs  back when that was pretty darn exotic.  So, so cool, so fast.  Linode believes in cloud computing for all.  Whether you're a big company or a little guy like me or a developer,  in between 800,000 developers choose Linode.  And there are a lot of reasons.  By the way, my reason is best customer service in the world.  These guys are geeks, guys and gals are geeks.  When you talk to them, they will handle your problem.  They don't tear you up.  They don't say, oh, I'll get a supervisor.  They don't hand you off.  Doesn't matter if you're a little guy like me or a big enterprise,  you're going to get great customer support from people who really know their stuff.  24, 7, 365 days a year.  Linode also is big.  In fact, bigger than they were when I first started using them.  Now they have data centers all over the world.  And they don't charge you more depending on location.  It's the same simple consistent pricing at every data center.  Choose the one nearest you.  You're going to get the best price.  They've got a great intuitive cloud manager.  One of the best APIs I've ever seen.  You can do anything with Linode.  Host your website.  I do it because I like to do web-based coding.  So it's a lot easier for me to spin up a server on Linode,  try out React or Node.js or whatever, and then shut it down when I'm done.  It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast.  But you can also do it to store or backup media.  You could, I mean, the sky's the limit.  Easily launch and enrich your developer applications,  hosted services, websites, AI.  They've got great machine learning hardware, gaming services,  your CI, CD environments you can build on Linode,  and those SSDs, yes, they are fast.  Launch and scale in the cloud with their virtual machines.  You could choose shared instances for affordability  or dedicated instances for speed and performance.  You could get S3 compatible object storage, managed Kubernetes,  whatever you want. Linode's great.  And they have a fantastic YouTube channel  where you can watch video tutorials, security tips.  It's absolutely free, youtube.com slash Linode.  I know a lot of people use those videos just to learn.  Bryce Adams from Meteoric, one of their happy customers, says,  We were looking for a partner, not a provider.  Some of the large providers see us only as a transaction.  Linode is the kind of partner that will be with us  from the start, today, and beyond.  Multiple Stevie Award wins.  That's their sales and customer service awards.  Linode's customer service, I'm not surprised,  awarded for excellence for three years in a row now.  Thanks. Congratulations, Linode. That's awesome.  Simplify your infrastructure.  Cut your cloud bills in half with Linode's Linux virtual machines.  Whether you're developing a personal project  or managing larger workloads, you deserve simple, affordable,  accessible cloud computing solutions  with the best darn customer service ever.  And we have such a good deal for you.  I always love it. I talk to these guys and I say,  Well, what can you offer our audience?  And when they told me this, I went, OK.  $100 free credit. OK.  Just because you're listening to Twig, you can find all the details at  linode.com.  linode.com.  Or if you're not at your desktop, just text  twit to 47 47 47  to get your free credit. $100? What?  I was so happy when I heard that.  Because I tell you, it's very affordable.  $100 could go a long, long way on Linode.  linode.com.  Click on the Create Free Account button to get started.  If it runs on Linux, it runs in Linode.  Use it for your git server.  I mean, I can just think of a million different things you could do.  linode.com.

Tell me what your pick of the week is.  I saw this and I loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I actually have to add a second one that someone mentioned in the chat room,  which you can play or not.  But it's a it's the four year anniversary to the day of that famous BBC interview  where the guys kids come.  Really? Today's the day?  Let's watch it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best interview of 2017.  He's on the BBC.  He's an expert in what is it?  The Middle East or something.  China, I think.  China. That's what it was. It was Asia.  Yeah. His kid comes prancing in.  He shoves him away.  Then the little kid comes in in the roller.  But the best part is this mom slips line and grabs the kids.  She must have been watching.  She's laughing.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best part.  Best part is the books.  Look at them on the right.  They're piled on the bed to make it look like a desk.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's in the bedroom.  We know it's OK.  You know, it's funny. In 2017, this was remarkable.  This was weird.  This was like, wow, this guy's at home in the bedroom.  Now it's like everybody.  Everybody dies.  We have animals invading the shows.  We have children invading the show.  It's just normal.  Now it all began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are they now with the daughter?  She's four years older, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a picture of her playing, I think, the cello or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, March 10th, 2017, a day that will live in infamy.  Epic.  Epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have another one?  Yes.  Which you maybe were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one I was talking about because I saw this on TikTok this morning.  It's hysterical.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guy built a video store, old fashioned video rental store in his basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in his basement.  And it looks just like a real rental store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes on and on, too.  It's not just, I thought it was just a little...  Does it have a porn section behind the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably behind the curtain.  Yeah, porn section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The beaded curtain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an ET doll.  You know, the video store has always had those gimmies.  The posters.  He decided to build a video rental store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He owned all of these?  It's wild.  I guess so, yeah.  Respect.  Look, it goes on.  There's a second room.  There's another room over there.  Does he have a sign telling him to be kind and rewind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some candy bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The candy counter.  Do you remember doing that?  Going to the video store.  Making a burning...  Picking the video for that night.  Picking up some...  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember the mom and pop video stores, right?  Oh, yeah.  Me, too.  Before Blockbuster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the last video store in Petaluma just closed.  It was a mom and pop store.  Wild.  Oh, he's got a little viewing room.  It's not the first thing I would have thought of doing in my basement.  No.  Max is pretty much the last thing I would have thought of doing in my basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he really went at it.  He didn't just half-ass it.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you can smell the carpet.  He's fully assed.  You know.  You know exactly what that carpet smells like.  You're there.  It's wood paneling and everything.  You know that smell right there.  That's a hoarder.  Well, it's a hoarder with order.  Respect.  A hoarder with order is very important.  Because a hoarder without order is just a hoarder.  A hoarder with order is just a nut.  Jeff, you're a number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is maybe a little inside baseball.  Matthew, you remember the journalism startup, Civil?  Oh, very well, yes.  Yes.  So it was a...  And we talked about it on the show.  It was a blockchain-based thing.  It never made any sense.  Nobody can figure it out or understand it, just like NFTs.  So when you started off today with Trey, before we were on the air, he mentioned MetaMask.  And I said, that's it.  That's where my money is.  I couldn't remember the name MetaMask.  I couldn't remember that.  So before the show goes on, I thought, can I do this?  I found my MetaMask.  I found my code.  And I had $500 that I had put into Civil because I'm such a nice guy.  I'm schmuck.  But it sat there this last two years because I didn't know how to get to the money.  That $500 is now worth $4,656.  What?  I'm the only person who made money on Civil.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have an almost identical story to have it or not.  So I bought Ethereum, or I actually had, believe it or not, some Bitcoin that I bought years ago when it first started.  And I changed it into Ethereum so that I could invest in Civil.  Right.  Because I thought it was worth, you know, I wanted to try it out.  So then I completely forgot about it.  And then it wasn't until Bitcoin started going through the roof.  I was like, I should go look at that.  I went to Coinbase and they said, oh, would you like to look at your wallet?  And I was like, I have a wallet.  And sure enough, there was like $3,000 in there.  Wow.  Civil went out of business in June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was Civil?  What was the point of it?  Oh, you don't have two hours for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'll give you the, I wrote a long feature about it at CGR if you want to read it.  You can or not.  They were trying to...  The idea was they were going to use Ethereum as a payment system for journalists.  So think about Substack if it was based on the blockchain.  So they started a whole bunch or funded a bunch of newsrooms, independent newsrooms.  And they were going to publish their articles using the blockchain.  And they were going to take payments in Ethereum or in something called Civil that was a coin based on Ethereum.  And then the company that backed them basically started taking because Ethereum started taking and the whole thing went down in flames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting because for a long time we thought micro payments would be the solution to journalism.  Well, that was the idea.  I didn't. I never did.  You always thought it was a bad idea.  I mean, the problem was we didn't have a way to do it.  PayPal would take a big chunk of any transaction.  They didn't allow small transactions.  So micro payments could never have made it.  But once blockchain based crypto currencies existed, yes, suddenly...  There were other benefits.  A thousand Bitcoin to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually don't think it was a terrible idea.  The one thing they were, Maria Bastille, who was part of one of the early newsrooms,  talked to me about why she wanted to publish using a blockchain.  And it was so that articles could not be deleted by the police or by the courts.  It's distributed to everybody.  That's brilliant.  Everyone.  That was the idea.  Which is actually a really interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.  It was just so complex.  It was like NFTs.  Nobody could understand it.  It was too complicated.  It sat in me.  It was way complicated.  And having to buy...  The thing I went through trying to buy the things, the funny thing was part of their business model was that basically  the crypto currencies would increase in value and it would benefit everybody.  Well, it did.  Sure enough.  Sure enough.  Yeah, they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure enough it did.  What they really needed is to do the transaction themselves.  If you just come there with $5 and you have an account with a certain amount of civil  coin in it.  That didn't work that way though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was too complicated at that time.  It's more complicated.  Plus they had to do the whole...  Because it was considered an investment, you had to do this whole thing where you took a quiz.  Remember that, Matthew?  Yeah.  You had to study a thing and take a quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because you had to be an expert investor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did that for a good reason.  They didn't want people to speculate in civil coins.  It was the law.  They wanted people who actually wanted to fund journalism.  It was also the law.  So they wanted to basically keep the speculators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Until the Jobs Act, you had to actually be an expert.  Otherwise, you couldn't invest.  That was to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, one other quick number to mention real fast was that when the pandemic started,  now that we're at our panabersaries, the joke was of course there's going to be a baby boom,  right?  The opposite.  Yeah.  FT has numbers that in France, births are down 13%.  Really?  Yeah, it's down all across Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think people said, oh man, I'm already stuck in this house with a kid for a year.  I can't imagine having another kid.  No.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant, what's your pick of the week?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll make them quick though.  First, Adobe Max announced its dates for 2021.  And yes, it is virtual.  And yes, it is free for anyone.  Just create an Adobe ID and you're good to go.  And that's on October 26th through the 28th.  And today they also, Adobe, they also pushed out a bunch of updates for like Photoshop and  Photoshop on iPad.  And one in particular for Adobe Camera Raw that I'm looking forward to trying out is  their super resolution feature.  Right now, if you're inside of Photoshop, you can scale up your images.  It uses a bit of AI to make a smaller image larger, but you still have decent quality  with it.  And I thought it's pretty good.  This is supposed to be exponentially better.  And that's rolling out today.  Yep, today.  So something to check out if you're in the Adobe sphere.  Lastly, this was something that it pissed me off.  I saw this last weekend.  It pissed me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're allowed, although I can't imagine what a pissed off Ant Pruitt would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bit of a personal story with this and I do have permission to share this personal  story.  So last weekend, there's a hotel called Montage.  It's a pretty expensive, high-end hotel chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I saw your post on this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And some people were there checking in and they wanted to have some drinks and just chill  out or whatnot.  And the manager told them they need to go sit outside because of supposed COVID regulations  and whatnot.  Well, these are black people that this manager told.  By the way, all wearing masks.  All wearing masks.  Yet within the same room, there were some white folks sitting right there just doing  their thing exactly like they were doing.  No masks.  They were not told to leave.  No masks.  And it just really, it really did piss me off because we talked to Dr. Nurett last week  and she went through the PR playbook and how these companies are sending out this message  when this happens and that happens, you say this or what have you.  And of course, that's exactly what these Montage people did is they sent out a blast,  hey, we apologize and we don't believe in this.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a manager taking a picture of them shooting the video of him throwing them out.  Appalling.  And there are plenty of white people in this lobby walking around eating, drinking, no  masks.  No masks.  He's not throwing them out.  He's absolute bull crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He totally got busted.  So that pissed me off because that stuff right there is still happening today and there's  not much going on on the news standpoint as far as that hotel stepping up and making things  right.  Where was the hotel?  This is in Laguna Beach down in Southern California.  Montage.  Remember the name.  There's nothing going on about this being published to be fixed and corrected or any  type of action.  Sorry, it pisses me off.  You should be pissed off.  It should piss you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yet I heard for about 10 days about Lady Gaga's dog that was stolen or whatever.  Didn't hear anything about Lady Gaga's handler that was trying to take care of the dog in  her absence that got shot.  So I'm like, what is wrong with society?  But the personal thing on this, that hotel chain now here in the Pruitt household, I'm  the only one working.  Okay.  Queen Pruitt has been trying to get work and she's been able to get a little part time  stuff here and there because she does nails.  She's an amazing nail.  She's done my nails and I'll vouch for it.  Right.  And so she's been able to get stuff.  Not a good time to be a nail person I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little tough right now.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So she's been able to get stuff here and there, but it's not full time work because of the  pandemic and stuff.  She recently had an interview, got a job and accepted it and went to training and all of  this good stuff.  Went through the corporate ethics training and all of those things HR make you do.  But she left.  She just wasn't feeling it.  And the name of that place was the Montage Hotel.  Oh, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For six cents was right.  Oh my, no wonder you're pissed off.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was about 10 days ago when she was like, you know, I'm just not feeling this place.  Because they have a version, they have one, they just opened a new one here in Northern  California.  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I cannot stay there.  That's exciting.  Another place I cannot stay.  That's great.  Is this, is it here in Santa Rosa?  Where is the montage?  No, it's up above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Heelsburg?  Oh, St. Helena.  Heelsburg.  Heelsburg is a good name for it though.  Heelsburg.  Heelsburg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But is that there in the middle of all the vineyards?  It's just north of Petamela.  Beautiful area.  Yeah.  And it's, you know, she had to sign all of these forms by the NDAs because of celebrities  and stuff.  Well, I won't be staying there.  Yeah.  Blah, blah.  And she's like, you know, I'm just not feeling it.  And of course I'm like, I need you working baby, but you're not feeling it.  Okay, I get it.  And then this popped up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Never question the Queen.  Never, never.  The Queen has a sixth sense.  She knew.  That's what Prince Charles has learned and that's what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't blame you for being pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's messed up.  But I wanted to share that and she gave me permission to share that because I think stuff  like this has to continue to be brought to light.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is everyday stuff going on, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're here to keep us honest, Ant.  Thank you.  Appreciate it, Mr. Ant.  My pick of the week is for anybody who wants to watch YouTube without the suggestion feeds,  without the comments, without all the things that make YouTube a nightmare, just unhook  YouTube.  It's a Chrome Firefox or Edge extension.  I've got it installed right now on my Firefox.  It's got a little play button and you can see all the things you can turn off.  Video, screen, video wall, screen cards, hide comments, hide mixed radio lists, hide  merch, tickets, offers, hide video info, hide top header, hide lifts.  I give you permission to turn all of that stuff off on our feed.  Disable audio, autoplay, disable annotation.  If you don't like it, you can turn it off.  I'm not sure how they're doing it.  Probably CSS, right?  I don't know.  But it's free.  You're invited to donate if you want to support his work.  Unhook at unhook.app.  It's kind of like an ad block, but it's a little more specific to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one of those for Facebook too.  I installed it.  Oh, good.  It's an extension and you can turn off almost everything.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  I did that too, but I just disabled my Facebook account.  Can you turn off birthdays?  Oh, I hate birthdays.  I hate birthdays.  You know what?  I hate birthdays.  And I hate it when it's my birthday because I get all these things and then I have to  respond to them and I don't care because I'm old and I don't want to celebrate it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When Mark Zuckerberg turns 65, he's going to say, what did I do?  He'll understand.  He'll know.  I don't regret anything else that I did, but this birthday thing was the worst thing I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have.  It's become a thing.  I don't know if this happens with you guys, but there are now people who want to be the  first, so they actually wish you a happy birthday before.  Yeah, that's irritating as hell.
