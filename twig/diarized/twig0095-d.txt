Gina Trappany is here.  Am I saying that right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  How do you say it?  Trappany.  Trappany is how I say it.  Gina Trappany is okay too.  Trappany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina Trappany is here.  I'm sorry.  Gina, I've been mispronouncing your name for 94 episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Trappany is a completely valid pronunciation but Trappany is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even at Google I.O. last week you could have slapped me upside the head and said,  say my name right.  But no, she's just too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's all good.  I'm down with those two pronunciations.  All right.  Trappany, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to say it wrong from now on because now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tomato, tomato, Leo.  It's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to get every possible variation now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll never get it right.  That's Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  Easy to say.  Yes, he's a professor.  He should know.  So Jeff, Gina and I will talk about this week in Google.  And actually before the show began we were talking about a TED Talk that's been making  the rounds by, is it Eli Pariser?  Is that his name, Jeff?  We're going to debate him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I don't know.  Pariser.  What's his name on Earth?  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perzer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perzer, whatever.  I have no idea.  He's from MoveOn.org, which is I think a respectable political site.  And he did a TED Talk on something called Filter Bubbles saying that customized search  from companies like Facebook, The Huffington Post, Google kind of disenfranchise people  because we end up seeing just the stuff we want to see, not stuff we ought to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that the old echo chamber argument that I think is exactly the opposite for a few reasons.  One is there was no worse in echo chamber than an old media property like a newspaper  where one editor picked stuff for us.  Now I have far more serendipity.  I have far more choice.  Second, turn it off and what you get is the same thing everybody else has.  What he's doing is turning this all into a mass again.  We're finally escaping the mass.  I don't want to go back to that where we all supposedly watch the same thing we don't care  about.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can clearly make the point, I'm sure Google does, that this kind of search personalization  is what people want.  They want results that are more like what they're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course.  Do I want irrelevance?  I want other noise?  No, I want reduced noise.  And then I think that the idea that this somehow ill service, so we should have the same thing  as everyone else, as I say, really is a problem of thinking of us as a mass.  It's kind of a, pardon me for this now, professorial moment.  It's a Habermas moment.  It's saying that we're all in the same public sphere and the entire value of these new tools  is that we can create our own publics in our own worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, but what do you say to the fact that we no longer have serendipity,  that serendipity helped expose us to viewpoints we didn't agree with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have far more serendipity than ever.  Editors define serendipity as that which they fed you.  That's true.  The definition of serendipity that I have, and The Guardian tried a while ago as a joke  to do a serendipity generator.  It was a random generator of stories.  And I'm sure Steve in the prior show would explain to me how it's not exactly random,  but I won't understand.  Pseudo-random, just pseudo-random.  It's a pseudo-random list of your stories.  And I said, that's not serendipity.  Serendipity is not randomness.  Serendipity in my definition is unexpected relevance.  Yes.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I'm glad I know that now.  That's interesting to me.  I wouldn't have known that it'd be interesting to me, right?  That kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that.  And you want that.  That's the kind of thing that people say, well, when you browse in a bookstore,  you'll come upon things you didn't know.  When you look on Amazon, everything's direct results.  You don't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So I get a tremendous amount of this.  Last point on Eli.  And by the way, I'm going to debate him on these points at the 92nd Street Y on,  I think, October 3 in New York.  Good.  That sounds good.  Listening to the talk, he said that, I'm just giving up everything.  I'm going to say that and say, what the heck?  Yeah, well, no, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're giving him ammunition, though.  So Eli, please don't watch this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other point was that he talked about Facebook editing the web  as if we had access to the entire web of everything.  And Facebook was bringing it down.  No, it's a very different concept.  Facebook is curating things for us.  And he got all shocked.  The example he gives is that I'm a political guy.  I'm progressive, otherwise known as liberal.  It's OK.  It's not a dirty word.  Progressive.  It's the new liberal.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate that.  I'm a liberal.  It's OK.  The real L word.  At some point, Facebook kind of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do liberals kiss each other?  Because I'd like to see that.  That's hot.  Only air kisses.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Only you, Leo.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I went there, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.  My apologies.  Because I like you.  I know.  She puts up with a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're using your points, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're all wearing black.  That's just what I want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he said-  Oh, now I forgot where I was.  That threw me off for a loop.  Jack, help me.  What was I saying?  What was he talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All I remember is progressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Right.  So it cut out because he tended to look at his progressive friend stuff  more, his news feed started cutting out the conservative friends.  And he saw this as a horrible thing where they were limiting him.  Well, that's not-  The point is he was only reading the liberals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  This is the thing.  As an adult, as a thinking human, you have to follow people and read news sources  with lots of different viewpoints.  I mean, this is kind of on you, like as a thinking person to do, right?  So it depends.  If you only look at the same people who are just echoing the same things,  if you're following good writers, they're presenting opposite viewpoints as well.  Sorry, Jeff.  I didn't mean to hijack, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you didn't at all.  You were- I was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I think Jeff makes it really the best point of all,  which is no matter what, we're getting a lot more inputs than ever before.  We're getting exposed to far more stuff.  Even if you follow only liberal writers on Twitter,  you're going to still see a lot of contrarian points of view and so forth.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You see the arguments that they're making.  You see the links.  We have more of an ethic of linking to that with which we disagree.  If you don't do that, that's a sin in our world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you certainly don't want to go back to the bad old days  where a handful of elderly white men controlled mainstream media.  I mean, that's it.  I mean, they still do, but at least we don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As we'll talk about the moment, one of whom for just this reason  doesn't understand Twitter and is- what he's upset about,  Bill Keller of the New York Times, we'll get to it more in a second,  but just starting on this, is that we're distracted.  Twitter distracts us from what he tells us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, listen to me.  Exactly.  Pay no attention to those other guys.  There's too much noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. That's the whole media problem, you know,  is that media took over the voice of the people  and the people are now getting the voice back.  And we're no longer all watching one media window in the world.  We are creating our own worlds across borders, across boundaries.  We gleeks hang together and do a group hug, right?  And we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always think of the fact that what we kind of accept as a given,  which is the mass media, is really a modern invention.  I mean, it's no more than a couple of hundred years old, if even that.  And pre-mass media, talk about hyperlocal.  You would know everything about your neighbors,  nothing about the rest of the world.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to do Habermas twice in one show,  and that's when I should get shot for that.  But Habermas, the German philosopher,  who says that the public sphere started in the 18th century  when what he said was the whole world,  what was in fact a very small group of male property owners and such,  had discussions in coffee houses.  It was the first time he argues that they became a counterweight to the state.  But then he laments that mass media came along and ruined it.  Because mass media now spoke to us.  I actually think that Habermas ruined the concept,  because before his view,  when we had the beginnings of the press and art,  I'm talking about my book now,  we were able to use tools to create new publics,  many publics, publics of all various sorts and kinds.  And when he and media put us into a mass,  that was a terrible period as far as I'm concerned.  And we're breaking free of that.  That's what I think.  We're still viewing the world in these old terms.  Right. That's exactly what I think.  And by the way, this will be on the final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make sure you're taking notes, kids.  I mean, it's not perfect.  Nobody's saying it's a perfect solution.  There are all sorts of issues.  And filter bubbles, we should be aware of that as a potential issue.  But I think you make the point, Gina,  give people some responsibility to break out of whatever filter bubbles they may have created,  because a thinking mature grownup seeks out other points of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I follow all my family members on Facebook.  That gives me all sorts of different points of view.  I can't escape the other points of view.  Sorry.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they all say this name the same way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trappany, Trapani, Trupany, Trumpet.  Trapani.  Trapani.  Yeah. And I do that actually, Gina.  I will intentionally, as long as I can, watch Fox News.  I don't want to go that far.  Well, that might be going a little far.  Oh, boy, we're going to hear from the conservative viewers.  Sorry.  No, but I do actually, I actually try to follow conservative commentators.  I've got Karl Rove on my Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watch Fox News because if you don't watch Fox News,  you don't know what that part of the world is talking about.  You don't know how to respond to it.  You're being purposely ignorant about a part of the electorate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have relatives who watch Fox News.  Yes.  They do that for you.  Yeah, they do that for me.  And then we debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  It's the way I bond with my father.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, if you watch a lot of MSNBC,  pretty soon you do need something, a little anodyne to cleanse the palate, shall we say.  No, OK, good.  I'm glad we brought that up because I've been seeing a lot of links to this TED Talk,  and to the notion of filter bubbles.  And I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about.  And people should be aware that it's important to craft your sources  so you hear from a variety of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where he's very right, and I haven't read the book yet,  but where he's very right, I think, is that we in technology tend to not see how algorithms and such  do have a prejudice and do affect.  It's the same argument that other people like, I think, Lesig and Shirky make about games.  That games rules are a form of law, and they have an influence then on how the world behaves.  So how the algorithm operates does indeed have a prejudice,  and you can have valid algorithms that give you  less valuable information than you could otherwise get.  So I don't disagree with that, but the notion that we were better before,  I think, is just curmudgeonly as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also the issue of the fact that Google is collecting information about your searches,  that Facebook knows about your searches.  And this...  No, really?  Yeah, really?  Surprise.  Surprise.  Web history and so forth.  And you can turn that off.  The Harris Interactive poll talked to 2,124 US adults and asked them if they agreed or disagreed  that...  There's such an art to phrasing poll questions.  Oh, boy, is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you agree or disagree with this question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, Facebook, and others control too much of our personal information  and know too much about our browsing habits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How could you disagree with that?  76% agreed with it.  36% of those strongly agreed with it.  16%, a mere 16%, said they didn't think internet companies know too much about us.  Is that how many employees Google has now?  16% of the population.  8% said, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the headline is if you give someone information, they have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook and Google know too much about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is too much?  This is this whole story is frustrating.  Yeah, I wish Harris had said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  did you tell Facebook that you were in a complicated relationship,  that you lived in Muncie, Indiana, that you have 2.5 children?  Did you tell them that?  And now you're upset that they know that?  I don't understand.  No, I didn't tell Facebook that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told my friends that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to lead to stupid legislation.  Do not track stuff is now taking off again.  We're in the UK is now going to implement opt-in because of an EU regulation.  We're heading down the thing that's going to kill the business.  It's really a problem.  And there's a really stupid law being proposed in the California Senate,  which I think is on the list there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, let's talk about it.  I don't know.  Here I am in California.  It's the you call it the num nuts privacy law.  Is that the official term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The num nuts law is the adjunct of reform.  This is this passes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This can't possibly pass.  But, you know, I would not put anything past the California legislature.  These guys are.  The list to say the least.  So what are they proposing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was hoping you were going to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want me to read it?  I was your story.  I hate to read your story.  All right.  I'm going to load this is from the same dig nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't watch.  Do they do that on Dignation?  They have each other stories.  They say this is Alex will say that's my story, Kevin.  I'm sitting in the in the doctor's waiting room reading a article about Kevin Rose.  And I'm thinking.  Where did I go wrong?  No, it's like for a venture capitalist venture capitalist, Kevin Rose,  who I remember as being like the kid who fixed the computers.  It's like he had he was an early investor in Zynga.  And I'm going, oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did everything right, Leo.  I guess I wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not an early investor in Zynga.  Web giants Facebook, Google and Twitter and Skype have banded together to oppose an online  social networking privacy bill in California that will require users permission to display  personal information such as home addresses and phone numbers.  Senate Majority Leader Ellen M. Corbett from San Leandro just up the road a piece  said it was originally aimed to protect miners.  She said then that Facebook and other companies argued the focus on youth would encourage people  to lie about their age.  So she said, well, all right, we'll just say everybody will amend the bill to focus on  almost all of us.  Right.  And you have to fax what's that mail or email specific permission to put any personal

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  personally identifiable information up.  So what if you think about this, this is shifts the default.  Think about this.  This is shifts the default to private.  So Flickr would never exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in other words, if I wanted to put my home address on a Facebook page,  I'd have to fax them permission.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, just the fact that the word fax is mentioned that completely invalidates any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bill would also allow parents to request any personal identifying information about  their children on the age of 18 to be removed within 48 hours.  That seems, I guess, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but that's Copa has caused problems up to age 13.  Dana Boyd would say that we're putting too much protection on our youth.  We don't allow them to be online and have their identities or anything else.  It means that there's no such thing as a 13 year old online.  Every child is 14 at birth.  Right.  So we now extend that to 18, basically is what that says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The bill passed a Senate committee, but it has not yet gone before the full Senate.  And then, of course, the full legislature and then, of course, the governor.  I don't even know who the governor of California is anymore.  I just found out it's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you now have an heir to the throne, at least a whole new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The little Schwarzenegger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, would this really mean that Flickr couldn't exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Flickr defaults to public.  So what she's basically doing is defaulting everything to private.  That's what happens.  You're going to get in trouble if you just automatically share with the world the thing.  So it turns it into a closed world.  But it only says it only says name, address and phone number.  I read another story that had any NEPII.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that would include a photo of yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And name anything is what I read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's look at it.  I got the bill right here.  SB 242 by Senator Corbin.  I mean, but anybody existing law required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But even so, it's still stupid.  If you want to put your address up on Facebook,  you have to give permission for Facebook to do what you just told Facebook to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bill would prohibit a social networking site from displaying in the designated  text field of the public or other registered users,  the home address or telephone number of a registered user of the Internet.  It doesn't. It's just home address and phone number.  Social network shall not establish.  Oh, here you go. This is the one.  So in section part two point seven, sections 60 a social networking Internet website,  whatever that is, shall show.  I guess that's anything, right?  I mean, do they define this except except the New York Times?  Right. You shall establish a default privacy setting for registered users as a site  that prohibits the display to the public or other registered users of any information  about a registered user other than the user's name and city of residence  without the agreement of the user.  And the agreement of the user has to be done explicitly, as you mentioned, with fax, email,  letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You now see that it falls under the rubric, your honor, of num nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet website shall not complete the process of registering a new user until  privacy settings are selected by the user.  All privacy settings available to all users of the Internet website in a conspicuous place,  easy to use format.  Oh, I just what, you know, it's like I don't know.  Yeah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is basically to combat someone on Facebook publishing information about their  friends and associating with their friends profile without that person's assent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, it says prevents you from doing it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, here's the definition of a social networking website.  An Internet web based service that allows an individual to construct a public or partly  public profile within a bounded system.  The hell does that mean?  Wow.  And the fine is $10,000 for each violation.  Well, I hope it doesn't pass, but it is a pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And here's the other issue.  Even though I know I'm just being chicken level here, but let's say it passes.  Let's say it becomes law in California because, hey, crazier things have happened.  Not your own.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it could happen.  So what does that do then to the rest of America and the rest of the world?  Right.  Facebook, that's the problem.  It becomes the high watermark of regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you of the opinion that, okay, well, where do you, where, if you could regulate the Internet,  where would you regulate it?  Obviously not at the state or local level.  Is the federal level enough because the Internet's international?  Do you have to have a international court regulated or just can you not regulate it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't.  That neutrality is neutrality.  You cannot regulate the Internet.  You can regulate behaviors.  You can regulate, you can say that, you know, if you steal from somebody  and you use the Internet to do it or the mail to do it or, you know.  Anything is specifically Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So child pornography is child pornography, whether it's on the net or in a book.  Those behaviors are illegal.  It's illegal anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's the exact problem.  When the terribly tragic case of Tyler Clemente, the young man at Rutgers University,  who was spied upon allegedly by his roommate and then jumped off.  So sad.  Bridge.  Horrible, horrible moment.  And but the argument I went on, Katie Couric kind of debated me on the air.  One time I've been on the show.  And she says, this is a this is a teachable moment about the Internet.  I kept saying, no, it's a teachable moment about life.  Right.  Yeah.  That's not what could have happened.  Could have happened through a Kodak camera or a with a diary sitting on the desk.  Right.  And so so the problem is we're now demonizing the Internet  and technology as if it causes these problems.  The truth about the Tyler Clemente case is the fact that in this day and age,  if any young person thinks that being discovered as gay is reason that you should go kill yourself  is not his problem.  It is society's problem that we got that far.  And that's the real story.  We don't blame technology for that.  We blame friggin society.  End of sermon.  Thank you, Tha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you write on and we've been Gina.  I both say yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the story had nothing to do with how like Tyler was able to connect with other  like gay teens in general are able to connect with one another and find community and find  connection at one of the most horrible times in your life, which is coming out.  You know, they didn't talk.  It wasn't about it gets better.  Right.  It was about the Web.  The Internet.  Let's people find out stuff about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  You know, although I wonder sometimes, Jeff, if you and I are so abnormal that we're not  because you and I both and I don't know if it's because we're kind of pathetic exhibitionists  or we're a new breed, we're a new breed of open people, but our default is very, very public.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that that comes.  You tell me.  But I think that I didn't necessarily start life that way.  I didn't have the means to be that way.  Right.  And only only because blogs did we get the means to do this and other tools that follow.  And then having done it and pushed the envelope, I found no harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So neither of you have been harassed, stalked.  Oh, I've been stalked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had bozos come after me in various ways.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I was stalked not because of the Internet.  I was stalked because I was a radio post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK.  And so the Internet's a platform for becoming well-known, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but I've been public since I was 20 because I've always been a broadcaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And have you ever truly felt threatened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  This woman had a knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But OK, I feel threatened by that.  Yeah.  But and so did that make you question whether or not publishing or whereabouts was maybe a good idea?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a very good question.  I think, and I'd love to hear what Jeff says, but I think I've received so much benefit from  living in public that it outweighs the risk, the very real risk, but in my opinion, low risk  that it presents.  So and I think that there are ways to be public safely, like not use Foursquare to check in when  you arrive, but use it to check in when you leave, that kind of thing, although I don't care.  But I am a guy.  That's a very important point.  I'm a very important.  Yeah, I'm a kind of hefty guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you have a wife and daughter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and this is where it came up for me is in obviously they have to make that decision  for themselves.  Abby actually is pretty public.  She has a Quora page or not Quora, the other one, FormSpring page where she answers a lot of  questions.  She has a Twitter site.  She she's fairly public.  She did a podcast for us.  Jennifer does not want to be public, so you won't see many pictures of her, although then  she gets mad at me because there's no pictures of her.  Are you are you are you shaming me?  I said, no, you don't want any pictures of you.  And then but so no, but so I respect that, although I have to admit it's hard for me and  I'm kind of proud of my kids and I want to know.  Henry, you know, when he was pretty young, said tweet my tweet my cell phone number.  I want to get some texts.  Wow.  And I did.  It was kind of funny because his phone was vibrating so much it went on, you know, it  went off the table and then we put on the table and it went right off the table again.  And he thought it was great.  He probably does like being public.  So but it is risky.  I understand it's risky.  It's more risky for women, more risk, you know, I mean, and everybody has to make that choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People with things that are attacked.  But, you know, I think, you know, you're absolutely right to raise this.  And I'm not at all against looking at what bad could happen.  But what I argue about the curmudgeon's is that they want to manage this legislation  manages around only the worst that could happen.  If that's what we do, we're all in caves.  We miss we miss out on the benefit.  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I agree that the benefit outweighs the risk.  That's why I'm doing the show.  That's why I open source.  We live in.  We do.  Right.  But you but I can see, you know, you hear stories about people, you know,  Kathy Sierra is a good example.  Yeah, Kathy Sierra is a great example.  I mean, that is that's some scary stuff.  That would make me want to go into a cave, too.  Right.  I think it's important not to.  And, you know, and I have I have some of my own experience with it.  And it's hard.  It's hard to it's a constant weighing of the benefits versus the risks.  The benefits certainly do outweigh the risks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You control how you're you mean, and you protect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As much as I can.  You are public in a safe what you deem to be a safe way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, there are those situations where a friend kind of casually mentions,  you know, something publicly that we had done together.  There are times when you can't control.  That does happen.  It gets published about you.  Right.  It does happen.  So, you know, maybe my friends don't realize how, you know, that I'm trying to,  you know, not publish pictures of my wife or not mention exactly where I live or that kind of thing.  You know, so I think that's that's why.  And I'm just playing devil's advocate because I really do agree with you guys.  But I think this is where this kind of legislation comes up.  Well, that's you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's where we need rules, societal rules.  We need to have this conversation and it needs to become expected societal custom  that you don't you don't out somebody else.  You write everybody's privacy is their own.  And I had to learn that.  I mean, I'm not that way.  And so with my family, I really had to kind of learn not to say stuff.  But Jeff gets so much out of his blog posts about prostate cancer and so forth.  You know, you remind me I should have put this in the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I forgot about this.  But I remember once when I was in San Francisco and I was a columnist.  So same thing at age 23, I was public, you know, in a way that you had a byline.  Yeah, I had a byline and a little picture the size of my nose.  And so I remember going out on a kind of date,  kind of day because that's what that's my social life was like.  You know, I've had a few of those too.  Here I was straight guy in San Francisco.  You think I would have had the greatest time.  Anyway, so I was out and kind of a date with her and mentioned the column with this movie.  And I thought the same thing with you and Jennifer.  I thought she'd be insulted if I didn't say that, you know, she said something.  She got really mad at me.  You know, why did you drag me into your column?  Yeah, right.  She was absolutely right.  Big lesson learned.  You don't drag others in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, you've changed your settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, my I don't know what's going on with I should be better now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, some tech trouble here.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine.  But so it's good.  It's good for us as this conversation is not good for us to legislate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but here's the key thing.  The same discussion that we're having right now about bad things that could happen.  How serious is the risk?  What do you do about it?  Can you protect against them?  Can you educate people?  That's all 100% absolutely legitimate.  But that's not the way discussions being held.  So Gina is playing devil's advocate.  We need to discuss both sides of this.  That's absolutely sane and right.  What are the risks?  Just exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's never what's never rooted about?  I'm glad you're writing a book on it is what are the rewards.  That's the whole thing.  That's very few of us live this way.  This is not a typical way to live.  No, it's not.  Most people say, oh, that's what why would I want to do that?  And so I think it's good to talk about the amazing rewards of  living in public.  For one thing, I feel I live in a community of viewers and listeners  that are incredibly valuable and supportive to me.  And I wouldn't have that if I hadn't put myself out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really found it true.  The whole prostate cancer thing.  I said a lot.  I really only had one guy who attacked me and he didn't like me anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would he attack you?  You have prostate cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why would somebody attack you?  He was trying to make another point.  I write about in the book, it's got a Mark Derry.  He can't stand me.  Never could.  But he uses the larger point to say that we're all becoming  bloggeriac and saying too much.  Well, I find that to be an odd thing that he decides what's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The whole notion of oversharing.  Well, who's to say that that's oversharing?  Now, at the same time, I can acknowledge that I can certainly,  it's very easy to get really boring and tell people things they don't want to know.  Well, but they're not compelled to follow you.  Exactly.  So for them to say that I'm oversharing is a way to restrict my speech.  And I never like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I thought that's a good point.  So in effect, this law here is a, well, you can't say it's an abridgment of speech  because it's a law for commercial entities to protect people.  I'm not sure.  Why is this law dangerous?  By the way, we've lost Gina.  We'll get her back.  She's probably rebooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to filibuster.  Filibuster.  It's your turn.  No, it's always my turn.  I think far too many times.  No, we love it.  No, these are great subjects.  Why is it dangerous?  I think it's dangerous because of the unintended consequences.  Because a lawyer would say to the Flickr founders when they found it,  you know, you really shouldn't do that.  You better default everything to private.  And then it would have been just another little photo service  where we would have shared our little photos with other people.  We never would have gotten anywhere.  Because the effort that goes into...  Well, you know, the legislator would say,  well, but no, you can do it.  You just have to get, you know, a fax.  Well, it's not going to be worth it.  It's not worth building.  And look at the wonderful, amazing things that came out of Twitter.  Look at what we can share.  Yeah.  That's what if on, you know, if Twitter had to get a fax from us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's okay for me to say where I am right now.  Or for the guy in Tahrir Square in Cairo.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who had his location on his tweet.  Oh, you can't publish that until you get him to fax you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  And so, you know, I think that as always in these cases,  it's unintended consequences.  What I think I say in the book, and I go way overboard  in drawing parallels to the Gutenberg age.  People will make fun of me for it, but I don't care.  I'm absolutely obsessed.  I do it all the time too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with you.  Obsessed.  That's the last big information revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and it has an equal impact what we're going to have today.  Yeah.  And the problem remains this guy wrote a Rand study in 1996,  which is, you know, or very early in the web,  saying that we shouldn't try to forestall the change that the net brings  and that those countries in Europe that did so with the press  fell behind in general, in bigger ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the risk.  That's a good point.  That's the larger risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's cultural to go back to Bill Keller,  editor of the New York Times, in his curmudgeonly piece  for the Sunday's magazine that's now online.  That is pure Twitter bait, and we're all falling for it, including me.  But he just goes on about how Twitter distracts us from what he's saying to us.  That he does not real conversation.  Well, who's to say that he decrees that?  That it's not real relationships.  Well, you bet it is.  And I compared it in some tweets to Erasmus,  who had the same exact reaction to books.  If I may read just a moment's quotes.  Oh, yes.  So Erasmus said,  to what corner of the world do they not fly, these swarms of new books?  Books, he said, are hurtful to scholarship because it creates a glut.  And even in good things, satiety is most harmful.  That's right.  Finally, the minds of men are, quote,  flighty and curious of anything new.  It would be distracted from, quote, the study of old authors,  old authors like Bill Keller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So don't write anything new because nobody will read our crap.  Yep.  You know, that article struck me as the article we see from everybody who kind of  just discovers Twitter.  It's almost embarrassing.  You know, he'll look back on this, I think, in a couple of years and go,  oh, God, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was.  Oh, I've got to go find it.  I have an exchange with him over blogs.  I try to get him to invite bloggers into the New York Times and have bagels.  And let me see if I can find the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the executive editor of the New York Times.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's tweeted 20 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's new to Twitter.  So he thinks it's a bunch of people eating their sandwiches.  I mean, I hear that every time with somebody who's new to Twitter.  And then it takes them six months.  But then they go, oh.  Yep.  Yeah, it happened to all of us.  It happens to all of us.  I had the same reaction.  And that's just kind of sad to see him publish it.  He'll feel bad about that later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he's an executive editor of the Times, right?  I mean, he says the Times has made some, you know, a lot of efforts in social media.  But this is truly the way he feels about it.  It's just an uninformed opinion.  And it's one-sided.  I thought that, you know, I thought the thing that bothered me the most about the article is that  I thought that there were seeds of valid points.  It was just really one-sided and uninformed.  I mean, this is obviously a person who hasn't, who hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just discovered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Truly used these tools in a good way.  I mean, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish somebody would just collate all of these articles because there have been so many of them.  And just, and then just put them all together.  Because they all say the same thing, you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wouldn't recommend going to it now at all.  But for those who might be interested, if you go to buzzmachine.com slash times,  you'll find an exchange from March 2005.  And we had basically the same exchange over email about blogs.  And by the way, please ignore the spam links that are in there.  I don't know.  It's an old archive.  I don't know how to get them out.  Help!  And it's way long and kind of ridiculous.  But he was just kind of similarly dismissing blogs then.  And I think now he would not.  Well, he would to some extent.  But it's a pointless thing.  It says the progress has come.  Things have changed.  I don't like it.  And it goes back to bad things could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like it.  Exactly.  You kids with your Twitter.  Stop it.  Get out of my newsroom.  Get off of my lawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My memory is getting kind of bad though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we're all going to be there any minute now.  So just, you know, let's be nice to the old farts.  Because I think that.  I always think, OK, so what?  In 10 years, there's going to be something new.  The pooper.  And I'm going to go, I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to know when somebody's going to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it'll just be me being out of date.  Actually, maybe not in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that actually, that's where you're more unusual than your publicness.  I am.  People our age who have this thirst for the change in the news.  This is not there's not a lot of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's that's what's keeping me young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amen.  I wouldn't trade that for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does Google News stink because M.G.  Sigler, Sigler said it's really bad and everybody hates it.  I use it every day.  And I thought, well, I didn't realize Google News was that bad.  I don't think it stinks.  I use it.  Is it a bad thing?  Anyway, they've read it.  They're redesigning it a little bit.  The newly expandable stories on Google News in the US released today gives you greater  story diversity with less clutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No more filter bubble.  Well, maybe you can expand.  You can expand the stories down and you can do a flashy thumbnail slide side to side.  It's pretty snazzy.  I can't say I use Google News every day, but I do.  I do look at it occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why.  When I need tech news, when I need to see what the big tech news stories are, I just go.  I go to Google News and I click the text.  Text says it is different, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I certainly use it every week.  I was using it furiously an hour ago.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how we find our stories.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, see, this doesn't have the new features.  It's only on the front page, I guess, that the new features are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it does look that way.  It's just a front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's cosmetic mostly, right?  Is it or no?  I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the things that I read, I have not played with this, the ability to restrict  how many blogs it shows you and how it defines blogs.  I remain unhappy with Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, you'd think Arnold Schwarzenegger was the only story in the US.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  He's the first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First, second, third, fourth, fifth.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously, Leo, this is customized to you, so you must have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The filter bubble again.  Yes.  TMZ Live, your question's answered.  That's the top...  Really?  Okay, maybe Google News does stick.  That's the top story?  The tippity top story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's not...  Am I logged in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am logged in.  Let me look if I log out.  What's the top story if I log out?  Yeah, I've got TMZ Live as my top story as well.  Oh, man.  They must know me better than I do.  Yeah, even if I'm logged out.  I'm logged out.  But of course, the number two story is the International Monetary Fund guy.  Sex scandal.  Sex scandal.  Then the third story, US sanctions Syria for human rights abuses.  You might want to move that one up a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have that as third.  I have Gates says somebody in Pakistan knew about Bin Laden.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, that's because I logged out.  Let me log back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fourth for me is Android Google Security Scare, which I have to believe is unusual for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  When I log in, Gates is number three on mine too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't reveal because that might be telling you too much private information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it glee?  Come on, tell the truth.  Is it glee right on the top there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fourth one is also the Android Security Scare for me.  So it sounds like we have similar ones.  Although I'll be honest, I don't look at Google News very often,  but this has to be personalized to your search results, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'd want that to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd want it to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that why the number one video on my Google News is man eats 250,000th  Big Mac 39 years after his first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or Russell Martin gets a panic here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would I get that many burritos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  There should be a Chipotle video here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also have the Big Mac story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They must know something about it.  See, now here's the paranoia thing.  An insurance company can then say,  ah, you must be eating a lot of junk food.  We're going to deny it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the solution is single payer insurance.  That's all.  Moving on.  See, my liberal bias snuck in.  Moving on.  Let's talk about the Android issue because it's potentially a pretty big issue.  Google says we've got to fix, but to get fixed,  you got to get the latest version of Android.  Good luck with that.  But before we talk about, you guys can moan in private.  We're going to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com,  the secret behind exceptional websites and our fine sponsor for this portion  of the This Week in Google show.  I probably shouldn't say the This Week in Google show.  That's too many th's.  Squarespace.com slash twig is the place to go to find out more about this.  It's hosting plus the best darn software out there, not just for blogs,  but for websites in general.  If you're tired of wrestling, you're going to be tired of it.  If you're tired of wrestling with your content management system,  wrestle no more.  You get a great looking site because you start with these incredible templates that  each and every site looks unique because it's so easy to customize with sliders and buttons.  Of course, if you know CSS and JavaScript, the sky's the limit there.  Then makes it easy to post on your site with that incredible iPad or iPhone app.  I wish they get an Android one.  I have to talk to Dana and Anthony and say,  Android version, Android version.  Great stats, beautiful photo galleries.  A lot of photographers use Squarespace because it makes it so easy to post your portfolio.  There's form building, data collection, even forums.  When I say data collection, by the way, I'm not saying like sneaky.  I'm saying you could put forums on your site.  No, no, not sneaky data.  Really is nice.  Try it free right now.  Go to squarespace.com slash twig.  Click the green Try It Free button.  All you need to provide is a site name, a password, and an email address.  No credit card or anything like that.  For two weeks, you have a full run of the Squarespace software.  Anything you can do, you could try.  It's a great way to create a site for family or friends who don't know about the web  or don't have a site.  If you know, if your friends have a business that isn't on the web,  you got to explain to them.  If you're not on the web, you don't exist.  Create that site right now.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  You can create a forum, hand over the keys.  It's kind of fun.  I know a number of people who do that.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Security experts say that there is a massive flaw.  Actually, there's a number of flaws here.  Let's talk about the one that's on 97% of all Android phones  that basically leak your credentials out in such a way,  leak a token out in such a way that people can get that token  and then log into your Google accounts or Gmail and your calendar and contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is similar to Fire Sheep, right?  Yeah, it's Fire Sheep.  The idea of your own secure network.  Someone get a token or sniff that token and then log in as you  to calendar contacts and other Google and non-Google services, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't understand why more attacks don't happen on smartphones  because they're just sitting ducks.  It's true.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, I shouldn't mention it.  Hacker.  Like they don't know, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They keep saying that it's a server-side fix on chat room and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that interesting?  They fixed it everywhere but Picasa.  Until the server-side fix though, it only affected, I think, Froyo, right?  So if you had gingerbread, you weren't vulnerable.  They did push a fix on other versions of Android as well.  Any version of Android prior to 2.3.4 was susceptible.  So they fixed it on the server-side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which they kind of had to, right?  Because getting out these new versions, as we know, that doesn't happen very quickly.  And this is the kind of fix that needs to go out very quickly.  It's a good thing it was server-side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, it was basically Fire Sheep, huh?  It was that Fire Sheep thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds similar, but they're saying that it was stored on the servers in an insecure way.  And this is why the server-side fix.  So it may not be exactly the same as Fire Sheep, but it only happened on insecure.  And I'm not really sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A weak authentication API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's API requests.  See, it's funny because I tried, when Fire Sheep came out, this is the program,  the plugin for Firefox that lets you go to an open access spot and see who's on Twitter,  who's on Facebook, and then impersonate them because you get their token.  So you don't have to log in.  It's just a cookie.  And then you just use that and say, I'm in the same set.  You piggyback on their session, basically.  Right.  So this is similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that the API was insecure.  So they could change the way they handle that token on the server-side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's API requests a token by sending a password and username encrypted  via a clear connection.  So the token that's coming back, your password's safe,  but the token's coming back in plain text.  Right.  So if I'm sitting on an open network, I can see the token float by and grab it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good temporarily while you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was kind of the issue.  This token lasted, I think, longer than one would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good question.  I wonder if you change your password, would it?  No, that should change it.  That should change it, right?  That should change it.  But still, you want to roll with the server-side without requiring...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tokens normally expire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have expiration dates.  You have to set the expiration date, and I don't know how they were set.  This was the problem with Facebook a couple of days ago,  where there were some tokens that were never expired.  Most Facebook tokens expired after two hours,  but there were some tokens that never expired,  and then it was further compounded by the fact that it was leaked in a clear URL  that the third-party applications could send out.  So...  Another reason why it's really good that Google is going to  standardize the operating system versions across the board, right?  Yeah.  Because if you've got a lot of people on older versions of Android,  fortunately, they could fix this on the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Leo, that's interesting.  Let's imagine that there were a client-side flaw, a bad emergency flaw.  The structure is not set up at all to do a broad release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be.  It needs to be.  You're right.  It isn't, and it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  My understanding, and in this, I don't know if this is accurate,  but I read something that said this.  I don't even remember where, so I don't even know who to attribute this to,  is that there are three levels of patches from the carrier.  Yes.  There's a security patch, which is free to the carrier.  The carrier should push out right away.  It's kind of transparent.  There's a fix, a lesser important fix, and then there's a software upgrade.  And the problem is that these Android version upgrades or software upgrades,  which the handset manufacturers have to pay the carrier for.  Is that right, Gina?  Am I saying that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  But security fixes, there is a mechanism for security fixes to go out.  And they're supposed to be just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Good.  That makes it a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's no charge for that, and it's kind of automatic.  So presumably that wouldn't be too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. Never mind.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Anyway, well, we've let you know.  Just be aware.  What's the story with this, the blurred house?  Mr. Blermony, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So as we know, Germans went numb nutty about the Google Street View,  and they demanded, 244,000 demanded their pixelungsrecht.  I love saying that.  I love that.  To get their homes or businesses pixelated.  And so a local hardware store used this as an opportunity to pixelate a house in real life.  And use it as a...  An ad?  Is it an ad?  Yeah, it's an ad.  The house is an ad.  Let's see if it goes to...  Is this in Germany?  It's in Germany.  The thing's in English, but don't worry about it.  So it says that, blah, blah, blah, everybody hated it.  And then they go and they...  In a minute here, you're going to see them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Over 250,000 people have opted to have their homes pixelated in Germany.  That's why we call it Blermony.  So they did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They blurred the house in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they went to the hardware store, Profi Ernest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Profi Ernest is the hardware store.  And they went and they took a picture of the house and they blurred it.  And then they put that picture up over the house.  And they...  Here they go.  Here they do it.  Here it is.  And so they then say, there's no reason to be ashamed of your house.  Come to Profi Ernest.  Fix it up.  That is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great ad campaign.  What a great ad campaign.  People are looking at, what's wrong with my...  Is my vision...  There's something...  I guess people kind of know about Blermony.  So they kind of know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  A little commercial interlude.  Oh, the silly moment.  For Profi Ernst.  Which is...  So that's a hardware...  That's like a hardware store.  I guess so, yeah.  Stephen Hawking has a message for Google.  Professor Hawking says, philosophy is dead.  This was at the Zeitgeist conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which by the way, let me just pull off here.  What do we have to do?  Create sucky, brown nosing shows.  I don't mean sucky, but I was going to be obscene there.  I'll stop myself.  Brown nosing shows and a book about Google.  And get invited to frigging Zeitgeist.  Hey, we kiss your ass, Google.  Let us in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesus.  Well, it wasn't Hertfordshire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm fine.  You'd go to Hertfordshire.  I hear it's lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff travels.  He travels.  So what is the Zeitgeist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I know what Google Zeitgeist is.  Because they do that at the end of every year,  like kind of a state of the universe,  state of the search page.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What people are searching for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can impress them.  And Karen Wicker said in Twitter,  when I complained about this, I whined and moaned and fetched.  And she said that the algo is complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Blame the algorithm.  Oh, God.  I hate that.  The algo is complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just had this vision of someone in the future.  Why won't you marry me?  Well, the algo is complicated.  The algo is complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That needs to be a new Facebook drop down for relationships.  So Hawking was speaking, which I think would be kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He basically says that philosophy hasn't kept up with the fact-based  world of things like physics, and it can't answer the questions the way that facts can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that there is something even deeper here,  which is that the value of facts has been devalued a little bit  because facts are so widely available.  And this came to me when I gave my father-in-law,  who's a science teacher, an iPad.  And I showed him the elements thing, and I showed him some Starwalk and stuff.  He said, imagine if Copernicus, who spent most of his life building the telescopes  that allowed him to make the observations to come up with the fact that the Earth  revolved around the sun.  Imagine if he didn't have to build, you know, that the facts were there,  and he could do a synthetic process just from all the information that had been gathered.  The access to information changes the value of facts on the one hand,  which in the old days were much more valuable because they were harder to get.  And on the other hand, it gives many more people an opportunity to synthesize and theorize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not to go back to his hover boss twice, Gutenberg three times.  We're keeping score.  I'm just doing it before the chat room does.  I don't think they could spell hover boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's hover boss?  Wasn't it? Did he work at Facebook?  So, Eisenstein points out that before the pre-impress, the scholars had to go to the books.  If you wanted to be a scholar, you had to go town to town to town  to find the books to get the knowledge.  And the books kind of couldn't compare with each other.  There's one copy here, one copy there.  Books come along, changes life.  Before pre-impress, you remembered things by creating rhymes and things.  You didn't need to do that.  You can look it up.  So life just changes.  It's okay. I don't think it's bad.  I don't know that I buy Hawking's argument.  There are some things that we don't have answers for.  And so philosophers try to fill in that blank as best they can.  And that will always be the case.  We're never going to know everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of which, the Winklevoss twins have decided to appeal to the Supreme Court.  You know, as much as we maybe have disagreed with the social networks portrayal of the facts  around the birth of Facebook, I think they got the Winklevies dead on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because, you know, they go to Lawrence Summers and say,  he stole our idea.  And Lawrence Summers said, your men of Harvard come up with another idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And don't you want that to be the scene in the Supreme Court?  Let's pull them in just so we can make fun of them.  It's just an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come up with another one.  Instead, they say, no, but this was our idea.  And they already got what it was at $160 million.  And that wasn't enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the thing.  Do you want your legacy to be, I spent all these years fighting over a couple of bucks  about a stolen idea because I didn't have another idea?  I mean, I kind of enjoy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know what the Supreme Court will do,  but I think it'd be great if they watched the movie and then just duplicate Larry Summers' response.  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Your men of Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what's coming next?  And actually, I would watch this in a flash.  The Winklevii reality show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's follow the Winklevii twins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or the Winklevii joined celebrity apprentice.  Now that would be a meat of the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, learn from the modern world and, you know,  become a, be great celebrity.  Don't continue this lawsuit.  It's really interesting.  I mean, they really feel slighted.  They feel injured, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They feel like they deserve more of the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They said, oh, Facebook lied to us.  They were worth more.  If we had known, we wouldn't have accepted 160, a paltry $160 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the irony.  They didn't accept $160 million, except for what, $35?  But it turned out to be.  It's only the good management of Facebook that is not worth $160 million.  I somehow think that the Winklevii wouldn't manage it quite so well as Mark has.  Can you say chutzpah in Harvard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chutzpah.  They've got chutzpah.  Those boys certainly have chutzpah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see a word sock puppetry, but I don't see a.  Do we want to discuss a link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Facebooks.  I couldn't find one, believe it or not.  The Facebook sock puppetry.  Maybe the story may be too old now.  What is it?  I don't know.  Facebook hired Burson Marceller.  We haven't talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we haven't.  Is this the term sock puppetry?  Yeah.  Because you're using somebody as a mouthpiece.  Yes.  So they hired a PR firm.  Somebody at Facebook PR had a singularly bad idea.  I think that's mostly what you can accuse them of.  To hire a PR firm to plant stories on blogs saying, it's not Facebook, it's Google.  Google's the privacy problem.  Not us.  I mean, not them.  Facebook.  I mean, Google.  So I'm not a bad sock puppet.  So what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this mean that Facebook is fundamentally a morally corrupt company?  Sorry.  That came out maybe a little stronger than I meant for it to be.  But every time a story like this happens with Facebook, this isn't the first time  that Facebook has done beacon and privacy stuff.  It feels like there are times when Facebook is deliberately hiding things and doing evil.  We are evil.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if they're owned by the CIA, I guess it's not a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the CIA also wants to sock puppet.  They put out an RFP the army did a while ago to do a whole bunch of sock puppetry in Arab nations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just dumb because you know that somebody, which is what happens, some blog is going to say,  you won't believe what just happened.  Facebook offered me 150 bucks to publish this article.  Right.  I mean, it was inevitable that they would get caught.  So it's just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely inevitable.  It's just stupid.  And it just says these days, I love it because it goes to the book,  it just says these days that if you don't stand up behind your name and say what you're saying,  then you will be out.  You're going to get caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I for some reason it doesn't bother me.  Just seems like this is the kind of thing that goes on all the time, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, am I being naive?  Does this kind of thing go on all the time?  Does everybody do this and they just got caught?  It feels like doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what PR companies do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they do.  I mean, they may not do it in such an egregious fashion.  And what would Google do?  This seems really bad.  I don't know if you're naive, Gina.  I mean, it is definitely creepy.  But I do feel like it's kind of standard operating practice, right?  I mean, all companies try to spread fud about the competition  and they use a variety of tools to do it.  And most of the time, they're trying to get the press, they're trying to get us.  It's misdirection.  Pay no attention.  It's over there.  And that's what PR people do.  Sometimes they go, pay no attention.  It's over here.  But it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The interesting thing in this case, Gina, was that...  Well, I'll back up and now quote my book.  I'm being really obnoxious today.  Please.  What would Google do?  What would Habermas say?  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vice Nick.  You should write that book.  He'd say, picture light in my home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I said that there were two professions that couldn't be Google-y, law and PR.  Easy punchline.  But also just said that the reason is they have clients  and that they can't...  They have to speak for the clients, they have to do the clients,  but they need to take swords to the stomach for the client, right?  What's interesting about this story is that as soon as this happened,  Burson Marcell or the PR company threw Facebook under the bus.  Oh, yeah.  And said, we never should have done this, right?  So what I wonder about that is what's more dishonorable?  Doing it in the first place and then trying to blame your client for it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think Burson Marcell comes across 10 times worse even than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't they?  They have a terrible reputation.  That seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They do a lot of political stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they didn't protect their client.  They didn't take the hit.  But they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They work for some pretty, as I remember, some pretty nasty fellas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And who would hire them now?  Right?  Yeah.  That's the problem with PR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Bad PR doesn't mean no more clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are the world's fifth largest PR firm.  But they do.  They represent governments.  Our human rights record isn't all that bad.  Look at Facebook.  The Nigerian government hired them to discredit reports of genocide during the Biafran War.  I was not going to speak about it.  Okay.  The Argentinian junta after the disappearance of 35,000 civilians.  Who are you going to call?  Burson Marcell.  The Indonesian government after the massacres in East Timor.  They also work to improve the image of Romanian president and funny man Nicolae Ceaușescu  and the Saudi royal family.  So I think at least the person at Facebook knew who to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's a horrible thing too.  They knew they were doing something sleazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who are you going to call?  I'm betting Burson suggested it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what we could do.  Yeah, right.  You're right.  We did this before for the Nigerians.  They loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've also worked for Big Tobacco.  Yeah.  European biotech firms to counter Greenpeace arguments on genetically modified food.  There's a whole website I'm looking at.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This makes me really trust Facebook's choice.  They went to these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the thing.  AIG.  Facebook is not trying.  They're not trying to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I found trouble finding stuff on Google news, which means that they've cleverly managed  to kind of bury this.  Gina's reaction is great because you're shocked, but it also...  I'm also naive and earnest.  It's not around that much.  We just unearthed it again.  She's so naive and earnest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just felt like another track.  Of course Facebook did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  You really do have to look at their track record over and over again.  By the way, I think that one of the real disservices that the mainstream media, which  spent a lot of time on sock puppetry did, and one of the reasons we didn't cover sock  puppetry so thoroughly over the past week is it distracted people from a much bigger  issue to me, which is that Facebook was leaking people's profiles.  I tweeted...  I didn't tweet this story.  I tweeted, change your password on Facebook because if you don't, you have the potential  that all sorts of third parties have your profile information.  Due to leaks.  And that was kind of buried.  I think it's interesting.  The media...  Well, it's an easier story, right?  The technology is complicated on the other stuff.  And besides, sock puppetry has a good name.  It does.  Do you think it's creepy that an Israeli couple named their baby like?  Yeah.  It might mean something in Hebrew that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you named it like because you like the baby, that's okay.  If you name it like after Facebook, that's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as they don't tattoo a thumbs up on its rump, I think it's probably okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Developers software creates culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we had that story after the Egyptian spring that an Egyptian parent named their  baby Facebook an Egyptian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The problem is, what's this kid's nickname going to be?  Dis.  Dis.  Hey, Dis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it.  I'm embarrassed to say I put a like button on my blog this weekend, a send button.  Because it drives so much traffic, you can't not do it.  And now that Bing is incorporating this stuff...  I mean, I don't know anybody who uses Bing, but I presume somebody's using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bing is now putting things your friends liked higher in the search.  Right.  So if you...  Before they just marked it.  Now they're moving it up.  They're prioritizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're crazy if you're...  By the way, this is another reason they hate Facebook.  You're crazy if you're a website and you don't have a Facebook like button because  you're in effect going to be downgraded on Bing because you don't.  Right.  So it's important to...  Now you have to play in this ecosystem and this is really where Facebook...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, God, I need to redesign.  I'm so many years overdue redesigning my blog.  I've got to get some way to redo it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not suggesting you put a like button.  Make better decisions with the help of your friends.  Learn more.  Okay.  Do I have to turn it on?  Does it require me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks that way.  It looks like you have to press this try social search now button.  I haven't looked at Bing in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Try social search now.  Maybe this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your Bing experience gets even better when you connect to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice looking young Microsofty will explain this.  By the way, it's got a like button on the explanation.  I think this is the bane of the web.  Just a moment.  Oh, here she comes.  Hey, Bing's a happy place where you can find things your friends like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, sorry, not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, sorry, not going to do it.  Okay.  Now, when I search for...  Let me search for something else.  Let's search for Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must have connected already.  I do.  I'm getting a connect.  I pushed the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not my friends apparently don't like Twig.  See, this is why I need a like button.  I need a like button.  Let's look at TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't click it that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, click it more often.  Look what my friends like on TechCrunch right here.  MG Siegler likes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  MG's liking his own articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's liking his own articles.  Well, there you go.  Let's see.  What does he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, MG Notorious Apple fanboy.  Why isn't Google Chrome a part of Android?  And now to see if the social search stuff actually works.  So actually, I fell for his little honeypot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now I'm losing my friend.  This is why it's important that you cultivate the right friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People who like things.  People like things.  You like people who like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what do you think?  I mean, I mean, I don't know.  Anyway, I think it's a bad idea.  So let's take a break.  We're going to come back with our...  Do we have any other big stories that we don't want to miss?  They canceled.  That stuff my dad says show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny, but it's not really the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has nothing to do with the cloud.  The Google Translate beatbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's funny for a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, that second video is pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Translate, the remix.  When we built Google Translate, we thought it was a cool tool.  We had to admit we had fairly straightforward ideas  about what it would be useful for.  However, no, no.  Here is a Google demo slam translate beatbox.  Let's see what the...  He's going to English to German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He typed in a bunch of random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did.  The beatbox is pretty good.  That second video is pretty good too.  They remixed a song based on...  In Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Let's see.  This is a Google...  Is this translate also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So typing in something in English into the Chinese box.  Google Translation.  Okay.  That's in English.  One, two...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Half a million views in Taiwan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like Kraftwerk.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess if you're reading the...  If you speak Chinese and you read the Chinese  and then see what the translation is, it's funny, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Guai Weiwei must come to his own hands.  La, la, la, la.  Google Translation.  It's pretty catchy.  Kind of awesome, right?  Google Translation.  The world's most powerful translator.  I had a lot of fun playing with him today.  Google Translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Solitary dog.  Estimated dog.  Estimated dog translation.  Google Translation.  Cher's.  My translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the Internet, everyone uses the text to print the beatbox.  But if you love Taiwan, you must use Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and it even talks about the beatbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Chinese beatbox.  This is awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's like a whole new art form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Piano solo.  Yeah, you know what?  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it.  Here's the problem.  It just proves we get no serendipity in life, you know?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because I would, you know, I never found that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, we'd never find that.  Yeah.  No, no, we didn't see that.  Let's take a break.  I'm reading the same old stuff about Andriuk.  That's all I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to hear anything about beatboxes.  Take that off of my, whatever, stumble upon.  I'm unlocking my iPad right now because I want to show you a new iPad app.  Then we're going to get to your tip, tool, and number of the week.  With the new furniture is on its way to our new studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was watching the video, my friend, and I tweeted before  that I want to quit my jobs and my life and come out there and move there.  I'll set up a desk for both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That new space looks awesome.  It looks amazing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  And we were awarded the furniture.  So we got made a deal, a product placement deal with Restoration Hardware.  Do you know that?  Great.  Oh, yeah.  It goes well.  I love that.  I love hanging out at Restoration Hardware.  So they have now an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad app.  That is their whole catalog.  So I downloaded the catalog on here.  This is how we actually figured out what we were going to get.  This is their 384 page source book.  So I don't even get this in my mail.  I get the little tiny one.  But now you can get the whole source book here on your iPad and you can zoom in at stuff.  I'll show you.  Let me see if I can find some of the stuff we ordered.  Because we wanted to go to the Captain Nemo route, you know, kind of,  I don't know, retro.  I want it to look like 20,000 leagues into the sea.  A little steampunky, but not completely.  Like this clock.  Nice.  Yeah, we ordered that clock.  I love that clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go Restoration Hardware.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So see, I zoomed in on it.  So that's in the mirror, though.  It's backwards.  But yeah, they did a nice job.  I mean, I think you have to order.  When you click order, you go through the web.  But this is really nice.  And you can easily zoom in on what you want to read about.  It shows you the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because Apple would have gotten 70%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Sorry.  No, you're right.  They didn't want to do in-app purchases.  Apple would have taken a chunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's always looking for the evil motive.  I think we got this one, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got a bunch of big clocks.  I like those.  And some really cool furniture.  They have this kind of airline.  It looks like it's made like an airline wing.  It's hammered aluminum.  Anyway, we were looking at these chairs, but I just I've eaten them.  I think we got the table, though.  I love that table.  I think that's what we're going to use on the TNT set.  And we got this bookshelf.  Anyway, thank you, Restoration Hardware, for providing a whole bunch of beautiful furniture for a new set.  And in return, I'd like to invite you to check out their free iPad app.  2.0 just came out.  Restoration Hardware.  Search for it on the iTunes app store.  Thank you, Restoration Hardware.  We love that.  You know what?  They have it's in there for Christmas.  I bought it.  I'm like they have some good coffee table books about some Christmas presents there.  Retro games.  I love that.  Let us go to Gina Tripani now for our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tip of the week spreadsheet nerds.  Yay.  They're now pivot tables in Google Docs.  What?  Pivot tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the most sophisticated feature in Excel.  They got it in Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did.  They did.  I noticed it when I logged in to look at our rundown today.  And you'll see a little kind of pop up box that say pivot tables are in.  If they're in the data menu, it's you choose Pivot Table Report.  Obviously, this works really well if you have a spreadsheet full of numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it won't work on our show rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It won't really work on our rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is really, this is a very powerful tool that it took me a long time to learn how to use.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is one of those.  You go to that right area and then you can define what columns you want to,  what rows and columns you want to add to the table.  And then you can generate charts based on your pivot table.  I have to say, I love spreadsheets.  I'm not a pivot table expert, but the video on the blog post that I have in the rundown there  trying to give you kind of example of showing revenue over time from a sales report.  So it's cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's probably not intuitive to learn it, but highly worth putting the energy in because  it's a very powerful way to kind of massage data and look at it.  Definitely.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  I got to hand it to them.  There's always something new.  I feel like whenever I log into Google docs, I get a little notification.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the Google.  We mentioned this before on Android.  They now have a great Google docs app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which really makes it even more useful.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  18% of Americans log into Facebook before their head leaves the pillow in the morning.  Oh crap.  35% use some, interact with some applications.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're saying they're still lying down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  And like before they get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think I understand this.  You grab the phone, you get the Facebook thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I can get up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a research conducted by Ericsson.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's phone.  Yeah.  Oh, it's phone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  That is truly amazing.  That's crazy.  So I've been for my tool of the week.  I've been playing an awful lot with the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  And while I admit that it needs a lot of work, I mean,  I can't wait till 3.1 comes out.  I wish it would come out soon because it crashes on me fairly frequently.  It pauses and stuff.  But I'm kind of growing.  It's growing on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got some mad widgets happening there.  Look at all the widgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been doing a lot of widget.  Fine.  There's the Google Docs widget.  Evernote.  Here's Gmail.  This is that what I talked about last week, grocery IQ.  Because what I do now is I spend a lot of time looking for tablet apps  because there aren't that many.  I don't know, 100, 200.  They're not that many.  I found a couple that I like.  I wanted to share with you.  This is I love Hacker News.  I read Hacker News religiously.  This is kind of like a newsreader for Hacker News.  It crashes on me a little bit.  It's H and, yep, see it crashed.  I know.  It just did a forced close.  Let me see if I can launch it again.  No.  And I don't know if this is honeycomb or not because even my browser crashes a lot.  But this is a great newsreader.  It worked for a long time.  H and Droid.  Hacker News Droid.  But it's just Hacker News.  But a great way.  I've always looked for a good way to read Hacker News because  if you look at the straight feeds of Hacker News, you only get the headline.  You don't get text.  Right.  There's so much.  Feedly has done a pretty good job.  It's portrait only, but it does take advantage of the nice big portrait screen on  the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  And this is the same thing.  It's kind of a reader.  I think does a nice job.  We don't have Flipbook, you know, Flipboard, which is a really great app for the iPad,  but this comes pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's nice.  So I like this.  I can never figure out where the menus are on these programs.  Okay.  So you can subscribe.  It's in the upper left, folks.  You can subscribe to various feeds and so forth, various topics as well.  And it makes a nice little magazine.  I have to say, in some ways, this does really use the, you know, the portrait mode is extra  long on a 16 nine tablet, but I don't mind this.  This is kind of makes it very legible.  It's very cool.  And I wanted to show you this because Steve Gibson sent it to me.  This is a really nice, look at this, it folds up tablet stand that you could put in your bag.  Oh, that is nice.  It works with any kind of tablet.  And the manufacturer's name is ARKON.  He got it on Amazon, Archon Resources.  They're about 10 bucks.  So watch you, you, you, you, you open the legs and they have little soft pads so they don't slide.  So you open the legs and then his suggestion was to leave this.  Let's see.  How was it like?  Oh, yeah.  Fold this up like that.  So that's kind of the basic mode and it's got little notches in the feet for the tablet.  So it goes like this.  It's very sturdy and because of the rubber on the bottom, it just does not slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really nice.  Yeah.  Much cheaper than the smart card.  10 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, we miss the smart cover, right?  But yeah, I miss the smart cover on the tablet a lot.  But at least we have this and you can, of course, by changing this angle,  very easily adjust the angle of the tablet to all sorts of different angles.  So I think this is pretty nice.  Archon, A-R-K-O-N Resources.  And I'm going to, I think my tools for a while are going to be more tools on the Galaxy 10.  Honeycomb apps.  Yeah, honeycomb, honeycomb apps.  Google's apps look great.  The Contacts, really it does a nice job.  I don't want to show you.  Yeah, good.  It does a really nice job of using the display in a beautiful way.  Gmail's awesome.  Gmail's fantastic.  Maps is really cool.  I hope more apps take advantage of honeycomb and I will, of course, give you a review of 3.1 when  it comes out.  But I have to say it's buggy.  It really is still a little bit buggy.  You see the little hesitation?  Yeah.  And this is something that really bugs me.  Maybe it's because of a widget thing, but it has to redraw everything when I change  to portrait mode.  That's not good.  iPad does not do that.  It's much more...  See, that's annoying.  Hope they fix that.  But, and I was a little negative about this.  The more I use it, the more I like it.  Have you played with yours more, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have.  I have.  I've been liking it.  But you know, I have the iPad now.  So, you know, the iPad's a pretty amazing device.  Having them side by side has been really interesting to me.  You know, all the Google IOs sessions are on YouTube.  They went up like that day.  And I had a lot of fun talking to people, but I didn't get to go to a lot of sessions.  So just last night I watched the honeycomb highlights session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good. I'll have to watch that because there's probably a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice walkthrough of some of their decisions and what you can do in the UI, like changing  an app to a tablet app, the status bar.  Oh, good.  And that's recently.  Yeah. It's worth a watch if you really kind of want to get your head around what they  were thinking with honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing I do kind of like about honeycomb, and I'd like to see this in Ice Cream Sandwich,  is the new notification system.  On this, it's down at the bottom.  And you can click individual notifications or you can pull up the whole, whoops,  pull up the whole notification and it scrolls.  And I think that this is actually a very nice system for notifications.  Yes, I agree.  I hope that this is part of Ice Cream Sandwich.  And of course I can close any individual notification just by tapping the X there.  So I think this is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. And notifications have always been sort of Android's strong, one of the strongest.  Much better than the iOS.  Yeah.  Yeah. But honeycomb has some ways to go.  I'm looking forward to Ice Cream Sandwich.  Yeah.  Let's say that.  Yes.  And 3.1.  3.1. We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. That does it for this week in Google for this week.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org. Check out her great blog.  Of course, she still writes for Lifehacker from time to time.  And her day job is thinkupapp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beta 12 just dropped yesterday.  So download and install.  It's getting better. It's getting better.  We're coming close to 1.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a really powerful Twitter analysis tool that I do hope becomes widespread use.  Because I get so much out of it.  I really am glad I have an account on it.  Thank you.  Someday I'll have my own ThinkUp server.  Someday.  Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I read the instructions and everything.  It was like my PHP is missing one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It was the PDO library, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to get you set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could get my sysadmins. They'd do it for me if I just asked.  I'm kind of a do-it-yourself kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I like that about you, Liam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate having to ask a sysadmin to do anything.  Bear and Chris would do it for me in a heartbeat.  Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.  That's where he exposes all his intimate secrets.  He's also the author of a great book,  What Would Google Do Soon to Be? Public Parts.  I can't wait to see that.  Did it come out?  Where he will continue this conversation about public versus private.  He tweets at Jeff Jarvis.  Gina tweets at Gina Trapani.  So that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina what?  Gina what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it related to trepanning the brain, where you cut the skull out and you look?  Is that any...  It's like that where it was invented at Trapani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No relation.  Okay.  Just checking.  Isn't that what they call it? Tree panning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where they cut a portion of the skull out and they let the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Define colon trepanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dude, look it up.  It's what you're named after, so you ought to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should. You're right.  Yes. Look at that.  Perforate a person's skull with a trepan.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of medieval.  They probably don't do it much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's TRE. I'm TRA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So you have never perforated a person's skull into your knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you everybody for joining us.  We do this show every Wednesday 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, live.twit.tv  if you'd like to watch along with us.  You can always download the show after the fact at  twit.tv slash twig.  We appreciate your watching.  Don't forget to buy a brick.  We are selling bricks for the Brick Twit House because we got to raise money.  Because all this stuff that we're doing costs money.  You can do that at bricks.twit.tv.  We do have international sales.  It's a little tricky.  You have to call the 800 number.  It's toll free, but it's 855.  If you have Skype, just Skype out to 855 and that's free.  And you can order the brick and everything.  But I do apologize.  It's so hard to do it if you're international.  I don't know why that is.  Has something to do with, I don't know, payment.  Probably.  Bricks.twit.tv.  We got the 4 by 8, the 8 by 8, and you can even get your logo on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I'm so doing this.  You don't have to do that.  My name will be on the wall.  No, you don't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to, I'm going to get a big,  you know how when they have a construction project,  you have the big plaque on the wall.  You know, it says the brick.twit.tv house built May through October 2018  and the names of the construction company.  And then I'll have all the names of the staff and all the host names.  So your name will be on a big plaque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's so great.  I cannot wait to see this.  It's going to be fun.  Me too.  I had to come see the cottage though before.  Yeah, well, you've got time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just anytime, sometime later this year.  I think we're going to be in August.  I think August is when we'll be in.  Thank you so much.  Good to talk to you all.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
