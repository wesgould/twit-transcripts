But I'm not adverse to introducing. Mr. Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism of the City University New York buzz machine  Hello hey hey hey  I got actually question ask you that's not about  Google before I do that I also want to introduce  Stacey's not here this week David Ruddock is though he's managing editor at Android police first time on the show  Yay, welcome David good to see you. Thank you glad to be on anybody who's watched all about Android knows David well  but I want to ask you Jeff because  Apple came out with finally its cardiogram feature on the Apple watch where people it's a it's a two-lead cardiogram much like  the Cardia device that alive core makes  one one lead is on your wrist already as part of the watch the other lead is the  stem of the watch and  It will say oh, that's how they did it. Yeah  So it's kind of like the alive core which I know you like and I've loved and the reason I ask is there's nobody  I know besides you that's had a fib and  The first thing Apple says when you sign up for it when you turn it on is this does not diagnose heart attacks or strokes  Although I think maybe they should even emphasize that a little bit more because if you are having a heart attack and you do this  That's the wrong thing to do  Right you say hey Siri call 9-1-1 right now and get to the hospital even if you're not sure  but  You'd think that this is a useful tool for people who have a fib

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so is it a FDA approved the way the live core thing is FDA approved under a kind of an exemption

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For new devices to fast-track new devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the way that the live core works is the first time you take your pulse with it  You don't get it right away. It is it is evaluated by a medical professional doesn't do that  so  Alive core I think has still a higher standard and and the the  EKG that I send in is perfectly acceptable to my cardiologist. Yeah, this this actually is giving me a diagnosis

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right now  Sinus rhythm this ECG does not show signs of atrial fibrillation  Then it says right under it Apple watch cannot check for signs of a heart attack if you believe you're having a medical emergency call  emergency

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Services of course all that is a little tiny type that you have to scroll up. Yeah, well you're having a heart attack

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But right you know just don't just don't click the accept button

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is very different from the live core do life core will never tell you you have a sinus rhythm, right or will it?  Oh, yes, that's exactly what it does. It does but with exactly what it does it without that first

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Step of sending it to a physician, which is what the FTC had insisted on  So I wonder what the what the difference here is  In in certification, yeah, whether whether that that EKG does that produce an EKG for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you see it on your phone. You see it doing the thing. Do you get it recorded on your phone?  That's a good question. Like I could set because that's what you do with the cardio. You send it into your you send the  resulting  EKG to your your physician or their physician if you don't have a physician  let me see Apple Health if they've put it if they put a  It will give you irregular heart notifications  You say yes, here's an yes, okay, so here the ECG's that I've done  And can you send that to a doctor? Well, that one's very different. The one I just did is not look good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Compared to that one usually when it starts up or you're talking or things like that talking. Yes export a PDF for your doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. Yeah  And again if you're having a heart attack or medical emergency call emergency services, so they try really hard to  There you know, everybody's raving about this. There's already posts on reddit of all the Apple  Watch saved my life a doctor told somebody who went into the hospital after being diagnosed with a fib by his watch  Oh, you should buy Apple stock. They just saved your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, let's be clear here that a fib though  I love to get sympathy for it and whine about it is it's not directly fatal  The the problem with a fib is when your heart is being irregularly in the pools in the heart  where blood gets undisturbed a blood clot can form and  That can in turn go out and cause havoc. But that's that's the that's the risk of a fib people some people live with a fib

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rest of their lives so I kind of worry that this is a  Over hyped and B could actually lead to some harm  I've showed before we showed it today a lot yesterday on Mac break weekly a  medium article from a  cardiologist who said he's not at all happy about this because  Diagnostics of healthy patients often lead to harm  Because of the false positive the chance for false positive and but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, the whining doctors  One matter if you get if you get falsely diagnosed for breast cancer or something and you go under the knife as a result in this case  If you think you have a fib and you go in you're gonna get on a real AKG and they're gonna say yeah  You're in or you're no you're not right and and the thing about this is that's there's two things about this that are good for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A fibbers as we call ourselves. No, you don't do you really? Yeah  I believe it's called trekkers. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so what one is I happen to be highly symptomatic  What mine know it's happening to you as as a British friend of mine said when I have a dicky ticker  I know it right. I I'm saying oh and so the  Cardio, let's be confirmed and once I thought I was in and I wasn't and you know half an hour later  I realized no, I wasn't so so it can actually reduce  the  false positives

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The second thing well unless you really are having atrial fibrillation the watch is wrong and you don't seek treatment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a false right but again because because I happen to be symptomatic  I I tend to know I was just very if you're if you're asymptomatic if you don't know when you're an a fib  No, you should you know, there's just me. The second thing about this  That I haven't followed but I'm almost surprised my cardiologist didn't do this  So I was supposed to be on blood thinner  I'm supposed to be on this awful blood thinner where you have to go in once a week and get checked and you get bruised  And you feel old and I hate the crap and because I am so symptomatic  I don't really need to do that. I argued with my cardiologist. He finally gave in because I can be an a-hole and  So I'm on just a major aspirin a big aspirin a if I go into a fit if they don't zap me  Clear oh, yeah within 24 hours restore the sinus rhythm that they won't do it for a month Wow and  because then I because I had that happened to me once and I had to go on a trip to London and I'm  Just dragging and during that time I had to inject myself in the tummy. Oh my god  Major blood thinner. So the cops are there guaranteed because the fear is if they do clear  When you have a blood clot in your heart, it's gonna go shove it that out in your brain you stroke you die  Oh great  So they won't do that. So once I was in a so in this time when I was in a fib the damn different doctor who I fired  So that was beyond 24 hours  so the next thing they do is they put you out and they stick a  Sonogram thing down your throat to the level of heart to see if they can find any clots  Or if they find a clot they say and you're not getting cleared  They're cardioverted as they say  And you're gonna spend a month fitting your blood  So wait a bit all this is sorry, I know folks just old guys is talking about their ailments

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, my back all up and down my spine is shooting pain

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh shooting pain could happen with if you if these things work well and you check once a day  Then  You know that within the last 24 hours if you now go into a fib  You know that within the last 24 hours you weren't in a fib and so they can cardio virtue  So I think the doctor is full of crap and I think these things can have real benefit, but I'm no doctor. Okay good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I kind of withheld I wanted to talk about it with you because you're the only person I know who's had  And also you use the cardia so yeah  Yeah  So it does at the very least it raises awareness  Though I would say it's really important and Apple seems to do at least a pretty good job of saying hey  This is not for heart. It's not for anything, but one particular case. Well, you see ECG you kind of think oh, this is good  This is my whole heart. I know you know my now imagine so I've talked about this with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our friend the former head of the soon-to-be deceased Google Plus who's now at cardio at Alive Corp  I  Help me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Former head of Google Plus, oh  Why can't I remember his name either?  This live this is Dick and Dota. I'm a good friend Vic Gondola  So I was talking to Vic about the product and and and now imagine and this is gonna send you know people crazy with  privacy  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine the correlation data you start to drive. Well, this is where all excels because Apple does do that  They have a hard study  They have a number of things on here and people seem to trust Apple a little bit more than they do Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but and Alive Corp has this data now too. So you can you can tie it to  Alive Corp has you record how you feel? Yeah, same thing here. Oh, yeah, what's symptoms feeling? Yep, and  You know where you are what time of day it is, you know, you ate in a Mexican restaurant last night, you know, whatever  There's a lot of potential to show correlation here  Which I think is going to be religious because they really don't know what causes an onset  And they don't know the risk factors of an onset sufficiently and with enough data and with people trusting on privacy  This is one of this is an example of big data being beneficial beneficial and why it is beneficial to  Other a fibers in life to share your data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  David you have any chronic illnesses you'd like to share?  You know, I don't think so today maybe up for my second appearance. I want to say something

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'd be really glad David we're not talking about prostate cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Plus you brought it up. So there's been a second breach

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With the Google Plus API it sounds like and I'm not clear on this  But maybe David, you know, it might be related to the fix of the API for the first breach  You know, honestly, I've really tuned out of the Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I mean I  Haven't read about the breach at all. I just know that for whatever reason they decided it's serious enough  I was anybody gonna complain if we shut it down four months earlier. No, all right crickets crickets. Yeah in October

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google Plus  announced that they Google announced that there was an issue at Google Plus API that allowed a malicious third-party  App  To get data that was marked as private from the users profile  Google said to our knowledge no one's done this although we don't really save records of it. It's been going on for three years  But then they said so we're gonna shut down Google Plus in  a year in  20, you know late 2019  then  They said we're gonna shut down Google Plus  They discovered another one just this week and  They posted with the discovery of this new bug  We've decided to expedite the shutdown of all Google Plus API's this will occur in the next 90 days  So the API goes down when does the service and then the Sun said the service sunsets from August 2019  Well, this doesn't make any sense. Oh, we've decided to accelerate the sun setting which was set for August to April of next year  So and again as you said David a great yawn was heard  Around the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As much as I want to still say Google Plus I I can't I really just can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The voices of thousands of Google Plus's screamed out in annuie

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's worth it's worth a moment of of small set. I think Google Plus had such potential

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look at people like Trey Radcliffe who made such a difference to his career posting pop photos  It was great for photos. I posted on it. You posted on it Mike Elgin, you know went down with the ship  I think he hasn't been heard from since  So for a lot of people Google Plus was the right social network and Elgin's pointed out many times and I think he's right  that the features of Google Plus had for blocking users and  Moderating comments made it a much better place to share than Facebook and Twitter. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think it was definitely a very it could be a very insular place if you wanted it to be and you had to curate though  That was I think the thing you had to be very active with Google Plus in order to get much out of it  It wasn't something you could glance at once in a while and cater to that just kind of immediate just you know IV of you  Know information the Twitter and Facebook give you Google Plus you kind of had to be like, okay  I need to look at my communities, you know, who am I following?  You know, how do I get all this good stuff Google Plus never felt like  Googled oddly for something from Google Google Plus never felt like it was trying to throw the information in front of you to get  You the click Google Plus felt like something you created for yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I liked it and people like Trey and Mike did it in lieu of a blog, right?  It was their their presence on the net in some respects  Yeah, but you make a good point that did require  It a lot of interaction to keep it up  And I think also making circles was a mistake  They backed off on that but in the beginning you had to kind of pick your circles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also everybody thought that was brilliant because that was solving the Facebook. Everything is public problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was too much work. It was yeah  It was it was it did solve the problem  But it but a lot of effort on the part of the user Mark Zuckerberg famously said nobody wants to make lists  Yeah, he was actually talking about Facebook, but he was right also the back was right. Nobody wants to it was too much work  And I think part of the problem was that was so in her intermingled with your other Google presence that for instance  I still have Google Plus is in my contact list and I still hear get birthdays. Oh my lord  Yeah, and that's not what you wanted when you put somebody a circle. You didn't want to make them your best buddy. I  Don't care about somebody's birthday from Google Plus. I don't care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be clear anybody's birthday. Yeah, but any when you're my age you don't care about  I feel the same. Yeah, I'll be dead by then but when Zuckerberg is my my day, he's gonna regret  Yeah, he's not you're not gonna want it on there because because don't remind me I literally do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I so, you know, I periodically I've deactivated my Facebook account, but I had to reactivate it for that Facebook portal  But I made sure that two days before my birthday  I deactivated again because I didn't wish me happy birthday  So I'm with you I'm exactly with ya. Yeah. Yeah, so Google Plus is  People don't understand that I've passed a point you don't really celebrate this it's nothing to say nothing to be happy about  So Google Plus will continue as an enterprise product which is weird what  Yeah, you didn't know that it's part of G suite. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Goodie I get that I can't sign into anything but I get Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it I think I feel like that's what Google does with everything now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're pivoting it to enterprise throw into G suite no one  Okay, well that's that's our lead story  Of Google Plus, let's see what else Oh speaking of deaths aloe is now about to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which and pivot tables, yeah, really no more pivot tables. Yeah pivot tables are going

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one could figure out how to use them probably  Alo which was I thought really cool. In fact, the only person I ever exchanged messages with on aloe was you Jeff  And same for you, yeah, it was our little intimate moment back and forth and that we were alone in the world  I said happy birthday and he cut me off  So now I you know, I  Do this every once in a while the other night  I woke up and I pulled out my pixel 3 and I downloaded every possible program to do text messaging  Because you know Google does allow you to make your default text message app be some other app  And then I found out I figured out after a while because hangouts still was getting all the messages you also have to go into  Hangouts and tell hangouts knock it off  And so it's two steps  But nothing is as good as hangouts in  Terms of a I want to be cross-platform. I want to be able to get it on my iPhone in my Android phone  I tried Luke clinker's pulse, but you can't do it on iPhone Apple won't let him put in a pulse  Apple and then I don't know why they let hangouts to be on the iPhone, but they do and  I tried a bunch of different Facebook messenger. Oh, it's so ugly. I can't and  So finally I put hangouts back after a few hours trying everything that's out there. It needs to be cross-platform  It needs to work on my desktop. It needs to work with Google Phi because that's you know, that's my pixel  It's only a few hours. I'm trying to get it on my iPhone. I'm trying to get it on my phone  Pixel it's only hangouts. Well hangouts  Survive they said that we're gonna keep hangouts alive for one more year  And then we're gonna move it to move you to hangouts chat and meet  David we've never had you discuss this. Please explain to me Google's messaging strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that's the problem and I think that what what I've heard is that Google really  There was no there was no nobody knew that moving all these people to hangouts chat and meet was going to happen  Before it was announced by the head of product on Twitter  Like he just went on there went on a tirade and then said yeah, we've already got a plan  We're moving everybody over and apparently it's a bunch of people on teams like news to us  So oh my god, that's terrible. Yeah  Yeah, it's pretty bad and it's not even clear how the transition is going to work and it sounds like they're gonna have take a  Bunch of people off product teams, you know on hangouts chat who are working on features and have to put them on migration duty

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the roadmap has changed now and that course as you know, that's huge for your career if you're on migration duty  Yes, that's how the glory don't know. That's how Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google  He was on migration duty all the glory and the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it really is it's just clear  It's just there all they're doing is saying to the people who are on hangouts that die hard to her left  Like we're not gonna leave you out in the cold, but it's it's really just appeasement. There's no plan going forward

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not going to all this. Do you use Android messages, which was now called it completely generically and ambiguously messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do and I use it because he honestly I live mostly in a web browser and so the web the web  Interface works for me. You got a desktop interface, which is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's how hangouts works on the desktop too you have to have a chrome plug-in you have to have chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the fact is there's a how many people how many new people have you talked to on hangouts lately?  Nobody's nobody's going there, but it's my SMS app. See so I use it on Google 5 for SMS

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I talked to everybody on hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought they were going to I wonder if they're going to sunset that they're probably going to get rid of then I'm screwed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my fear and  That's why I looked at pulse and textra  Facebook messages signal  Telegram tried them all they all can be your default SMS client  but they but I don't know it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still I'm still in denial about the death of inbox. They finally get me used to it. Yes, and then it's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate these guys. So you knew it was gonna die. There were never ads in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there ads in your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android messages and in Gmail, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're using and you're using it with a carrier that does RCS David I wish

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  RCS I think will be intercompatible across all four carriers sometime in 2035  Yeah, they've they've really shown how good how well they can drag their feet on that do you use five David or I  Was on five for a few months it really didn't fit into my kind of data usage a lifestyle  I guess I'd say  But I use messages just because SMS kind of the default I go to if I if I'm talking to somebody either I'm talked to  In a while or whose contact information on a social network  I don't have and so it's just it's easier than the web interface. The web interface keeps me coming back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really now that we have a web interface for messages. It makes me much happier. So you don't use hangouts either Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I have to go to messages. I mean clear Google wants me to go to messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously even on five they want you to go to messages. No to be clear. I am in a multi messaging app hellscape  I'm on whatsapp. I'm on Facebook messenger. I'm on Android messages  I'm still on hangouts as well  And I also use telegram for work communication when we're at events, so it's it's it's not fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David do you the problem that I have so I'll see a  A  An alert come up for a message register that oh, yes, so and so Leo just messaged me now find it and then exactly

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have spent ten minutes going is at Facebook was it Facebook messenger was it messages was it hangout was it? Oh?  Cuz cuz somebody one time once you're probably Leo Leo wants to say something to me  He's the only person on earth who would do it now. Oh, I guess I understand that really somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chattam's pointing this out. It's really true. I have an unusual use case because I have more than one phone  One of some of them are iOS if you only had one phone one Android phone and one desktop I  Guess it'd be fine to use messages  But but if I use messages, then I won't get the message on my other my iOS phone  But I understand I'm an I'm a definitely an edge case so I shouldn't complain I should just shut up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  suffer with the rest of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just you know if if Apple made messages work on Android I  Would use that?  fat chance fat chance I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Know and it's such an opportunity for them. They could even monetize it opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well for instance you can paste up people with Apple messages  And I think everybody would use it except that because you can't pay Android people you use Venmo instead because you could pay it's cross-platform  There's a you need to have certain things need to be cross-platform  messaging  Payments there's certain things that just have to be cross-platform because they could make Apple pay for Android too. There's no reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly right. It's just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Available on Apple. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's can you change the payment provider on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what what it quit here's my larger question what equivalent Google to the list you just made what equivalent Google apps are do work hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hangouts right that's why you hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  alo does for the time being

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For two weeks. Yeah, that's well there you go  I  Don't know what to say. I guess we'll pay on the app store. Yes  I wish we could just like by fiat say everybody has to use telegram or everybody has to use  What's app or you know what? I'd really like everybody has to use signal  Yeah signals cross-platform, but signal  Doesn't let you have two phone numbers for the same account. It's tied to the phone number  So once when I set up signal on one phone, I can't have it on the other phones  So that's that's just that's for security. I understand but that's  All right, mr. Mr. Pichai goes to Washington. We'll talk about that in a second  We're glad to have you David Ruddock managing editor of Android police first time on the show be nice folks  No, they're always nice  Whether we need to it's it's entertaining Jeff Jarvis, they're never nice to you  Buzzmachine.com.

Did you know that?  he does  Our show today brought to you by your belt Jeff my belt too  We love our slide belts now the problem with the click click click click click click click click click click  I know isn't that sound great? The problem with belts is they were designed  I think the belts are older than forks  Belts were designed in you know, like the eighth century  Maybe even older than that take a piece of leather of animal skin  Punch hole in it tie it up around waist problem is five six holes  one of them has to work otherwise your pants fall down or  worse  Your pants like you can't talk cuz they're so tight  Belts just are old-fashioned.

Shall we say and listen and when you put it on it sounds so good  There's the ratchet right like that. Although when you loosen it completely silent, so get it just right  So your pants are comfortable but aren't gonna fall off  Then if you have a big meal or you just want to relax at the end of the day you slide it open a little  Bit more I love these and they have every style unisex survival belts for adults colorful belts for kids  here's this is a blue canvas and I really like this buckle on this the  Distressed chrome they call it brass brass buckle with the Navy  Canvas belt they can be worn casually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, rather wasn't searching granddaughter was on some game  And then I'm guessing it was an alert up pops her grandfather was something awful about him  That's because he does awful things your grandpa is a racist. Yes, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He holds up his phone and Sundar has to say  The iPhones made by another company. I don't I don't think about that  And then King says well maybe it wasn't this phone, but it might have been the Android phone  Then they say well, why is it?  When we search on Google for idiot we get pictures of the president. Why is that Sundar Pachai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was what was Sundar's response to Sundar explained that they they just are looking at the data from what people do  That was a Democrat who asked that actually  algorithms man algorithms algorithms  But let me before we go on let me just point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know because part of this is the part of this hearing is because this contention that  Google somehow stifles conservative thought  But  It's you know you don't what you don't want Google to do is to say oh look every time somebody searches for idiot  They're getting President Trump. We better fix that  That's what you don't want to have right that's called editorializing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what what what Pachai said is at some point is there's not a little man  There editing these things. That's what I tell my parents usually data. It's not a little man in your computer. I  Was on MSNBC this morning with Stephanie rule talking about this. I love so I made my regards. Oh, she's great  She's just great. So I made I made a list of the idiocies  Right you have Bob good lats starting off saying you have more data. You have so much data would make NSA blush  Oh, no, sir good lats shouldn't the NSA make you blush since it knows a hell of a lot more than Google does and  It victimized Google and you have Steve King then you have Zora Loughlin then Steve Cohen who's a Democrat?  Wanted a help tutorial line for people. Oh, please is this too stupid to use search  And then he complained I'm on MSNBC I had appearances on MSNBC I'd ate appearances on the sea  I don't know that they don't come up and  Then you had Matt gets wanting to know how many liberal employees there are that's a little scary  Then you have Steve Chabot  Chabot I don't know that he was amazed that if you search for American Health Care Act that was the the Trump one  All these bad things come up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You were saying now now, let me say this though and somebody the chat was pointing this out  Some years ago when people were searching for Michelle Obama and the image search you got pictures of gorillas and  Google fixed that did they not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got well you it wasn't I wasn't Michelle about it was it was it was searching for gorillas and then  african-americans would come up so now you basically can't search for gorilla because they don't know how to  Deal with someone so so they they did a broad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fix like that fix. Oh, that's that they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not saying that  Hello  Mr. Cohen  You think that your MSNBC appearances should be higher than you don't get to choose that get in you know  Get to choose that and there's not a little man and then and then finally there was Ted Poe  Who got really angry?  Does this know where I am?  Well, it depends on your default settings oh you make millions of dollars, you know, you know, he gets all mad at him  Well, mr. Poe when you leave and you say find me the nearest pizza. How can it do that?  If it doesn't know where you are, it's just it's just the idiocy is tremendous. What I said on on MSNBC this morning was  As you're sure they'd be more regulated I said after this performance yesterday  Who who do you want to be running the internet?  Google or Congress? I'll take Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure I want that either I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think there's some room in the middle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not with this Congress, I don't think so. What about this though this New York Times article your apps know where you were last night  Moral panic and they're keeping a secret. Well, but wait a minute some apps did have a nifty graphic though  Yeah, it does have a very nice graphic. Yeah, we got very impressed with itself. Yeah some some apps  Don't that you know  Don't need  Constantly to track where you are to work. I agree if you're searching for pizza you want to know pizza  often want to know pizza near you and the weather channel has to  Obviously know where you are to give you weather but that doesn't mean they have to sell that information with two third parties  right  They're just I think it's reasonable to say  Okay, some apps need location information but to constrain how they're using it or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least they need to do they need to tell you transparency into it and the invisible is her boss that I that I grew

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'll tell you why location information at first. It just sounds like well, they know where I go  but there's all sorts of things you can deduce it with location information for instance if  I as a married man  Spend the night at some other person's house and they know where she was because of her location information  How is anyone gonna get to that data though, well, I don't know if you're selling well parties

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See it's the it's the could could could chain here. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you one this here. They're also selling it to hedge funds, right to decide what what investments to make or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's data. It's data about human behavior. Yeah, I'll give you one  It's I'm gonna give up my number because this one is relevant to what we're doing here  If you go down to the numbers Scientific American, yeah, this will this will raise lots of questions  so a  Study determined that Google searches on an individual level could predict heroin overdoses

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, why because you're listening searching for Narcan or well, you're looking for various things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and so it predicts hospital visits based on accurate drug usage  With with some level of accuracy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually though the the person who created this report  Actually celebrated it because it gives us new innovative approaches to analyzing data relating to the opioid epidemic in other words, this isn't a negative

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a positive. It's a positive but you're that one  Opioid drug user, right and do you fear they're gonna come knocking down your door?  You're gonna get into all of the what bad things could happen argument here, too  This is the argument Stacey and I have all the time  I put a high value on saving lives and  What you fix in this case is not the data. It's how it could be used badly, especially by government  So this is why I keep trying to say leave the doors open to these good possibilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is fascinating. It is the terms China white methadone and a Vinza. I don't know what a Vinza is  Maybe is it a  Alternative drug were strongest predictors of heroin related emergency visits in  Boston Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, New York Phoenix San Francisco and Seattle. That's fascinating  So did we gain anything from  Sundar Pichai's testimony in Congress. Did we learn anything just that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And doesn't necessarily mean much but we're not going we have no current plans to go into China with a censored search  Oh, yes, that's right. He said that three times at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The evasiveness of the answers was was not really yes. I didn't feel encouraged by that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right now could mean but tomorrow he said right now right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are no plans to launch so plants but and he admitted that there were a hundred people  Yeah, they're working a hundred people working on something  Why if you're not doing it  Got to be prepared guys, yeah, right. He said we'll be transparent if the company does bring search products to China  Well, we're gonna know it. Yeah in a letter to lawmakers last summer  Pichai said providing such a search engine would get broad benefits to China  Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so so my my question is really it is to Google and I think the  My question really comes down to you don't you have all of these companies and services in China are so embedded at this point  That you know  Catered to the needs of Chinese users and cater to I do all the all the things they want  Why would why would anybody in China want to use Google especially a censored version?  What would that really what what kind of appeal would that have?  I just don't I don't really see the argument in the first place  It just seems like wow  Google is really willing to shoot itself in the foot for a buck here and it just it doesn't look good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big bucks David I think you're right to compete with  The existing government supported systems probably not impossible, but but but a small  Market share in China could mean a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could mean something certainly I mean it's it's you know, obviously huge market  I I just I don't know if it's worth the the public backlash and it's clear Google is getting  Backlash on this and I think comes from both sides of the aisle, which is the real problem for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not going to find a sympathetic ear on this. Yeah, it's interesting to see so Lofgren who is the Google's member of Congress, right?  Join in the hunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, just be clear David I agree with you I don't Google should not be doing this I was glad I  Have them on back when they left. I couldn't agree more but in trying to understand the motive, which is really your question  There's a there's a discernible dollar sign or you are that you can put behind this decision  But I think I agree the damage would be worse. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just want to point out that once again the monopoly man was  What a  The mustache got bigger and bigger he shows up at every every big tech hearing  I  Thought I didn't watch it, but but I didn't in all the coverage  I didn't see anything surprising really except for the fact that he said we're not doing the China thing. I  Guess that was maybe the main point of going and that and that when you go as a tech executive  You know members of Congress make fools of themselves. So it's a really it's always amusing. I  Honestly wonder what the I just think that these are totally useless to the average American these hearings

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They they do nothing but confuse the issues at this point  But not going just makes Google look bad and I think they were responding  I think they're responding to the fact that everybody was you know, everybody was giving them, you know a hard time about not going to  The last hearing and so even though they know it's going to be a farce every single time  It's it's kind of a it's a farce  And so even though they know it's going to be a farce every single time it's it's kind of a it's a no-win situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you think the general public takes away from this or if anything or do they even know about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was way played down in every news site today

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's over right yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just don't about Trump is that he really dominates the news cycle day after day  Well, you can call that a nice thing yeah, well, I mean I just it is a nice thing for anybody who doesn't want to be  Yeah, the new cycle a cycle  You know  Okay  What else there were some there was a whole bunch of good stuff to talk about I am I  They're looking for  Google employees who are leaking  this is an ongoing problem everywhere, but  Somehow Apple seems to do a good job. They have regular staff meetings about why leaking is bad  According to a former research scientist at Google  The number one priority among senior managers is to stop leaks in the media employees  Yeah, that's a bit of an overstatement. Yeah, I don't think that's their number one for a number one  Maybe number two maybe number three plays at the company's headquarters near San Jose are encouraged to monitor their colleagues and lists on a web page  Within Google called stop leaks any confidential information they see externally  Of course anyone caught revealing information the press is fired, but that's every company

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean at a company like Google  I mean how many of these people do you think there are super proud to be spying on their co-workers?  It doesn't feel like the Google is the kind of company that would foster that culture. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except  We didn't wouldn't know about the China thing  you know, we wouldn't of course now Yonatan Zungar is apparently talking to the intercept because  He is one of four sources the only one named  Talking about Google's meetings at the very beginning when they started talking about this China thing  So, I mean I mean I could see why they don't especially if they don't plan to do it  I could see why they would might might be a little upset about that  Just a little bit, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the me too stuff, you know, was that was that whistle-blowing? Yeah, right it was whistle-blowing whistle-blowing, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and you could argue the search thing is whistle-blowing you could you could it's not legal miss whistle-blowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more like moral whistle-blowing. Yes, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not the same thing with the drone or the  The the when they were trying to help out with the the drones. Yes, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, right they went public with that no interestingly David I was at an event a few weeks ago were a  Forget who was it was talking but but just said that that decision has has really affected the  relationship of DoD with Silicon Valley  And that and that  there's a lack of trust now from defense side because there's a belief in the defense people that  You know, this would have been more accurate would have saved lives blah blah blah  There's an argument that was there. Well Jeff Bezos

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Jeff Bezos maybe got some moral gained some moral ground by saying look  It's our job to help our military and help the government to help our country

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say it's unpatriotic not to make all whole new kinds of weapons that can be used in new ways and we used by  Bad guys, you know, you want to go to the what bad could happen world  Maybe you just don't want to be in the weapon business

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I think that's again for a company with Google's image  I feel like being in the business of weaponizing anything at all is probably just not I don't think that's something they want to step in  I mean, they're protecting freedom. Yeah, I mean you can argue that you know, you're saving lives, you know  You're making the drones smarter. You're you're helping target ID get better. I mean, no, I mean, I don't think Silicon Valley is a pacifist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, you're not saying oh, we shouldn't have a military. We shouldn't have defense  These are these are you I mean these are intended to be defensive weapons, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I just think that for again is specific to Google. I think the message plays very badly for for  Google has adopted such a tone and posture on certain issues. I don't think Google could spin that one. Well, I it's complete dissonance  Yes, it hurt Amazon say no, we'll do it. I  Don't think so. I think Amazon's definitely got that, you know, we take all comers attitude  I mean, they're so focused on commerce and you know business is business and it's cutthroat  I think I think Amazon can totally and totally jive with that. It's a ten billion dollar contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a small at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know you wonder what the core business of Google and Amazon is going to be it in both cases it may be AI and  If that's your core product and core offering that's where your core value comes then passing up government contracts, you know again  There's a there's a dollar sign. You can put that that decision

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Reuters  Dateline  Tuesday  Super micro says  we hired  Nardello and company a global security firm to audit our  Motherboards we test they tested samples of old motherboards like the ones sold to Apple and Amazon that  Bloomberg said were infected with spy chips and new motherboards  It examined software and design files found no unauthorized components or signals being sent out  Bloomberg got it wrong according to super micro and they had an audit to prove it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This story is super fascinating. What a shock. Yeah, what's going on now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I wear his Bloomberg on this  This is time for you step forward and either say oh, yeah  We got it wrong or they got it. They got some splaining to do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean I think this is mostly fascinating is kind of an inside baseball thing just because it's like who told Bloomberg what and why?  Did they believe it? You know, it's in probably had to tell them many times and probably had to you know  Create some evidence that was basically just completely fake. I mean I can only imagine  The whole thing is really just it's totally crazy we we've been talking about this since the first story and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's it's you know, I defended Bloomberg for a long time I talked to  Mark Millian who works at Bloomberg. He knows the one of the authors. He said he worked right next to him  He's very technical very smart. He is not somebody who would be fooled the  Bloomberg's editor-in-chief came from the Economist highly respected  He was involved in over for over one year in the development of this story and presumably putting the authors, you know  to the test  They went with it. They said we had 17 sources and they're still sticking by it and apparently this was yesterday that this  This report came from super micro. We haven't heard anything from Bloomberg  There's apparently they're still sticking by it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean you just have to wonder at this point. How how deep does this go?  I mean are we talking like a state-level actor kind of stories to where you right? I know it's so it's it's I mean the intrigue  Is driving me crazy. I hope I hope eventually we figure it out  But I I kind of wonder if we ever will at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing I can say first of all if you take this review as on face value that there and and by the way  I think I do because nobody else has come up with any of these rice  Colonel sized spy chips  And there are lots of these boards out there  So I'm having I have to think Bloomberg got it wrong  So then the question is well, how could that happen?  And I have to think that they that that this was a concerted effort on the part of the US intelligence community  to  Oh  Miss Lee's care of the Jesus right and this ties in now to the arrest of the Huawei COO and to the  Mm-hmm and to the government  This is is this part of a trade war against China is  These days God knows it could be the problem. We just don't know do we know?  One question here, so let's say let's say you're you know, who got a lot of these boards like Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the Bloomberg story would talk particularly about a company called elemental which makes a streaming device. We use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon was in the process of buying elemental they have bought them since  and in Amazon's  Bloomberg quoted  Unnamed sources from Amazon and Apple but in Amazon's due diligence. They discovered they saw the  They discovered these spy chips on these elementals elementals are used not only by podcasters  But by the Department of Defense  by lots of people to stream video and  The presumption was this was some sort of Chinese spy effort. They didn't necessarily blame super micro  The thought was it could have been introduced by a supplier or a manufacturer  So if you're elemental of your Apple, you're not going to be able to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're elemental of your Apple and you do to see that's just just well Amazon so Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Denied it Apple denied it. Not only that for the first time in public demanded a retraction  They said we've never found such a thing this didn't happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they did find one they'd be loath to announce it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't think they would step forward in such a public. It's not happening, right? I  Think at this point I don't I don't think Bloomberg made it up  So I think they were I think they were played I think that's the only possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's these guys would be that they had to do that. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean at this point I feel like the only avenue for for this to really advance is somebody's got a file a defamation lawsuit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's well super micro says we're considering our legal options

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you do a company I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Guess you would call it  Well, you could probably argue a loss if there's a loss that there's gonna be a cause of action

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure well, you don't have to have a loss to sue and say you defamed us  You may not get big damages, but you can at least sue  It's they're not protected by the First Amendment if they knowingly lied  right, they are protected by the First Amendment if they  Didn't do it with intent right I don't I'm not an expert in the first  But I feel like the point of a suit wouldn't be many kind of monetary

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, it would be to get Bloomberg to give up the goods. Yeah. Yeah discovery. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What what what protections do they have Jeff? So I just was looking up here on the god-blessed Google  Which knows where I am and I'm fine with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See I searched and it didn't give me German law gave me American law because it knows where I am  Because it knows where I am and I'm not harm it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Calm down. Anyway, it says that a company can be defamed though. Only small corporations can sue for defamation  big corporations like can't  Companies like people have reputations can be damaged. However, though companies can claim damages for loss of reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can get nothing for injury to feelings. Yes, I understand that but they by the least could little change that's wrong  Oh, we didn't you know or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm I  Mean it would have been in a small corporations are those which employ fewer than ten people  Are not related to any other corporation for the purpose of Canada. Why is that? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't know. I guess I mean probably the cause of action that would be saying like torches interference  You know the Apple or one of these companies could just claim hey you interfered with my business  You know, I can demonstrate a loss, you know, and I'm sure they can I'm sure they had calls and emails from  Tons and tons of companies and people that they work with deeply concerned about that. We'll see  I mean, you know what it was a lot super micro stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  plummeted after this story  Yeah, and by the way to people who don't like Bloomberg they say that was the reason because Bloomberg reporters  We've been told get paid based on moving the market  What I know I don't that's what I said what I don't believe that I don't believe that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd have to know that would be such a moral hazard

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here it is from Business Insider Bloomberg news pays reporters more if their stories move markets  It's one of many metrics factored into reporters annual bonuses  This is from 2013  We asked Bloomberg back to practice the company spokesperson acknowledged it  It isn't news unless it's true at Bloomberg news. The most important news is actionable  That means we strive to be first to report surprises and markets that change behavior  And we put a premium in reporting that reveals the biggest changes in relative value across all assets  You know, you could say well, they there was a definite, you know bonus in the picture if they could if they could harm  super micro  Super micro

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I don't want to impugn the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Motives or the integrity of these two reporters for everything. I know they're they're they're good reporters. They're not  still

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm it is a mysterious story

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to know more we want to know more and I think if you're super micro you you might have good reason to be  Darn angry  But I'd like to you know what Bloomberg call us  With we'll put you on I'd like to hear your story. I'd like to hear your side of it  So you brought the Huawei story. Yeah, let's do it. We'll tie this into the Huawei story. So by the way has  as  Carson said is the is Ming on the way to in new it on the road to a new it  She's been bailed out right? Yes, none of it. It's the new Bob Hope Bing Crosby  movie the road to none of it  Imagine that she will then be exfiltrated from Canada and so that she doesn't have to stand trial in the United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's supposed to stay in her house or her home  Are they surrounding it? I doubt it. I don't think I mean  Canada can't be too pleased be the middle of this because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's now arrested in China. Yep immediately a Canadian diplomat arrested in China  And if you're an American business person, I wouldn't be going to China anytime soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so and so then then Trump say he may intervene now  The problem is that any country out there says oh we got it. We got a negotiation going on  Let's arrest ourselves a few executives

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so Meng one Joe is  the CFO of Huawei  She's been accused by a US Department of Justice and was arrested in Canada at the behest of the DOJ  for creating a shell corporation to  Bypass Iranian sanctions. So let's stop there for one second

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many companies are doing that these days? That's a question. How many?  Doing it. I mean, it's it's illegal under under not under Chinese law. It's all you know, we make it our sanctions, right?  It's our sanctions. So  Is that  You know for us to step in and arrest someone from another company country in another country because they're violating our law

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They  sold HP gear to Iran  Through this shell company, which they claimed was not part of Huawei. But in fact  All the employees had Huawei badges and we're getting checks from all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just wonder how common it is and why did I'm presuming it's it's fairly common  Not not common common. I'm presuming they're not the only company in the world to do it and why would they pick on Huawei?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and of course, there's a little bar. There's been a drumbeat for years  Don't use Huawei gear in your 5g networks. Don't buy Huawei phones. Don't buy Huawei  Technology because their founder was in the Chinese military and it's presumed that there is a connection between the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I don't trust Huawei myself either. Yeah  But in this house of cards God knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if really this is the problem if if if I  Don't know what to say anymore. I know  But that's the point this is isn't that the goal of all of this is just to confuse the hell out of everybody  So nobody knows what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is what ZTE got in so much trouble for it is the same same basic crime  That they're accusing Huawei of here what granted I think Huawei it's just seems so much less  It seems a little more fishy a because of the timing and political situation  And B because Huawei's business presence the United States is microscopic  You know, they sell some laughs here.

Transcript:  Lily Lily Hay Newman today and wired and she's good  She's your security security porter if China hacked Marriott if 2014 marked a full-on  assault  She says if that was China involved in the 2014 hack of the Marriott because that's what happened  By the way, that would make it just one of several devastating roughly concurrent cyber attacks against the United States  The same year Chinese actors pilfered extremely sensitive and expansive data on  Tens of millions of US citizens. Remember this from the Office of Personnel Management China  In February 2014 anthem was hacked China  Names birth dates addresses Social Security numbers even income data  Throughout 2015 analysts noted the intelligence value to China of gathering in-depth information  On so many people from multiple sources the diverse it this is why by the way, this is this this is the motive  The diversity of data could allow Chinese espionage agents to check and cross-reference information and track individuals over time  If I were if this is crane hassled senior director of threat research at agari  It's a fishing defense firm used to work as a digital behavior analyst for the FBI if I were a foreign intelligence service  By the way good use of the subjunctive tense screen and wanted to get a complete picture about a specific group of people  These are exactly the targets.

So these are old hacks  Going back four years three or four years  They agreed that to stop doing that but they're finding other avenues  Even then less hacking doesn't mean no hacking  All the data that we'd certainly  Indicated that we had certainly indicated a decrease in activity, but decrease does not mean it went to zero  J.

Oh, this is Hangouts chat  Not Hangouts Hangouts chat and Oh guess who is for  You Jeff G suite users, it's rolling out G suite users with the next few days, so this is chat  Android police guy you got to explain explain to me  Please so so there's Hangouts Hangouts chat and there's Hangouts meet yeah chat and first G suite

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right yeah, so chat is for chat is supposed to be this intra-organizational  Communication platform it's like slack okay, it's slack  It's slack but with more of the kind of Hangouts legacy attached to it  Yes, it is ugly slack  I think that's a good way to put it and with a more of a focus on one-to-one communication  I think and then slack has but and then Hangouts meet is just basically as far as I understand it  They're taking a lot of the old Hangouts on air platform  The the meeting the cloud meeting platform, and they're doing something with that. I've not used Hangouts  Doing something with that  That's the thing about Google products though, you know somebody's actually pointing this out to me is you know hey if you look at  Aloe, you know a lot of what made aloe kind of neat  You know is we've been kind of hooked in the Android messages now  And you know so when it when something at Google dies  Usually it kind of lives on with features in other products  and so I think that you kind of have to follow the kind of fall the path and  I think Hangouts meet is you know kind of from where the original Hangouts like voice or the the video product started and Hangouts  Chat is kind of  Aloe meets regular Hangouts meets. I don't know slack or something  So a lot of the stuff does live on it's just like like I've never I've never used either of these platforms because they're enterprise  Only and it's it is  It's hard to keep track

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you use Google Translate, you probably didn't even know this this because gender bias is so built in  But if you translated a sentence that said  From Turkish obi or doktar it would come out. He is a doctor. There was a bias  if you  Used words like strong and doctor you get a masculine skew or feminine or nurse or beautiful you'd get a feminine skew  They're gonna fix that which is good. So now if you translate obi or doctor, you'll get two translations  She is a doctor or he is a doctor. Thank you  That's it shows the reason I bring this up though is it shows how easily these human biases get translated into machine  Learning we think well, it's machine learning. It's not biased  It's a machine but it is because it's biased because it's trained by biased and it biased the problem with bias is off  It's unseen unheard and unknown. So it's actually a difficult thing to root out  We're gonna get Amy Webb on a triangulation student.

Transcript:  I buy completely understand the value of this  You also get great high value rewards that are tailored to start-ups to modern business high multipliers and the stuff you spend the most on  7x on rideshare three times on restaurants and travel two times on software  There's no limit on how many points you can earn and this is the best part. I love this points can be redeemed for statement credit on  transactions  Exclusive offers with some of the best technology brands and services that you might be using as a new business  AWS Google's Salesforce we work  So because brex is underwriting your company that means no minimum operating history. There's no painful paper application  No personal liability. They merely use the cash raised by your business to extend credit  So you don't need a credit score. You don't need a social security number. You don't need a security deposit  It's a Visa card. It's a real credit card, but it's better in a lot of ways. It's very high-tech  First time I use the card I used it as a restaurant  Immediately get a text that said ah, we got your transaction take a picture of the receipt. I thought oh that's interesting. I  Mean this is I mean literally within a second of using it. So I took a picture of the receipt  They said oh good that matches we've categorized it. We put it in we put it in QuickBooks. It's already done  What?  Don't even save the receipt crumple it up throw it away  You just reply to the text message with a picture of receipt and it's automatically matched to the transaction complete statement description  Clearly tell you what you've spent on. Of course, it works not only with QuickBooks, but all the major software programs for accounting  I love this join the thousands of startups and tech companies who use Brex to manage their growing business needs and earn valuable  rewards while they're doing so  Get the card free and  Because you're watching the show  Your card fees will be waived in  perpetuity  Forever  B-r-e-x.com slash tweet b-r-e-x.com  slash  twit  You want to use that URL because that'll that'll eliminate the car fees in perpetuity  Like saying that in perpetuity b-r-e-x.com slash tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  think I  Thought that the this is this isn't particularly Google related, but it was kind of a it was a bit of a funny one this week  Samsung was supreme. I  Don't know if you guys had heard about this. Tell me about it  So so they had you know, they they launched their their phone with the cutout notch which was in the document here and they want  It's not a whole notch it's just yeah, it's it's a yes as a cutout a punch hole punch hole notch  Yeah  so so they launched they they launched the phone and they announced doing a partnership with supreme which you know is so hot right now and  What is supreme supreme is a fashion brand that you like pop-up stores and people go buy supreme merch and you know  It's it's very popular with the young people and it would look a little foolish on me  So except it turned out that the real supreme doesn't have any kind of distribution or IP rights in China  So they partnered with an Italian company that used a copyright or trademark loophole in Europe  prima  Yes prima  Yeah, so so Samsung, you know, they're huge you would think how would they think?  This is a good idea to partner with an obviously fraudulent version of supreme now the the Italian versus prima argues that hey  They're legally protected and there's nothing supreme can do about it, but that's not really as we say a good defense. I don't  That's just like you can't sue us. Okay, that's that's that's definitely grounds to do whatever you want  I guess but so they're now reconsidering they haven't walked away

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They haven't walked away that but they're thinking about it. They are they are considering it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it was this was translated from from Mandarin  It said recently Samsung Electronics announced that the launch of the galaxy 8s that will cooperate with supreme Italia in the Chinese market  We're currently re-evaluating this cooperation and we deeply regret the inconvenience caused see this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so this I'm really glad you brought this up because I saw this story. I didn't get it  I'm not fashioned forward like you are David and so I had no idea who supreme was in the first place  So that now I understand. Thank you. Yeah, I think that sweater proves your point Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four and a half billion four and a half each I think right AOL was four point four billion  So a total of eight point nine billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they even then they were down to half of that and the brand value down to four point eight billion and they wrote off  4.6 billion of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and and the phone company of course now at and t owns time warner, right?  So they're going into the content business, but but folks let me tell you content's a crappy business  So content over it's a gutenberg era thing. Is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, you know, I was looking for something and I really I I wasn't able to come up with anything  Anything great it's it's been a bit of a slow, uh slow news week for us. Come on. What's your favorite phone these days?  What's your favorite android? Oh, man. I mean honestly, that's it's a tough pick. Uh, like the one plus six t better than the pixel  That's a hard one  I don't think I like it better  But I think it's a lot better bang for your buck and if you do want a number I mean one plus the sales of the  60 are up  250 over the six  So they're saying big returns on that t mobile deal and they just came out with a new version of the phone  That's got 10 gigabytes of ram that nobody needs  But you know, it's a partnership with mclaren and I think they're in a business where saturation is really starting to take its toll  On a lot of the big players one plus is up and coming in a way that is pretty interesting to watch  Especially here in the u.s market, which is you know  Really prove kind of intractable. Um in terms of unlocked phones picking up so  And their deal with t mobile is definitely definitely changing things up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I talked to uh, the vp of device pr  waway america  And she said the reason that we didn't introduce the p20 in america and now the it's replacement with the mate  Is because we didn't have a carrier deal  And she said without a carrier deal. It's hopeless  You don't want to spend millions marking a phone if you don't have a carrier deal  You're just not going to sell many devices. So they never were the one country where waway doesn't sell that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, well and then they got kind of banned anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the reason they don't have a carrier deal is because the government stopped running that's exactly right because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They announced verizon and at and t deals at ces a year ago  And they were going to they were going to and they had to cancel them and they were peeved and that's when they said well  We can't sell this phone in the u.s.
