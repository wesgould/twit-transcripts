We're so happy to have Gina Tripani here who is not was not feeling well for a long time.  I didn't know you were coughing last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank goodness for the mute button.  I'm coming down from my cloud of antibiotics.  Get vaccinated, folks.  Get vaccinated.  Seriously, I will come cough on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She you have whooping cough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have Pertussis.  I have adult whooping cough, which is a cough without the whoop.  It's horrible.  Yeah, it's a lot of coughing and a lot of tissues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most of us got a vaccination for it as kids.  But then every 10 years you have to get a booster, your DPT booster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  So the children have been vaccinated.  They're OK.  My niece is a nephew is no problem.  It was the adults in my family who I called and said, hey, did you get your TBD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why don't you go over to Jenny McCarthy's house?  Yeah, seriously.  Cough on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to visit Ms. McCarthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be karma?  Wouldn't that be so funny?  It would be fun.  I wouldn't want to wish that even on Jenny McCarthy.  Also here, he's working on this third day of the fifth day of the year.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis at his office at the City University of New York.  Hey, Jeff.  Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two of the.  And good work on me to the crew on the Best of show.  I thought it was.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a lot of glee, a lot of Chipotle.  Yeah.  So you so in fact, that was that that great scene.  In fact, it was hard.  Poor Eileen really had to work because we had I guess we hadn't saved it or something.  But where she brings the Chipotle in during the show for me, apparently the the the Twitter  for Chipotle, what is it Chipotle tweets?  Only tweets was underwhelmed by the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well no, he came back around.  He was he was happy.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  In fact, you know, I said that they should sponsor.  They should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should sponsor your Facebook stream, Jeff.  You're always at Chipotle.  He's there.  Every time I look on Facebook, Jeff says at Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They offered me coupons and I said, no, just sponsor the show.  Yeah.  No, I found out.  I wish that they had jalapeno as a choice.  They don't.  But Chipotle tweets said that you could ask for it.  And indeed, you can get diced fresh jalapeno peppers from the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, so that Twitter thing helps.  It does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Secret menu, secret menu items.  Yeah.  You could also ask for more cilantro from the.  Oh, I love the cilantro.  I could always use more cilantro.  Is the chat room going nuts right now?  Oh, my God, they're into it already.  No, Chipotle rocks.  OK, right demographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  Let us talk about Google.  By the way, yes, there is a four square check in for every Chipotle in the country.  There is a four square check.  And I have to thank Dan Hendricks, our chat room moderator, who created a four square  check in for our CES booth.  Right on.  Watch for some check ins.  I know Gina and Jeff, you are not going to consumer electronics show.  No, you go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went every year for many years.  Last time I stopped in 2004 because I didn't have to.  And it's pretty exhausting.  We started again last year for the Twitter network.  And in fact, I'm really looking forward to it.  We're sending a bunch of people down.  We will have amazing coverage starting tonight and going through all day, Friday,  Saturday and Sunday with everything you'd ever want to know.  The big the big story, frankly, I think at CES last year was 3D TV's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that took over the world, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm sure they'll be back for round two.  In fact, there are going to be a lot of 3D camcorders trying to get.  Let's get some content here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let me put on some really big glasses and get a horrible headache  and watch TV.  And that result is, oh, I can touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm with you, to be honest.  But apparently the industry is still 100 percent behind 3D.  And then the other story was because Apple hadn't yet come out with his iPad.  In fact, at the time, we thought it was going to be called the iSlate.  So there were all these slates.  Well, stand back.  Because if you thought there were slates and a lot of them at CES last year,  this is the year where everybody and their brother is going to do.  And they'll all be Android based because Android is free.  So any manufacturer, including Asus, Vizio, Motorola,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which I like, we bought Vizio TV's like them.  They're going to do both a tab and a phone this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, both on Android.  Yeah. So instead of CES, we're going to call it CAT,  Crappy Android Tablet.  Lots of them will be there, I'm sure.  Actually, only one that I know of will be running Honeycomb.  Honeycomb, it requires.  Well, that's and the reason I say that is because it requires an A9, a dual processor  that is currently only available in the Nvidia Tegra platform.  And Motorola's they say, Motorola is announcing its tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's depressing, though. That means that my poor beloved  Galaxy Tab will never run Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and that's the that's actually a big part of the story is because it requires  dual processors, you're right. Nothing out there right now will run it.  Although your contract, you've got Froyo on that, right?  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got to be so jean is so as soon as I read that story,  they've been OK, Jean is right.  Jean is too nice to say, I told you so.  Was she was she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you saying don't get a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just coughing out the words I told you.  So I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I told you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I feel bad.  I feel bad that your your tabs going to be, you know, possibly obsolete.  That that that stinks. That stinks. But  yeah, this is kind of the reason why I'm trying to hold out  for the official tablet ready honeycomb release.  But I don't know. It's tough.  When the next iPad comes out, I may buy that first.  We'll see. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the Motorola event is, I think, going on right now.  My writers are tomorrow at 1 p.m.  4 p.m. It was 4 p.m.  So it's going on this afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just so glad that all of you go to CES and figure out what's important.  All of me who get to sit home and wrapped up in my blanket,  because I've never been to CES, but it sounds like a nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going next year. I'm making you go next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I kind of like I can't call myself a tech journalist at all  because I've never been to CES, but it just sounds like it sounds insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've been right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I haven't been for many years, but it just is.  The walking is just killer on that hard floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's you cannot cover it all in the amount of time allotted.  It's huge. There's a pretty broad variety of stuff,  because remember, this isn't a computer show.  It's it's consumer electronics, which means everything from  rocks for your garden that have built in speakers to car stereo to TVs.  Or do they still have the adult videos?  They've moved the adult video into the adult video expo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That used to be funny. It was this cordoned off area.  Right. And you'd watch the the electronics stores openers skulking in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My wife asked me because I was you know, I had I was not planning to go.  We're not bringing our cameras there.  Do not look for coverage on Twitter of the adult video expo.  But my wife said, well, you've been there before.  I said, yeah, when I was at Tech TV, they sent me and a crew over.  And it was a nightmare. And she said, oh, yeah, you hated it.  But it was a nightmare because apparently a lot of strippers watched Tech TV.  So I'm there with a camera crew and they all go,  and they're trying to give me lap dances.  They're rubbing up against me and they're the camera crew is going.  And I think, no, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, I mean, I'm just thinking of my first public image here and my wife,  what she's going to say when she sees this video.  We made a quick exit and I am not going this year.  But yeah, they had to separate them.  They were the whole idea of CES is a consumer electronics show.  It brings dealers of consumer electronics to meet the manufacturers  to decide what they're going to buy.  Usually not now, but in September, you know, for the next year's holiday buying season,  or 2011's holiday buying season.  And of course, there were a lot of video stores involved with that.  So the video cassette guys were all there and a lot of adult video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't get this out of my mind.  Geek strippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, well, okay.  You know why?  You know why this was?  Because this was in the dawn of the webcam girls.  So this was, I don't know what year, 2002 or 2003,  where there were a lot of strippers, women who realized they could kind of,  and actually it was empowering.  Make their own living.  It was feminist because they were going to get out of the strip club,  get out of the whatever, you know, unhappy situation they were in and come from their home.  And it would be their own business and so forth.  And so remember, Danny, I can remember her last name,  Danny's download, the most downloaded woman on the internet.  This was right about that time.  So it was really when the adult industry was discovering the internet.  And so that's why when I walked in, I guess for a lot of them,  I was teaching them how to do it.  I didn't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense.  That makes a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Otherwise, I don't think I'd have a big constituency in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And geeks across the world, thank you for it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The new Motorola tablet, you know.  I am. If I could, I would.  The new Motorola tablet is on a Tegra 2.  So it does have the A9 processor.  It's called the Atrix ATRIX 4G.  It will be AT&T.  It will support AT&T's HPSA plus network.  AT&T announced it this morning at their developers conference.  How big?  Right.  Let me look.  Let me see.  It looks...  You know, the picture looks like it's a 7-inch.  I can't tell.  It doesn't...  You know, this is a pretty poor article.  It doesn't say anything about the specs just that they announced it.  So I will continue to look.  If anybody knows...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at...  It says a 4-inch.  That can't be...  No, maybe it is.  The ATRIX 4G dual-core smartphone.  Oh, it's a phone.  It's a phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  4-inch QHD 24-bit capacitive touchscreen, microSD.  I'm looking at...  I just Googled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google ATRIX.  So that's not the tablet,  but it will be capable of running Honeycomb.  Presumably because it's got the Tegra 2 in it.  We're going to see so much stuff this week.  And I imagine some of it will be worth looking at.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I want to see is creative uses of the chipset and the OS in other kinds of devices.  Yeah.  Right?  You know, the fabled internet refrigerator.  How all...  You'll see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure Android will be in everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, how all can Ford use it in cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Toyota, in fact, says they're doing a platform.  We haven't heard about it yet.  A sync-like platform for Toyota.  They're a little bit behind on that.  But yes, of course.  If you're a car manufacturer, the first...  Now, Microsoft car powers sync.  It's a Microsoft platform which sync is built on top of.  But if you're a manufacturer trying to compete with sync,  I would think the first thing you do is look at Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I saw another car.  I can't remember who it was that's going to broadcast your car's location.  Is it Hyundai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't see that.  Well, you know, the folks, Parrot, who do...  They do that drone helicopter that was really big at CES last year.  They actually are an in-car stereo guys.  And they're making an Android-based car unit  that will in fact broadcast your position and do all sorts of stuff and have apps on it.  It's its own platform.  So they're hoping that people will develop specifically for the Parrot in-car platform.  Let me see.  They do Bluetooth hands-free.  Actually, they do a very cool Bluetooth hands-free set.  That's right. I forgot about that.  But they have announced an Android-based in-car system with a knob and all sorts of stuff.  I think we're going to see...  You know what?  Just for you, Jeff, I will wander the floor looking for exactly that.  Not tablets, not phones, but new uses of Android.  And because Android is open source and free, anybody can do something.  That's why you're going to see all these cheap Android clones.  Is that bad for Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Chrome OS devices at CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think Google's planning that.  In fact, you know what?  We're not going to see, which is kind of a surprise.  We're not going to see a Google TV devices either because Google told its partners,  I can not mention Google TV.  Please don't talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we call that a beta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is Google's presence at CES?  They don't have a booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have a booth.  I don't think they have any official presence there.  Oh, okay.  In fact, as I said, the one thing they don't want,  is anybody mentioned Google TV?  Microsoft is going to take on, everybody agrees, Google TV.  We don't know yet.  This is an official, but the rumor is that Steve Ballmer, who speaks tonight,  we all know he'll announce competing tablets based on Windows 7,  not on Android, obviously, for competing to the iPad.  But the rumor is they're going to announce a $200 media center device  that will compete with Google TV.  And I'll be honest with you, Microsoft is not like Apple in its ability to keep  rumors quiet.  I think if this rumor is everywhere, I think it's probably true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, doesn't Microsoft have like a gazillion media center products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft's biggest problem, as you're seeing right here, is they have a bazillion products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right.  They have a bazillion.  I mean, they have the Xbox, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Xbox should have, it should be this device.  And I would hope that the capabilities of this device would migrate to Xbox.  They used to support media extender devices made by a variety of companies that would allow you  to hook something to your TV that would then pull from Windows media devices and play your  stuff on your TV.  But that wasn't my, it was, you know, other parties made those.  But they've never been able to make an inexpensive set-top box.  No.  So this is a very interesting idea for Microsoft, especially if you get the price down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what, Kinect could be, to my mind, a really important part of that because  it can finally change the UI of going around a TV.  Right.  That's a good point.  That could be hugely important.  I mean, I'm so impressed with Kinect.  We got it for Jake.  Isn't it great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing.  And it does change the whole notion of UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the radio show, I, because you have to do this, gave my list of top five gadgets of 2010.  And Kinect was number five, easily, you know.  iPad was number three.  The Nexus S was number two.  The MacBook Air was number one.  I can't remember what number four was.  It wasn't Google TV, I'll tell you that.  It might've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good picks.  Good picks, Leo.  So far so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did I leave out?  Samsung Galaxy Tab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff would probably say so.  I'd like that.  I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm loving it.  Was it one of the five best things of 2010?  Thumb typing.  You don't use swipe because it comes with swipe on it.  I can't use swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't thumb type with swipe, that's for sure.  No, swipe doesn't work the way my brain works.  Oh, interesting.  I'm a touch typist, so I'm hitting buttons.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I got the Nexus S, which means I got  the new Google keyboard.  And I have to say, I was not...  I used it for a while and I went back to SwiftKey,  which I really like, but I always end up on swipe.  Really?  Swipe's the bet.  I think Gina and I both agree that swipe's the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you can.  I was using ShapeWriter, it's kind of similar thing.  I went just going back to the stock keyboard for a little while.  Could you?  What did you say?  I was having trouble with the ShapeWriter getting stuck.  It wouldn't retract and it was bugging me.  But yeah, I'm still not...  I think I'm not trying...  What's that other one?  The...  It's not a touch...  It's not a slide keyboard, but it's a SwiftKey.  That's the one I was using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of like SwiftKey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm still...  I'm noncommittal still on the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The T9, the Android T9 is driving me nutty sometimes.  I hate you.  Because there's things you just can't do.  You cannot do something like Twig.  Capital, capital, lowercase capital, it will not let you do that.  It will not listen to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, SwiftKey will remember it.  I mean, that's swipe.  Not...  Well, SwiftKey will too, but swipe will remember it and then you can swipe it.  Which I do all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it won't even...  On the regular keyboard, it won't let you do that.  You can't add to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you add to the dictionary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mean you're just talking about the case, right?  He wants to save the case, yeah.  Right, right.  Case, that's one example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it will not let you do it.  You can manually do it 10 times.  It will not let you...  You can blame me for that because nobody...  This is Google.  We know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody does reverse intercapping except Twit.  But I do it a lot, so there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's my answer to CamelCase.  I just say, no, I'm going to do it the other way.  What's an upside down hump?  Huh?  Huh?  That's what the lowercase i in the all uppercase word for Twit and Twig...  Well, I say, I like it.  I like it too.  Although I have to say, and as a journalist, you probably hate this too.  In fact, what is your policy?  Remember CNET...  Serial commas.  Always serial commas.  I agree.  I'm a Harvard comma guy.  But no, no, I'm not talking about that.  What do you do about weird typography?  Like CNET is technically C bar, NET, all lowercase.  What do you do?  Do you just type CNET?  Screw them.  Screw them.  So in a way, that's my attitude as a journalist.  But then as a brand, it's nice to have something that stands out and is unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then AOL does capital A lowercase ol now, except in its own billboard in the valley,  it's all caps.  It's an acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It should be all caps.  They changed it to AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or maybe they don't want anybody to remember America online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This may be the most ridiculous topic we've ever done on capitalization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This brings me back to my first year Lifehacker, where we had massive internal debates about the  like exclamation point at the end of Yahoo and things like that.  You style guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did you decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to be true to the brands.  We went to the exclamation point for a while, but then I just said, this is not-  It's like you're advertising.  Yahoo!  Well, right.  And this sentence just wouldn't read well.  So I figured the copy was more important than the brand.  I agree.  Yahoo!  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so as a journalist, I'm with you guys.  I'm saying don't do those.  That's like branding stuff.  Don't do that.  Just put it into English.  But then as a brander, you want to have that because that Yahoo!  mark is part of your look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yahoo! should be followed now by a question mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo!  Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just wrong.  But I still got a good laugh out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's right.  It ain't wrong.  It's so wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's right.  Okay, Jeff.  So I'm typing twig with capital T, capital W and capital G and a lowercase i.  And it takes a little work to do it because you have to like hit the shift key a couple  of extra times.  But then you get that like, do you get the tap to save prompt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  For the regular keyboard T9?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's a tap to save.  I didn't know there was a tap to save.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so when you type in a word that it doesn't know or that's not in its dictionary,  it will tap it.  Like you'll see it listed like, oh, this is the thing you type.  Tap it.  And then it'll say tap to save if you want to retype it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'll try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even feverish Gina has used whole properties of mine.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm pretty sure chat room will let me know if it's not.  Give it a try and we'll see if we can figure it out.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I did it right now, my tongue would be sticking out and I'd be cursing,  so I'm going to not do it now.  I do that too when you're concentrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that Google TV got jailbroken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yay.  I have to hook my Google TV back up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, don't not so fast.  You have to solder on a board in order to load the ROM.  So not yet.  We're not there yet, but it's the beginning.  And actually this took a lot longer than I thought it would take to be honest.  I mean, I think it's just a reflection of the lack of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me just ask, wouldn't jailbreaking it be the greatest favor?  Maybe people would actually write things for it that would make more sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it requires sort of a level of devotion from developers to do this type of thing.  So I think that it's a good thing.  I think jailbreaking just means that they replace the Flash player inside  from Google TV because Hulu and those sites that are blocking check the version of the Flash player.  But you have to go in and you have to get access to it.  Here's what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need a brand new out of the box Logitech review.  If you update it, it will stop work.  It won't work.  So I'm out of luck.  Okay.  You also have to solder wires to add a port to the motherboard of the review.  Jesus.  And then you download the modified Flash player.  Because what happens is, you know, normally you use the browser user agent to identify,  oh, that's a Google TV.  And so initially that's what the networks and Hulu were doing.  They were saying, well, I see the browser you're using is a Logitech or a Google TV.  So we're not going to let you do it.  And then Google said, well, no problem.  We'll change the user agent.  Actually, users said that.  And they said, well, we better look elsewhere.  It turns out Flash also has a non-modifiable normally user agent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unless you install another version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to get a different version.  Son Jake was saying that, you know, and I finally installed the Apple TV and he said,  you should have just gotten a Mac mini.  It's a far better way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes and no.  It's interesting.  You know, I'm actually giving a lecture on the cruise.  I'm going to be gone for three weeks in February to South America.  And one of the lectures is turning a Mac mini into a home theater PC.  And one of the pieces of advice I'll give people.  She's coughing.  I thought you were mocking me.  No, I wasn't mocking.  I was.  Gina covered her mouth.  I thought she was laughing.  Well, the only reason you do it is if you want to do it.  See, here's the it's funny.  I think I mentioned this before.  Veronica Belmont made a Google spreadsheet matrix of all the different units and what  they can do and no one Roku popcorn hour WD live.  No one unit does it does everything.  The only way to do that is to use a computer.  Then you get everything right.  So that's the only compelling reason to do it.  But truthfully, it's so much more expensive because you got to start with a 699 computer  and you have to do a lot of messing around with it.  You might as well just get a Roku box and live with it and say, well, sorry,  because you got Hulu Plus, you got Netflix, you got Amazon,  you got a bunch of third party channels, including Twitter.  I think the Roku is still the king of the hell.  I'm sorry, Google, but you just know it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like the classic Xbox hack.  Leo, do you remember this back when they won?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bunny Wong, he was the guy who did that on the original Xbox.  And I I soldered more than a few chips onto an Xbox motherboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see.  Now I'm too lazy.  I waited around until it was a soft mod.  Right.  And eventually it was a soft mod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's always had to have a chip, though.  Right.  But eventually they had a chip that you just used springs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this type of thing will get easier.  Assuming that Google TV hangs around and gets more developer interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it an open platform?  Why should you have to do this?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, right?  It's like you go with Android so you don't have to jailbreak.  Just the fact that they're using the word jailbreak breaks my heart.  It's like, oh, back.  I might as well just buy an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  The thing that and Giga Ohms, Janko Rutgers,  points this out in his article about the hack.  The one thing all that Google needs to do is put the marketplace on Google TV and you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it really, really needs, for sure.  I've been liking the Google TV.  I feel like there's a little bit of a wave moment again for me,  but I don't think it's that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you're a jinx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I feel like it's like, don't say this.  Maybe I have a high tolerance for the keyboard.  I love having the big keyboard.  I mean, I was watching the UConn Stanford women's basketball game,  I had picture in picture and I had the Twitter search going.  I'm like, it was cool.  I was like, this is really cool.  This is kind of what I wanted.  Sure, there are a lot more things I want.  I do want the market.  I do want a lot of other apps.  I don't want to have to deal with this blocking and jailbreaking,  but I'm still like, this is really cool.  Now, Google sent me a Google TV unit.  I am too cheap to have gone out and bought it myself, for sure.  So I don't think people should buy it right now.  $300 I spent on that piece of crap.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not, no, not a good choice.  True. I agree with you that the Roku is a better choice right now,  but I think it has a lot of potential.  I bought them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I spent 200 bucks on the Boxee Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  How do you like the Boxee Box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot like the Google TV.  It doesn't have Netflix.  I mean, not having Netflix to me is like,  that's a deal breaker, but it does have, and you might like this.  It has what looks like the Roku remote.  It's not very big.  If you flip it over, it's got a keyboard on it.  I mean, it's like kind of like the Droid Pro keyboard.  So you could type, which I think is kind of interesting.  I like the Boxee software a lot.  And in fact, Boxee or Plex are my choices on the Mac Mini,  but the Boxee Box, because it doesn't have all, you know, Hulu Plus,  I suppose it was supposed to get that soon.  It doesn't have Netflix.  You know, one of the things that's going to happen at CES is a lot of manufacturers,  including Samsung, Panasonic, are going to have remotes that have a Netflix button,  a red Netflix button on the remote.  Jesus.  Talk about a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix is awesome.  They're killing it.  That's amazing.  They're killing it.  That's done.  Yeah.  Remote placement.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How often do people buy a new TV?  Maybe every five to 10 years, right?  So that means that Netflix is front and center on that TV for the next five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So forget having the desktop, the screen top.  You want the clicker top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Boy, do you want the clicker top.  There's not a lot of real estate on a remote.  If you have a Netflix button on a remote, you own that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Netflix earned that.  Netflix is awesome.  It's awesome.  I've been so sick the past week.  Netflix saved me.  I just, so great.  The streaming is amazing.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My daughter came home from college and spent two weeks watching Netflix on the Roku.  That's all she did.  She said, why didn't you tell me about this?  And she's, you know, she speaks French, so she was watching a lot of French movies.  It's actually an interesting collection of stuff.  It's not too bad.  And what happens is, yeah, the movie you want, you can't get.  You have to get that on DVD.  But there's so many movies that are okay, then you just watch those instead.  It's true.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back with more.  There's a lot going on.  Amazon is going to go into competition with Google.  Google is going into competition with Apple.  The Chrome Store, a little bit of a disappointment.  We'll talk more about all of that in just a bit.  This week in Google is on the air with Gina Trapani from smarterware.org and ThinkUp,  a great tool.  Mr. Martin likes that tool.  Yay.  So that was right in telling him that the CSV button on ThinkUp downloads  is it all of his tweets and all the replies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can export.  Well, the CSV link, yeah, you export all your tweets.  It's just your tweets.  You can also search and export and filter replies.  But you can't, because that's what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not just his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants replies as well.  He can get that.  In fact, I should make a new file that's sort of structured that way where it shows his...  A comma separated value.  This is one of my moments where I was like, oh, maybe this isn't the best label for the export  button.  CSV is meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I sent him an email too and I realized I had to do...  It's a comma separated values, parenthesis CSV file you can import into Excel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Terrible, terrible UI on my part.  So that was a learning moment.  Geeks like it though.  Well, he said, I got my CVS file and I was like, oh, it's not the pharmacy.  Bad choice on my part.  So we're going to relabel that button soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, Steve Martin is using Gina's software.  He's a beta tester.  That's a pretty good beta tester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost as good as the twitfez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I've been using it too and it's really, it's so cool.  Do you have at some point a plan to...  I mean, you can get download to share server and reinstall it, but do you have at some  point a plan for somebody to make like a service using this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we just put together my coworker, Andy Bayo put together super simple steps  to deploy ThinkUp to an Amazon EC2 instance.  It takes under 10 minutes and Amazon's actually doing this deal.  If you're a new EC2 customer, you get a free instance.  I mean, it's a tight, it's a micro instance.  So you get like maybe 600 megabytes of storage.  It's a smaller instance, but for free for a year.  So if you want to try ThinkUp, go to thinkupapp.com or get in touch with the mailing list.  Literally, it's nine steps.  So it'll take you about 10 minutes.  You can have ThinkUp up and running on the EC2 instance.  So you don't even need a web host.  We hope to do more of that kind of one click install.  Are you going to do a hosted version of ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I want.  I think some company should come along and make ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not, but maybe I'm not in the near future.  It's just a scale, you know, it's a scaling issue.  And it's just like, do I really want to replicate, try and replicate Twitter and  Facebook's databases?  First of all, I can't.  I mean, it's just, you know, I'm just more interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ev, would you just buy this thing from Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm interested in doing peer to peer, peer to peer hooks at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on, Costello.  Get off your duff and buy ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we do want to make it as easy as possible for folks to try it out without having to  go through as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the EC2 instance, but that's still pretty, I mean, I don't think Steve Martin's  going to be setting up an EC2 instance in the near future.  Right.  Right.  I actually, I, before I sent him to you, I said, well, I'll just install it and he  can run it on my server.  And then I don't have the PHP data objects installed, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, PDO, right.  Right.  So guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to recompile PHP to put it in.  That's a bummer.  I'm not doing that.  As much as I'd like to run ThinkUp on my own server.  So do we have to thank the AAAS for providing you with the bandwidth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, AAAS, well, you know, AAAS is our parent organization.  So they, they and the MacArthur Foundation fund expert labs.  So they're giving me a couple of servers to deploy to folks with good data for everyone  from the White House to Steve Martin now.  So, and we're equally excited about all those.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, so they've been fantastic.  AAAS has been very supportive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're on GitHub.  If you search GitHub for ThinkUp, you can download the code, run the server.  Point seven is the current version.  Yep.  It's just PHP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nothing too fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  PHP and MySQL, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PHP and MySQL.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you need the PHP data objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you need PDO.  You do need PDO and GD and a couple of more.  I had everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had everything except PDO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except PDO.  Damn.  So close.  But still it means I got the email of Steve Martin.  So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I'm glad actually that worked out pretty well.  That worked out pretty well.  You have this super secret email address.  Do not, do not give that out.  You can also follow Jeff Jarvis.  I was giving a big plug to Gina, but let me give a big plug to Jeff Jarvis.  His book is What Would Google Do?  And his blog is BuzzMachine.com.  And we will be right back with more conversation about Google in the cloud in just a minute.  But before we go much further, I got to thank our friends at Ford.  We're about to head down to Las Vegas.  And I'll tell you what.  Couldn't afford to do this if it weren't for Ford sponsoring our trip.  It is a very expensive enterprise, as you might imagine, bringing 15 people to Las Vegas,  feeding them, let alone all the equipment, the gear, the stage.  And Ford is saying, no, we want you to do this.  Now, good news.  Ford's going to be very much a part of CES.  Alan Mulally is giving a keynote, I think tomorrow morning.  And we will be talking to Alan shortly after that.  Maybe Friday morning.  Yeah, we'll be talking to Alan shortly after that keynote speech.  CEO of Ford.  He's a fascinating guy.  Former Boeing engineer.  He designed the 777 cockpit and came to Ford and really has taken that company.  And turn it around.  Well, I don't want to say turn around because they never took any  money from the federal government.  They were always solvent.  He's just making great cars.  And he's making the American industry proud.  And I'm very proud to drive a Ford.  That Ford Mustang right there in the back lot.  Sweet.  It's got the Ford SYNC installed.  That's one of the reasons I love it.  True hands-free calling.  You just press a button on the steering wheel.  You never take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel.  That's the whole, that's the motto.  Just think of that.  You focused on what you're doing, which is most important, which is driving.  But you're still connected to the world.  It works great with Android phones.  My DroidX actually reads me text messages as they come in.  And I can send canned messages out.  I can call anybody without taking my hands off the wheel.  I just press the button on the steering wheel.  True hands-free calling.  I say call Gina Trapani on cell.  Boom.  It even understands Trapani.  It actually understands 10,000 commands.  And because it downloads your address book from your phone,  it knows everybody you know, knows all their phone numbers.  You got it all in the Ford.  Turn-by-turn directions too.  GPS is built into Ford SYNC.  Personalized traffic alerts and weather.  911 assist.  And a personalized vehicle health report, which I love.  I set it for every 5,000 miles, but you can do it on demand.  And it will go through the car, tell you all about what's going on internally,  give you all the recall or maintenance information you need.  You can even schedule service online at syncmyride.com.  Now take that and now get in a new Ford Edge or the new Ford Focus and you'll see the My  Ford Touch.  Some of the Lincolns have it too.  That is taking sync.  Plus you got the 8-inch screen.  You got the 5-way touch pads on the steering wheel.  You got the LCD screens.  I mean, it's like you're in a command center.  You actually are.  I love it and I want you to try it.  Go to your local Ford or Lincoln dealer and test drive My Ford Touch and SYNC.  And if you want to know more, you can also go to syncmyridepodcast.com for demos  and all the information you need.  And we do thank Ford so much for sponsoring our coverage of CES 2011.  It all begins tonight, 7 p.m. Pacific Thursday night.  No, I'm sorry.  Wednesday night, 7 p.m. Pacific.  Becky Worley and Tom Merritt will be live from Digital Experience.  7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern.  Then tomorrow, 1 p.m. Pacific, Sarah Lane and I kick the whole thing off.  It's going to be fun.  The show floor opens tomorrow.  All right.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis and moi.  We're talking about Google.  Amazon says we're going to open an app store.  This is an interesting play.  This is again something that happens because of the openness of Android.  Android has its marketplace that comes with Google phones.  Now that's a Google product.  So do you have to do a Google deal to have the marketplace in there?  In other words, do these Chinese tablet manufacturers not?  They don't get Gmail.  They don't get Maps.  Do they get marketplace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I mean, I know for sure that the, excuse me, the Gmail app is a closed source.  So you can eat.  I think marketplace is too.  I believe the market is as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can download maps, but if you don't have marketplace, you can't download marketplace.  I mean, I guess you could get an APK file somewhere.  So this kind of is an interesting play.  Amazon saying, well, you don't need Google.  In fact, anybody could write that Google layer.  That's what people were theorizing Facebook might do is take the Android base  and instead of using the Google apps, put Facebook apps on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So would they ship a device with only the Facebook market on it or is Amazon?  Well, I mean, because don't you need the market in order to get the Amazon market?  Or is this, you know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, so, okay.  So those of us who have standard Android devices, we can download the Amazon app store.  I don't know.  First of all, it's just getting started.  It won't be available till later this year, but they're now the developers are being invited  to participate today.  As of today, if you're a developer, you can go to developer.amazon.com and find out more about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that still good for Google?  Eric Schmidt said a year ago that the one with more apps wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  200,000 apps at last count, by the way.  That's amazing.  Apple's got 300,000, but the gap is closing very, very, very, very fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a great thing.  Developers are used to making money through Amazon.  I mean, not quite this way, but certainly through referrals and Amazon's going to,  you know, their market's going to be really good.  They have a great recommendation engine.  They're going to do a lot of good, like, you like this app, then you're going to love these  other three apps kind of things.  And your friends have looked at, I'm not sure if they do, do they do much social?  They don't do very much social, but Amazon is really good at recommending stuff that you like.  So this is great.  I think it's great for Google.  I think it's good for developers.  I'm interested to know how it would work.  How do I get the Amazon market or, you know, are Amazon going to ship devices?  Are they going to ship a device with the Amazon market on it only?  That seems a little far-fetched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if more companies don't partner with Google when they put out their devices,  then there might be a natural thing to put the Amazon marketplace on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it take to download an app into the phone?  If Gina, you wrote an app tomorrow and just wanted to give it to the two of us,  what would it take?  Oh, it's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I would just, well, I would send you a link to the APK file, right?  But you have to set your phone to install APKs from unverified sources, unsigned sources.  That's not really a big deal, but it's kind of, it's a setting that you'd have to go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd have to do that for Amazon too, by the way, I presume on our phones.  You'd have to say, allow third-party sources.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All credit to Amazon do that.  Can they hook in and just do that for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I wonder if there's a way to say Amazon is a trusted  delivery mechanism for apps and have that set as a, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would Google fight Amazon?  Why wouldn't they?  They don't take a cut.  Does Google take a cut?  No. You can buy, I mean, Google, you see, Amazon would take that 70-30 split.  Right.  But Amazon would then take some of the money they make, I think, and they're going to vet apps.  You have to get approval.  They say currently it's a one-week approval, but it could get longer if a lot of people do it.  I think users are going to like that because they're going to have some  perception that it's safer, more secure.  There won't be porn or illegal apps, but they won't be as strict, they say, as Apple is with its apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Father jobs.  And does the deal tie into Amazon web hosting?  As a developer, is this just going to be a really two-way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, but I would guess it'd be just like Apple where they host it for you.  They've got to give you something for the 30%.  Oh, by the way, they set the price.  This is what's going to piss off developers.  You can set a suggested list price, but Amazon reserves the right to charge anything they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just like books.  Just like books.  Ug.  Authors make no money on books that get sold on Amazon because they, like,  lower the price so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was good right up to that point, wasn't it?  It was.  And then all of a sudden it's like, well, why would I do that?  Now, neither marketplace will have exclusivity, at least as of now, so you could be on both.  But of course, Amazon could undercut the price on the Google marketplace.  The setup is you set a list price.  That's the price you want it to be.  Amazon uses a variety of market factors to decide what price it will use.  You get 70% of Amazon's price, but they guarantee that you won't get any less than 20% of the list.  So if they discount it, if you charge, say, I want 10 bucks, and they discount it to $1,  you're still guaranteed $2 somehow.  I don't know how.  Is Amazon going to make up the difference?  I don't get it.  I guess Amazon will never set it below $2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  So they could do specials on apps.  They could drive people to Amazon.  That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could do bundles.  They could do specials.  They drive traffic.  I don't know.  You're a developer, Gina.  It rankles, but on the other hand, can you say no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like being an author, my book has to be on Amazon.  It may get to that same point with apps where, hey, I definitely want my app to be on Amazon.  I don't know.  It bugs me a little bit.  Really, are people going to run to buy your app if it's 50 cents less or a dollar less?  How much of a sale are we talking about here?  A couple bucks, right?  I don't know.  What's the most expensive app except for that $1,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a $1,000 Android app?  That was an Apple app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which was a gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, there is a real $1,000 Apple app that is training for some sort of certification that is  actually worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually, yeah.  As a developer, I would definitely put my app on every venue right to sell it.  It doesn't bug me too much.  I mean, not a lot of developers are even charging for their apps right now,  which I think is a mistake.  I think more developers shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't Rovio say, didn't the developer, the guy who wrote the Angry Birds software said,  we still prefer iOS.  Not that we make more money, we just like the platform better.  I think you recently said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did they?  Yeah, it's interesting.  I haven't done a whole lot of iOS development.  In fact, I've only dabbled in Android development.  I'm still really kind of a noob for mobile development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You and I both got the test app running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you got the, right.  I got the Hello World app running.  Hello World, yeah.  I mean, I think we can extrapolate from, I mean, Google's tools are very powerful and very nerdy.  Apple's tools are a lot more elegant maybe and a little more aesthetic,  maybe a little more limiting, but still.  So I can see why it might be more pleasant, the SDK might be more pleasant to work with.  But I'm not sure.  I haven't done any iOS development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Theo, I don't know if this is new or not.  I'm just seeing conversation in chat room plus Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see your link here that you just put in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just added a link to a video on Engadget for a honeycomb preview.  I don't know if that's new or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen it.  Let's see here.  The video is embedded below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't up for a while.  It was coming up private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sources Android developers on YouTube.  So let's watch a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Head and shoulders is just a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's not watch a head and shoulders ad, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You trying to tell me something?  Hey, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They call them AD shampoos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Engadget says, perhaps the best thing to say is that this looks more or less nothing like Android.  Huh.  The browser is the same.  The Gmail app will be familiar iPad users,  but trust us when we say there's a lot of lovely UI in the video above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android 3.  Oh, this is going to kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because this is what you can't get on your Samsung.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, very whizzy.  Drag and drop icon.  Yeah, this is why it needs two processors.  Experience of the full web, best of class web browsing.  Well, we got that.  You're not losing anything there.  There's that honeycomb style or gingerbread style.  I don't actually like that much.  This is the Google eBooks.  Nice bookstore.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cover flow.  Page turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very cover flowy.  Yeah, page turn.  We can leave that out.  Tablet optimized Gmail.  But this looks very much that looks just like the iPad.  Well, it depends on how big the tablet is.  Right.  You just redesigned.  This is the YouTube leanback, isn't it?  So that's what they're showing there.  Newly redesigned.  Chat face to face with hundreds of millions of Google Talk users.  Wait a minute.  Front facing camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has to be, right?  Has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're showing off the vector Google Maps.  So they're doing FaceTime with Gtalk.  Can you do Gtalk video now?  No, you can't.  Can you?  I don't know.  You'll like this.  Samsung just announced the Wi-Fi only Galaxy.  Oh, you won't like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, poor Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff is just getting killed today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the cost of being an early adopter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said, you know, mine was a loaner from Sprint, which I have sent back since.  But I liked it.  And obviously a lot of people liked it.  Sold as we mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using it so much.  I'm getting back.  The only problem with it is.  You're stuck for two years.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  And Verizon just cut the price from $599 to $500.  Right.  And they only rebated the money for the last two weeks of purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Boy, you really did get screwed on that one.  Hey, hey.  Hey, you really did.  So Honeycomb when?  When do we see Honeycomb?  Have they said later this year?  They've just said.  I will see probably a lot of tablets with Honeycomb.  I will make a very big point to get some Honeycomb.  We're going to do iPad today, tomorrow morning.  And release it by Friday.  And even though it's our iPad show, I think because we're at CES,  a lot of the coverage will be iPad competitors.  And we'll certainly get some Honeycomb video for you, Jeff.  And I'll get a hands-on for you if it's available.  Just to rub it in.  Just to make you crazy.  Wall Street Journal says Google Digital Newsstand aims to muscle in on Apple.  Is this a new Google application?  Google's trying to drum up publishing support right now for a new Google-operated  digital newsstand for Android devices.  So you would buy magazines.  It'd be, I guess, marketplace for magazines.  It would include apps from media companies.  So if, for instance, Rupert Murdoch wanted to put his daily on this,  which is an app, he could do it.  Google hopes to launch it in part to provide a more...  This is from the Google News.  Google hopes to launch it in part to provide a more...  This is from the Wall Street Journal.  To provide a more consistent experience for consumers who want to read periodicals  on Android devices.  This is one area where iPad has owned Android.  But mostly because of the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mostly because of that.  And I'm going to use one of my numbers now.  But the magazine apps have not done well.  They've gone down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although some are saying...  Now, I've seen some dissent saying, well, they've gone down.  But if you look at the paper sales, they've gone down at the same rate.  That drop in periodical sales on electronic platforms  mirrors the drop in periodical sales in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not really.  Here's Wired is down.  And this is over a period of a few months from 31K to 22K.  OK, they were first in.  A lot of curiosity.  Vanity Fair down from 10.5K to 8,700.  Glamour down 20% from 4,300 to 2,275.  GQ 11,000, which was its worst performance since April 13,000.  So they're all down and they're brand new.  And sales of the tab are going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have some theories.  Now, by the way, those publications you mentioned, mostly Hearst and Conde Nast.  Time, Hearst and Conde Nast, all three according to the journal conversations with Google.  But all three declined to comment.  Part of the problem, I have to say, is that in many cases in the iPad,  you pay more for the iPad version than you do for the paper version.  And even if you're already, as I am a subscriber to the New Yorker,  you get no break on the $4.99 iPad version.  It's ridiculous.  You get no value added, really.  You know who does this right is the economist.  I think you get a discount plus there's additional content, there's video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They seem to be...  I think buying the magazine and the...  I saw this somewhere, buying the magazine and the app  for the economist is cheaper than buying the magazine alone.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  The journal does that too.  I wanted to cancel my paper journal because I have the Wall Street Journal on iPad  and it costs more.  The paper is not just free, they subsidize it.  I know that's bizarre, but I guess from an advertiser point of view,  they really still want to sell those display ads.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess the Google newsstand will probably be more flexible in business models than Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google wants to make nice with publishers because they're constantly accused,  wrongly I think, of killing publications.  And so it'll put pressure on Apple and Amazon, which is a good thing for publishers.  Even if it doesn't work, just the fact that they created competitive pressure  for the people who publishers think are screwing them will be helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Apple already is kind of responding.  Apple says, we're going to make it easier to do in application subscriptions,  to sell subscriptions on iTunes.  This is the problem is Apple takes its 30% cut out of in-app purchases.  And the publishers don't get the email address, they don't get information.  So Apple apparently is also going to adjust how things go on iTunes.  They also plan to give that information to the publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the interesting thing.  The fight that I read that they're having is that Apple would make that an opt-in.  Right.  To allow me to send your name to the publisher.  And of course, the publishers want that to be an opt-out.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have said many times that all of this is just a holding action for  paper publishers who are dying anyway.  Do you think there's any scenario that makes a company like Hearst or Conde Nast  make this transition and survive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think the cost structure is way too high.  I had lunch today with Fred Seibert who started Next New Networks.  Yeah.  Are they selling to...  There are only rumors, shall we say.  Did he confirm?  I will say nothing.  Okay.  Because he was a good boy.  He said nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he didn't deny it.  I know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the rumor is that Google was...  The rumor is there.  The rumor is there and well known.  But we were having this discussion about ever the dystopian utopianist, I hope that...  Is that a thing?  What is a dystopian utopianist?  My dystopian...  Their dystopia is my utopia.  Oh, okay. I get it.  Bad news for them is good news for us.  I think so because it's about openness and it's about disruption.  I agree.  And...  I'm with you.  Taking their hegemony away from our media experience.  And so he thinks that the big old companies will eventually come around.  I think there isn't enough time for many of them and they'll die.  And the problem is cost structure.  I've said it before.  The Washington Post is 2,000 employees.  TBD in Washington is 55 employees.  The issue isn't top line size.  The issue is profitability.  Yeah.  And a new company running on free platforms using smart collaborative mechanisms and specializing  can be profitable much, much, much faster.  I think that's the issue for Connie and Aston Hurst and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And let's not count out.  And I think I would have been shocked a year ago to hear myself say this.  The Kindle.  This is absolutely an equal platform with the iPad and the Android phone.  I mean, complete parity.  They sold so many Kindles.  If you throw the Nook in, it might even be bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see the Nook got hacked to have a full Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a tablet now.  Not much processing power.  It ain't going to be running on honeycomb.  But it's color.  It's Android.  So for instance, Barnes and Noble offers subscriptions to 14 Hurst publications,  including Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, and Esquire.  Kindle, of course, when it launched had very few publications, but is more and more all the time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  News Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now this is a Wall Street Journal article, so I presume they know what News Corp's up to.  News Corp has been trying to sign up publishers for an online newsstand where consumers would  pay to access digital publications from a variety of companies.  But it shelved that project this past fall.  So they had been trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were trying to get it because the deal there was they wanted everybody to go behind the wall  behind the wall and they wanted to have a kind of one price bundle like cable.  They wanted to recreate the cable model.  It's never worked with print publications.  And it was triply absurd and insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, people subscribe to a magazine, not a newsstand.  We know Monica Ray, Executive Vice President of Consumer Marketing, Condé Nast.  We know consumers want an ongoing relationship with our print and digital products.  And we are working with all partners.  To achieve that.  Who is the most forward thinking in this space?  Is it Condé Nast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's happened lately is getting off the reservation here.  But the top publishers have all changed CEOs lately.  Time Inc, Condé Nast, Hearst each have new CEOs.  I think the most forward thinking that I know about there is the Atlantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They went on the web open and free a couple of years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Justin Smith, who is the CEO who had launched The Week in America and did a super job.  I love The Week.  He did a great, great job of launching that.  I subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny that you should say that because guess what I subscribe to?  The New Yorker, The Week and Atlantic.  Paper versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you are.  So Justin said he was interviewed in the Times about two weeks ago and said,  and this is the beautiful thing that I haven't heard any other publisher say,  is that we sat down and said, how do we disrupt ourselves?  And so they hired Andrew Sullivan as a blogger.  They got the web going big.  They know that the web is the future.  And the owner, who's a very, very smart guy whose name is suddenly escaping me,  brought in Justin and gave him the reign to change the company radically.  And the Atlantic is small enough and is owned by a single operator.  They can do that.  They could do it.  Risk is just so great with these other companies.  They're not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you, what magazines do you read, Gina?  I'm just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magazines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Magazine?  What is this magazine that you took?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't get any print magazines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I get wired.  But like, I feel like that happened sort of by accident.  I don't think, I don't know.  You got it free.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it free because I bought something or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't.  I don't.  I don't read print magazines.  I read stuff on the web that I find through my friends.  I don't, I'm not necessarily, I mean, I read a lot of those titles that you mentioned.  I read the Atlantic a lot.  I read the Times a lot.  But I happen upon these things online.  I don't, I don't have a lot of, I'm also like, I'm a little bit of a clutter.  I don't, I don't like having papers sort of stacked up around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I do?  I make my own magazine with Instapaper.  I'm going through the web.  I find articles I want to read and I Instapaper them.  It emails it to the Kindle so I can read it there or on my iPad.  Because there's a great Instapaper app on the iPad and that's kind of my own magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  Absolutely.  I do similar thing.  I have to switch to Instapaper.  I've been kind of like.  You do read it later?  Coming and hiding.  Yeah, I do read it later.  And now I just, I gave in and just switched to Chrome and now I'm syncing my bookmarks  across my computers just using Chrome.  Yep.  Because XMACS got, was, you know, was closing down but then it got bought because I was  using that for a bit.  Anyway, I just need to just start using Instapaper more because everyone seems to love it.  I just haven't been able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just have that Instapaper bookmark on my browser.  And, you know, how often do you get to a page where you really want to read it but it's  going to be a fairly long blog post, often yours or Jeff's.  And people like Fred Davis and, not Fred Davis, Fred Wilson.  Wilson, right.  And I know, oh, I really want to read this.  Bruce Sterling just had a really good one on WikiLeaks.  And so I just, I'll press that bookmark.  And it doesn't even pop up in a window or anything.  It just goes saved.  I love that.  And if you set it up with Instapaper, it will mail it to your Kindle.  That's really cool.  It's not free but it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really cool.  I have a very long read it later list and I actually think that that is going to be  the reason why I get a tablet.  It's just so I can take the tablet and then just browse while I'm on the go.  It's perfect for that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I put Instapaper on my Galaxy Tab, it'll just sync and be right there, huh?  Offline reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Instapaper have an Android app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think this is the reason why I didn't quite switch to Instapaper entirely.  I don't feel like there's, and actually I wanted to ask you about it, Leo.  If there's a, I don't know if there's an official Instapaper app or if any of the  unofficial ones are any good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now you got me because I realize it's iOS that I read Instapaper on.  Let me see which ones I have installed on my, that's a very good question.  Instapaper, Marco Arment's product deserves a Nobel Prize or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't look like it.  There's other apps working around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a few other ones, right?  Everpaper, Instafetch.  This is what made me hesitate.  This is why I never switched totally to Instapaper is that I didn't feel like I could get it on my  Nexus One and feel good about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I use the, there's a, you know, you can add it to the, one of the nice things about  Android is you can add to the share, there's a built-in share bookmark on the browser and  you can add arbitrarily anything you want to it.  Yes.  So you can at least bookmark it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, read it later.  I could do that with.  Right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  Chatroom, no solution on that one?  Huh.  That's where that's keeping the Kindle alive for me.  It's really handy.  No, I wonder, I mean, I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, can I read it in my Kindle app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's the next question.  I could just set up how you have it, Leo, and just read it in the Kindle app on Android.  I don't know.  That's because the Kindle app on Android was a little limited at first, but they just,  they just released a series of updates with more functionality.  So.  Including magazines and newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, big update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So that might be the solution.  Who would have thought that Kindle would be where it is?  It's really true.  It's so true what you said, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would have never, if you'd asked me last year, will you be, I would have thought, oh no,  the iPad is going to completely eclipse it.  It's over.  In fact, I think I said that many a time.  Stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because it runs on everything too.  I mean, it's because it runs on Android and iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And great battery life for the Kindle device.  And they got it down to $139.  I'm convinced that's the real reason Kindle's still alive and why they sell so many.  But Barnes and Noble, you know, Kindle, Amazon said Kindle's our best selling product ever.  Then Barnes and Noble said, hey, guess what?  The Nooks are best selling product ever.  But maybe that's because they don't sell anything else.  Here's why that doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because there's, you know, 200,000 books of different titles.  Books are their best selling product ever.  Right.  But any one title is not going to sell as many as their only reader.  The long tail and aggregate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tupani, Leo Laporte talking about Google, the cloud.  Mitch, if you're listening, I don't know what happened.  We couldn't reach you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He thought it was tomorrow.  He feels terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So he did.  Okay, good.  All right.  Well, I feel terrible.  Next time.  Let's all feel.  Yeah, we'll get them on.  Gina was the one who felt terrible.  That's what we were going to get Mitch on.  But Gina's back.  She's with us.  She's alive.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am.  And I don't sound like Marge Simpson too much.  We're glad you're here, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me talk a little bit about our friends at Carbon.  You can go have a hack coughing fit if you wish.  While I talk.  Carbonite, don't cough.  Carbonite.  Carbonite is backup done right.  This is the time of year when you know you're.  You've got a lot of stuff on your hard drive.  Pictures from the holidays, family pictures, that kind of thing.  Maybe music you downloaded.  Videos you made and you really want to back those up.  PC or Mac.  Carbonite makes it safe, easy and automatic.  So you don't have to think about it.  You could try it free for two weeks.  Just go to carbonite.com slash twig.  Your files are encrypted during transmission.  So the idea of carbonite is you put it on your computer.  It automatically starts backing up anytime you're online.  Without slowing your system or your internet access.  It automatically starts backing up anytime you're online.  Using 128-bit SSL.  And that's important.  Why?  Well, if you're at Starbucks and open access point or somewhere like that.  The backup is going to go on.  You don't want anybody to watch your data go to the cloud.  So it encrypts it and sends it to the cloud.  You could further encrypt it using Triple Desk or Blowfish if you want as well.  For absolute privacy.  Now here's the beauty of it.  All that data that's backed up.  You can get to it anytime from anywhere.  You log into your carbonite account on any computer.  Or the iPhone app or the Blackberry app.  There's your data.  So it's always available to you from the cloud.  Those apps are free by the way.  $55 a year is the normal cost.  That's about 15 cents a day.  Now that's for unlimited.  You don't measure the amount of data you use.  But it's just got to be the personal data on your hard drive.  And you're an internal hard drive.  You can't just plug in a bunch of drives every day and back all of that up.  It's the internal hard drive.  $55 a year.  You can get two months free if you use our offer code TWIG.  So please try it first.  It is dependent on high speed internet.  You got to have good broadband access.  It's great for a student though.  Students are always moving around different access points at the library.  That's why I put it on Abby's computer when she took it to college.  And you know, you don't want to have to think about backing up.  You just want to do it.  If you use the offer code TWIG, you'll save two months.  Two months free.  Carbonite.com offer code TWIG.  Back it up to get it back and do it right.  With carbonite.  So I've got my CR48.  Oh, no, don't boo hoo.  You don't need that.  Did you get one, Gina?  I forgot.  I did get one.  And I feel like a terrible tester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was traveling over the holidays for several, you know,  for a few weeks, two and a half weeks.  And you know, we had to do the show.  So I, and actually we wound up doing it on Google Talk.  So I could have done it for the CR48, but I just couldn't justify bringing two laptops.  And honestly, since then, I haven't been a very good tester.  I just haven't picked it up again.  I just, I'm doing a lot of development and I need a clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Google, I'd be better than her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say.  You know what, Jeff?  Maybe Jeff would be a better tester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will send you mine.  No, no, I will.  I don't use it.  I will send you mine.  We'll pack it up.  We'll send it over to you.  Google said, here's what Google said when they sent it to you.  They said, you can send it back if you want or you can keep it.  You do whatever you want with it.  So normally I would not keep it.  I would send it back.  But in this case, I think it's appropriate to send it to you, Jeff,  so that you can get a sense of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you just see no use for it?  The reason I want to use it is to think about things like,  because we require every student here to buy a Mac laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  MacBook Air, you should make them get an 11 inch air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it strong enough to do video?  Yeah, it just doesn't have a lot of, it's plenty of strong horsepower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just doesn't have a lot of storage.  So they'd have to buy an external driver or use a cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the question is at some point, do we switch to pure cloud tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess my attitude is that you can do everything that you can do on a CR 48 with any notebook,  as long as you're running Chrome.  So it's really the question, and we talked about this, so I'm not going to rehash this,  but the question is, is this going to be free?  What is going to be the selling point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's go to that for a second because I think we discussed,  we didn't discuss last week.  We didn't have a last week.  No, we were in the best of mode.  The report of the new chip set for Android that can bring the unsubsidized price of  an Android phone down to $75.  And so if you tie that to an incredibly cheap Chrome laptop and look at connectivity,  the world around that really changes.  One of the things on the list here is that Eric Schmidt wrote a little piece,  a squib for Harvard Business Review.  And he said that all of Google's strategic priorities for 2011 are mobile.  And he listed three things that they have to do.  One is work on fast networks on 4G LTE, which was really interesting to me that he said that Google  had to do work on that.  Am I reading too much into that?  Two was digital money and three was cheap devices to ramp up distribution.  So I still think that the Chrome thing is not for, you know, Gina to use to write the next great app.  The next great app.  But is it the device that gets, is it the end of the digital divide?  Does it get tons of people on?  Right.  That's the question.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  We're just not the target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  And I accepted that.  That's what basically the, I can't remember his name, the product manager for as Chrome OS said,  said, well, it's not for you.  It's not, don't compare it to a MacBook Air.  So if it's close to free or it's cheap, it has very good security.  That's really the big focus of it.  Everything's sandboxed.  Everything's secure.  You even do things like hash the ROM and the operating system files.  And if there's a modification, you protect it.  It's good.  They're really thinking of security first.  But it's got to be cheap because you really do give up a lot.  Now the story that's leading to this is that the Chrome Web Store, Jason Kinkade on TechCrunch  did some calculations based, Google's a little too open, I guess, on the...  On the top grossing apps on here and so forth.  So, and by the way, you get the Chrome Web Store on every version of Chrome,  no matter what your platform.  So it's not like this is just CR 48 users.  This is all of us.  But let me give you some of Jason's calculations and it's kind of,  essentially it seems like interest in this has dropped off rapidly since the CR 48.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but isn't that, go give the numbers first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's all unfair.  No, these aren't your numbers, I hope.  No, they're not.  It's okay.  So the number one application based on downloads over the past week,  according to Jason, is Onslaught Arena, a medieval war game.  Sounds good.  I'm going to go get this.  Five bucks, but it's had 1,294 installs, a total of 5,000 users.  So a gross of $25,000 minus the $2,600 in Google transaction fees  since the store launched in December.  It's okay, not bad.  But then he says there's a big drop off to number two.  The number two application, Wordico, which is kind of a scrabble game,  402 downloads this week, 1,457 users, $3 app.  Total gross since December, $4,356.  Number three, Brain Pop, $1,000.  The fifth most popular, fifth, number five on the Chrome store,  Real Solitaire, a mere 406 users.  They made 800 bucks.  Most of the top 11 applications, less than, fewer than 100 downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But are we really surprised by that?  I don't think anyone I know knows that there is a Chrome store.  It hasn't been promoted.  There isn't a lot there.  I guess you're right.  You know, I know I'll be fanboy again,  but I think I got to defend them on this one because I don't think it's there to be successful yet.  It's there to start to put a place in the ground and understand how it works.  And then if, you know, HTML5 finally takes over the world  and people start using more and more web apps and then Chrome, the OS comes out,  then maybe it'll be different.  I think the other thing that's going to happen is tomorrow, reports are on the sixth,  Apple will open for developers its app store.  And so Google just got out a little bit earlier.  The second thing we were first and we'll see how much Apple promotes it.  And then whether Google comes back in and promotes it equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I don't know if the paid version has ads, but that,  but this, that amount of money does not account for ads.  So maybe you make a little bit more money in ads.  I don't know what I'm doing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just first for bragging rights.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be interested to see.  I mean, do we think the Mac app store is going to do as well on the desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Mac app store is going to do better.  Are you kidding?  The Mac app store is going to be totally dominant.  And it's, it's bad news for developers because if you do,  let's say you want to do a demo version of your game or a beta of your program,  you're not going to be able to cause Apple won't approve it.  You're going to be, it's going to severely limit what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good point that the beta problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, and Apple is going to talk because users are going to love it.  That's what I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because you're going to get a brand new Mac and it's going to be the first thing that  launches when you started up.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and it's security.  You don't have to worry about automatic updates.  It's very much like iOS, right?  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's interesting.  You said that the new version of Foursquare, which I've been for Android,  which I'm really enjoying, it supports comments and photos.  I follow Dennis Crowley and he had mentioned the early beta before it was in the market.  And I downloaded it and he, he actually talked about how that was so helpful to have  people kind of crowdsourcing beta testing before that they released it in the market.  I think I'm still actually running the early kind of beta version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's how we do business these days of web development is fast iteration.  And that's why I like Android over Apple because Apple's,  iPhone store slows iterations down.  You don't get updates as fast as Android.  Sometimes you get daily updates.  Thank goodness they added the automatic update because I don't think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank goodness for update all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well update all, but even now, you know, if you check that box, it'll automatically do it on most  apps or unless they make a big change in permissions.  And that's kind of cool too, because I'll wake up in the morning and look,  four apps are automatically updated.  I love that.  And I like that.  And I'm sure developers like the fact that they can iterate without permission,  but that's gone in the Apple model.  You have to get, you don't have to get approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I, you know, Leon, when I started working for advanced publications,  which kind of asked back in 1994 and the browser just been released.  My first task there was to work on something called the India journal.  Just a moment's story where we found all the old computers that were around with big old five  inch disks and got them out in the community and set up a bulletin board back at the offices.  And an editor named Sri Ram Krishna Swamy would get reports from the community,  very early citizen journalism.  Really?  And he put out a daily newspaper that went out on the vertical blanking interval of the NBC TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This must've been 19, what?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was done by MIT media lab.  So cool.  And it went into the, into a TV antenna at the Shevam deli in Newark Avenue at Jersey city.  And there was a big red button, MIT insisted on the big red button.  People would hit the button and out would pop the latest issue.  Awesome.  So we did all that stuff.  Right?  So now imagine that if you could buy a bunch of devices in bulk and give them out,  what all could you do?  So journalistically, could I, could I empower a community to report on itself?  Educationally, could you really take a school and eliminate textbooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's what Chrome OS, that's what you're saying for Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I think is the power here.  Yes, I agree.  It's like a key net Android.  And the thing you're going to do starting tomorrow is look for devices  besides tablets and phones that have Android.  Yep.  Same here.  What are the uses besides geeks on PCs that if you had cheap devices that you could buy  in bulk and give out in bulk, ad supported, educational, charitable, whatever, what's possible?  Now, will people have, will everybody have computers anyway?  And it's ridiculous.  Yeah, eventually they would.  They have cell phones and cell phones are expensive, but they got them because it's  important.  But I just think that there's, there's uses for these things that potentially are big.  Or I'm full of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I think, no, I like this and I think Google thinks big like this.  So this is the, I mean, I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say Microsoft's going to ever do  that credibly or Apple's ever going to do that credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft was, they fought the one laptop per child.  Right.  They've integrated it too.  That's right.  And, and so, yeah, and again, don't think this is the Chrome is for the US.  Right.  Think about Chrome for Africa, Chrome for Brazil.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Makes a lot of sense.  And frankly, more practical than the one laptop per child, which had a very kind of funky  small talk based interface and, you know, sugar and all of that.  And this is just, you know, it's a browser.  I think everybody knows how to use it.  Eric Schmidt does in fact say that all of Google's strategic initiatives these days  are mobile.  No wonder they promoted Marissa Meyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd say that should, that should vindicate her for that being a motion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is at Harvard Business Review.  He's writing, preparing for the big mobile revolution.  As I think about Google's strategic initiatives in 2011, writes Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google,  I realized that they're all about mobile.  We're at the point where between geolocation capability of the phone and the power of the  phone's browser platform, it's possible to deliver personalized information about where you are,  what you could do there right now and so forth and deliver such a service at scale.  But to realize that vision, Google needs to do some serious spade work on three fronts.  We must focus on developing the underlying fast networks.  He's talking about 3G networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And stop there.  Google must focus on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that explains maybe the deal with Verizon, right?  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, for net neutrality, the quote, net neutrality deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The net unneutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Second, we must attend to the development of mobile money.  That's the near field communications stuff built into the Nexus S, I would guess.  Phones, as we know.  It's not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also the backend to handle new currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's big too.  And this underscores what you said because he's looking at the third world.  He says, phones, as we know, are used as banks in many poorer parts of the world.  And modern technology means their use as financial tools can go further than that.  Third, and this again is what you were talking about, we want to increase the  availability of inexpensive smartphones in the poorest parts of the world.  Notice he doesn't say laptops.  He says smartphones.  But that makes sense.  So that's what a smartphone is, is a small computer.  We envision literally a billion people getting inexpensive browser-based  touchscreen phones over the next few years.  So really Chrome OS isn't about a CR 48.  It's about a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Browser-based touchscreen phone.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now didn't he say that Android for touch, Chrome OS for laptops?  Browser-based touchscreen phone sounds like Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of does.  Maybe we will see the full Chrome on Android, you know, within the next few versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or maybe Eric's just blowing smoke.  I love Eric.  Eric's the best CEO because, you know, he'll just say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I interviewed him for the book, it was funny.  He was quite growly about the reaction he gets and about the horrible video on Times Square.  I don't know if I said this on the show before, but he called it death by Twitter.  And he said that, you know, you say that one line somewhere and that's all that gets tweeted  out is that one line and no context, nothing else is there.  And the people who want to attack him will attack him shallowly.  And he emphasizes that, you know, full paragraphs of reaction are very good or valuable to a company.  But death by Twitter, I thought was a great line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, there's also life by Twitter.  A lot of people will quote smart things that you say.  And I mean, I see Steve Jobs quotes, I mean, around all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you use it properly, it could be very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, he shouldn't have to reduce his message down to a sound bite every time,  but, you know, actually maybe he should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But see, I think an article like this in the Harvard Business Review then gets  retweeted and put out.  How did I learn about it?  Probably from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His last tweet was December 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, you're missing the boat, Eric.  Dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need to get him in touch with Cory Booker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know who's not missing the boat?  John Boehner and the GOP.  They're going to stream the opening session on Facebook.  Wow.  Talk about getting it.  Question is, will he cry?  I mean, I have to say, you know, Boehner is also the one who wants to change the rules  in Congress to allow computers, phones and so forth tweeting from the House floor.  And I have to say, you know, I think probably because of my  left coast liberal leanings, I don't always think of the GOP as the party of  technology.  But boy, you know, they seem to understand a little bit better at this point.  The 112th Congress will, yeah, you could watch it on C-SPAN, but you could also watch it  on the Pledge to America Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that's great.  However, how are we engaged?  Using social media engaged to the senses is a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The GOP leaders are billing it as a down payment on a new era of governing in the public eye  through web enabled technology.  Awesome.  Right on.  Yeah.  Nick Schaper, we got to get him on.  He's a digital media advisor to John Boehner said this will mark the first time that the  opening session of Congress has been streamed live on Facebook.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it's is it going on right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Might be.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For a link?  Yeah, I think it is.  Click to watch.  You can go to this by going to Facebook.com slash pledge to America.  And they're using live stream.com for this.  Oh, looks like it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's great.  I also love how the press secretary is uses Twitter to gather first questions from the public.  Robert Gibbs.  Yeah, Robert Gibbs.  Yep.  I say this is fantastic.  Go to where the people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, C-SPAN was the beginning of all this where you could actually tune in C-SPAN anytime  in the day or night and watch stuff.  And smart members of Congress really started to take advantage of that, you know, using  the comments sessions.  I remember this.  Who was it that was giving long speeches to an empty house?  But you didn't know because the C-SPAN cameras were pointing at him.  And of course, Obama was very effective.  Actually, Obama disappointed because I think he was very effective at using social media  to get elected and then didn't seem to really want to use it after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's the issue.  The same was true in the UK with Cameron.  I asked his social media person back early on when he was making videos, will this continue  when he gets in office?  And he said, oh, you know, if it didn't, this would be rather cynical that we're doing it now.  Well, turns out to be rather cynical that they're doing it now because it doesn't continue  once in office.  I know Beth Novick, who's the head of the transparency effort at the White House, and  the need to get things vetted by lawyers is a constant issue.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the take my Blackberry problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Gina, you're a lot closer to all this than I am.  They're using TweetUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, they're using ThinkUp and I actually got to meet with the new media  team at the White House and I actually think that they're doing a lot of really cool stuff.  I think first question is a really good example.  I mean, President Obama did an It Gets Better video during the teen gay suicide.  Did he really?  He did it.  I didn't know that.  He's like an internet meme.  Good for him.  Which was amazing.  I mean, when I saw that video, I was just floored.  And then they released a montage of White House staff doing that.  You know, WhiteHouse.gov has been really, has been very active.  I don't know.  I've actually been, like I said, I'm close to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not wrong that the perception is there that he's not using it.  So why is that?  Is it all just smoke and mirrors?  Is it?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think I'm pretty close to this.  So I didn't actually, I was surprised to hear you say that.  I didn't think that that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I'm alone though in that perception.  Maybe I am.  Maybe it's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anil Dash writing in his blog a couple of days ago, there are three is a trend,  the decline of Google search quality.  And I've started to see this talk about a meme.  I've started to see this meme circulate a little bit around the internet.  He quotes Paul Kudrowski writing,  Google has become a snake that too readily consumes its own keyword tail.  Alan Patrick on the increasing uselessness of Google.  Google's like a monoculture.  Thus parasites have a major impact once they adapted to it.  And finally-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're blaming Google for spammers and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Jeff Atwood, trouble in the house of Google.  I can't help noticing we're not the only site to have serious problems with Google search results  in the last few months, he says.  Is this perception?  Is this the case?  It's anecdotal obviously.  And then Neil points that out.  You know, it's like the other stuff we have on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just, I'm so sick of people declaring things dead and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even bother with the RSS dead meme, which is coming on.  Oh, thank you, Leo.  It's ridiculous.  Every two years.  Every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I blame bloggers because they look for a snappy SEO headline and declaring something dead  is a lot better for a headline than saying, well, it's less interesting.  Exactly.  Who's going to read that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, you know, there are certain characters who do it all the time and it's just so irritating.  So to say, listen, Matt Cutts has a hell of a job, right?  Because the evildoers are always going to be a step ahead of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's the guy who works at Google for web spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I think that he does a very good job of trying to get rid of web spam,  but he's always going to be a step behind.  That's one issue.  And that's kind of what they're talking about in those posts.  The other question is, and Marissa Meyer just talked about this in an interview she just did,  new mechanisms of discovery.  That's a different question.  That's a question of making a leap ahead.  Right.  So is Quora or Bing or that other search engine better than Google or not?  That's an incremental question.  There's a strategic question, which I have to believe Google's working on.  Could they blow it the way they have things like Buzz?  Sure.  Boy, do I piss off people when I dare criticize Buzz.  That's going to get me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the good news is you're only about 100 people left to be mad at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but they're vocal.  They're vocal.  They're vocal, but I'm not kidding.  It's 100 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not.  Jesus.  But they are.  We're going to get killed for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I challenge you.  Guys, don't bother.  Buzz is dead.  I'm not going to read Buzz.  I don't care.  Nobody denies it.  Nobody denies it.  Screw Buzz.  Apparently.  Apparently.  You got it?  I don't like Buzz.  I don't like it.  You know why I don't like it?  Because I don't like you bozos there who are like a bunch of school marvie crap heads who

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all they do is talk about how you should properly use Buzz.  Well, screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  All right.  You know, I kind of agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Best of 2011 right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are taking notes this time at the beginning of the year for the end of the year.  Best of.  And there's one right there.  And by the way, you'll probably be vindicated.  I really had high hopes for Buzz.  You know what I'm wondering now and I notice this seems to be a trend because I had high  hopes for Jaiku.  I had high hopes for Pounce.  All of the Twitter.  Your own dates.  It's my fault.  No, I think it's because I liked.  Yeah.  And Wave.  No, I liked the conversation, but it turns out I don't think anybody wants the conversation.  So Twitter continues to win because there is no real conversation on Twitter and all  of these Twitter clones that involved threaded conversations.  And I think the same thing is going to happen to Quora quickly lost their appeal because  nobody really wanted it except for those hundred people.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an overload problem.  And that's definitely part of it.  People wanted to broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They wanted it.  They wanted it.  They wanted RSS.  Yeah.  Right.  They didn't want to have a conversation.  You don't have a conversation with your RSS feed.  You don't have a conversation with Twitter.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can.  But actually that irritates people.  I got into it about the Oprah network this weekend.  That was epic, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think of own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I'm going to build a think a plugin just to accommodate this own thread  that Jeff started because it's so interesting, complex and involves so many different people.  And I was like trying to map together the status.  I mean, you can't have a conversation on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need software to parse it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  You do.  Well, that's what Gina is going to build.  Own is the most narcissistic effort on earth.  And it was actually Rafa Ali.  I retweeted him and set off this woman from the New York Times Dealbook and just a  cultish fit of defense of Oprah where Rafa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you think buzz fanatics are dangerous, don't mess with the yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Rafa had said that he was hyperbolic.  It went too far.  But he said that basically, can you name anything that has been so bad for the self-image of women  that Oprah Winfrey?  Whoa.  Whoa, that set them off.  And I thought it was an interesting thought.  I got it.  Yeah, he went too far.  But as you watch it, basically everybody is screwed up until Oprah comes in to rescue them.  Except celebrities who are all allowed to be amazing.  But everybody else is a mess.  And she's got to cut you down before she can build you back up in her mold.  And I just found that fairly offensive.  There's one show where the guy comes in and he helps you clean out your mess, which I could use.  I would show you my office, you know, right now.  But he gets to the real issues.  Yeah, OK, OK, OK.  He was dealing with a family where the father was dying of leukemia.  And it's just so exploitive to me.  It's so tremendously exploitive of people that Oprah, the truth is that Oprah is responsible  for trash TV.  Phil Donahue invented the form and had it on the high end.  Oprah came in and compete.  She's the one who went to trailer trash screaming.  And then she recanted suddenly because it went too far because everybody else copied her and TV  was going down and down and down.  So she recanted and said, oh, no, no, no, now I'm going to be good and virtuous.  And I was actually they tried to get me to appear on that show as a TV critic to lionize  Oprah and I wouldn't do it.  Pissing off the flack for TV guide immeasurably.  Oh, I bet.  I mean, the power.  Just like I piss off, you know, the PR people from my publisher when I dare criticize Oprah.  That's what.  Gina, what do you think of Oprah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty neutral about her.  There have been times that I've been really pro-Oprah.  There are other times when I just I shake my head.  I can't I can't take it.  You know, I really go back and forth.  I see your points.  I see your points.  I find the devotion to Oprah fascinating in and of itself.  And I just find that her career trajectory just sort of fascinating, like as a media  personality, she's just an interesting person.  But but yeah, I see your points.  I see your points.  I found the whole conversation that you had on Twitter this weekend.  Very interesting.  And I really wanted a way I really wanted to like create a visualization of it.  That was my reaction to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really fascinating.  I just showed a few of the tweets and you were in there.  You were fiery.  You did not sit back, Jeff.  You just got in there and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What the hey.  All right, let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't just yell here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He yells everywhere.  No, I think that I think this is one of the one of the great democratizing things about  the Internet.  We all get to have our opinions and have the conversation.  It's a shame that Twitter is the is where the conversation happens because it's just  so hard to follow.  And there are so many great conversation platforms, but apparently nobody really wants  them, including buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And nobody really isn't that isn't that I think the issue for me is obligation.  So the buzzers get mad at me because, you know, they say, well, you've never been on  buzz.  I say, yes, I was.  But then it was more things to answer and deal with is like Quora, right?  More things to answer and deal with.  I've got enough things to answer and deal with.  I don't mean to sound self-important and Oprah like there.  But, you know, we all are overloaded.  We have no busy signal anymore.  And so to give me something that sets me up in a position of obligation.  No, I resent.  Whereas Twitter come in, come out buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  Who cares?  You know, it's OK.  And I think that that's what makes it more appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right.  It's like the no commitment part of it.  Dip in and dip out is definitely part of Twitter success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly.  Certainly is why I use it.  And but I like conversation.  I mean, that's all I do all day every day.  But maybe that's just, you know, that's that's not the right form.  And I can't imagine quorum lasting very much longer.  After a while, people just get tired of answering questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there are those who are declaring that it's the next big thing  that's going to take over Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing the spike that it's had recently.  It's been such a big deal.  And, you know, I've seen a couple of good threads.  I haven't posted any myself.  I mean, you know, when I think good Q&A sites, I think Ask Metafilter.  That's actually a great site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or I would post on Facebook or Twitter and ask my friends, you know, people who I,  you know, have, you know, have some sort of relationship with.  But it is interesting that quorum.  Hey, it's just like you said, I think it's great to have different ways to have conversations.  And I even I think it's even better that you can harvest the data and get insights from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let us let us move along because we are running late.  It is already three o'clock on the West Coast.  We want to get down to CES soon.  And TNT before we do that, though, we should get our tip, tool and number of the week.  Let's start with you, Gina Tripani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tip of the week.  Is transferring your delicious bookmarks to Google Bookmarks.  Now, Leo, I know you moved over to pin board, which I'm checking out.  And I'm actually getting lots of recommendations for instapaper clients for Android as well.  Ben Paper and Hard Copy Pro.  But Mihai Paparita, who's a Google engineer, wrote a little tool.  It's at it's delicious dash export dot app spot dot com.  You enter your delicious username and password and it will move your delicious bookmarks into Google.  And actually, the one thing that Chrome OS has done for me is I am basically full time  Chrome at this point.  And the really nice feature is the synchronizing bookmarks across all your machines.  No extra toolbars required.  So if you were keeping your bookmarks in delicious and looking for an alternative,  just want to go back over to Google.  This tool will help you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does Google Bookmarks have that functionality that the delicious?  Maybe we should be.  Yeah, maybe we should use be using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which functionality, the tagging or just all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know what we use delicious for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it doesn't quite have all the functionality that that's just saving them.  It's just it's just saving them.  And I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if this export tool will actually create the tags as folders or what it actually  does with what does with the tags.  But if you're just bookmarking, you know, if you're using delicious more as a bookmarking  bookmarking tool just to save URLs versus publisher share, I think Google Bookmarks  is just fine.  But it is the kind of old school folder system versus tags.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still going to do the import because at least it will save all of that, which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But pinboard also great.  And I and I know much and I think I think I love his business model as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, I do too.  You know him.  I didn't know you knew him.  We had him on net at night the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I met him briefly a few years back.  Yeah.  Smart, smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, I just tried to use this tool and I guess we've broken it.  Whoops.  Maybe they had a little few too many API calls to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, check out pinboard.  Sorry about the bad tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's not bad.  It's just temporarily.  Temporarily.  Come back later.  All right.  Our number of the week for Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six hundred million.  I've been waiting for this number to pop up and waiting for the case because quite a while ago,  Facebook said that they had five hundred million and we've been waiting for it to go up.  And I checked, in fact, just last week, their info page.  They have a stats page and it was staying at five hundred million.  Well, Goldman Sachs said to its investors that it has six hundred million and Goldman just said  moments ago that they've cut off the offering for Facebook stock.  They've already fully subscribed on half a billion?  Way oversubscribed to one point five billion.  So they have more than two billion.  There's a market demand for more than two billion dollars in Facebook stock at that valuation.  Now, the background here, of course, is that it's not a public stock.  Goldman is going to invest itself, but then they'll in turn sell that off to others.  It's a way to get around going public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For a little bit because I think the SEC is going to start really looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to come in on this.  But I'm thinking it's kind of brilliant because what it's done is it's shown that  Facebook can go public at far north of this valuation.  It has set an extremely high valuation.  So fifty billion dollars is low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's low.  Oh, man.  And you know, I can't believe they got to six hundred million because  how many people are there?  I mean, there's a billion Internet users.  How many are you going to be at 100 percent at this rate in a year or two?  Are they growing faster than the Internet?  I think they must be.

Transcript:  Well, I think what's happening is some of the countries where other applications were stronger.  Like Orkut in Brazil or.  Yeah, or Studefouz in Germany.  I mean, the interesting one is Yuri Milner, who he invested at an  valuation of 10 billion, and it's now five times that with his, I think, five hundred million dollars.  So he's done quite well and he owns the competitor in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know what's happening with Facebook in Russia, but Facebook is just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, one of the investors, the second investor with Goldman Sachs was a Russian company.  That's Yuri Milner.  That's Yuri.  That's that's.  So now he says, well, maybe I should own the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's amazing.  I've met Yuri.  He is not an oligarch, but he will be one day.  He has that kind of really stern Russian thing, but a very nice guy.  He believes he's very interesting investor.  He does not take a board seat.  He didn't want one.  He invests a great measure.  He created the liquid market that enabled employees to sell their stock and take some money off the table.  And that's how we got a lot of his shares with Facebook's blessing.  And he gives a lot of advice to Zuckerberg and he believes that we ain't seen nothing yet.  That artificial intelligence is indeed going to come in and those with the most data will win.  And that's why he loves Facebook so much.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's now big owner, big, big rich man.  My, my selection of the week is just something that relatively recently came out, read about it in  on Lifehacker.  It's called Active Inbox.  It's a free plugin that basically it's a Chrome and Firefox plugin that basically turns your Gmail  into a getting things done kind of a tool.  It allows you to take, they say basically they say email is just a to-do list that's hard to get to.  So they're going to turn it into a to-do list.  You install it.  It adds, as you see on the left here, an active Inbox plugin and you can assign messages.  It creates new labels.  Traditional actually getting things done labels like, you know, delegate and maybe later and so  forth.  You can have projects.  You can have references.  Really kind of a neat addition to Gmail.  I know Gina, you've written some so you know a little bit about this.  This is very elegant, very slick.  It's nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this extension used to be called GTG Inbox.  It's had a couple of iterations and actually it came out, its earlier iterations came out  before Gmail had tasks built in, but it does a lot more than Gmail tasks.  And actually it's a great extension and something that we've written about on Lifehacker through a  few of its iterations and definitely a good addition for GTD folks who don't want to have  to move their tasks out of their email into another Task App Manager, you know, kind of build it  right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Emails are just badly formatted tasks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really true when you think about it, you know, and the reason why I hate email so much  is because every single message represents like something that I like I'm supposed to do,  like some sort of obligation or commitment that I haven't, you know, followed up through,  you know, followed through on yet.  Email, I just shiver when I think about it.  Sorry, I didn't mean to give you the shivers on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to go get on a plane where I can't be reached.  Oh no, they have air.  Why do they put Wi-Fi in planes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks to Google, free Wi-Fi.  I don't know how long the free Wi-Fi is going on, but I had it on my flight home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Virgin America in about three hours.  Yep.  I'll be tweeting.
