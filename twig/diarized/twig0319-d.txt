And there is so much to talk about in the Google and the cloud.  I hear the dulcet tones of me coming from Mr.  I would guess that I don't know who that's coming from, but I would guess it's from Jeff Jarvis.  He's off-site.  Hi, Jeff.  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, where are you?  I'm in Los Angeles at the Century City Hyatt for the Online News Association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, I spoke a couple of years ago to that.  I thought you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think I was here that year.  That was a lot of fun.  That was in San Francisco when I did it.  And it was a great group and solving a thorny issue, especially these days.  It's my peeps.  It's my tribe.  Your tribe.  Well, I'm glad you could.  We weren't sure if you'd make it, but I'm so glad you can.  Thank you for being here.  Jeff teaches journalism.  Thank you, United, for earlier flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got here and I'm in the room and everything is on my Chromebook is working fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, United.  Jeff teaches journalism at the City University of New York.  He also blogs at BuzzMachine.com and he also is the author of many very important books  you must read and all of which you'll find at BuzzMachine.com.  Also with us is Mike Elgin, news director here at Twit.  He's also an avid Google pluser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I enjoy it.  You know, since we got Jeff on the horn here, I want to mention that his book photobombed  one of our...  So we have this thing on Tech News today.  Yes.  How I watch TNT.  People take a picture of what they're doing when they're watching TNT and they send it  in and his book, What Would Google Do?  is conspicuously present in one of the photos recently.  And I suspect the plant.  You have a reader.  I suspect the invisible hand of one Jeff Jarvis behind all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you see Jeff's hand coming in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the movie front page with the late great David Carr, he used my book as a palm rest  for his laptop.  Not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not bad.  That'll work.  If you can't read it, hold it.  Also with us, Matthew Ingram.  Always good to see you.  Now at Fortune for a long time at Giga Home.  At Giga Home.  Great to see you, Matthew.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for coming in.  I wanted to mention real quickly because Cory Doctorow, our good friend and fighter for  freedom mentions it on I think on his blog.  I don't see it on Boing Boing, but we've talked about it before.  There is a bill before the 114th Congress.  They hope to vote on it before the end of the month.  S754, sometimes called the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.  And this is something we have up to now been fairly, we, I say we, but the EFF and grassroots  activists have been fairly successful in fighting.  This is the second time through I think a couple of Congresses ago, last Congress I guess,  they tried to get this through.  Mitch McConnell vowed to hold a vote on the bill before the summer.  EFF and 20 other privacy groups had a week of action.  Six million faxes opposing CISA, which postponed the vote until now.  But here's something kind of depressing.  And this is what Cory tweeted.  And I'm going to send you to the website if you want to find out more.  There's a website called Youbetrayedus.org.  And it points out that Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, Oracle, IBM, Autodesk and Salesforce  have all been publicly lobbying to pass this bill.  It's billed as a cybersecurity bill, but the chief benefit for these companies is it would give them  legal immunity if they should share our data with the government and law enforcement and other companies,  even if it's in violation of their own privacy policy, even without a warrant.  So as the company or the group that fight for the future that created this page points out,  all privacy policies effectively be meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I disagree with his criticism of the companies.  Why wouldn't they support something that gave them immunity from prosecution?  Let me give you an example.  We talk a lot about how we want really stringent laws because in a really bad crisis,  let's say ISIS is about to take over the country or some crazy thing,  of course companies are going to do whatever it takes to help the government track down  in some horrible 9-11 scenario that you can't imagine, right?  In violation of their privacy policies, possibly in violation of laws.  You don't know what happens with the next administration that comes in and decides to prosecute or whatever.  I mean, I just, I think this is something we as the public should oppose,  but I can see why the NSA wants it.  I can see why the companies want it. There's no downside.  It's like if I come to you and say, here's a bill that will give you $10,000.  Do you want to support this?  Sure.  Yes, I want to be protected from prosecution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, of course they're going to lobby in favor of this,  but I think it's important to mention it only because these companies,  particularly Apple, make a big deal about, we care about your privacy.  You can trust us.  And when they turn around and then go to Washington, DC and go to members of Congress and say,  please let us off the hook, it kind of puts the lie to that public proclamation.  But again, they trust themselves.  Yeah, we trust ourselves, but do we trust them?  So I understand your point, Mike, which is they're acting in their own self-interest.  It's really up to us to defeat this.  And that's why you should go to youbetrayedus.org and write to Congress.  You know, you can email these companies, but more importantly at the bottom,  a number, 985-222-CISA, will let you in.  And you need to call and contact.  Best way to do it in either a call, which is easy,  because they can identify that you're from their district.  And then they're ready for these calls, and they just mark you down a checkmark in the box.  Or snail mail, because the postmark will verify your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if your cell number comes from a different area code, they can't verify your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, so use your landline if you have a landline.  If you have one.  They may have other ways of verifying your location.  I don't actually know that.  They know where you are.  Leo, I think you make a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tim Cook made a huge speech about Facebook and how all these companies are invading your privacy,  but Apple doesn't do that.  And yet at the same time, they're lobbying for a bill that would allow them to share data  and give them immunity from doing so, as long as they argue that it has something to do with cybersecurity.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess Apple's response or Tim's response would be, well, we just don't collect that data,  so we can't share.  I'm sorry.  I feel like that's a little disingenuous.  We know that they, for instance, have a unique identifier.  You use an iPhone.  You're using an iPad right now.  I'm using a Macintosh right now.  I can't wait till my new iPhone comes on Friday.  Are we foolish for trusting Apple with our private information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're probably better than average, but they're not as clean.  The average is very low.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're great on the curve, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I think they're better than average.  I just think that there's a difference between a law that says that the government can just help themselves to data,  or, for example, the encryption issue.  I think Apple's been very strong on that.  There's a difference between agreeing to something that results in data collection beyond anybody's control  and your choices between you can be prosecuted, you can't be prosecuted.  The lawyers who were behind this stuff at Apple and other companies are always going to choose the,  no, we don't want to be prosecuted side.  That's the difference.  This is not requiring them to share data.  It just says that if they do, they can't be prosecuted for it.  This thing should go down in flames because this is not, it sounds even unconstitutional to me.  And it sounds like an end run, most importantly, around all the protections that we've slowly been starting to erect  in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations.  And this stuff always happens.  Whenever something is defeated, it'll be back in some other form.  It's got to be defeated.  But I just don't see why the companies wouldn't do it.  If I was a lawyer for Apple, I would be in favor of this too.  Yeah, you should.  Why not?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Actually, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I was the lawyer, I'd probably make a lot more money if we got prosecuted.  But you see what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but it also saves money.  Somebody pointed out, it saves money in having to fight requests for information.  You know, Microsoft's spending a lot of money right now to keep data on an international server.  What is it?  Where is it?  France?  I can't remember.  Out of the hands of the US enforcement, or is it Ireland?  It's Ireland.  But if you're talking about the US enforcement, they're going to lose that battle because of the way the laws are constructed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a new battle in France where France is going after Facebook, saying in light of the Snowden revelations, you can't go shipping our data off to another country.  So that fight's going on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not an anti-government guy.  I'm getting more sympathy for the folks who say the government should, in every respect, keep hands off the Internet.  I was really one of the people in the net neutrality battle who said, no, we need the FCC to step in and promote net neutrality.  But I was reading a really, I have to find it, a really great talk in San Francisco.  And I don't know who it's by.  The fellow is so unassuming that he didn't actually put his name in it.  His blog is Idle Words.  And somebody in the chat room will tell me who he is.  But his slide talks a lot about this whole thing.  And he gives as an example, you know, the Snowden revelations talks about state surveillance.  But he also talks about how government intervention is not always going to be good.  He uses an example of the European cookie law.  I'm sure you're familiar with this, Jeff Jarvis.  And of course, we're not subject to this.  But if a law was passed at a site who uses cookies has to announce that on the site.  We see that a lot in the US now, probably because they do business in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every every news that you go to in the UK and the EU, you have to constantly click off.  Yeah, I know you got cookies. Yeah, I know you got cookies. Yeah, I know you got cookies.  Because it's now become a ridiculous legal thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and he points out that really is not has not been a good remedy.  Because if you don't if you don't like cookies, it ends up really because this well, here's I'll read it.  The European cookie law is a beautiful example of regulatory disaster.  If I want to visit a site in the EU, I need to click through what's basically a modal dialogue.  That means you can't do anything else until you click through it.  That asks me if I want to use cookies. If I don't agree, this site may be borderline unusable.  But close your eyes for a minute.  Those of you who feel you really understand the privacy implementation of cookies, raise your hands.  And thank you. Those of you who raise your hands.  See me after the talk because I'm a programmer. I wanted the earth speaking about this stuff.  And I don't fully understand the implications of cookies for privacy.  It's a subtle topic. So why is my mom? He's from he's Danish.  Why is my mom supposed to make a reasoned decision about it every time she wants to check the news or weather?  And I say every time because the only way European sites remember that you don't want to use cookies is by setting a cookie.  So so people are serious about not being tracked.  Get asked every single page load, not every single visit to the site, every single page load done poorly laws introduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. This is Mike's point, too. It's ass covering.  Yeah. And it's it's not we asked. We gave him a chance. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So write your member of your Congress critter, as Corey would have it, and say S 754, please.  The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.  When it comes up for a vote, it probably will in the next week.  Say just say no.  OK, I just I wanted to launch out with that because I want to make sure that we we covered that there's so many other things to talk about.  Have we really done ad blocking to death? Yeah, pretty much.  The news hook this week, of course, is Marco Arment, the world famous Macintosh programmer, Tumblr pioneer found first programmer at Tumblr,  wrote a program called Peace to Block ads on iOS, came out with iOS 9 on Wednesday after three days.  Number one, the number one paid app on the Apple Store.  He pulls it saying I can't in good conscience continue making an ad blocker.  He says this is I'm winning a war. I don't want to fight.  And it's not that he is against ad blockers. He's written a number of posts saying I'm pro ad blocker.  But he realizes that it's much more complicated, right?  Then he thought and he doesn't want to be the guy doing it.  Apple cooperated with him by giving refunds to everybody who paid the couple of bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And for starters, it's refreshing to see somebody turning down money for principal potentially a lot of money.  Yeah, I mean, I would you know, I would have been tempted to go, you know, I'm going to do this, but I think I'm going to wait a couple of days.  I'm number one in the category. Maybe if I just take my time.  No, but, you know, it's it's it's laudable that he's doing this.  And, you know, it's still debatable as to whether or not it's necessary to do that.  But it's refreshing and rare to see somebody.  He's the work for Tumblr. He's been around for a while and he had a big hit on his hands and he basically walked away from it.  Very cool. The problem with ad blocking, of course, is that some ads are good, some ads are bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a blunt weapon. That's the real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike, I agree. That's right. I'm working on a piece of the airplane coming out just arguing that we have to reform advertising.  That we have been complicit with the advertisers and irritating our own users, losing their own trust.  The ad blockers just tell us that users say enough and they're going to have it.  And we've got to fix that if there's any time left.  Randall Rothenberg, the head of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, had a big piece in the ad age today, arguing oddly similarly,  saying that too much of advertising is crap and that we've got to improve the standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Clearly, I think what we need is a kind of ad blocking that incentivizes quality advertising.  I don't know how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's what Ad Block was trying to do with the acceptable ads policy.  Although you might say they're also trying to make a little money on the side because they'd go to companies like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. It's worse than that. It's racketeering. It's blackmail, bribery, racketeering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They go to Google and say, for a small fee, you could be one of the acceptable ads we do not block.  And of course, Google paid for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crap. That's a nice ad network you got there. It'd be a shame if anything happened to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be a shame if anything would have happened to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But on the other hand, that is a response to that specific need, which is how do we block just the really malicious ads,  the reprehensible ads, the ads that triple our downloads, that slow down our pages?  How do we block those nasty ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or how do you turn it around and how do you go to sites that in fact try to encourage what we would...  How do we define good advertising? What's the definition of quality advertising?  I'd argue that it's got to be relevant, number one, useful and informative, number two, and or engaging.  It could be any two of those three. And there's things it can't do.  It's a long list of really irritating things like autoplay video and taking forever and loading too many data points and being not transparent.  That's all the negative stuff.  On the positive side, I think it's possible that you could have a world of consensual advertising,  where you let the audience be fully in charge and say, what advertisers that I won't allow here and I won't be seen.  And that gives a message right back to the advertisers saying your ads are crap. We don't care about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The irony of it was, of course, that the ad blocker that Marco was using, he was using the Gostry database,  blocks ads on Marco's site, John Gruber's site, the DEC is the network it blocks.  The DEC is as unobtrusive an ad.  One of the best.  I mean, look at Daring Fireball. This is ad supported by a little time.  Now, remember, it's one person. So this ad is sufficient.  If you're if you're Mobile Nations and running iMore.com, you're going to need a few more ads than that to support your much larger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, to me, the solution I'm starting to step on you there, Matthew.  Go ahead.  The solution is pretty obvious, actually, I think.  I think that the ideal ad blocker would basically be something like a Chrome extension.  And you click on an ad when you don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Are you right? Oh, you make it a kind of affirmative opt in thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But then what it does, of course, it need cookies for that.  But then what it does is it asks you, you don't want to see any ads on this site.  You don't want to see any ads from this company.  Like you get to choose the category of what you're blocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to see you also need to take away the moral hazard that exists for both Apple and Adblock Plus.  And I think, you know, if anything is going to be a not for profit, separate entity like Wikipedia, it has to be that because because the present players in ad blocking have a moral hazard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me read. Actually, let me let Matthew talk.  And then poor Matthew, you're at a disadvantage.  But then I'm going to read something from Seth Godin post on a block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Matthew. Yeah, I was just going to mention that it's not just advertising that people are using ad blockers for.  It's partly tracking. And so what irritates a lot of people is all the cookies and and hidden trackers that get loaded by websites that they don't they aren't made aware of.  They don't know where their information is going. They don't know who it's being shared with.  So it's not just the ads. It's not just that they look ugly or that they take a long time to load.  It's all the other stuff that's that's propagated by those ad networks and by those publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nobody questions that. It's the advertisers and the ad networks that got themselves into this people in the first place.  Here's what Godin says. Ad blockers undermine a fundamental principle of media, one that goes back 100 years free content in exchange for attention.  The thing is, the FCC and I'd say the FTC kept the ad part in check with TV by limiting the number of ads and verifying the veracity of ads.  Paper costs did the same things for magazines and newspapers. You can't put an infinite number of ads in a newspaper.  It costs you too much. But on the Web, more and more people have come to believe the deal doesn't work and they're unilaterally abrogating it.  They don't miss the ads and they don't miss the snooping of their data. I think that's a fairly succinct description of it.  Ads, you know, ad-supported free media has a long and not respectable, but at least a long tradition.  Yeah, respectable, I'd say.  And well, it works on TV, works on radio, works for us. But what happened is people on the Web went crazy. Advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to create a new scarcity around quality. That's my argument.  That's the point is scarcity went away. Abundance is what killed the old model. We've got to create a new scarcity.  And you're an example, Leo. You're exactly an example. You turned down advertisers.  That's why I had that discussion last week, because I wanted to hear your view on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the biggest problem is, Ben Thompson pointed this out in his Stritecary newsletter,  The biggest problem is that advertising and media used to be joined at the hip because they served similar purposes or they shared, they had a shared goal.  But that's not the case anymore. So the advertisers can get the things they want in other places from social networks, from Facebook, from different platforms.  They don't, their, their desires are not aligned with those of media websites anymore. That's the problem.  So you either have to figure out how to align your desires with those of advertisers or vice versa, or you have to figure out how to make money without ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of funny that there's a Chrome extension created by an artist named Darius Kazemi called the Ethical Ad Blocker.  And basically what it does is it asks you if you want to block the ads on a site. And when you say yes, it won't show you the site.  It just says, nope, you've decided not to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the ironic thing, the ironic thing is a lot of ad blockers do that to sites already.  I've had people tell us that Fortune, if they run an ad blocker, they don't see anything. They don't see any content at all.  CNET started doing that with video.  Because it won't load whatever JavaScript is at the top of the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We had Ben, sorry, Drew Curtis, the CEO and founder of FARC.com on because he's running for governor, by the way, of Kentucky.  And everybody should vote for him, even if you don't live in Kentucky.  But if you run an ad blocker, when you go to FARC.com, it actually does a nice thing. I have turned it off, by the way.  I use an ad blocker called UBlock Origin.  And because I've turned it off, I'm getting a Spanish ad for carefree panty liners. Not something I'm probably interested in.  Yeah, and Hulu. But if I turn on the ad blocker on FARC.com, he does, I think, probably the best thing a publisher could do.  First thing he has, don't like ads? Try BearFarq. In other words, buy a subscription to FARC as little as a couple of bucks a month.  And then a little banner up at the top, FARC feeds their squirrel with revenue from ads. Could you consider BearFarq? No ads FARC.  This comes up because I'm running an ad blocker. I still have access to all the content. But just a gentle nudge in the direction of paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and one thing publishers don't do, they don't give people who do pay no ads. So if you subscribe, you still get ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, he says he'll give you BearFarq, an ad-free FARC.  Well, Matthew, you've always paid for a newspaper and gotten ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right. But I'm saying just because that worked in when paper owned everything doesn't mean it's going to work now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to see that.  Those who say, oh, if they only give me a chance to pay, then that will solve it all. I completely disagree. People who say I'll pay will not pay.  They won't.  Because it's going to be a free alternative. We've got an abundant marketplace now. We've got to deal with that. And we can't afford to give up on advertising.  There simply is not enough generosity from individuals or foundations or God help us governments to support the journalism we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think what's going to happen is this is going to focus even more attention on native advertising because it's one of the few ways where you can theoretically align the interests of your readers and the interests of your advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you and I both know what you really do is fool your readers and now fool the ad blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so. I don't think it has to be that way. Yes.  I think sometimes I don't think it has to be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you know what?  I've got a very simple idea how to solve this publishers. Serve all your content from the ad server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you don't then you don't get you don't know how many hits you get. You don't know how many impressions you get the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You serve your content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, the other way around. Not serve your ads from your server. Serve your content from the ad server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your content gets blocked.  I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, native editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That actually. Yeah.  Oh, that's where we're headed, by the way.  There's going to be all ads with a little editorial and that's usually paid for by advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think one thing this does do is it pushes more publishers towards Facebook because and to Apple.  If they go to Facebook and Apple, they get a share of that advertising revenue.  They don't get blocked.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What a coincidence that Apple, which, of course, fuels this whole conversation.  I mean, this ad blockers have been around forever, but nobody used them until Apple put it in iOS.  And now everybody's using I'm unaware of them.  And I think the awareness that's happening now in iOS is going to spread to every other platform.  So suddenly we have ad block ellipse.  Isn't it interesting that Apple does have its own ad platform?  I ads. And it happens to work in news.  Did you go to Wired earlier this week if you went to wired.com, one of their top stories, it said this is all this pissed me off.  This said, you can't read this story on the Web.  Go to iOS news app and read it and we'll put it up on Tuesday.  Yeah, that is the upshot of this.  One of the upshots.  And that is reprehensible.  It's killing.  It's killing an open Web in favor of a gated community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we need advertising.  Advertising is what gives us freedom.  Alan Rusbridge, your former editor of The Guardian, points out that it was advertising that saved us from ownership by political parties and patrons and special interests.  If you get to a network where only the rich can afford it and the rich can subsidize it, then we're going to be right back in that world where we get, you know, Donald Trump brings you the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been thinking a lot about this in general.  And let me see if I can express this.  I feel like the human mind is really going in one direction or the other.  It's either opening or closing.  You're either in a kind of the most classical sense, liberal opening to new ideas, tolerant, expanding, or you're closing.  And the United States had a couple of and it's very easy, by the way, there's a lot of inertia and momentum in this.  It's very easy to kind of get in the wrong direction.  And we had a couple of nudges in the direction of closed with 9-11 and then with the Snowden revelations, which moved a different group of people toward closed.  But both of those things have pushed the Snowden revelations suddenly got everybody worried about privacy and 9-11 got us worried about terrorists.  And so what's happened is once you get nudged in the direction of shutting down, eliminating the other, I don't want to hear challenging ideas.  I don't want to be exposed to the other.  I want to be in my cocoon.  You move into basically a gated community.  That's the move towards shutting out the other, getting kind of a homogeneity of experience.  Apps are the ultimate gated community.  They're the opposite of a free and open Internet.  They're the right, the controlled community where you don't have to be challenged.  And the problem is that this vicious circle that the more close you get, the more you move in that direction.  And so I really fear that that's one of the threats that is a really kind of a significant deep sociological threat is that we're moving toward the gated community.  Apps started that.  Absolutely right.  And that's not what you want.  You want a wide open Internet.  And yeah, you know what?  Things are going to happen on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that subsidizes, you know, what subsidizes that open web advertising.  Part of the problem with the ad block discussion is that advertising has been completely demonized.  And the ad industry didn't help because they irritated the hell out of everybody who could ever be a customer.  They messed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The irony is that you want the closed mind with advertising and you want the open mind with the editorial.  For example, you don't even want to consider the panty liners, right?  The mind is closed on that product category.  I'm not going to be using those.  But what we do want is to return to a certain standard.  We do have prostate surgery.  What we do want is to return to the newspaper model where the newspaper is always throwing articles that you didn't know you wanted to read.  And one of the problems with algorithmically sorted content is it just tells you what you already want to know.  And in fact, people are inclined in that direction anyway.  People read the news because they want their existing opinions validated more than challenged.  And so we need that combination.  Close mind on the advertising.  In other words, high quality advertising.  Open mind on the editorial, which is high quality editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the risk with Facebook is that walled garden, it's a little like Apple.  It's a beautiful garden.  The flowers are really nice and you can hardly see the walls and no one comes up and tries to pickpocket you or whatever.  But you don't know what the rules are of the garden.  Only Facebook knows what is shown to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't worry your pretty little beard about that, Matthew.  It's going to be nice.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I argue that we have to negotiate with Facebook for some small measure of user interest data so we could also serve people on our own.  And no, they don't want to give that up because it's the pot of gold.  But if we're really going to have discussions about Google and Facebook, truly supporting news, it has to mean that.  It has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is the Washington Post getting for giving 100 percent of its content to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that they didn't negotiate something special in terms of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and it's Jeff Bezos, remember, that probably had a hand in that negotiation of Amazon.  He bought the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Peter Kafka was on TNT today talking about this.  And his basic view is that Jeff Bezos' directive for the Washington Post is if it's digital, jump on it.  We want to be all over it.  And I don't care if we lose money at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  Because isn't that Bezos how Bezos built Amazon?  Ten years of losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they can afford to.  My friend Wolfgang Blau from The Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, you go ahead.  I'm done.  Matthew's too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, you are too nice.  My friend Wolfgang Blau from The Guardian, who's a brilliant editorial mind, has been arguing on Facebook lately that between the discount deal that Bezos has given prime users for the Washington Post, which got me to subscribe.  Yeah, by the way.  He says that very, very soon, Washington Post is going to be bigger in traffic and audience than the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it will.  It's getting close for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much does it cost if I'm a prime member to get the Washington Post?  $49 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still too much.  Whereas I take the New York Times, the New York Times is like $600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I buy the Sunday Times and then I get access to everything else.  I do too.  Yeah.  And I do buy the Wall Street Journal because that makes us money.  Yeah.  I can justify spending money to make money.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  I did an experiment, Leo.  This is why I'm against the idea of micro payments.  My journal subscription lapsed.  So I said, let me see how it goes in three months.  And I'll see if there's a story I want.  I'll first see, did somebody else already write that story?  99 times out of 100, the same information as elsewhere.  The one time when I went with that story, of course I could cheat and go around.  But that's the time if micro payments existed, they'd get $1 for me, not $900.  And so this idea of, well, people should just pay a little bit for their content and everything would be OK.  Just a dollar here, a dollar there.  Uh-uh.  Not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because nobody wants 18 different bills for a dollar here, a dollar there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Zena, I think you know her, Jeff Zena, to fact he...  I disagree with her on that.  She's brilliant.  She wrote a piece on Medium about how what she would like is for a whole bunch of media entities to get together  and have a sort of Spotify where you could subscribe to one thing  and then get articles from all kinds of different publications.  It's kind of a Google contributor, isn't it?  Well, it is a little bit, although it's more organized than that.  It's more similar to something called Blendle, which is based in the Netherlands  and has expanded to Germany and wants to expand to the US.  And so they sign up a bunch of publishers.  You say, I want to pay, or publishers say people have to pay three cents for an article.  So then you just pay for the things you want.  I think that's a great model and I think it would be great if we had one.  But I don't think enough people will pay.  It might be a little bit of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Blendle said...  So Alexander Clipping, who's the founder of Blendle, said that 100,000 people in his nation of 16 million  had topped up their Blendle accounts within a year.  That's the one metric.  Yeah, so OK, that's nice to say that.  How much money have you paid out to publishers and what's the average payout for readers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He won't say.  He won't reveal.  And I do know that, well, I think I know from speaking to people at these companies,  the New York Times is experimenting with it.  Wall Street Journal is experimenting with it.  They're testing the water because it makes sense to do that.  But I don't think it's ever going to be...  That model is ever going to be a big enough contributor to say do without advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, again, I think it'll hurt the journal.  I think the Journal of the New York Times and the Financial Times are very high-priced subscriptions.  And if I could get the occasional article that I uniquely want there for a fraction of the price,  most people would.  I mean, I'll support the New York Times no matter what.  But for the up, you know, I don't subscribe to the EFT.  The EFT does have articles on whatever once in a while.  And I get stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting.  If you look at the New York Times, they've already...  They're effectively watering down their own paywall by giving access to people through other means.  So you can get more articles through NYT Now, the app.  You can get articles through Facebook, instant articles.  They're effectively cannibalizing their own paywall.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I just paid the $10 a month.  That's the max.  You don't have to pay that much in contributor, but that's the max you can pay.  Are we... just to get this straight, are we arguing for or against ad blockers here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's for ad blockers?  I'm in favor of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use them.  I don't actually use them.  But you're in favor of them.  Well, I'm in favor of people using them because I'm in favor of publishers and advertisers getting the message.  Right.  And the message is you have to try harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am against them, but I use them.  Just to balance you, Matthew.  So, and who's against ad blockers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  Even though I know that's hypocritical because I've had...  Back in the days, kids, we had these things called VCRs.  And it was wonderful when you learned how to skip commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I skipped commercials on my DVR.  Same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  And I think it's a little disingenuous.  I pretty much don't anymore.  You don't?  For publishers to say, you know, you have to, in order to support us, you have to submit to any kind of terrible advertising that we think is, you know, that we've convinced ourselves is worthwhile.  That's not a deal anyone would agree to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's kind of the main reason that I'm finally saying, you know what?  Given all of the hazards of the current ad model, it's not unreasonable for somebody to use an ad blocker.  You just can't blame them for doing that at all.  So that's what we have to fix if we have time.  My...  You know, I really didn't want to get into this conversation, but it really is.  It's a great discussion for a variety of reasons.  So what the heck?  But one more thought.  Here's my actual fear, as I think about this, is not that good sites are going to go away, but that we're going to get an escalating war, an arms race,  between ad blockers and ad tech.  And I think that's really, history tells us what's going to happen, because this isn't the first time ad blockers have become universal.  Remember when pop-ups were so awful that every browser worth its salt blocked pop-ups, and they all do still.  So what happened? Well, the ad tech just advanced.  In fact, that's one of the reasons ad tech is so offensive now, is to get around pop-up blockers and things like that.  And there's no reason to think that there's any technological...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, so that's why we need human standards to say, sorry, you can't advertise, just as you do, Leo.  You can't advertise here if you're going to do X, Y, and Z.  Right.  And that hurts when we're losing money.  We need publishers to do that. We do need publishers to do that.  We do need that. And they don't gather together to create a...  What Seda asked for, I don't think, and she's brilliant, but I disagree with her on this one.  They don't gather together to create an antitrust. What they gather together for is standards of quality.  And then at some point, the reasonable people would say, not unlike when Apple allowed you to buy music, reasonably I'll buy music now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in the IAB, their tech lab said that they were considering suing ad blocking software companies.  Like, that's a great strategy.  Oh, that'll fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The shoppers are doing it. The creators are doing it as well.  That's the record industry model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly. Have they not been paying attention? This is not a great strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should mention, I was at the IAB upfronts last week, and some people thought that was an endorsement of the IAB.  We are not members of the IAB.  The IAB is a good organization.  I didn't want to join an organization where things like that might happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and let's face it, some members of the IAB, ad tech is their business.  Right, lots of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look up Ad Age, Randall Rothenberg's piece, The Unnecessary Internet Apocalypse,  And I don't think he goes far enough, but he says that, where is it here?  The rapid race for first-party data has to slow down.  Ads should only load when they're about to be filled up before.  Advertisers and agencies should voluntarily abandon the worst forms of digital disruption.  Publishers should take control of their site experiences. Those are his four rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't matter at this point. Too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Too late.  Ad blockers are here to stay.  Ben Thompson said the same thing.  Ad blockers are here to stay.  It's too late. Effectively, this debate is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's over. They should have done that two years ago.  Because you know what? Everybody's using ad blockers.  Well, we're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to mention advertisers are going to social platforms like Facebook.  Publishers with their own websites will be left to soak up whatever dregs they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only if that's the business we put ourselves in, and then we end up doing...  The world is Buzzfeed and cats. Yes.  I'm not ready to give up, gentlemen. I am not ready to give up on quality media.  I think that there's room for quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's room for quality media.  The problem is there won't be large enterprises.  There'll be individual small enterprises that can do first-party ads.  They can figure out a way, like I have, to do advertising in a respectful way to your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the New York Times and Conde Nast and places like that can figure this out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder how though, with the ad blocker and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the courts. Zach Seward at Courts. Zach Seward at Courts bragged properly.  The courts has no networks, no IAB units.  All they have is very well labeled, native, and other kinds of advertising.  They sell specially.  And they're not so much in this mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So the risk is, when I started talking about the same thing, the risk is smaller outlets, like say The All, for example,  they don't have the resources to create really good native advertising.  They don't have the resources to do deals with Facebook and other platforms.  So they're going to get... The argument is they're going to get... They're going to disappear.  In fact, they're going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll be in the Facebook deals.  Facebook's going to open up for those kind of guys.  Really?  Yeah. Oh yeah.  Facebook said it, that they're expanding.  What they have now is just the beginning.  They've already started expanding. They'll expand to bigger guys, smaller guys.  But that's a case where you have a quality network.  The All and name five other great blogs could join together to take their quality audience,  their hip quality audience, and create stuff from a place like narratively or contently.  No, I think that's possible that you could do that. You're right.  The All on its own can't.  But because advertisers are still stupid, they still want mass.  The problem with all of this is that advertisers are dumb and slow,  and nobody wants to argue with them because they have the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, as Dallas points out in their chat room,  Wikipedia still doesn't have ads and survives,  and there are places on the web that preserve the ethos of the web from the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They got to beg for it. They got to beg.  They do have to beg.  I'm glad to give them money.  There aren't enough people like you, Leo, giving them money.  I think it gets harder and harder with that model over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, it is the shining example of what the internet can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone else in the chat room made a good point, which is that a lot of what is out there content-wise is...  I mean, there are a thousand websites writing fundamentally the same thing.  The same thing, yeah.  Plus the same thing.  Yes.  Why would anybody even consent to view ads to read that?  You would have to pay people to read that.  Why business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the business model is still a volume-based...  You're absolutely right, Matthew.  Eyeballs, exactly.  Exactly spot on.  It's also terribly inefficient because we all write the same stories.  We do it to get our own page view, to get our own ad,  because we're in a volume-based business, not a value-based business.  That's what we have to change at the fundamental level.  The Ola port is not in the volume-based business.  Leo said he doesn't want an audience with 250,000 for a given show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't mind it.  Right, but the problem is you go to an advertiser...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh!  No, I never... Did I say that?  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is you go to an advertiser and you say,  wow, I've got these 1,100 really quality readers, and they say that's super great,  but we're going to go with the other site that has 75 million unique visitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also too... It's too hard for them to buy 1Z2Zs for that.  True friends.  Exactly.  The agency wants to deal with that.  In fact, that's the problem we face.  We're not big enough to get a lot of agency buys,  because it's not worth it for the agency.  Their commission is not big enough to buy ads from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in fact, you could argue, and I have argued, that ad buyers are the problem.  I agree.  Not necessarily advertisers.  Yes.  Because ad buyers just want to...  They want to check a box so that then they can make a report to the brand.  Got this number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And speaking of moral hazard, the more they sell, the bigger commission they make.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, take a break.  We've got to talk about other things as well, including the right to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's something you didn't want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I really didn't.  You always want to talk.  It's a great subject, and I think it's an important subject.  I think the war is over.  I think ad blockers are here to stay.  I'm very interested in what will happen next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every story, including the one you just about teased there,  is all about the future of the internet.  These are big, big questions.  What's going to happen?  Whether ads exist or not, whether content exists or not,  and this right to be forgotten thing, this is a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I'm worried about this.  We'll talk about it.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm sure Jeff will turn a little pinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  We're Niagara Falls.  Niagara Falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, don't skip this ad.  This is an ad that could keep your home safe, your family safe.  It's something fun and easy and simple.  If you're a geek, you're going to love it.  Ring, the Ring Video Doorbell at ring.com slash twig.  So I have one, and I love it.  In fact, I should fire it up because...  So here's the deal.  This is a doorbell that replaces the button on the front door.  If you have a wired doorbell, it's easy to remove the old one.  I removed two screws, popped it off with a screwdriver.  There's two wires coming out of a hole.  They give you everything in the Ring box, by the way, to do all of this,  including configure and start up the Ring doorbell.  Once you do it, there's the screwdriver.  You got the level.  You got the drill bit, everything you need.  They give you everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They give you a whole tool set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing.  I know I kept the screwdriver and all that because it's useful  and a little bitty level.  By the way, you don't have to have wires.  You can glue this anywhere.  I was thinking of putting it on our bedroom door  because it's battery as well.  So in a lithium-ion battery lasts a...  Yeah, you see what I'm saying?  You know what I'm talking about here?  Lasts a year.  Hey, who's out there?  The thing is, it not only rings your chimes in your house,  but it rings every device you install the Ring software on.  And I put it on everything because I can never hear the doorbell ring.  So now when somebody rings our doorbell, I know because I hear it everywhere.  It's the chimes, right?  On my laptop, on my iPhone, on my Android phone, on my tablets.  And it...  Dong, dong, dong.  It's very pleasant.  You can then fire up the app.  This is what's so interesting.  And you can see who's at the door.  There it is.  And you can see who's at the door.  And you could talk to them.  The other day, a neighbor came by.  Let me see if I can find that one.  He came by.  Bob, the neighbor.  He wanted to chop down our trees.  It was a good thing that I actually answered the door.  I was at work.  Where is that camera?  Holy cow.  That's right here.  Okay.  Yeah, there he is.  There's Bob.  Bob, our neighbor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at the wide field of view.  Yeah, that's good because you can see everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is there.  And so I pressed the accept button and I talked to Bob.  There he is.  Oh, see, he's bringing wine.  This is his second visit.  So I said, hey, Bob, he said, I want to come by and chop down your trees.  You mind?  I said, Bob, I'm at work.  Can I call you later?  So that was an actual call that I took while I was at work.  In fact, some of you saw me do that.  It was right before the radio show.  So those are the missed calls or the answered calls.  But you can also get a call from just motion out front.  You can see if people are coming and going in front of your door.  So it's kind of like a security camera.  And as you say, it's very wide.  So I can see what's going on.  That's actually our son leaving with his grandparents.  So I know exactly when that happened.  When my daughter comes in at two in the morning, I know he left 1052 this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I give you another use case, Leo?  Yeah.  When somebody sends my FedEx or UPS and they demand a signature,  I want to be able to answer this with my mug on the screen and say to the guy,  really, I live here.  Leave the box.  I give you authorization.  Leave the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leave the box.  Sometimes that works.  Can't promise.  But I tell you what, it certainly scares a burglar away.  Did you know 95% of home robberies occurred during the day?  Burglar rings the doorbell to see if you're home before he goes around back to break in.  Even if you're at work and you can answer the doorbell and say,  hey, I'm giving the kids a bath.  Can I just leave it?  And then they run off.  So it's for safety.  It's for security.  It's for monitoring.  You said how wide...  There's some kids coming to visit.  I just love this.  I just love this.  They can hear you.  You can hear them.  You can see them.  It's about 200 bucks.  Although we're going to give you $10 off if you go to ring.com slash twig.  And notice you can have multiple doorbells on a single app.  So I can add another doorbell like my bedroom doorbell.  That's the next one.  Put that right on the door there.  What is it?  Taking a bath right now.  Ring.com slash twig.  It's easy to install.  I am not Mr. Handyman by any means.  I found it was simple.  And even if you don't have wiring, you can use it, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And what's really cool about this, before you close out, I do.  I love it.  I use it 30 times.  I mean, I just love it.  I have, they used to call it total information awareness in the Pentagon.  It's so great to know what's going on.  And one of the things that's really cool is it's mounted on there really solidly.  Right.  If somebody somehow comes with a crowbar and pries it off your front wall, they'll replace  it for free.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yes.  So it's out there and it's this obviously valuable piece of gadgetry.  It's not going to happen.  I think it's very unlikely.  It's very unlikely.  But if you'll have video of them, if they do exactly, that's right up in the clouds,  so they don't steal that.  But they'll replace it for free.  Yeah.  That's a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Botham was showing me hers and she said, I will show you how this works, but I can't  remember my password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, you do need a password to log in.  And by the way, it's mounted on the door with a proprietary screw.  You get a proprietary bit, which deters somebody who wants to subtly steal it.  But I love it that they'll replace it for free.  That's neat.  Yeah.  Ring.com slash twig.  Obviously, there's nothing, no reason not to get this immediately.  Yeah.  French data regulator says, if you delete, if you delist somebody, if we agree and say  you just delist somebody in France, Google, you have to delete it not just on google.fr.  You have to delete it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not appeal, that can't be appealed.  And if Google does the right thing and doesn't go along, what is it?  I think it's two to five percent of Google's revenue globally.  Globally.  Globally.  Globally.  This is just this is exactly what I've been screaming about.  What's wrong with this decision?  Yeah.  And if France can do it, so can China and so can Putin and stay away from our Internet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  people.  Well, this is this is this bothers me profoundly on multiple levels.  And they're not they're not they're not admitting to this.  They literally say that contrary.  This is a quote from the CNIL, which is the organization that that rejected their appeal,  said, quote, contrary to what Google has stated, this decision does not show any willingness  on the part of the CNIL to apply French law extra territorially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, we are not saying your law should be everywhere in the world.  That's OK.  We're not saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's our French law.  That statement is a bald faced lie.  We are sitting here in Petaluma, California, covered in the United States, protected by  the First Amendment of the Constitution down the highway.  An hour and 20 minutes away is Google's headquarters.  They do they have a search index in case you haven't heard about this, where they index  the Internet and whatever's on the Internet.  If it's legal content, they try to index it so you can search for those things and find  those items.  And what the French this ruling does is it reaches across the Atlantic, right past the  Constitution and and censors Internet in the United States for Americans.  This is like outrageous.  And I think Google needs to leave Europe.  This is this is just Europeans will just go to Google dot com.  And what are they going to do?  Block Google?  Yes, I don't think they will.  They don't.  I don't think they will.  What do they do, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they can't say bullpucky in a French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just it's just they not do it.  Can they just ignore it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, they'll they'll be they'll be then they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I want to sue France for damaging my Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there is no damage is exactly what it is.  They're requiring by law.  This is the right to be forgotten in general, even in Europe.  The law says you must have a more inaccurate search engine because of privacy.  And yes, privacy is important.  But what bugs me is this idea that the Internet and content on the Internet is something that can be mettle with.  It can be censored.  You can do the equivalent of book burning as long as it's an American company doing something digitally.  If they think that this content is so privacy evading, then then go in there with with a bunch of of jackbooted thugs into the Guardian and shut them down.  Censor the content itself.  If this is censorable content, but if it's legal content, then the search engines should point to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's speech.  It is pure and simple.  It is speech.  We believe in free speech in this country.  And unfortunately, others don't hold that same sacred right as we do.  But but now they are indeed.  This is exactly what I said was always going to happen is that European standards were going to we're going to affect us in the U.S.  the rest of the world.  And then you're going to end up with the lowest common denominator because now you know damn well that pootie pootie is asking the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The denominator is going to get way lower here.  Yeah, absolutely.  And this is the only thing I can see happening now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, God bless them, has not done a great job of dealing with this.  They ignored it for a while.  It came on.  There was a surprise.  I think I said on the show I was I was at a Google privacy event to speak about you when this decision was handed down and they were all gobs back.  They didn't see it coming.  And Europeans say you should have.  Hello.  And the only thing I can know is that Google has to has to put forward Google and others in the rest of Silicon Valley and our government have to put forward a full frontal assault on the stupidity of this, including PR.  But also, I think at some level, I wonder what the right is to go to the Human Rights Court and go to the EU as a whole, because the EU will come down in some cases on such stupidity.  The problem with this, of course, is right to be forgotten is an EU court decision with no right of appeal.  And so it is royally f up.  But Google has to find a way to fight this.  And I don't know legally what the options are.  As Matthew says, it is unappealable at that level.  Once they're fined, then they can go fight that.  But then they've already been found basically guilty of something.  They've already been fined and they've got a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.  I don't know if there are any way that we can start a popular movement to tell the France to go f off.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing I could see is the EU might decide, yes, they have made decisions about the right to be forgotten, but they might be open to an appeal on the basis that France is trying to effectively apply its laws extraterritorially, which is a no-no.  So, I mean, that might be an avenue of appeal.  I don't know if the EU would listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just, I mean, look, don't we want privacy?  Isn't this what we've been fighting for?  This kind of, I think this is absolutely right.  We want privacy.  We've been saying this all along.  We don't want these companies to store information about us.  I think this is completely legitimate.  They're doing the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We, we like privacy.  Privacy is a core value in the West, in Europe.  So does France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, Europe protects their people better than the United States does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But, well, that's a European value.  And if European values are going to be instituted not in the publications that exist in Europe,  but in the search engines that exist in Mountain View,  then the Saudi Arabian values have to be applied globally.  The Chinese values, no more mentioning or photographing the Dalai Lama.  No women's hair can be exposed on Google because Saudi Arabia doesn't like it.  If Saudi Arabia executes a blogger, they don't really want to have problems with their relationship with the United States,  their big oil customer, and they want to censor that.  That's a Saudi Arabian value.  And that has to be implemented into Google.  You can't mention that anything about that blogger being executed  because Saudi Arabia's values insist that that be a global.  This is, it's, and by the way, this for Europe, this is cultural bigotry to think.  They actually expect Google to say, OK, European values are good.  Everybody else's values are bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But to play Leo's devil's advocate role here, which Leo does very well,  they would argue that we have forced our values on the world.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  You Americans, you don't mind if you put your public, your private stuff in public,  but we do not wish this and we wish the right to be forgotten.  That's it. It's exactly what we would like to forget you, France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please let us think Google stop doing business in countries like China.  They did this in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there is. There is a simple solution.  All Google has to do is serve people in France, Google.fr and remove whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think they I think for legal reasons they'd have to block France  because you can't be doing business in France.  Otherwise, you're you're prone to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But see, they wouldn't block France.  They don't they don't actually think they're censoring, even though they are literally censoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's why Google says if we get a query from a French block of IP addresses, we say, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You'll have to use whatever the crappy piece of software you guys have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But back to this institute imposing American values on Europe.  No, this content that is being the links to which is being blocked are legal articles, are legal articles by French law.  The French the French publications, for example, those are it's in French.  And these are French journalists expressing the French value of freedom of speech in printing these articles.  And then it's not like it's not like we're imposing pedophilia on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I understand. But they have a court. They have a system.  The court has decided respect their court. We respect the Supreme Court. Right.  We'd expect. I mean, just move out. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have to leave Europe. This is this is I think you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they might actually.  Wouldn't that be great just to say, hey, sorry, you're coming in from France.  We don't I mean, we certainly know how to do geographic restrictions.  By the way, there'd be a risk business in VPN. Yes.  In France. And that's how it should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's how it should work. Wow. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all I can say. But yes, of course, I was being the devil's advocate.  Thank you for noticing. Yes, I know.  But I do. But I there was a kernel of truth in that because I I really worry.  And I know you agree with me on this, Jeff, that we are so concerned about  and I feel like this is kind of in reaction, a knee jerk reaction to Snowden.  So concerned about our privacy that we will in fact start shutting down valuable,  you know, technology technological advances, things like we love you.  And I love the Amazon Echo, Mike. But people are so but it's listening in your house.  And I could easily see stuff like that not being developed,  not happening because people are so concerned about privacy.  So there is a kernel of truth in that when I said that, because I do think that  many people point to the EU as an exemplar in privacy regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First, you know, Ilsa Eigner, former head of consumer protection in Germany,  some different title. I said this on the show before when four years ago  said that the use of geo technology and facial recognition together was henceforth  and forever. They're both taboo is the word she used.  Well, and as I've always said, you could find missing children and Alzheimer's  patients and all kinds of other things when you regulate technology,  because you fear what the technology could do when you regulate speech,  because what you fear the speech could do, you're basically insulting  the public, the future. You're cutting it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we live in a place with the country of the First Amendment.  There are very few countries that have free speech in that regard.  And in the way we have, that's absolutist. Right. Exactly.  Did not Google, as Al Khalifa has pointed out in her chat room,  open the door to this by voluntarily censoring search results on things like Torrance?  And they were forced to. Well, it wasn't voluntary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, Google has a perfect right to decide itself what to do.  I mean, Google can decide not to put child porn up and Google decides that.  And that's Google's fine right. OK.  Facebook can decide to put no nipples up. Yeah.  But this is the I don't agree with that, but they do it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But there's a huge distinction to be made between linking to illegal content,  whether it's swastikas in Germany, whether it's child porn just about anywhere,  whether whatever and legal content.  Yes. The problem is that it's really easy to find content on the Internet.  That is a problem. It's a problem that sometimes people can be stigmatized  by things that happened that it's no longer fair for them to be stigmatized for those things.  That's what this is all about.  One example is there was a guy who was when he was young, he was a hippie,  he had a beard, long hair, and he was playing this goofy Australian instrument in a public park.  And the local newspaper took a picture of him and put it up online.  This is like 15 years ago. Now it's in their archive.  Now he's a financial consultant. He's got a suit and tie, a three piece suit.  He wants to be respectable.  And he felt that the hippie picture was ostracized, was stigmatized.  And he asked that it be removed. And under the law of the right to be forgotten, it was removed.  It's unfortunate that content like that is easy to find and it's stigmatizing.  However, the article, well in this case, this is a bad example because in fact,  the newspaper voluntarily removed the article itself.  But normally that's not the case.  But the problem is that that's reality.  That's an unfortunate reality that that sort of thing happens.  The right to be forgotten is equivalent to being you can't burn books  unless they're bestsellers, in which case they're everywhere.  And therefore it's okay to burn bestsellers.  You just can't burn obscure books.  Like nobody would pass a law like that.  But that's exactly what the right to be forgotten is.  The Europeans do not take the Internet seriously as a protected medium of content.  That's why they don't mind burning the Internet.  They would never burn the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had the same argument when I was a TV critic when there was efforts,  the V-chip put in VCRs so the television content could be censored.  We never would have allowed that with books because we respect books.  We didn't respect television.  You're right.  The Internet is not respected at all.  It's demonized and they've got to see the Internet as speech.  And folks, if we're not going to fight, who the hell is going to fight?  How does somebody, does Boing Boing or EFF get people together to go march on the Elysee Palace?  I don't know what we do.  But if we don't fight, nobody's going to fight and it's just going to happen to us.  It's really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The good news is France is a small country, probably not a huge amount of money.  Now this is like Neville Chamberlain and the Nazis.  Godwin's law, ladies and gentlemen.  I just want to point that out.  You have now fulfilled Godwin's law.  You cannot appease the French.  This is the time to send a signal to the EU and to every other country that would do this.  You can afford to do it in France, right?  Maybe you couldn't afford to do it in China, but you can afford to do it in France.  Cut them off now.  Send a signal.  You don't like what we do?  We will cut you off and then see how many times that happens in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the French would love it for Google to leave France because there is a smattering of French search engines  and they would love to give them a chance.  Heck, bring back the Minitel.  I bet they would love to bring back the Minitel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One aspect of this is the European cultural resistance to giant US corporations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Coca Colonialism, I think they call it.  We've talked about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I was in Italy talking to people about Google and about Facebook,  one of the big sources of resistance is just these are giant US companies coming over here  and they own the Internet and they tell us what to do and they take all our advertising and all our news  and all our industries are going under.  So a lot of it is just anti-Googleism.  I'm sorry to interrupt, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  But it's like this is the irony.  They don't understand the reason that these companies are all American is because the American government  didn't preemptively ban things and didn't do insane things like the right to be forgotten.  If that were the case and if Europe had more of a Wild West type of situation,  we'd be complaining about the French search engine with its dominant cultural values being imposed on us.  I happen to like the French culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I look forward to going back to France next year as I do as many years as I can.  I love the people, the food.  Maybe not so happy about the CNIL.  But nevertheless, I think this is the way you handle it.  And you don't and you don't but you've got to do is you've got to act and you've got to act briskly to forestall.  What would the stock market do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, one more point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, who cares?  Google said.  The stock market doesn't.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm stupid.  Does your stock price really impact how you run the company?  It's not your money anymore.  You already got your big chunk of change from the IPO.  Who cares what your stock price is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The market will say, oh, if France did this, where else is going to say good?  Let's get rid of Google.  Now we know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but nobody wants to get rid of Google.  Well, OK, all institutions, they do.  But every but the people don't and the people were when imagine.  I mean, look, you don't want to screw with the French people back to the barricades, baby.  Yeah, the cut your head off.  The cut your head off.  Get a new burned McDonald's.  The burned McDonald's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But but it is a good point.  92 percent north of 92 percent of the search engine using public in in in France is loving Google.  That's way higher than the US.  They're way more popular in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google, if Google puts a big higher, a big page, it says, no, no Google for you today.  Yeah, you better believe you'd hear it.  And that law and it would it would it would be completely transformed.  Well, we saw it in Spain, especially in Spain with the publishers, especially if you put a photo of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a folk parotene who's in charge of this organization that he stoned.  You know, it's it's yeah, you know, that French love McDonald's, too.  You know that they really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was in when we were in Budapest several times, guides pointed out the first McDonald's on in the Eastern Bloc.  There it is. There were lines around the block for months.  People would die to get their hands on a big bag.  People get dressed up. Yes.  Go wait in line. It would be one of our guides told us that.  He said, you want the best date. You want to get a girl to love you in those days.  This was probably 19. I don't know when it was 80s, 70s.  It was, of course, still a part of the Warsaw Pact.  It was still a communist block country.  You take her to McDonald's, man, she would flip her lid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, you know, and when they opened in Moscow, McDonald's, I've read stories about this.  McDonald's biggest challenge was trying to get this is during the Soviet Union, trying to get Russian,  the Russian cashiers and so on to smile and give friendly to be friendly because it's so counter to the Soviet culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you want? Get in here. I give you meat and meat and pie. No soup.  I give you I give you roasted potato. What do you think? You liked it? It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny. Really, they could like they culturally wouldn't smile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just couldn't bring themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's nothing to be happy about. Have you not seen what's going on out there? It's terrible.  World sucks. Would you like phrase with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ahmed Mohammed is at Google right now.  What's wrong with the right? He's there right now.  Is this OK? I'm like I am I.  I'm all for this kid and he's a maker. I understand he didn't invent the clock. He didn't make it bit by bit.  He took apart a clock. He got it radio. That's fine. This is a maker. That's how you start.  I think what the school did to him was reprehensible. I think there's probably very good evidence.  It was racist, anti-Muslim, Muslim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got some email about this, though. No, I know, because there's now a backlash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But maybe we are going a little too far honoring this kid.  He's just received like every kind of Microsoft product known to man.  He's been offered yet is he's been offered a trip to the White House.  I think he's going. He's been offered a job at Facebook internship.  And now he's at the Google Science Fair hanging out with no lesser a light than Sergey Brin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, all you got to do is take apart a clock and man, it's everybody feels super guilty about how badly Muslims are treated in the US,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  especially in places like Irving, Texas. You nailed it, though.  I mean, of course it happened. The kid was terrible and everything.  But this is celebrity in the US. And then inevitably it goes completely the opposite direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to we're going to see the stories that you put set the clock now in two years.  We're going to see the story. Poor Ahmed was the center of the universe.  And then everybody dumped him. And he wondered what the heck happened.  You know what? That's a good point. Geometry class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He thinks his life is made. This could be the worst thing that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Right. He's going to wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was at the Examiner in San Francisco when Skylab fell over that old folks.  Yeah. Yep. We gave we offered and I called NASA and they said this is never going to fall over land.  Don't worry about it. No money involved.  We offer ten thousand dollars as a prize to every one.  This is Skylab to our office. Wow.  And a year because we found out that the Chronicle was going to offer insurance to Chronicle subscribers if they got injured by Skylab.  So we said that was awfully negative. So we'll offer money for Skylab.  And it was good old time newspaper war.  And so this kid named Stan Thornton from Esperance, Western Australia, a beer truck assistant by God with the help of an Australian radio station came to San Francisco with pieces of Skylab.  And I remember Stan was 17 years old. He wanted money.  Well, the managing editor basically adopted him for three weeks because we couldn't let him be on his own.  So we. Oh, we'll never know what happened.  Yep. When all the fame left.  Wait, wait, wait. You froze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Start. Finish the last sentence again.  So you adopted him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You adopted him and then and then he couldn't stand when the fame left.  Yeah. What to do.  He was he was, you know, well, what you love don't love me anymore.  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is the movie where the guy is a poor he's a poor drunken sot now he was the quiz kid who won all that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was that was Magnolia Magnolia.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. He was Donnie quiz kid.  Yeah. Barnes or whatever. Yeah.  What was his name?  That was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Such by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  William H. Macy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  William H. Macy.  Great. One of the best movies ever made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he was trying to get braces because he was in love with the bartender who had braces.  Right. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What a great move. That's right up there with Pulp Fiction Magnolia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Oh, yeah. Brilliant.  What? Oh, you got to watch.  I'll play it on the way back. I'll be watching.  Actually, one of Tom Cruise's finest roles.  You know what? That turned me around on Tom Cruise.  He does an amazing job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought, my God, he can act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Only there, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, he's reprised that role several times, including in Rock of Ages.  He's very good at that kind of crazed Paul Thomas Anderson, who is one of the one of our great directors.  Yeah. And this is a must see movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's giving an interview to remember to that woman.  And he just stops. He just stares at her.  What are you doing? He says, I'm silently judging you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  You can all watch the movie later.  Don't watch it now. Just put it on your wish list.  A wonderfully weird show this week.  It's fun. You know why? It's the perfect recipe.  I've really realized this with shows, and we spend a lot of time thinking about who should be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Three Americans and a Canadian. Is that the recipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeast and lemon.  It's personalities. You get the right personalities together and something magic happens.  I just really don't know how that happens.  Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.  Anyway, I'm thrilled to have you all. Matt Ingram, Matthew Ingram from fortune.com.  Are you back from the lake?  I am, unfortunately.  Oh, man, those pictures all summer long.  Man, follow him on Instagram.  If you know what it was like, he went to movies.  It was like the loans, Norman, the loans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He went straight from the canals of Venice to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. The kayak photos are over for this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No more kayak photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not until next summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Damn. What was that on Golden Pond?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I ran into a guy in London and he said, you know, I like you and your writing and everything, but you know what I really like?  I like your photos of like canoes and kayaks.  I told my son that everybody in Canada has a cabin up in the woods and they all go kayaking and canoeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So nice. Jeff Jarvis, who is in Los Angeles for ONA, the online news association.  Are you speaking tonight? What are you speaking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not speaking.  You're just standing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to pull a Google?  Talk to the hand. That's what Google needs. A big hand.  Yes.  Talk to the hand.  And Mike Elgin, who's here all the time, but it's so good to have him sitting here talking about Google.  There's nobody more fun to talk about Google with than Mike.  I love this show.  Yeah, I love this show too. This is my favorite show. I end my week with this show and I love doing that.  Someday we'll talk about Mike's project. He's making Camembert.  Yes. And Embry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's on your Instagram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think my wife is posting on Instagram.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I want you to make? I want you to make a paw paw pie. We discussed that last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We love pawpaws. And I found out somebody emailed me that Luther Burbank Gardens up here in Santa Rosa has two, not one, but two, you need two pawpaw trees.  They cross-pollinate like avocados. So you have to have a male and a female.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sounds very sordid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the pawpaw tree, I could go pluck a pawpaw just minutes away. I might do that.  Mike, not only are you making, tell us the story. You're not just making cheese, you're making cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We try to do things from scratch, my wife and I. And we keep pulling the thread out of the sweater.  So we got into a gallon and a half of milk every day. So my wife milked a cow.  There's a cow next door.  Yeah, a cow next door. And so it's too much milk for the family that owns a cow. So we alternate every other day.  So Amira milks it?  She milks it. She milks the cow. She goes out and leads the cow from its fantastic pasture into the milking barn.  Does she have a machine or does she do it by hand?  There's a machine. You attach it and it takes like 20 minutes or something like that.  And then a gallon and a half every other day. And then every other day I launch it. So we got a cheese cave. It's a wine fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's been making butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but wait, there's more. So I'm not making camembert and brie and some other things. I'm going to make some blue cheese.  I started cultivating my own mold for blue cheese.  Yes, I've been watching that with interest.  But now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's right there on the TNT desk, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to do a lot of that in my kitchen.  It's in the company refrigerator.  Not deliberately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the latest one is that rennet can be made from a variety of things, but traditionally it's made from one of the stomachs of a ruminant of some kind.  So we acquired a ruminant, a sheep, and we had it slaughtered.  Oh no!  They're going to eat the whole thing. They didn't just do it for the gut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't slaughter it?  I didn't slaughter it personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but there's a truck that... this is Petaluma. We're in a farm community.  There's a truck that goes around and says, sheep, anybody got sheep, we'll slaughter it for you.  They make house calls.  You don't slaughter it yourself.  It's a slaughter truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg, you're not as much of a man as Mark Zuckerberg. He eats kills and food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if he still does that.  But anyway, so what was funny is my wife texted me, like it was outside, they came and it started to happen.  She's like, come out here right away. You need to describe which of the stomachs you need.  Which of the stomachs?  Yeah, the four stomachs.  Do you know which of the stomachs?  I was quickly flipping through there.  Google told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Say, hey Siri, which of the four stomachs makes rennet?  Of the ruminant.  Wait a minute. This is a good test.  Okay, Google, which of the four stomachs of a ruminant is needed in rennet?  She probably says used for rennet, right?  Oh, I see, got Renton.  Yeah.  But it did come up with a, what is a ruminant?  And an article on the ruminant digestive system.  That's a very interesting topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, so I go out there and I told him and he carves it out and he just hands it to me.  I'm like with this stomach thing.  What do you do with that?  What you do.  You mince it?  What you do is you cover it in salt and you let it go because rennet is a series of enzymes.  And you're cultivating and growing these enzymes.  So you pack it in salt and you leave it sitting there for six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, the enzymes are not like living organisms. They're chemicals.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, okay.  And they live in a community but there's one of them that coagulates.  I don't know if they live.  They don't live in a community.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're like sea monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would like to live in a community of enzymes.  They have a Facebook group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, so in six months I'll have...  This topic's on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, is a rennet kind of like a sourdough starter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just take a little bit and you keep it going?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It uses it up.  It uses it up.  So there'll be further slaughter in the future.  You need another sheet.  Yeah, exactly.  But I mean, I imagine it'll last a long time.  You don't need a lot of rennet.  No, just a tiny little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did somebody figure out that only a piece from a stomach, one of the specific stomachs...  With French, what else are they going to do?  ... they use to make cheese?  I have a solid theory on this.  Any way to figure that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, first of all, it's a myth that you need rennet to make cheese.  Cheese will make itself use raw milk and with nothing.  Or if you add any acid.  It hastens the law.  So does rennet just feed it up?  Yeah, for certain types of aged cheeses you need rennet, but for like regular cheese...  So the way they discovered this is that oftentimes when you slaughter one of these animals,  there's actually cheese in there.  Like if you...  Oh no, no, no, that's not cheese.  We talk...  No, no, in France, back to the French, in France it's actually a very expensive valued type of cheese that's sort of made by the...  I mean, that's essentially...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why we will not allow the French to export unpasteurized cheese to the United States.  I think we should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or their laws.  I disagree with the French on the right to be forgotten, but they really know how to do cheese, man.  Well, there's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When did this become the speaking cheese?  There's an example.  There's an example.  We do not get the best French cheese in the United States because...  Oh no, we don't.  Our laws prevent it.  It's unpasteurized.  Is it the same in Canada?  No, you must...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They must allow good French cheese.  No, it is.  No, in fact, there's quite a well-known farmer who was selling unpasteurized milk and they basically shot him down.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is driven by the dairy industry because if you...  In order to do raw milk, it has to be a small...  It's as if the Schlitz and Budweiser companies banned the making of microbrews.  Because raw milk has to be done on a very small scale.  Right.  For obvious reasons.  And so it's a political thing and people have bought it up on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Fulio Marger in act of 1952 or whatever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did it prohibit it or did it promote it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It actually required margarine could not be sold that looked like butter.  Oh, that's right.  At some point, I think it was in Wisconsin, if you went into a restaurant, they were not allowed to offer you margarine.  You could have it if you requested it.  But they were not legally allowed to offer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like here in California, they can't offer you water at the restaurant anymore.  It's illegal to say, would you like water?  If you ask for it, they'll give it to you.  The law prohibits them because we're in a drought.  You know what I remember?  I don't remember.  I remember my parents telling me during the war when you ate a lot of oleo because butter was a precious commodity,  it would come, it would be white and you would get a coloring packet.  Yeah.  You got to mush it together.  Wow.  And now we know that that healthy thing called margarine is actually the worst thing you could possibly eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a chunk of trans fats.  He said they went across the border to buy illegal margarine.  It's like hooch, smuggled it across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, thanks to the French constitution, you have the right to forget the conversation you just heard.  And I urge you to use your rights.  This all started as a Linda ad.  But you see, the point being we love to learn new stuff.  We do.  The human brain is made to learn.  And if you stop learning, you stop living.  You've got to expand.  And there may be good reason for it.  For other reasons, you might make you a better employee.  You might get a raise.  You might be able to get a better job.  Linda.com is the place to go if you would like to make things happen, if you would like to learn for your work or for your hobby.  Maybe you want to learn how to code, make an app.  Maybe you want to get a website.  You need to learn how to design it.  Master Excel, sharpen your business skills.  I'm a photo buff.  I'm like crazy.  And of course, I've taken some of the best courses on photography at Linda.com.  First of all, you've got Burt Monroy, the best Photoshop guru in the world teaching there.  In fact, all the teachers are great.  Many of them are friends of mine.  People like that guy right there, Ben Long, who's awesome.  His course on learning to be a better photographer is one of the best ways to learn photography.  He's just great.  They've got introduction to photography, getting started with photography.  I love this one.  There's the five day photo challenge.  This will help you improve your composition skills.  There are new courses on color correction and making selective adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw.  You know what?  Master Curves.  It's very, very good.  The fundamental of Photoshop's, the brand new one, Creative Cloud 2015.  I could just tell you, the stuff at Linda.com is fantastic.  3,888 courses, last time I checked, in almost every subject.  Business, technology, creative skills.  Soft business skills too, like negotiating a raise or making a resume.  There's great stuff in there.  Running a business, starting businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've got to look into that negotiating a raise one.  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That sounds great.  That's one that we block all our employees from seeing.  Dang it.  If only we could.  Actually, a lot of businesses do have Linda.com accounts for their employees.  It's a great way to keep your employees sharp.  I want you to visit Linda.com and find out more.  Here's what you're going to get, a free 10-day trial.  Linda, l-y-n-d-a dot com slash twig.  10 days free.  That's enough to do a couple of courses beginning to end.  Or just to dip your toe into a bunch of them.  Where are we going to put this astronaut?  We're cutting him out of the moon and we're going to put him somewhere else.  This is fun.  If you want to find out, Linda.com slash twig and get that free 10-day trial.  That's the Content-Aware Move Scale and Rotate section from Photoshop 2015.  Where do you think he's going to put that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so convincing I'm starting to doubt the moon landing.  That would be a good course, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How to fake your own moon landing.  They need a cheese course.  How to make cheese.  Mike Ellicott brings you cheese.  I think Mike could teach that course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I learned a lot about cheese just in this show.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike got me.  Mike got me.  I have so many utensils on my counter now for all kinds of things.  You know what?  Jenny Jardin got me a tortilla maker.  I now have a 25-pound bag of corn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We make tortillas too.  You know what we're doing is we're fermenting the tortillas now.  No, stop!  So it's like it's better.  It's better.  You have to give me that trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got the press.  I got the lime.  I got the corn.  Why would you ferment them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just taste a little better.  Everything's better fermented.  So the theory is that in the old days where tortillas were cultivated in the Mayan era  and so on, of course they didn't have refrigerators and they didn't have good storage,  but they probably fermented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a fine line between going bad and tasting good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the great thing about fermented foods is you can always tell when it's gone bad.  That's the great thing.  If it's delicious, it's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once you're in Iceland and you have shark.  Right.  Never, never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Really?  Never eat that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't eat fermented shark?  No.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you tried that?  Yeah, it's the worst.  I don't want to offend the Icelandic community, but that is one of the worst meals ever.  And the only thing close to it is called lutefisk, which is Swedish, which is also disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Japan also has a very challenging fermentation culture.  They have this stuff called natto, which is like, it's a fermented grain, but it is really something special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really, every culture has fermented something.  They do.  Before kind of cooking, I think this was an early form of cooking was fermenting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's because things would go bad.  Right.  So you had to eat them when they were just a little bad, or you could eat them when they were really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Preservation involves salt, drying, fermentation, or starvation.  Great part about lutefisk.  Those are the options, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ragnarok, it looks like this shark has fermented a little bit.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should we eat it?  Lutefisk, they actually soak it in lye.  Lutefisk means lye fish.  So you soak it in poison, basically.  Yeah.  And then you have to leach the poison out and then reconstitute it.  It's revolting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're in Kristiansund in Norway, which is on the farthest west coast of Norway.  They are famous for their klipfisk, which is cod, which is dried in the cliffs in the sun.  It becomes cardboard.  Yeah.  You could kill somebody with it.  It's like a frisbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the lutefisk, they stack it up.  It's like plywood.  Yeah.  An Icelandic guy showed me this stuff they have called Brynvyn, which is a horrible revolting alcohol that I'm not sure what it's made from.  And I said, why on earth would anybody drink this?  And he said, that's the only way you can get down the shark.  And he told me about the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes the shark taste good.  I think it's interesting how taste is really conditioned by what you grew up with.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is.  And if you look at what people actually eat around the world, somebody was starving at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, someone in the chat room just reminded me of something which is related to your cheese.  And I won't go into that in any more detail.  But they mentioned this Chinese delicacy called thousand-year-old eggs or black eggs, which basically go bad.  And then they're horrible.  They bury them.  And you eat them.  And I mentioned this to a Chinese friend of mine.  And I said, this sounded like just a horribly revolting food.  And he said, you know what?  You're right.  I thought the same thing when someone told me how you make cheese.  They don't do dairy in Asia.  And then you squish it together and then it goes even more bad.  And then stuff grows on it.  And then it smells so bad you can barely get it in your mouth.  And I said, you know what?  Now that you mention it, that does sound horrible.  Don't look it up.  And then there's bar mites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's just yeast.  Don't look it up.  But the single worst food in the world is balut.  But don't look it up because you'll be sorry.  B-A-L-U-T.  You might really wish you had the right to be forgetting.  Nexus 6 is coming out in five days.  29th.  We're going to do a live stream.  We are.  Mike's going.  Mike's going.  Jason's going to be on vacation.  He poorly planned vacation.  He's going to be in Iceland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I planned my vacation well before the event.  Had I known, I probably would have planned differently.  I felt the same way when I was in New York City during the iPhone.  I would love to go to the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also would love to go to vacation.  We will next week hear about the two new Nexus phones, we believe.  And you have been waiting, haven't you, Jeff Jarvis, to hear about this phone?  Yes, I have.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll probably get the large one.  Except, you know, I got to say, I'm a little nervous about it being made in China.  You know, the latest ThinkPad revelations...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, it's not the ThinkPad. It's Lenovo.  The ThinkPads, as far as we know, are clean.  What about them?  Some Lenovo laptops.  You know, the first they had the SuperFish thing on there.  Now we've learned a couple of weeks ago that Lenovo was putting software on a Windows install  that they would then, even if you wiped the hard drive,  the BIOS and the Lenovos would reinstall the software.  It was used to update. I think it was used to update.  But it might have had other privacy implications.  It was important to step back.  But then again, iPhones are made in China, so...  Everything is made in China.  If that's your single concern, I think you're out of luck.  That's true.  There are a few phones made in Thailand, I think, and maybe some in Japan.  I think I can get a Windows phone, yeah.  But I don't think there's any phone made in the US.  For a while, Motorola was assembling its phones in Texas, but they stopped doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the bigger Nexus that's slightly smaller than the...  I think, as you said before, we found probably the upper limit of big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Six inches is as big as you want, I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the slightly smaller one would probably be right.  So the 5X and the 6P.  Yep.  Which color should I get, if those are the real colors?  I think the dark one is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, they don't have pink.  How is it better than the 6?  It's just newer, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me see.  I have a schmuck for this.  It's going to be smaller, actually.  The 6P will be 5.7 inches.  My phone is perfectly fine, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  You penurious Canadian you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I just have a 6 and I'm wondering, would it be better or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I call penury!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a... I have kayaks to pay for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, I do think that the 6P is the right size.  This is a 5.7 inch.  This is the Note 5.  And that is... I don't know why 0.3 inches makes a difference, but it does.  It's just... the 6 is just a little too big.  But you're carrying a 6 right now.  I think you'd like a 5.7.  Which has gotten dirty, but this white case...  That stupid Google Fi case, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is stupid, but it's what I like it because the buttons...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you still haven't turned on Fi?  No.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want to know that.  Okay.  The main reason to get...  Does it involve the French?  Just because it's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The main reason to get the new Nexus is fingerprint reader, right?  Yeah.  I am of the opinion now that you should not buy a phone that doesn't have a fingerprint reader, period.  Yep.  With Google, or rather Android Pay, with Apple Pay, for a myriad of reasons.  And convenience as well.  So, there is on the back, which actually is a sensible place to put it.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the second best place to put it.  First best is the on-off switch.  It's right on the bottom where the Apple iPhone puts it.  Because you hold it naturally and it's a great place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, I'm not sure.  There's a new phone.  I can't remember which one is it that has it on the on-off switch, Jason.  That's a Sony.  Sony.  That kind of seems sensible because you're going for the on-off switch anyway.  And all you do is you touch it and that's it.  I really like that one.  So, we should get one of the new experiences when they come out.  But I'm sure we'll get.  Which one are you getting, Jason?  The 5X or the 6P?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's difficult for me to choose.  I want to get them both, but I don't know.  He asked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To be honest.  He asked me.  He was hoping I would help the decision because he was going to get whatever I didn't get.  I don't know.  What are you going to get?  So, he could get that.  But I haven't decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 5 from two years ago is still, in my opinion, probably one of the best Nexus devices that there has been.  So, it's a good reason for me to check out the new 5.  Because it'll be an LG, same manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The camera will be better, we're sure, because the LG G4 actually has an excellent camera.  The Nexus 5, not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crossing my fingers that we finally have a Nexus device with a great camera.  With a good camera.  I'll hold out.  I'll hold out hope on that, but I'm not sure.  Is this the first?  That's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, is this the first major Huawei that we could get in America?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Unless you went to...  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could buy it on Chinese site.  But I mean, legitimately retail the Huawei entrance into America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the first time a Chinese Huawei or ZTE or Xiaomi has sold a phone direct in the United States, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's going to be the first time when you're going to see Huawei phones in the wild in America on a regular basis.  I have never seen one, ever.  I've never seen anybody using a Huawei.  You have a Xiaomi, don't you Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have a Xiaomi line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have the Xiaomi Mi 4 here.  But we had to buy that online through some random channel in order to get it.  Huawei, you can buy their devices in the US by going to the Huawei site.  So, you can get them here.  It's not a matter of importing them.  It's just I don't know if you can get Huawei devices through a carrier.  Like if you go into a carrier store, I don't know if they're going to be carrying Huawei devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  5X will be 5.2 inches, the rumor mill says.  It looks just as ugly, frankly, as the 6P.  Both of them are kind of ugly.  That's the 6P.  No, this right here would be the 5X.  The 6P has like a periscope on the top.  Yeah.  I'm really curious about that.  They both are not exactly...  But see, Google doesn't need to make attractive.  These are...  I still think developer platforms.  I really don't think that they intend these to be consumer grade, consumer funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hope so because that...  When they were really in the zone with making it a sort of a phone you could take apart and really tinker with and everything was open,  I thought that was really the way to go.  It was a differentiator for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's ironic because Google really broke the mold when they started selling the Nexus One.  It was the first phone not sold through a carrier.  Yeah.  And they stopped doing it because nobody bought it at the time.  Nobody was used to buying them like that.  Nobody bought them.  And now even Apple is starting to be sold carrier lists.  And now Samsung.  And Samsung.  So I think that's the wave of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, subsidies are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe the time is right for Google to get back into the consumer market with the Nexus.  People who have the Nexus, now it's mostly our audience who are geeks, enthusiasts,  but they love it.  They're like you, Jason.  They say this is the best phone ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of value to the update aspect of owning a Nexus,  especially for fans of the platform.  They want to be as up-to-date as possible.  And that's worth being on a Nexus for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I got the Nexus.  I mean, that's why I didn't get a Samsung or LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really too bad because that's a big...  That's kind of the fatal flaw of Android right now is that not all phones get that luxury.  And unfortunately, the majority of people get the phones that don't have that luxury.  And so it ends up being a big problem.  Type-C connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm actually happy about that.  Well, the OnePlus 2 is a Type-C, but really it's just a USB 2 port masquerading as a 3.1 port.  And what we really want is the full speed 3.1 Type-C port that goes...  that's bi-directional.  So, I mean, that would be remarkable.  And I'm hoping that they do that.  We're also going to see a new Apple TV.  No.  Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A new Chromecast. I'm sorry.  It's starting to blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's device season. That happens.  You know what? It's always device season now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no time off.  What do we know about the new Chromecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Funny looking in its shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like a ping pong paddle or something.  If you believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A whoopee cushion was what Flo said last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that has to do with antenna, I would guess.  Oh, that's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should get better Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't matter because it's behind the TV anyway, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which is interesting because you're seeing colored options for something that you're just going to have stuck behind the TV.  Did they have rose gold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said, well, I think it looks like it. Or maybe red. I don't know.  I really think the Chromecast does not get enough respect.  I still think that's the best device out there.  I agree. It's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's pretty great.  35 bucks.  Even though mine seems to have problems connecting to the Wi-Fi network and I don't know why.  It just periodically won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's typical. I have great results.  In fact, it does better than most of the other devices.  It could be my janky network too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what? Wi-Fi has gotten worse because everybody, even at the lake now, everybody has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's one of the features supposedly of the new Chromecast's AC support.  So faster Internet.  That would be good.  Fast play. All that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if it will do anything special with the new router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.  So happy that I did not buy the on-hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Jake did hook it up, said that it wasn't basically equal in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's average. It's overpriced for an average Wi-Fi router.  I'm very happy with the ASUS AC3200, which will be at the top of the line for a few days more until a new one comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm interested in that Chromecast audio, which is also in the lineup, I think.  That could be interesting for sort of non-Sonos users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hendrix, which is funny because that's my Wi-Fi name.  I named my Wi-Fi after dead rock stars. I have Hendrix, Winehouse, Joplin.  It's easy to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is it? Is it like you plug these into your speakers around the house and then it synchronizes the music going to Sonos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of is. It turns your speakers into a Sonos instead of a specific Sonos speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, it's very hard using just Wi-Fi to synchronize speakers all around the house.  People have been able to cobble this kind of thing together before. It's not that hard to do with Bluetooth dongle, Wi-Fi dongle.  But the problem is that a speaker in the living room is slightly off from the speaker in the bedroom.  And you hear this kind of echoing effect that's not good.  Sonos has some sort of secret sauce. They do their own network that seems to really eliminate that. It's amazing.  If you put it in party mode, all your speakers, and I have a lot of them, are all in sync.  And you can literally walk the whole house is rocking. You can walk anywhere and they're all in the sink.  But that's not trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it using the Wi-Fi access point inside the house or is it talking to each other through its own connected networks?  It does its own mesh network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if this is going to do the same thing.  You have to do that. Although they did add Wi-Fi recently.  They did, yeah.  They did, but the mesh network works quite well.  You use Wi-Fi to configure it, obviously, and it uses Wi-Fi to get radio or whatever.  But somehow they synchronize themselves through their own devices.  Hendrix. It has a 3.5 millimeter headphone cable.  One that goes into Hendrix, one that goes into your speaker.  So you'd presumably have powered, you'd need powered speakers.  That makes sense. Why not let people buy their own speakers?  That's one of the, you know, with Sonos, you have to generally use their speakers, although they do have a Kinect that allows you to use your own speakers.  I use that.  Well, this is going to be a big announcement.  September 29th. What time does it start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nine a.m. Pacific.  Now, the home run would be, and I don't think they're going to do it, but the home run would be to make this something like an Amazon Echo.  Amazon Echo type of interaction with Google.  That's what I want. Yeah. Big, big.  Just have this, the voice be throughout the house wherever there's a speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We did. I mentioned this on Windows Weekly. I apologize if you watch both shows.  So Lisa and I are parking this morning in the lot and we drove by a nice looking Corvette, had a badge on it that said 50.  And I said, what does that mean? Does that mean that's the 50th anniversary edition Corvette?  I said, has Corvette been around that long?  She said, I don't know. Let me ask Siri.  And in my head, I said, oh, you have a lot of unjustified faith in Siri.  So why don't you go ahead and ask Siri when when was the Corvette first released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see what we get.  When was the Corvette first released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Checking my sources.  Here's what I found on the web for when was the Corvette first released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Siri is kind of dumb and she gave me the Wikipedia entry for OK, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, Google. I shouldn't have said it twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've got to really be conditioned how to use these machines.  OK, Google, when was the Corvette first released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  June 30th, 1953, according to Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, then it goes on and on and on. It's like your little friend.  It's like the Cliff Claven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Mustang. I think the Mustang is also.  It's really Cliff Claven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually, I don't know if you know this, but it actually induced GM to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's their own production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the point being, really, and that's the new Siri.  That's the new Siri.  That's the new smarter Siri.  So and we did it with a few other things just to see.  And I have to say Google really still.  And then I asked Paul Thuratt to try it with Cortana.  The problem is Siri and Cortana both use Bing search.  So it had the same issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's funny is that we talk a lot about these virtual assistants.  But the most interesting one by far is Microsoft.  No, Microsoft's Chinese one called Xiao Ice.  I haven't tried Xiao Ice.  Xiao Ice is not an assistant. It doesn't help you.  I don't know if you can try it in English.  I think it's only in Mandarin or something like that.  Well, let's get.  But according to John Markoff, who with the New York Times, who Megan and I interviewed the other day for our.  I love John Markoff.  He's awesome.  He did a great article in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago where he pointed out that 25 percent of Xiao Ice users have told it.  I love you.  Wow.  It's not a personal assistant.  It's a it's a chat bot.  So what they do is they mine the Chinese social media for what people say and what people say in response to those things.  And they pack all this into the database.  So when you interact with it, you're essentially talking to the Chinese hive mind.  And it's and it also learns about you personally.  So it becomes a friend.  There's no mind like the Chinese hive.  There's nothing like tell you folks.  Exactly.  But it's supposed to be amazing.  People go off and spend a lot of time with this.  So here's the translation that the Times published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That sounds like her.  So you it does sound like her.  I want her, by the way.  If her ever comes out, I'm never leaving the house.  So the questions they're asking, this is the Chinese speaker.  I'll do I'll do her in a high voice.  Hannah, do you want to see my pet dog?  How old is it?  Have a look first and guess.  Can you give me a hint?  I want to hug and pet it.  Eight years old.  I was pretty close.  Give or take 10 years.  I took my dog for a walk today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't walk or feed it, it will be pushing daisies after a while.  Ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could keep it in a greenhouse.  That's no good.  What?  This is like a Liza.  Yeah, I was just going to say it's Liza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would you do then?  Build a home for it inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Set up a home warm hat.  What do you think of my cooking?  Nice hug.  Just to make I'm sure.  Oh, then she sends a picture of her food.  I'm sure you said that picture just to make my mouth water.  That's impressive.  Want some?  Anything delicious.  I have to try.  How did I do?  I think you're great.  Smiley face.  Picture of two dogs.  I could tell right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a purebred husky.  Huskies.  I'm going to go back to the cliff climbing voice.  Huskies are the goofballs of the dog world and they're fighter jets of the goofball world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at those cute little eyes.  Aren't they just dreamy?  What do you think is the best way to describe this kind of dog?  My dog likes to play outside.  Does it have fun?  A lot of fun.  I'm having fun too.  What do you think of my dog?  Really beautiful.  It's driving me crazy.  This is Eliza.  This is just a good Eliza.  Ask it when the Corvette was first released.  That's what I want to know.  How about this?  Imagine those two things combined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine if you had a chat pod and the original chat pods were supposed to do that.  But imagine if you had one that had the intelligence of Google Now or Siri in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is just around the corner because of course messaging is the hot platform right now.  Facebook big time pushing into that with M and other things.  WhatsApp.  I'm a big fan of Telegram.  The creator of Telegram, the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, Pavel Dorov, who ran when Putin basically confiscated his company and is in Berlin right now.  Actually, I think he has a place of no known abode because he's probably still a little scared of Putin.  But he created Telegram as a private messaging service.  He told TechCrunch Disrupt on Monday that they have gone from one billion messages a day in January to 12 billion messages a day.  But not much of an increase in monthly active users, about 60 million, which is still a small fraction of what WhatsApp does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember when somebody told me WhatsApp had exceeded the entire SMS network globally.  It wasn't that long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Messaging is hot.  I think the key on messaging is to add these features.  Telegram has great bots.  I have a bot on Telegram.  How many people do you know on Telegram?  Pardon me?  Not many. That's part of the problem.  But I have 400 people following my Telegram bot.  That's pretty good.  What does your bot do?  It says things like, Leo just arrived at the studio.  I have it connected with my car.  It has an automatic, so when I pull up and turn off the ignition at a certain geographic area, it tells the bot.  The bot goes, Leo's just pulled up. Maybe his show's about to begin.  Then it looks at my calendar and when the show says that, when I post to Instagram, it does.  It's kind of a way of aggregating different stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It helps us here on the staff because we put away the scotch and tell the strippers.  We put away the strippers. Leo just pulled up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unfortunately, the bot that I, the technology I'm using has gotten latent.  So it's now like three hours later.  It's saying, Leo just pulled up.  So here's one other thing. The Soundhound folks have Hound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Only on Android and Zend Beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very interesting because it is a weird kind of cross-site search.  They promote things like, you could say, show me hotels in Seattle for this weekend that cost less than 300 bucks.  Japanese restaurants in San Francisco within walking distance of the Ferry Building.  Those things would be very useful.  I found it be, where'd that camera go?  I don't know. The camera's placed horribly. Sorry about that.  So I found it very interesting because it's incredibly fast.  I'll just use one of their samples.  Well, actually, give me a sample so we don't, let's see.  Hotels in Santa Rosa that are child-friendly under $200.  Give me some hotels in Santa Rosa that are child-friendly for under $300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe child-friendly is.  It got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Showing two results near Santa Rosa for a maximum of $300 US dollars per night that are family hotels.  Family hotels. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder though, let's see. It's very fast.  When was the Corvette released?  Showing search results for when was the Corvette released?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not so useful.  What time is it in Peru right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What time is it in Peru right now?  It is 521 PM in Peru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how they make it so fast, by the way.  That's got to be, that's as close to instant as you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, that's important, right?  Siri sometimes takes a really long time.  Alexa, the Echo with Alexa is very fast as well.  Much faster than Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We have little contests and races.  I love Alexa.  Yeah. It's so good.  And I think that geeks now who have Alexa, I'm sorry, Echo, I shouldn't say the A word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Geeks now who have Echo, I'm seeing a lot of them kind of sharing our, like, you know what?  This is really good.  Yeah.  This is really interesting.  And it's not so different from talking to Siri or Google, but I think it's because it's your house.  And it's just there.  Yeah, you're talking to your house.  The other thing is I've noticed multiple improvements that just happen.  So we use it heavily for timers and we have multiple timers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Me too.  And now it keeps track of them.  It's like, well, this is one timer, this is the second timer.  Would you like to cancel the 10 minute timer or 45 minute timer?  Yeah, it has multiple timers, yeah.  Just a month ago, that didn't exist.  It also has multiple accounts.  So Lisa has an Audible account and I have an Audible account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I can say, switch accounts, read my book, and it will read Lisa's book, so I can switch accounts.  And I can say, switch accounts, read my book, and it will read Lisa's book, switch accounts, read my book, it'll read my book.  I use the timers for tea.  Me too.  It's a great tea timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's great.  We just use timers, the weather, sometimes what time it is.  If I have my hands full and want to know what time it is.  It's like a little buddy.  We use it for conversions, like how many teaspoons in a gallon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But imagine mixing that Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife would just shoot me.  No, she wouldn't.  The kids and my wife, they would all, oh, you've gone overboard.  They would all love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They would all love it.  No, they would come around.  You know what?  I thought the same thing.  I told Lisa, now, don't be mad at me, but we're going to put this thing in here.  Really, if you don't, if you hate it, I'll take it out.  She loves it.  We got a second one.  Yeah.  I think your wife would like it, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I dictate a text, she just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but this isn't like that.  This is more like you ask a question and you get an answer.  And they, and she, and she actually has some smart things.  You can say who shot first and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why doesn't Google have something like that?  Exactly.  That's my question.  That's where this came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I bet you on the 29th, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Now has, it's been around so long and it's had such a great reputation, but you  have to actively say, I'm going to go find and use Google Now now.  Whereas Alexa is just you talk and it answers.  It's like, that's how it should be.  That's how Google Now should be.  It will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the ambient internet.  I predict that's maybe even what that little Hendrix will do.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and if it comes with Scarlett Johansson's voice, you know, they all want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it on last week's show that we had Siri's voice, the woman who does Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've never had the woman who does Siri on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, not on the show.  Someone else's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I talked about her on iOS today.  Oh, she, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've seen Susan Bennett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Susan Bennett has a demo reel in which she interviews herself as Siri.  Was that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Now I remember a friend of mine suddenly Susan Bennett is following him on Facebook.  You can't figure out why, but she's the voice of Siri.  So he feels like he's, you know, touched a celebrity.  That was, that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't figure out why.  Here, let's hear Susan Bennett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here today with one of my alter egos, Siri.  Siri here.  May I call you Siri?  Call me Rock Goddess.  OK, Rock Goddess.  This is a little weird.  Almost in the iPhone or not.  Yeah.  Where have we heard your, my voice?  Did you see Mission Impossible 4?  4 hours 52 minutes.  Delta Airlines gates worldwide.  Thank you for choosing Delta Airlines.  What about TV and radio?  Searching the web for Siri.  Susan Bennett voiced over.  Chiquita.  Quite possibly the world's perfect food.  You can have it all right now with the Acura TSX.  At Papa John's we don't have to keep you waiting.  This is her voice over demo reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, there's big money in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeez.  It's kind of ironic she was the voice of the first ATM machine.  Was she?  Wow.  Yeah.  Tilly the all time teller.  First automated teller machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tilly the all time teller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what pisses me off?  Newark Airport.  The announcement was like, hey, don't leave your thing around.  It's a southern accent.  It should be a New York accent.  Hi, welcome to Newark.  Hey, yo, idiot, don't you leave your box around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop doing that.  Really, it's a southern accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Southern accent.  I bet they did research that found that people are less, that that's more, don't you think  if somebody said it with a not southern, hunted southern accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find it geographically offensive.  You know one of the most appealing accents apparently, and this is not just because I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Canadian, is the Canadian accent.  Because it's almost, it's not obvious, so it's not offensive because it's obviously  some other place.  But they will actually teach people who don't do voiceovers to try and simulate a Canadian  accent.  Because it's close enough to American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's something that they made up in Canada.  I don't think that's true.  No, it's not.  It's totally true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With the exception of the OU and the EE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously they don't do the Oud and the Oud thing.  But the EE, the B.  It's different enough.  It's different enough, but close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, I'll take your word for it.  I got a full-fledged supporting researcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there are multiple Canadian accents.  Exactly.  And some of them are nicer than others, I have to say.  Right, agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But do you want to talk more about Signal?  You wrote a nice article about it in Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's really interesting.  I mean, it's obvious that, you know, the technology actually, I don't think is all that interesting.  It's not.  What is it?  So it's a way of, it's a tool effectively for journalists to find things that are newsworthy on Facebook and Instagram.  So Facebook wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And reshare it or to actually use it on their.  To embed it.  Embed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's basically a dashboard that gives you an easy way to search for terms, keywords, etc., hashtags.  And then you can find content that's been posted.  You can sort of rank it effectively and then you can aggregate it, curate it and embed it easily.  So Twitter has done this too, right?  Yeah.  I forget what Twitter is called, but curator or something like that.  I just thought it was interesting that Facebook has been making a whole bunch of moves in various ways to try and appeal more to media companies.  So I think this is one aspect of that.  They're trying to get media companies to put their content on the platform.  They're trying to make it more appealing for media entities to work with Facebook.  They're trying to reach out more.  And I think this is, you know, they're trying to get obviously Facebook content highlighted in news reports as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm kind of, you know, day after tomorrow, Apple's new iPhone comes out and it features something called live photos.  Yeah.  Facebook and Apple have already been working together to put live photos in the iOS app of Facebook.  Facebook has also announced that they're going to allow 360 degree video in its news feed, video that you could create with a variety of cameras like GoPros.  Actually, I hope that the Ricoh Theta will work with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ever play with the Theta?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you ever view it?  I did. I did. And there's a new version.  Which I've ordered. I cannot wait to get it.  It's going to be great.  And you absolutely can do.  It looks like an Apple TV remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just a little kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a fisheye lens on either side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it'll take a 360 degree, not just still, but live video.  And that to me is very interesting.  You know what I want to do?  I want to do like a serious show like this and you could watch it and then the idea is you could look around, but then have dancing girls on the other side of the camera.  And we're just serious and we're talking like this.  And if somebody should by chance look over, they'll go, what the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or circus clowns with a chainsaw.  Or circus clowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just like weird stuff on the other side.  They actually did that with HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you remember some shows would actually have special content that you could only see if you had HD?  Hi-def? What does it look like?  Well, there would be something in the frame that you could only see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, because it was widescreen on the edges.  Yeah, it's just like that.  Now, I ordered this. I don't know.  It's supposed to come out pretty.  Is that the Theta S?  Yeah, the Theta S.  The problem with the one you had is the quality was pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty low and this is supposed to be much better.  And also the quality of what they do.  So there's obviously there's part of the world that can't be seen through a camera because the cameras in the way.  Right.  So the bottom sort of center and they have this supposedly great software that sort of stitches it together in a way that makes it vanish somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid I'm going to throw up when I look at my Facebook feed.  Like I'm afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to get very rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know what's driving me nuts, Matthew?  You know what's driving me completely nuts right now?  Trigger of trigger of triggers for me.  You're going to love this, folks.  The movie about the guy who walked across the Twin Towers.  Oh, I don't want to see that at all.  The previews, the thought of it, I'm doing it to myself right now.  Between that and my 9-11 thing and my heights, it's just the perfect storm for my psychosis to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is an incredible documentary about this guy that came out a few years ago.  It's amazing.  I've never seen it before.  Philippe Petit, he did it in 1974.  He strung a high wire.  Don't show any video.  Don't show it.  I shouldn't torture Jeff like this.  He strung a high wire across the between the two towers and walked across them.  And of course, no net because no, don't look.  No, stop, stop, stop.  I don't want to see.  It makes me a little queasy.  I've seen the movie trailers and I'm going, is it safe?  Yes, it's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine if it was a 360-degree autoplay video of that.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've seen some videos of amateur Russian daredevils as kids who go up on the top of the building.  Oh, they're crazy.  And they do somersaults on the edge and they hang over just you guys holding the other guy.  It makes me want to.  Poor Jeff because those are very popular on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You must see those all the time.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The preview is for Everest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you probably would never go somewhere like on the Hancock building in Chicago where the floor is glass.  Well, you know who does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those sadistic Canadians.  CN Tower, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  CN Tower.  Oh, that's creepy.  That's CN Tower.  Although I went up there and had dinner once because it rotates.  Yeah, it's great.  And that's a beautiful view.  And the floor is opaque.  I actually was sitting there.  It was Mikhail Olin, my photography friend and I, and somebody proposed to his girlfriend right next to us.  He got on his knees.  There's a lot of that.  Yeah, but there's a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Canadians like to get married.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't done the edge walk yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that I actually didn't do because I don't know how well I would do.  I would like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I would do it.  So it's official now.  The final account is in and we ordered 18 Fire tablets.  Amazon's new Fire tablet.  They sell in a six pack if you want it.  For the price of five.  For the price of five, you get a sixth.  Father Robert saw this and I think he was kind of surprised.  He sent out an email saying, hey, you know, these tablets end up being like 46 bucks when we all chip in.  Did anybody want one?  Three six packs later.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Disposable.  Yep.  Well, the next thing that's going to happen is, you know, newspapers have tried for years to give away tablets to get usage.  Yep.  Now, fortunately most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the thing is that after taxes, each one of them, if you get the six for the price of five, is $48.30 something cents.  Something like that.  Super cheap.  I mean, that is.  Are you getting one?  I'm getting one.  I was the first one in the pool, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you lose one or you, you know, you leave it in your hotel or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Even if you use it as a cutting board, it's a good price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, cutting board.  Cheese board.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.  I got this idea.  I'm flat.  Elgin household, right?  The cheese board is a fire.  And when you slice the cheese, it tells you about the cheese you're slicing.  Oh, yeah.  That's a great idea.  Made this camo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a pretty thick slice there, fatty.  You might want to back off on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I read somewhere that they were going to clean up the Android on the Fire tablets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it doesn't have the carousel anymore, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The thing about these tablets that is the important takeaway is they've abandoned their illusion that they are a compelling tablet in comparison with other tablets.  And they basically said, if you're a Prime member, this is the physical embodiment of Amazon Prime.  You can download stuff and watch it.  You can buy stuff really easily.  And that's exactly what they should be doing.  So if you don't use Amazon, you don't want one of these tablets.  Let's think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  This fits perfectly with this sort of reinforces the difference between Amazon and Apple.  So Apple makes great hardware and then tries to convince you to use its crappy content services so that you'll buy hardware.  Amazon is the exact opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can never compete with Amazon on price because they don't care if they make money.  They don't care about it.  And Apple has to make money on the hardware.  That's the only thing it's going to make money on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In fairness, Apple's content services are either crappy or overpriced.  They have high quality overpriced content services.  Not either.  Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's an and, not an or.  Take your pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Amazon video stuff works very well on my Android tablet.  Yes.  I've been downloading stuff.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I buy stuff on Amazon streaming all the time.  I like that stuff.  Frankly, it's either that or Google Play, unless the only place you get it is Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you seen Hand of God?  I started watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a mind blowing show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of mind blowing.  It's so crazy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He is so great.  Ron Perlman.  Ron Perlman plays a judge who has a religious awakening after his son commits suicide and  then goes on a vigilante spree to find the killer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it takes place in a fictional town in Silicon Valley.  Oh, I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I only saw the first one, but I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to get a six pack of tablets, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, congratulations to Amazon Five Emmy Awards for Transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is why they're celebrating.  It's down in the numbers section.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get to, don't waste a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got numbers.  I got numbers.  They signed a bunch of other deals too, right?  Did you see that?  They launched, they announced a bunch of deals with, I think, Louis C.K.  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It helps when you win an Emmy.  That kind of gives you some credibility, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also on September 25th at 12 a.m., they will have a sale.  Amazon Prime, normally $99 will be on sale for $67.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, everybody should run and get it.  That's if you're not in it.  Well, I guess if you didn't buy on Amazon, it wouldn't be worth it.  But boy, you get so much benefit from that.  Yeah.  Just a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really do.  You really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually, I was a little depressed last week because it was,  so garbage night is Monday.  And so it was this week a couple of nights ago.  And I'm breaking down boxes.  Yeah.  And from one week, Amazon boxes.  I mean, like a lot.  Like, I just, it took me an hour.  Yeah.  And we have a fairly big recycle.  I recycled, so they're in the recycling bin, but it's a big recycling bin.  I was jamming them in towards the end.  They're guilty pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Every time I order something, I'm like, I should go to another site and buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like I've just ruined the environment just by being in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There should be an option where you don't get a box.  It just comes in a bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They do have those.  They have the low frustration packaging, but I'm sorry, no matter what,  they always over package.  Yeah.  And the boxes are always too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will also happen with the direct delivery, the same day delivery.  I'm sure that's what they'll do.  Oh, for sure.  I hope so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody's telling us.  In the auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With the drones, it'll just have a parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Humanless driving cars.  It would make me happier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel guilty enough about throwing away the gadget, but at least I don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or leave the box on the porch, and when they drop something off, they can take the box back.  Oh, reuse it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should recycle.  Not me.  Why am I recycling your boxes, Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have this vision that the drone is going to come to your front door,  and you're going to get a little call on your special portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there'll be a command.  Alexa, drop the package.  Drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Drop it.  Let go.  Drop it.  Drop it.  Incidentally, those tablets you're getting, they're advertising supported.  You know that.  Yep.  No ad blockers on that one.  Nope.  No.  Like installing one.  I have the ad-supported Kindle paper.  Why?  It doesn't bother me.  You don't see the ad.  No, no.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You made somebody really bugging you.  See, that's the thing.  Everybody, we all have ad blockers installed in our brains.  We don't even see ads anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a notification, not audio.  Yeah.  That's what turning it down won't help.  Yeah, I know.  That's confusing as hell, by the way.  Apple.  Thank you, Apple.  Apple.  Who knew?  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  You can sing it.  Happy birthday.  Everybody sitting out there.  I can sing this song now without any pay royalties to Warner Chappelle Music.  Happy birthday to you.  So, you have the story on Fortune.  Happy birthday is now public domain finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh crap.  You're going to get sued.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Can he edit that out?  It's not actually public domain.  Oh.  So, all they found was that Warner does not hold a valid copyright.  Oh.  So, that's not to say someone might not have a valid copyright.  But, let's face it, after it's been a hundred and whatever years, the odds of someone actually  arguing that, spending the time to argue that they have a valid copyright is pretty slim  to nil, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Warner bought this copyright in 1988 from another company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, they've been making two million dollars a year.  But, they cost them 25 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, here's the real question.  Do they have to pay back the people they've been getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, the plaintiffs in this case are basically mounting a second case to argue that Warner  should have to cop up that million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, it was a filmmaker who intentionally used happy birthday, paid $1,500 in license fees.  The whole purpose of it was, she was writing, she did a documentary about this so she could  sue him.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, this is all, and actually, they used a lot of the evidence that came up.  I mentioned that Georgetown University law professor, I think, who's mentioned in the  piece, did a massive amount of research in 2008, I think it was, and produced this paper,  which I remember reading.  It was just mind boggling the kind of effort he went to track down what happened in the  1890s, you know, with this, these sisters who wrote this little song and then sang it  to kindergarten kids.  Just fascinating, that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Highly recommended Matthew's article in Fortune because it follows the trail.  And, you're the only one who got it right, that it's not public domain, that it's now  an orphan work.  Close enough.  Yeah.  Well, it seems highly unlikely that somebody's going to come along and say, no, I own it.  And, that means even if, if nobody does that, you can sing it with impunity until such time  as somebody has the, you know, says, oh yeah, I own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just reinforces though how, like, if this had not happened, that song would have been  in copyright protection until 2030.  Yeah.  Because of?  This was originally registered in 1935.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of Mickey Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, Mickey Mouse, as everybody knows, was created in 1927.  Walt Disney stole him from some, from another mouse that was created a year earlier, as  was Disney's want.  As soon as he makes a movie, now we own Cinderella, baby.  It's ours.  Forget those brothers Grimm.  And, they've been going, every time that copyrighted Mickey Mouse was about to expire, they've  gone to Congress with a bag of money and extended it.  The last time they extended it was with the help of Sonny Bono.  It's called the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act.  So, that takes us to 2030.  So, we don't have to worry about it for a while.  Save your money.  Save your Mickey dollars, Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, the one thing that this, the one thing that this decision does is it prevents us  from being subjected to the custom happy birthday songs that every restaurant has.  Happy birthday, happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they do that in Canada too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every restaurant, and movies, it's so stupid.  They sing, he's a jolly good fellow, like anybody would actually sing that.  Just pay the $1,500.  For crying out loud, you're making a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you gotten anything, the Getty threatening letters, have you gotten anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  No.  Why?  We missed out on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We missed out on the rundown.  The Getty is now going after photos, and there's various cases about how to respond and…

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, Getty images is a stock image.  Huge.  One of the biggest stock image firms.  And, these say that, what, you're using a Getty image, but they have to prove you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  using it.  Just Google Getty threatening letters, and the first link is an instruction letter, what  to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the one hour professor, Ron Stefan Stefanski.  But, why would you get this letter if you didn't use an image?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's one case I saw, again, this is third hand, so who knows, one case I saw  where somebody's blog, they've gotten a handout photo from a publicist for a person  or something.  They put that photo up, and then apparently Getty had bought that collection and said,  no, no, no, no, we own that photo.  That's legit, they own the photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because they were given the photo for purposes of publication, publication.  So, then after the fact, years later, we're told, no, no, no, not only do you have to  take it down, we're going to go after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're saying it's retroactive.  Hey, wait a minute, we did…  Hey, Lisa, did we ever get…  I think we did get a…  I think we paid it.  Really?  I think we did.  Yes, it was for the Tech Guy Labs website.  One of our editors had used an image, can't remember the provenance, but we got a letter  from Getty and we just paid it.  It wasn't that much, it was like $600, $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but this is like copyright trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, they may not actually own that.  I was suspicious when I first saw it, but what we did is we searched the Getty site  and we found it.  But what you're saying is it may well have been a legitimate use, but retroactively copyrighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem, of course, is that we know that the system of trying to find provenance on photos  is nigh on what's possible.  Somebody can put it up on a sharing service and mark the licenses for reuse and you try to be  the good citizen and you use it.  Do they have the provenance?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, ever since we have made sure that we only use licensed stuff from Shutterstock,  I guess Lisa's not around because I'm pretty sure we just paid it.  And we said, don't do that again.  Here's your Shutterstock license.  Let's take a break.  We come back.  Numbers, tips and all of that.  We'll wrap this puppy up.  Can I throw one in before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just a little note.  Neil McGrath Tyson interviewed Edward Snowden.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that?  I did.  And fascinating little thing is that Snowden's argument was that we may not be able to find  aliens because there's an inevitability, he says, to encryption.  You start with open communication.  At some point, you're going to shut it down and that the best encryption is indistinguishable  from noise.  So the noise we hear in outer space could be aliens.  We won't know.  And vice versa.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That we just that space noise that we hear could be containing data, but we'd never know  because it's encrypted.  Could be porn.  Might be worth trying to decrypt it.  I think alien porn might have a market.  Alien porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see there was a video up this week?  I forget, Bashmore or somebody showed people, just nice, normal people in the park.  Porn VR helmets.  Oh, yeah.  People were going nuts for it.  Absolutely nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I saw that video, I thought, okay, this is going to be...  I have some if you want to watch.  No, thanks.  It could be a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any cardboard porn?  Yeah.  Really?  You can use it on cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  The problem with cardboard is you need two hands to hold it like that.  So I have the Gear VR, which straps under your head, leaving your hands free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, that's a bad visual.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the ad?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I as a exercise, because I did think, I mean, this is, I mean, nobody talks about  this, but clearly this could be a very big market.  And I noted that a number of well-known porn publishing companies were already doing VR  porn.  It's not very well done.  It's not very well done.  Oh, you've seen it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I saw the video that was referenced where they showed people in the park experiencing  it for the first time.  And the thing that everybody was surprised about is that in this VR version of porn,  you're one of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, it's point of view.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's like having relations with another person and where that person's head would  be is your camera.  So it's as if it's a point of view.  It turns out that's kind of not that great.  And then where they're shooting it, they need better cameras.  They're not really immersive.  I'll stop right there.  I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying they need to work somewhere.  If they had that theta, I'm telling you they could do something.  Yeah.  I'm going to I am going to do a 360 degree video blog with as soon as this theta comes,  because I think this is fascinating.  And in fact, in December, we're going on the anthem of the seas, which is this insane  high tech cruise ship that was just launched by Royal Caribbean, because it's you open  the door with your iPhone.  I mean, everything is technology.  They have a robot bartender.  Yeah.  And also that one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has the further for the for the if you're in steerage, they give you the LCD screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of the if you don't have a window, they put a high def 4K screen out there and you actually  see and they have red cameras on the deck shooting the water.  They actually do a virtual balcony.  So it looks like it's your balcony and it looks very realistic.  Yeah.  It's really kind of amazing.  Yeah.  So yeah.  So anyway, that is where I'm going to bring the theta and you're going to get 360 degree  views.  It'll make you sick as a dog.  Later, I really can't wait to get this data as I hope the quality is decent because you  can post it now on YouTube and Facebook.  When you expecting it?  It's pretty soon.  I think I just actually I'll check while I'm doing the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, 349.  It's not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I already I ordered it the minute I saw it was available.  You know why?  Dicty Bartolo, our Gizwiz showed because he was at the event where they announced it and  they took him out in Times Square.  It's incredible.  You're looking around in time.  You're in Times Square.  It's amazing.  And if you put a one of the VR helmets on it, you literally are looking around.  Yeah.  You can watch it on YouTube or Facebook with your key.  That's not as good.  Hey, let me tell you about zip recruiter.com and then we'll get our final words on the  show.  Zip recruiter is a solution for a problem a lot of you have if you're hiring.  Of course, hiring is the most important thing you do in a business.  I am not kidding.  The people you hire are going to form the character of that business as long as they  work for you.  It's important to hire the right people, people who get the job done, but people who support  your culture, your ethos.  And thank goodness we've got the Internet because job sites really do make it easier  to reach a much larger audience.  But which job site?  Which one do you use?  There are more than 100.  And how?  And by the way, you wouldn't want to use 100, right?  Because can you imagine getting phone calls from every Tom, Dick and Harry and all the  emails?  I got a better idea.  It's Zip Recruiter.  It's awesome.  You do post to every job board, 100 plus job boards with a single click.  You also post to Twitter and Craigslist, all the social sites.  You also get matched as soon as you use it with six million current resumes.  So within a day, you're going to start getting applicants and good applicants.  But here's the deal.  You don't have to answer a phone call.  You don't have to answer an email.  It all rolls into the Zip Recruiter interface where you can quickly rank them, rate them  and hire the right person fast.  It's really nice.  Really nice.  We've used it here and been very happy.  Zip Recruiter, 400,000 businesses have used Zip Recruiter.  Got an email from Lisa, not my Lisa, another Lisa said, I'm a business owner.  I'm a novice when it comes to navigating job boards and searching for qualified candidates  for my company.  This morning, another near catastrophe that I avoided.  And thanks to a customer service agent by the name of Jed at Zip Recruiter.  He not only helped me out, but he went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.  For that, I am grateful and I would recommend Zip Recruiter to anyone.  Great customer service.  A really incredible product.  And you can try it right now free for the first four days at ZipRecruiter.com slash  twig.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  If you're doing the hiring, you owe it to yourself to use the best tool out there.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  Matt, you got anything you want to share with us?  An idea, a tip, a demo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was trying to think of something that I don't have any of the cool stuff that you  guys have, but mostly because none of it works in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know you poor fellow.  You've got a box and play the guitar and that's about it for an interview.  They have those great accents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I do, have I mentioned AirDroid before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember.  No, I know what it is and I love it.  Maybe there's a better tool, but I found it when I was trying to get, I think I was trying  to get something off my Nexus and I was looking for an easy way to connect the Nexus to the  computer.  AirDroid, it actually just keeps getting better.  They added a whole bunch of new features.  So you log in at web.airdroid.com and basically get access to your phone and you can move  files around.  You can get instant messages on your desktop that have shown up on your phone.  So if you leave your phone somewhere else, you don't want to miss a text message.  I've used it for a whole bunch of different things.  I haven't seen it written about a lot, but it's a great tool.  At least I find it for sort of getting access to stuff on your phone easily from your desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've used it for years.  You know, there's no wires.  It uses Wi-Fi.  It's great.  I love AirDroid.  Yeah.  And it just works.  It's free, right?  I've never paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's nice.  AirDroid, AirDroid, A-I-R-D-R-O-I-D dot com.  And now Jeff Jarvis has the latest numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we'll do a number.  I'll do two real quick.  One is we should note that Instagram hit 400 billion.  Yeah.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still love Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people laughed at Zuck when he bought it.  And there's pictures on Zuck's Facebook page of him walking on the bar on the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a deal after the WhatsApp sale.  Everybody realized a billion is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ben Thompson and I were talking about it.  He mentioned that he thought that was one of the best tech acquisitions of all time.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ben says that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other number just to mention is related to our earlier discussion about what happens to advertising.  eMarketer says that the social advertising spend hit 25.1 billion this year.  Facebook gets 16.3 billion of that.  To Matthew's earlier point, a lot of this money is going to go away anyway from what we now consider advertising  toward what we think of as social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And podcasts.  I just thought I'd throw that in.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to point out to anybody who's trying to reach an intelligent geek audience, there's nothing better than an ad on Twitter.  And it can't be blocked.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  What's your pick of the week, Mr. Mike Elgin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I want to recommend an app called Instant.  Now, there are a bunch of trackers for lots of different things, including quantified self things for your physical activity.  There are other trackers that keep track of where you go.  This looks good.  This single app tracks it all.  And so it'll track how long you're at work, how long you're at home, how many minutes a day you spend on Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp or whatever.  It tracks how much you've run, how much you've walked, how much you spend in a car driving, everything.  Just you turn it on and it tracks everything.  And with one app, you can delete all the other apps.  And with this one app, you can just sort of track what you do.  It quantifies everything that can be quantified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it where do I, how do I, what the...  It goes on your phone?  It goes on your Android phone.  How do I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you go to InstantApp.today.  You'd have to put it on everything, right?  Well, you can, you know, you just put it on your phone and it keeps track.  There's also a Mac version for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because if you want to know what apps you've used and everything, you have to put on everything that you would use.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They also have a brand new iOS version and a Blackberry 10 version.  But this on an Android device is a great way to just keep track of where you go, how much exercise you get, how much time you spend doing this, that, and the other thing.  It's fun to just let it go.  And I love these that you don't have to launch it.  You just launch it once.  And then when you get curious, when you want to know something, then you go and you can check out the history.  It's watching you all the time.  That's right. You can you can surveil yourself.  Go surveil yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some in-app purchases, it looks like.  I don't know what those would be, but I like this idea.  Yeah, that's a nice interface, too.  Yeah, because your phone really is a fitness tracker.  It actually does a very good job.  As long as you keep it on you.  Yeah, folks, I think we're going to wrap this up.  I thank Jeff Jarvis for making the effort to get here on time.  We appreciate it.  He's now on FaceTime, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my pocket didn't crash, so I'm now on my Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nice. That's cool. I don't care.  BuzzMachine.com, follow him on Google+.  And of course, read his great books, the latest of which is Geeks Bearing Gifts.  And it's on Amazon, as all his books are.  Just search for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Out in German. Out in German now.  And you pronounce that?  I don't know how they came up with a new title.  Oh, OK.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, we'll see you next week. Thank you.  Have fun at ONA.  Thanks to Matthew Ingram.  He's from Fortune.com. We love Matthew and his canoes.  And always glad to have you on.  Have a great afternoon. I appreciate you being here.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Mike Yelgin, our news director. You can see him Monday through Friday.  On TNT Tech News today, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern Time, 1700 UTC.  That's right.  And we'll be back Thursday. I'll be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tomorrow. Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. for the Oculus event.  That's tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  No, it's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Thursday.  What day is tomorrow?  Thursday.  Oh, tomorrow.  Yes.  This is an actual reality, not just virtual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually. Is this real reality?  Tomorrow, 10 a.m., we'll be doing it. I'll be there for that.  Yes.  And we have some great guests as well.  Oculus Rift is big at an event.  Huh?  Is this real life?  I don't know. I'm confused.  This is Wednesday?  Then I'd better get out of here.  I think so. I think so.  I'm Leo Laporte. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you next time.  This week at Google. Bye-bye.
