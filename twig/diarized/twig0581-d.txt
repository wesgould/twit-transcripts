There's Ant Pruitt, Ant the man, Pruitt from  Hands On Photography, Hands On Wellness. It's good to see you, Ant. Thank you for giving me back my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GoPro. Oh, man. Was that hard? It was a lot of fun. Yeah. I debated on holding it just a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  longer. Just ask for it anytime you need it. It's kind of the company. It'll be the company GoPro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of fun. They told you what happened to my old GoPro. 240 frames per second. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My old GoPro, when I got the Tesla, they stuck it to the side of the car with a suction cup  to get the video as you're driving down. It fell off and then a pickup truck behind me immediately  drove over and flattened it. And then Jerry told me, I didn't know this. He said, I still have the  pieces. You could send it to them for trade in value. Wow. I didn't know that. One of my favorite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  parts of your broadcast of the Apple thing was when you gasped when you saw a phone  stuck below a truck going over rough terrain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God. Yeah. They must've had a hundred new iPhone 12s that they just gave to this  filmmaker because they were dusting sand off. Yeah. It's like, Oh my God, it's awful. But the  video looked amazing and it's worth it for Apple because it makes every putzer like me go, Oh,  I can't wait till my video looks like that. And then we all we all weep into our beer when we  realize, Oh, there's a little more to it than just having a phone. Just, just a little bit.  Oh, that's Stacy Higginbotham. Good to see you Stacy from the great Pacific Northwest  host of Stacy on iot.com. Hello. Hello. So yeah, so Apple did have an event yesterday. Did it make  you say, Oh, I don't, I'm not going to buy a pixel five. I'm going to get an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the reviews about the pixel five made me say, I am not going to buy a pixel five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You were saying the camera reviews were pretty negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they just were negative in that they were like, look, this phone, there's no real,  what was end gadget had a, the most kind of it covered everything. It was basically like,  this phone is fine, but the camera kind of, it doesn't compete with any of the others. So why  would you do this? It seems like Google's losing interest. Yeah. There's stuff that was worse than

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the earlier cameras or just that they were disappointed. They hadn't made no progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Same sensor, same background software. Yes. And gadgets subhead was, yep, it's basically what  we were expecting. And they matched my, my sense that Google just almost gave up. I don't think  they give up, but I think that in a way this is maybe what we wanted, right, Jeff, we want them  to go back to Nexus days, make a cheap, relatively inexpensive, pure Google phone. It didn't have to  be the best thing in the world. It didn't have to be a flagship. This does not compete with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  flagship phones. What would you say the Android flagship is now then Samsung? Not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the best Android. I think one plus does a pretty good job with their version of Android. So does  Motorola. I think is a pretty pure Android phone. That might be a better one to look at as a  Motorola. People like LG. I don't know how, I don't know how pure the Android is in LG. What do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  use Stacey? I have the three a and I'm not upgrading. Yeah. Although the tiny iPhone 12,  is it the iPhone 12 mini? Yeah. That in the blue color. My wife is so happy. She's been waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for so long. I've been trying to get her to a phone for years. That thing, the phone she has  is steam powered and 20 years old now. She has a little iPhone, right? And she's just been insistent.  I'm not getting a phone told it's the same size. Like it's not going to happen. It's not going to  happen. Of course she's always right. And she's right. So she's finally going to order an iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  mini 12 mini. Okay. Now I feel bad because I was very sexist Stacey, you can punch me,  but I did kind of think, and I said it out loud, but I apologize immediately that maybe it was  aimed at women who wanted a smaller phone. Perhaps I think, I mean, say, I mean, are there men?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My husband is a man who wants the smaller phone. Some guys want a smaller phone too. Yeah. Look,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  here in general, we have smaller hands, right? Smaller hands and no pockets or pockets are small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I mean, you can stick any size phone in a purse, but you know, well, and that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Rosemary orchard said on Mac break weekly yesterday. She said, well, I don't have pockets,  so I'm going to put it in my clutch. So it doesn't really matter. I'm going to get the biggest phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. See, so really it's kind of what Kevin created this category of way back in the day of,  are you a one-handed or a two-handed phone user? And maybe that like, I'm definitely a one-handed

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  phone user. Right. So yes, I don't really care. And what do you think? Now you've got giant hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have giant hands, but I had some, a pair of britches that I guess you can call them skinny  jeans or whatever that I wore just recently. And you know, I have the pixel for Excel and trying  to use those pockets was a bit of a pain in the butt with this large phone. So maybe it's not  necessarily for the ladies, but it's definitely a smaller phone for the smaller pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been seven years, ant, since the New York times put out this quiz, how y'all use and you guys  talk and it, I want you to, is britches on it? Possibly. I really want you to take this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just realized I said britches. You did. I love it. I love it. But you know, in a way I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  celebrating, I think regionalisms are fantastic. I was very shocked. I took this test the other day,  somehow it's coming back up again and the people are talking about it. I took this test the other  day and it said, you're from Providence, Boston or Worcester. I left there in 1971, but they nailed  it. Lisa took it. She said, you're from rural California, Stockton, Fresno, nailed it. So I  want you to take this. Where is it again? What's it called? It's just, if you Google a New York  Times and how you guys talk or I did dialect test and found it. How would you address a group,  and let's just do the first one because this is the title. It's only 25 questions. How would  you address a group of two or more people? You all use, you lot, you guys, you ones, yins, you other  or y'all? Y'all. Y'all. See, I said you guys. No. What would you say, Stacey? Y'all. Y'all. Oh,  because you're from Texas. Really? Y'all never heard me say this. Well, what's interesting is  standard English, standard American English does not have a collective noun like y'all.  Actually, James McWhorter talks about this in his books. You all, so we don't have, French has it.  Most languages have it. We don't have a collective noun. That's why you guys, or yous, yous guys,  or y'all. I think y'all is pretty good actually. I'm a weirdo because I don't put the apostrophe

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in it. It's just y'all. Y'all. No, you need the apostrophe. Y'all. I just have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  take this test, aunt, and tell us where you come from. Sure. Because I bet you it'll nail,  I was shocked. They would probably say Idaho. Idaho? That's where they say britches, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I went to three elementary schools, four elementary schools in three states and four  high schools in three states. So I'm hoping that I confuse it. You might be, I was stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Says you're either from Providence, Boston, or Worcester. It's like, what? How did you know?  It's like Henry Higgins or something. Anyway, back to the, back to technology. Where were we?  The iPhone. Sorry. I have to say, and this one I'm going to defer to you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am the- Wait, but I've just finished the quiz. You can't ask me. Oh, go ahead. Oh, god. We got

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to pause. It's the law. It takes a little while. Go ahead if you want. I'll tell you what,  I'll set this up and then we'll go to you. Cause you- I'm on 24 and 25. You're more of an expert  on 5G. I have been very skeptical about 5G as saying, as many have heard, I think it's a  marketing term. I don't, you know, some people say, well, it's like LTE. It took a while,  but eventually we all got, you know, some sort of high speed 4G LTE connection and really did live  up to its hype. I'm wondering if it's more like LTE or more like, maybe you remember this, Ymax,  which was a highly hyped technology sprint jumped on it and turned out to be a complete flop.  Ymax was going to transform rural internet. It was going to bring high speed to everywhere. I mean,  it was- Those were the days. It was a technical disaster. I don't think 5G is a technical  disaster. I think the problem is there's three 5Gs in the world. There's what T-Mobile has been  running, rolling out and Verizon just announced yesterday, they're going to roll it out big time  too. The low band 5G, which is a roughly 600 megahertz, that goes through walls. It's like  a regular cell phone signal. It's good, but it's not anything special. It's not the low latency  and the high speed of what we think of as 5G. Then there on the other end of the scale,  there's millimeter wave 5G, which only goes 800 feet. So you have to put in four times more  towers. It bounces off of everything, including raindrops. So conditions really will vary with it.  It can be incredibly fast, up to four gigabits, but that's really going to be limited. In fact,  initial Verizon rollouts were inside of buildings for businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were also for residential. They're doing it so they don't have to deploy fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's better than fiber if it's 4G. I also would point out, because there's a lot of hype now,  nonstop advertising, I would point out that you'll always see ideal conditions.  Among other things, not merely ideal weather conditions and ideal distance from the cell tower,  it's also how many people are using it. At least for now, no one's using it. Now that everybody's  going to start having 5G phones, you may find that those ideal conditions degrade very rapidly.  LTE was super fast as long as no one else was using that cell tower. So it's going to depend  a lot on how much provisioning they provide to each cell tower. The reason this came up for me  is the Apple event yesterday. Here's a super cut from YouTube. Somebody took all of the 5Js

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and edited them together. Today we're bringing 5G to iPhone. 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us. Stay safe and have a great day.  So there were one more time. That's hilarious. That's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was bugging the hell out of me. By the way, it was great.  I should give him, and I just closed it, but it was a, you know, it's a YouTube.  Let me see if I can quickly get the history and reopen it.  You're right, because that's a lot of work.  And I actually, I asked, I said on the show, somebody's got to do a YouTube super cut of 5G.  And it didn't take too long. So thank you, whoever did that. Let me give you credit.  I'll go to his page. The truth about 5G and it is uploaded.  No, that's not it. No, that's not it. That's not the super cut.  Oh no. What's the matter? Where do you come from, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no. I was like, you did such a great job vamping that, you know, I finished the quiz and got bored.  It's wrong. It's wrong.  Yeah. So wrong. Mine says I came from Irving, which, okay, that's at least in Texas.  That's Texas.  But the other two cities that are most like me are in Arizona, Tempe and Chandler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you're a, you know, a Southern girl.  So I am Irving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Irving, Texas.  Back in Rouge and Brownsville. I've been in Texas like twice in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a Texan. We have such a way.  I think part of it is if you say the words, there's a couple.  There's some giveaways. I said bubbler and that's a giveaway for a water fountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a dead giveaway. You had to come from there.  Well, I didn't get a question about water fountain.  No, they're not all the same. They rotate.  No, no, no. It's only five questions, but they rotate. There's different ones.  I did get my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you call it?  A water fountain.  It's a water fountain.  But when it's raining and the sun is shining, that's one of their like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I have no word for that. What is the word for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, sure as the devil beating his wife. That was offensive.  So that's what my dad calls it.  You're kidding!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Really?  But we call it a sun shower.  But my dad, for a long time, I was like, what the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The devil beating his wife again.  That's when it's raining, but the sun comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We used to run... When that would happen, my family would say, okay, the devil is beating his wife.  And you know, because if you go outside and run around the house three times,  put your ear down to the ground, you hear it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not making this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, my dad would tell you the same thing.  Wow. Wow. I never heard of that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is a cultural moment for me.  By the way, Levin Hare, L-E-V-I-N-H-E-R-R, did the super cut.  And the comment that he leaves is, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.  That's the description.  Yeah. So thank you, Levin. I appreciate it.  Levin, good work. Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get a life, Levin, but good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  55 seconds out of the one hour event devoted to the word 5G.  And a lot of Verizon 5G.  I really felt like a Verizon ad.  It feels a little bit markety to me.  But Stacey...  A little bit.  Maybe I'm just...  What did Jeff say in response to that?  What did you say, Jeff?  You said you made fun of me for not...  For which?  For not buying into the 5G hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, that was...  Who needs a color television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what you said. Who needs a color television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who needs a color television? Black and white is just fine.  I can tell Lucy is Lucy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My dad said that for my whole childhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can still see it.  I have to confess that even as a young fart,  I said HDTV I don't think is going to take off.  Too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But let us be clear.  There are technologies that really don't work.  3D TVs.  Can you buy one anymore?  No.  I'm wondering if VR is really just a hype and not going to launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm going to sacrifice my number this week.  You're going to be at the top of the scale right now.  Somebody said in the video that he was stuck inside for the pandemic.  He had nothing better to do.  So he analyzed 25 years of Gartner hype cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so he just saw that some things stay on forever.  That something is going to work.  One year wonders and they come and go.  That was like a lot of them.  It was like a third of them or more.  And so 5G is...  Well, there won't be a 5G hype cycle for America.  So 5G is...  Well, what was the last one that really mattered?  Was it 3G versus...  4G.  Okay, just stop.  No, not the last one we did.  The last one that mattered.  4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  LTE mattered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'll tell you why, I'm mad.  Go ahead.  Stacey can do it.  But I mean, it isn't just high speed.  It also...  We used to be, remember, GSM versus CDMA?  And we used to do that and do voice over LTE.  And it completely unified the nation's networks.  So that was a huge transformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a big one.  5G just...  Bigger, faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a big deal.  Nope.  I'm going to tell you why.  So, on the consumer side, honestly, I don't think we should...  5G will help.  But there's not a compelling reason to move to 5G just yet on the consumer side.  Unless you happen to live in one of the areas where you could doubt...  Like, where you have a lot of people.  If you live on Race Street...  On 11th Street in Philadelphia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say you should absolutely get a millimeter wave 5G phone.  It'll be amazing.  But, I do think for industry, it's important.  Because it will bring wireless into factory floors.  In a way that have never been available to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that once you have a 5G, you can get wireless into factory floors.  And that's what we're doing.  And I think that's a big one.  And I think that's a big one.  And I think that's a big one.  And I think that's a big one.  And I think that's a big one.  I'm confident on the board that, most importantly, we move quickly now that this is happening.  I'm confident on the board that, most importantly, we move quickly now that this is happening.  And that's why we keep that wireless function available to us.  And that, once you eliminate wires almost all the time, in cases where we don't get it out.  Beautiful, but unfortunately, now we never get to buy new office accessories or power supplies.  Several reasons, within companies.  The Marketing Network is telling us about their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Marketing Network, according to amry.  They tell you the most sour blocking between you and your Armenian clients.  Basically, this is more secure than that stupid Wi-Fi access point at the coffee shop.  Well, of course...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, every new standard, they improve things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can add new security encryption plans to, protocols, not plans, to a new GSMA standard.  OK, but I am going to point out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That they will still use the easily hackable cell phone radios in these phones.  That they will still use the easily hackable cell phone radios in these phones.  Which, I mean, everybody knows how to hack the 7SS.  And they never have fixed it, and they never will fix it.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's a problem.  Which radio are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to look it up now, it's been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, for the most part, are you talking about hacking a SIM?  No.  Or are you talking about the baseband?  The baseband.  I'm talking about hacking baseband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm talking about hacking baseband.  And it is well known, and the problem is...  Nobody's fixing it.  So, a smartphone is not going to be secure.  A millimeter wave access point, you could say, probably is more secure, sure.  But baseband zero days have been around forever.  And they don't want to fix it, because everything relies on it.  Everything relies on it.  They can't, basically.  And it's this...  I want to say...  Oh, who did we lose? Anybody?  Ants?  Ants frozen, yeah, ants internet's going up and down.  Anyway, so, a cell phone itself is probably not super secure.  That's one of the reasons SIM jacking happens, you know?  Well, so, there's a couple things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, so I'm looking at your baseband processor hacks.  Most of those stories are from like 10 years ago.  Yeah, but they were never fixed.  But those baseband processors, the ones we were using in 2011, are no longer in use.  But I see a zero day from 2017.  I haven't read any of this, so I can't speak to that.  But, we're not talking about the baseband processors or the processors.  We're just talking about the ability to get into the cell phone network.  It's much easier to get inside a Wi-Fi network that then has all of your corporate secrets or whatnot.  But if you attach something to a cellular network, you have to hack into the cellular network to get to that device,  is the theory that the people buying cellular connections are working from.  They're also way easier to get a device online and keep it online.  And less trouble for stuff in the field.  Wi-Fi is not great for that.  And depending on the way you've set up your network,  it's also a little bit more reliable compared to Wi-Fi.  Now Wi-Fi is getting, and there's some really cool technology that none of y'all probably care about,  but it's called time sensitive networking.  And it is going to help make Wi-Fi way more reliable in terms of packet management that cellular carriers can already offer.  But the point is 5G.  Is it a big deal?  The answer is 100% yes.  But what you were saying about there being like five different kinds or three different kinds of 5G is totally accurate.  And I think when you talk about 5G, you have to explain what kind you're talking about.  And that depends on where it is in the spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's a bit of a problem because people are just promoting 5G.  And when it comes down to it, it's really more complicated than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Stacey, you are differentiating between a consumer view and a corporate view of 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how big a deal is corporate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How big a deal is consumer?  Eventually it will be a big deal in consumer.  And I say this because if we had stopped innovating and like moving down the process node for semiconductors,  or if we had said, you know what, having internet connections that are 10 megabits per second, that's plenty.  You have to keep moving here because we're going to get new applications.  I don't really know the killer.  I don't think there's going to be one, but I don't know what that's going to be for 5G.  We were lucky when LTE came around.  We actually knew what the killer app was.  And that was the iPhone.  And we were all like, because we were on these 3G networks with these smartphones, we're like, damn it, I need more connectivity.  For 5G, we're going to find something, probably several somethings.  And we don't know what that is on the consumer side yet.  You can't just sit and be like, we're good.  This is good technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I understand.  But I think it's also our duty, my duty anyway, to say some, not all technologies are good.  And not all technologies work.  You've been saying that a lot lately.  Well, I sniff a little BS in all of this.  This works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what you sniff is, there isn't a super compelling reason for anyone to give up a lot of money to pay for the radios and the internet.  Or the radios and their devices yet.  Or take the battery hit.  And even the carriers who are upgrading to 5G are kind of like, they're a little desperate.  Because this is the first upgrade we're going to see on the carrier side that they don't have a super large demand for.  And it's complicated as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So my phone, you're saying, is the biggest differentiator on my phone will be that the bandwidth is better, it's faster bandwidth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lower latency, faster bandwidth on your phone, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so we're going to need some new applications to take advantage of that.  Like Chris Rock said in the ad, oh now I can download an album in a second.  But he also said it used to take longer to download that album than the length of the album.  That was a long time ago.  It hasn't been that long.  5G is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Verizon is actually putting 5G for in-home broadband.  They're offering 5G for in-home public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't trust Verizon as far as I can spit.  So that's problem number one.  In fact, none of the carriers I trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Other operators are doing the same thing.  And so it may be that for areas, and not super rural areas, because you still need backhaul to the internet.  They're not going to put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This will be best as with almost everything else in highly dense cities.  Except, millimeter wave doesn't work well in highly dense cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It works well.  What happens is the infrastructure looks like web pass.  So you're going to have a tower that will beam to a satellite dish or something.  It's not a satellite dish.  But think of it as a satellite dish on the outside of the building.  And then that's going to be converted to a Wi-Fi signal in the building or to a local layer.  But that's great.  Well, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not going to matter to my phone, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's nice.  That doesn't matter.  The point is connectivity.  Eventually we're going to stop thinking about connectivity as wired or wireless.  And we're also going to stop thinking about it eventually as cellular or unlicensed.  The cellular guys don't want that to happen.  But that is going to happen.  So we're going to be walking around with ubiquitous connectivity.  And we're going to have devices who are capable of tapping into not all devices, but our smarter devices with batteries,  like bigger batteries, are going to be able to select from the most economical or the most useful for the workload we're doing.  And that's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just so distant and so speculative.  It's here today!  Well, but wait a minute.  Because you're buying, okay, so you're spending $100 more for an iPhone.  This, by the way, the iPhone does not have a fingerprint reader, which is something we could use today.  Because guess why?  This place where you would put that fingerprint reader, that's the window for millimeter wave.  So you're putting a technology in this phone that is, you know, every phone is a decision between technologies  that maybe someday will be useful in this phone, or some guy in Philly can use it on Race Street and 12th.  But is not going to be widely useful.  It's going to cost $100 more.  I really have to question the wisdom of doing that.  I just, I guess if you're buying a phone for future proofing in three years or maybe five years, you'll be glad you have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Phones are the only form factor that will help, that are wide enough and people adopt,  and they may ignore that $100 pricing to get this sort of technology to the economies of scale we need.  To the economies of scale we need to put it in other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to predict Apple, now it's hard to say because Apple is very good at marketing,  but I'm going to predict this is a phone that a lot of people go, yeah, I don't need it.  Because Apple has pushed it so much that it's a 5G phone.  And people are just going to say, okay, that's fine.  I'll wait next year.  Maybe I'll get one next year.  Were you lusting it all after it, Mr. Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, actually now with people not making this much money, they're rethinking these purchases and saying,  you know what, I can still make my Zoom calls and things like that with this existing tech.  There's no need to spend an extra thousand dollars for a spectrum that I'm never going to see for quite a while anyway.  So, it just makes sense to hold on to what you got.  And this also made me think about, from a marketing standpoint,  which just seems to be the way a lot of these companies are doing this bit of a marketing fallacy, if you will.  It reminds me of Canon with the R5 and how it was being marketed as this super duper video camera.  Yes, it shoots 8K video, but it's not necessarily designed to shoot 8K videos.  It's designed to be more of a hybrid and a photography camera.  But they were just pushing 8K, 8K, 8K and everything.  And of course, it came back and bit them in the butt with all of their overheating issues.  And now look at this and watched our live coverage yesterday.  And I had to just step away because it was frustrating me because I know this 5G is not going to be around here anytime soon.  It's going to be worth a dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask this.  Should somebody buy a 4A or a 4A 5G?  4A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably a 4A.  Unless they know they have 5G capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My map says I've got 5G out here.  I just checked mine.  I've got two megs up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Smoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So would 5G then be better?  Is it maybe a better installation or is it the same tower?  Well, the tower is not the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the 5G is, it's a processing protocol.  So it's the way the data is crammed into the airwaves.  So your tower will be able to handle both because it will have receivers for both.  So they don't mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But clearly I'm too far away from the tower for my LTE.  Will 5G be any different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's your carrier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AT&T.  In their former headquarters tower, I might add.  So their 5G is an actually 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're talking about AT&T's 5G which is really 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So yeah, don't worry about that.  I'm not doing a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My big question, I've got to ask you later, but I've got to go ahead and buy the Chromebook.  So I'll make your advice in a few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, did you see the $300 deal on the Pixelbook Go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was the i7 one, which I don't really need.  Even I, Chromebook fan, I don't need.  It was $200, dude.  But it's still $200 more than the i5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But was this a Prime Day deal?  I think it was, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's still on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's $13.99 down to $11.99.  Oh, it's $200 off.  I thought it was a $200.  Oh, I thought it was for $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, no, you're right.  That's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, Mr. Dermis, I got you.  Well, and I wanted to hear your views on the show.  I'll come back to the Chromebook.  But were you lusting at all after the iPhone 12 Pro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At first, no.  And I'm sorry about my video acting weird again.  Skype doesn't like me today.  But at first, I wasn't lusting over it.  But when they said HDR, in 10-bit, for video, that's pretty strong.  Oh, the cameras look great.  And again, but we're still talking about a tiny sensor.  So there's a lot of different variables that you have to consider with these tiny sensors  as far as how much light you're going to need around there.  Well, that's one thing that is interesting on the Pro anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Apple did not do a great job of distinguishing the iPhone 12 from the 12 Pro.  But the Pro anyway, the sensor is now bigger.  It's 1.7 microns per pixel, which is a fairly big pixel.  That means a lot of light gathering.  And the wide angle is f1.6.  Again, really nice aperture.  That means a lot of light gathering.  In addition to all the computational stuff they're doing for low light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's what's going to be the killer feature is the fact that it's computational  to help correct a lot of things that it physically cannot.  Because some people are going to assume they can shoot a 4K video on their regular camera body  and compare it to the phone and think it's going to look the same.  It's not.  It's just physics is different there.  But I like what Apple is doing from a computational side.  And plus all of this is written on their own chip.  So it's probably going to be pretty dank sweet if you know what you're doing.  This is the constant conundrum if you're an Apple iPhone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, should I spend $1,000 more or less to have the newest phone or should I wait a year or two?  Someone asked me on Twitter yesterday about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I said, you know, it would be fine if all I wanted was the camera.  But it's $1,200 just for the camera.  I'd rather spend that $1,200 on say something like this.  This S5 here.  Something like that.  But if it's just the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Leo, was Leo, hold on man, was Leo being heretical when he said soon you're not going to need an SLR?  Is that a hype cycle or is that, do you see a day without an SLR?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  We're going to always have those.  Yeah, we're going to always have those larger sensor sizes because they just add a different sense of depth.  And then you have lenses that you can attach to those sensors that you can't attach to a phone.  So yeah, we're going to always have big camera bodies of some sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say though on him, on my next trip in about eight, nine years, whenever I get to go out.  I would probably with the old folks home.  Yeah, maybe my next trip to the old folks home.  My next trip to the old folks home.  I would maybe consider, because it is a pain to carry a big kit and all the lenses and all that stuff.  And yeah, you get a better shot.  But if, how good is good enough is the question.  And if you can get really good, adequately good pictures from a camera phone that you're going to carry anyway.  It starts to look pretty appealing, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will say this, the average person would probably enjoy that GoPro Hero 9 Black that we just reviewed on Hands On Tech this past Monday.  It looks pretty good.  And that's pretty small.  That's a little pocketful.  Yeah, it's small.  It's something to carry around pretty easily.  And if there's people that want to do their whole vlogging or whatever, it's easy to hold and it's not heavy or anything like that.  And it's going to look pretty daggum good.  I'm not going to say it's going to be a cinematic masterpiece, but it's going to look good for what most people want to do.  And then you have the built-in stabilization.  Just go watch the review.  Yeah, do watch the review of Hands On Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll be watching it because I got it back from you.  Don't listen to me. Go watch the review.  Here's some pictures from Apple shot on the iPhone.  And some traditionally difficult.  Now, as somebody, I think it was you, Ant, pointed out, what they don't tell you is, you know, this guy, he's a little bit of a guy.  What they don't tell you is, you know, this guy, the photographer has $1,200 worth of lights.  Lights. Always. They never mention that.  They don't mention that.  You can tell that because you can see out the door and the outside where it's very bright is perfectly exposed.  So is the inside.  So clearly there's fill lights.  You know, I mean, you know, so you can't really judge.  But the low light performance.  That looks good. That's computational.  That's computational because you see how bright the neon sign is on the right.  He's this guy sitting in front of the motel is sitting under a bright light.  But yet we still see detail in this.  I don't think is professionally lit the the macadam on the parking lot ahead of him.  But you still see detail in that.  That would be normally very dark with these two bright spots and noisy.  Yeah. Yeah, that's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a regionalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What macadam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First, it's macadam.  Second, it's blacktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Asphalt.  Asphalt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like macadam.  I think that really does pinpoint me from Worcester.  Here's another one with neon and another skateboarder.  Apparently they love skateboarders.  These Apple guys do.  This is also hard.  As anybody knows, who's looked at neon from from the outside said, oh, I'd love to get a picture of that.  Right, Ant?  That's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it usually blows it out.  Are you going to get all neon or none of the neon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And this is perfect, right?  And then this is a portrait.  You know, that's the other thing is that the selfie camera is going to have many of these features as well, which is the first.  These will be the best looking selfies anybody's ever taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They took a page out of the Samsung Playbook.  Yes, Samsung.  Samsung puts a lot of energy into their front-facing camera.  I feel like Samsung over beautifies though.  That's what people want it though, a mystery of the port.  Right, they smooth it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to look like your ruby self.  Not when you're our age, you don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, and when you're young, you don't want to either.  So true.  No one, no one.  Everybody wants to look good.  All right, I don't know what we're talking about Apple.  I guess the idea was we were going to compare it to the Pixel and I really wanted to get Stacey's take on 5G.  I won't give up on 5G yet.  I mean, is it hype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it hype that will eventually turn into our day-to-day reality that we can't live without?  Also 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know 100% on that.  I say it remains to be seen but possible.  I'm just going to say you're wrong.  You really think it's absolutely going to transform everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, in the sense that if we want to keep moving forward on this, we are going to use 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll give it to you then.  I won't be so cranky about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe we'll be here in a year and I can be like, Leo, how's that 5G treatment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you can send me your thermomix.  As a reward?  He says never.  As a reward.  Ms. Stacey, with that said, do you think we'll still be in the same position where people are  giving deals for unlimited data, like the big boys at Verizon and things like that?  Otherwise they're charging you for your actual data allotment each month.  Because I remember when 4G LTE came out, everybody mentioned in their bylines that,  you know what, you're going to burn through your data because it's so fast and it's going to cost  you more money.  Are you seeing any more conversations like that now with the talk of 5G and better performance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What 5G is going to offer you, and this is part of, again, the 3GPP standards.  So they've got different revolutions.  Is it revolutions?  I think so.  They're rev A's, rev B's, whatever, for each different iteration.  Revisions.  Revisions.  That's what they are.  Thank you, Jess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Say you want a real solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But with some of those involved things that will allow carriers to offer,  we're just going to, it's going to kill net neutrality.  You're going to offer managed services for the devices of the networks, right?  They're going to have to, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because I'm going to start downloading my Netflix at HDR 4K in three seconds.  And there's my bandwidth for the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Done.  So the pricing plans are going to change around what you want to do.  And I'm actually really intrigued by how this is going to play out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, again, remember, I think Verizon is the evil empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're greedy.  Yeah.  Money.  Rubbish.  That's kind of the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The whole point of this is they would very much like to bypass all this  federal regulation on what you can do with networks.  And they see this really as a gold mine.  And also difficult to regulate gold mine.  And I think that's why they're putting a lot of money into it for a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're wrong.  They have always operated from a scarcity model.  And there are physics at play that make the scarcity model make sense in some elements,  in some parts of this, right?  But fundamentally, they do not, it would be so much smarter for them to operate on an  abundance model like we have with like computing or semiconductor performance.  No one says, I'm going to charge you based on the core.  Oracle actually tried way back in the day.  But it became so obvious that when you have more of an underlying technology and you can  provide that, people build entire new economies on it.  And that's what's happened.  But it's slowed down a lot because the carriers have not thought about it that way.  And that's why we see companies going around it and things like Wi-Fi and even Wi-Max.  And I think what's about to happen is we're about to start seeing more distributed and  different business models or connectivity, not for your phone, but for like connected devices  that are going to be very different from what the carrier model looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's where your IOT expertise comes into place, because that's the issue with IOT of all  these little devices, they all need bandwidth.  They don't even need a lot of bandwidth, but they all need bandwidth.  And most importantly, they need ubiquitous bandwidth.  And that's one of the offers here.  It's not just the speed.  It's the ubiquity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  5G is not ubiquitous yet, but it will talk.  Next week, I've got the sidewalk people coming on the podcast and that's going to be,  oh baseballs.  And I write about this all the time on the IOT network side.  And that's why things like Starlink are going to be really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your IOT devices don't need the 5G.  They just need connectivity.  Right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Starlink has, by the way, the same problem, which is it doesn't go through the roof.  So just as you will with the millimeter wave 5G, you'll have a collector on the roof,  which will then go through Wi-Fi into your house.  Because unlike self-service right now, which does go through walls,  increasingly we're going to see bandwidth that doesn't.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, for some of it, yes, but not all of it.  We still have, I mean, the 2G spectrum and even the 3G spectrum,  they're starting to repurpose the 3G spectrum starting next year.  And that's a beautiful spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  That's very low frequency.  That gets through everything.  That's actually a good idea.  Don't decommission it, repurpose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they don't always do that.  I don't think there's many edge networks floating around anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but they did repurpose that.  I mean, they reuse that spectrum.  You repack it.  Reuse the spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, Google's having an event tomorrow.  Did you know that?  What?  Going on with them in Oracle again?  You all are going to help me decide whether we should stream it live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Oracle, you know, was part of the hearings today,  so we can talk about that too.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Did they ask Amy Coney Barrett what she would do about Google versus Oracle?  How she feels about software APIs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was Sheldon Whitehouse who's really—  He's smart.  Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From my home state of Providence, Rhode Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, no, it was that all the amicus briefs or amici or what's the plural of amicus.  So the amicus briefs that he asked her,  would you meet with a party in a case while the case is on?  How are you trying to fool me?  No, no, why not?  He says, because it'd be wrong.  Right, it'd be wrong.  It'd be wrong, yeah.  So he leads her down the path and—  Oh, that's sneaky.  Very sneaky.  And then basically you get all these amicus briefs,  but not knowing who's behind them is an issue.  So in the Google versus Oracle case,  Oracle paid $90,000 to a party who wrote an amicus brief.  So did Google, by the way.  So a party in the case—

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Both sides were doing that, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both were, okay, he just mentioned Oracle.  Yeah.  But a party in the case is also filing amicus briefs.  Shouldn't you be watching out for that, Judge?  I didn't know that went on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's not exactly a gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it wasn't quite.  It was a larger piece about ethics and the court.  He did some really good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not sure how you say amici or amici in—  Amici, as they say.  In your neck of the woods, but here in Rome,  where we still speak Latin, I say amici.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because you went to—

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I studied Latin in high school, actually.  So church Latin would be amici.  The Latin I learned, you say amici, the C's are always hard, which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that was closer to the fall of the Roman Empire.  That was the theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll listen to you.  That was, yes, right, way back when,  when people still remembered how Latin was spoken.  Our show today brought to you by Twilio.  Nice job, Stacey.  The world is changing fast.  When you're my age, it's changing awful fast.  You want to build new ways to help customers to communicate, right?  That's what Twilio does so well.  Engage customers wherever they are on any channel,  from text messages to emails to phone calls to video.  And more, with one powerful platform that's easy for your developers to code for.  It's so good.  And let me tell you, it's at scale.  Twilio powers 795 billion-plus interactions across channels with five nines of uptime.  Three billion phone numbers.  More than 100 countries.  That's Twilio.  Shopify, you use Twilio because you use—  I'm sure you use platforms that use Twilio.  If you use Shopify, they run their entire global contact center.  More than a million customers on Twilio's Flex,  their programmable contact center solution.  Blue Apron sends its newsletter emails with Twilio's SendGrid.  Netflix, you use two-factor on Netflix.  That's Twilio.  In fact, Twilio makes my favorite two-factor authentication program,  Offee.  They give it away for free, but the back end's all Twilio.  Ride-sharing and contactless delivery services like Lyft and Uber  connect riders and drivers with text messaging from, you guessed it, Twilio.  Twilio's used all over.  I actually have had a Twilio account for years because it's fun to develop for.  Product and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their users  inside applications ranging from account notifications with text messaging to chat  bots to securing online accounts with two-factor authentication.  The thing I love about Twilio, you don't have to be a specialized telecom network engineer  to use it to build incredible communications apps.  If you already know how to do web apps, you can build apps like text, chat, call, video  conferencing.  Marketing teams use Twilio to get the word out, connecting with leads over text messaging  and phone calls, using email campaigns to build chat bots.  Yes, they've got chat bots to answer questions.  And of course, that Twilio Flex is so great for customer service teams.  It's the easiest way to build global contact and support centers.  It starts out of the box working great, but it's fully programmable so you can make it  do exactly what you need to.  That's kind of the idea of Twilio.  Twilio's power that you can use to do what you need to do.  Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire  business.  Go to twilio.com to learn more today.  That's T-W-I-L-I-O Twilio.com.  It's time to build.  It's called Search On.  It's a live stream event.  It's going to be tomorrow.  It's a surprise to highlight the latest improvements to Google Search.  Is this for, I don't know who this is for.  Let me look at the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not for me because they didn't invite me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to get invited either to put it on there because I just saw it  somewhere.  Yeah.  So I searched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google Search On.  If you go to searchon.withgoogle.com October 15th, 12 p.m. Pacific will be probably doing  another show, but that's all it says.  I don't know anything about it.  I guess they've done these before.  We could stream it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now I hear Kent Brockman from the Simpson saying this barely qualifies as news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, and ouch.  I've been spanked by the Pruitt.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Search On will reveal new AI powered features on Thursday.  It says in Gadget.  What is it?  AI powered these days?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You want to talk about hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk about that.  Yeah, that's true.  That's a good point.  We're not going to do it.  You can watch it if you want to.  I don't see any reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could right now.  Wait, wait.  Leo, Leo, you could right now at this very moment be in on Zoom-topia.  It's live as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, no.  You know where you want to be right now is the Smart Kitchen Summit,  which is actually really cool and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's where Stacey wants to be right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just telling you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would like to be at that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Talking about hacking kitchen devices, building robots for restaurants.  But no, I'm here with y'all and y'all are great.  But robots are pretty cool too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a kitchen robot.  I give you that.  And I know you want it.  You can't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I met a developer there yesterday who was on the cookie do platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the cookie do.  It makes me a little angry that I have to pay a lot of money for a Thermomix  and then subscribe to cookie do for 40 bucks a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you don't have to subscribe to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, but the thing I like about it.  Let me tell them.  The Thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The features you like require that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, because you search for a recipe and it says, OK, I got one.  And then it says and the top of the lid on the Thermomix goes  and it says, OK, now put 400 grams of sugar in my lid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My thing this week, you're going to enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, good.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  While we're on this for a second, I've been meaning to ask you guys this  because you'll know the answer.  What's the deal with the Brava oven?  Oh, you see a lot of ads for that right now, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the Brava, the steam oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, that's the Tovala.  That's the Tovala.  Brava is light.  Yeah.  So this is a radiant heat oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Where you can cook three different things at three different temperatures on the same plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah.  And it's very fast.  It's just I mean, I have a radiant grill.  I'm a big fan of any intelligent.  Radiant heat is not anything new.  It's just infrared heat.  I don't know.  It's another gadget.  I'll let you buy this one, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean, I don't.  I am excited about anything that gives you the ability to cook things well faster  without spending a lot of money on it.  I am too.  Yeah.  So I am excited about the Brava.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a big category.  I mean, basically you put an Android device on an oven  and then you have online connectivity, you have a library of recipes and you can, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife said if we're going to get any of this stuff,  we have to redo the entire kitchen because we can't.  The kitchens aren't built for all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's all about counter space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so that was one of the conversations yesterday that I found so fascinating.  We were talking about.  So a big topic.  Do you all want to talk about food tech?  Sure.  Sure.  So a big topic in food tech is the recipe.  And what's frustrating is there's no like XML for recipes.  So everyone feels, I think rightly,  that recipes are kind of the connective tissue between like your device and like an assistant  or your shopping app, you know, whatever you use.  But all of the, none of the players in the industry want to invest in like an XML for recipes.  Instead, they want to put their own recipes tied to their devices.  So you, you know, in your case, Leo, you subscribe to that.  Yeah, they want a silo.  So it's a huge source of frustration for everyone.  And no one is yet to the point, like at the smart home, like now we're getting into this  possible standardization.  No one's at that point yet for recipes.  So everyone in the industry, it's so funny to watch because everyone is like,  we need a way for things to talk to each other.  And it's like right there in front of them.  And they're like, no, we don't want to do that for recipes.  So it's super frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there used to be a format, the meal master format, but in the early days of computers,  this was a, you know, balancing your checkbooks and keeping track of your recipes  were two of the most popular things you could do.  And then for a while, there was a program called meal master.  And there was a standard format and a lot of websites sprung up  where you could download recipes in the meal master format.  And a lot of people supported it.  And then it just kind of faded away.  I think Broderbund bought them with everything else and then just disappeared it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but Jeff, this was my point.  And I forgot about my point because I'm kind of not all here.  The point is that people who are developing recipes, they have to develop for the lowest  common denominator in the kitchen, which means an oven that maybe doesn't have an  internal temperature probe and a dehydrate setting.  So you've got in that's I didn't really think about that, but it's kind of fascinating as  we get these more sophisticated devices out there.  Yeah, you can't like they need that's why you pay 40 bucks.  Exactly.  Oh, it's 40 bucks a month, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, a year.  Thank God.  I wouldn't pay for 60 bucks a year for the New York Times.  But you know, what would be cool is if instead of the cook.  Yeah, I do too.  I pay for the New York Times.  But would be cool though is that what you're saying is interoperability,  like the recipes I got from New York Times cooking, I could put into my  Thermomix or my Brava oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to then rewrite every recipe for these different mechanisms.  Here's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the Brava does it.  So Kevin wants to dial in and tell you, Jeff, that the Brava needs a 5G connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Otherwise, it cooks really slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Otherwise, yeah, it's cooking at the speed of light, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Leo who was saying who needs stereo before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said, and I think they're actually right,  that the Brava is just a really big, easy bake oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a smarter, easy bake oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got three bulbs instead of one.  You can go online.  I just searched for Mealmaster.  You can go online and download giant databases of Mealmaster recipes,  all in the Mealmaster format.  It's still out there.  These are all hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of recipes  from a variety of sources in the Mealmaster format.  But Stacey, you know about Paprika probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The spice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  No.  You've heard of Cayenne, have you?  No, no.  This is a recipe app that works on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows.  It is fantastic.  What it will do is it's got a very intelligent scraper.  If the recipe exists on a webpage, it's got a browser built in.  You can surf to the webpage and say, scrape this recipe.  It's very good.  It divides it into ingredients and instructions.  It'll take the picture.  If there's a picture, any information that's on that website,  it can import from the web.  So it doesn't have a lingua franca.  I wish it did because I can't then use it for cooking with other devices.  But it is one way to get recipes into your computer.  I like it.  I'm going to try it out.  I highly recommend it.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Way back when, when we started Epicurious, I was there.  We hired monks, literally monks, to retype years and years and years  of gourmet and Bon Appetit recipes.  Wow.  There was no way to figure it out at the time.  This is so long ago.  It was 96.  But why monks?  Wow.  Why monks?  Because they were cheap.  Rather than making beer.  Are you sure you didn't hire monkeys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because they're really cheap.  No, monks.  No, they did good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  It's all bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really interesting.  These were the monks who used to be in Scripteria.  Exactly.  Gutenberg put a lot of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're no longer illuminating manuscripts.  They're just doing data engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It all comes back to Gutenberg.  It's all Gutenberg's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It all comes back to Gutenberg.  I hope you said that.  I hope you said, you know why we can get these monks so cheap?  Gutenberg.  Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the effort of the book, which I haven't taken to an editor yet,  I just got finished another bit of it.  So it's now 335 pages and I've got more to go.  A lot more to go.  And so I put it all in one file on Google Docs.  Oh, was that a mistake?  The lasses.  That's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, my Lord.  It wouldn't take it.  How frustrating is that?  Really frustrating.  It's now seven pieces.  And that's why on-prem is not dead.  The cloud can't do it all, friends.  You want to do a changelog?  I want to do a changelog.  God knows the audience.  Already want to do a changelog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's early for a changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can't win with this guy.  Sometimes it's too early.  Sometimes it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, do your changelog.  It was much longer before.  How did it get cut down?  Karsten went in and did some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Probably there was stuff in there we'd already done.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it was longer.  What happened?  It's this incredible shrinking changelog.  Ant, you want to do a changelog, Ant?  Incredible.  Change log.  The four-item changelog.  You want to do a changelog?  Play the trumpets.  The damn trumpets.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It had like 12 items before.  What happened to all the stuff in the changelog?  Karsten, what did you do to the changelog?  He says it's pretty boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Most of it was boring, he said.  Google makes a big push to integrate  and let you control Android apps with Assistant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what was left.  The boring stuff went.  No, this is actually what Bixby could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But now you'll be able to say,  hey, you know who, send a message to Rachel on Discord  or search for candles on Etsy  or log a Barry Smoothie on MyFitnessPal.  That would be awesome.  Check my accounts on Mint, tighten my shoes with Nike Adapt.  Did you know that there is a way to tighten your shoes?  To tighten your shoes with your smartphone?  You knew about the Nike Adapt?  Well, my device doesn't let me do it.  It feels like that would be risky.  Like, could it over tighten your shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  There's sensors so it doesn't.  Man, what is happening with my head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, my foot is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not going to amputate your foot.  It's not that strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we need you to do a review, Miss Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, would you please order a smoothie with Postmates?  Send a snap with Cartoon Lens.  This is good.  Already 30 apps, 30 of the top Google Play apps  have voice commands.  Now I have to say, this is something  Apple's had for a while, but it's much more manual.  You have to do with shortcuts.  It's something Bixby kind of pivoted to  when it realized they couldn't compete against Google and Amazon.  So they made Bixby more of a way to operate your phone.  Um, now you can now, according to Google,  you don't need to swipe when your hands are full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't realize I could log stuff  under my fitness panel.  I use that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that one.  Right. Yeah, you could say, hey, I just had a smoothie.  Tell my that's cool.  So they're also allowing you to do,  and this is very much Apple's shortcuts.  In fact, it's even called shortcuts.  If you want to, instead of saying, you know, add a smoothie,  uh, hey, you know who add a smoothie to my fitness pal.  You could just say, hey, you know who oops, I did it again.  And it would just add it for you, which would be nice.  Or you could say, uh, lace it.  And oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to say the G word.  Hey, you know who lace it all across all across podcast world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's saying, I don't know how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do what they don't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, uh, this is part, this would be part of, uh,  I don't know if it's part of Android 11 or if you can,  if you'll be getting it soon.  This is actually the part of Google assistant developer day,  which is another thing I missed.  So maybe Google Kevin, Kevin, that was last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin. Uh, they also announced that's where, oh no,  that was accessibility day.  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have all these days.  They didn't tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not going to invite you to their days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Geez.  So many.  So there you go.  There's one cool thing.  How about this?  Uh, the, uh, and there's new feature of Android that will allow you to use your nest devices  to listen for critical sounds, a dog barking, smoke alarms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they had, they did that for Google assistant on your phone for people who are hard of hearing.  Right.  They did 10 sounds.  Oh, so it's not just your nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the microphone on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is your phone.  I don't actually think it works on the nest devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause they, they do glass break and burglar alarms.  The nest devices already have done some of this stuff, but this is new in Android and  Wear OS devices.  It'll use the microphone in your phone to listen for things like beeping appliances,  running water, barking dogs.  And then it will either send you a push notification, a vibration or flash the light on your camera.  That's pretty cool.  Uh, but you will have to turn it on and accessibility is not on by default.  I really like that.  You know, that's, that's using that, you know, the AI to help people.  Google has opened assistant smart displays to interactive education and storytelling apps.  So if you have a nest hub max or one of those displays, now they can, you know what I'm  talking about?  You know what I'm talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do.  I'm laughing because they keep changing the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't remember the freaking name or the Lenovo thing or the thing with the thing.  So here's how you can do this.  There'll be an education and storytelling hub.  You'll say, Hey, you know who tell teach me something new, which will open a carousel  with categories of things you can learn, like learn a language, discover the world,  pick up a new skill.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds fun.  Will it bug me every day?  Like Duolingo does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hope not.  And don't you hate it that Google assistance now, like after you ask it to some set of  time, it says, Oh, and here's a pro tip.  And it goes on and on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Amazon and Google, I know that I asked them to be proactive, but I need them to be  a little less proactive about advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, if I'd wanted that, I would have read the email that told me how to do it that you  send me every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  That's right.  They do.  They send an email, but I guess that's not enough.  So some more things you can do with Android 11.  This is from the keyword Google keyword blog.  Do even more with Google assistant, your favorite apps.  We just mentioned that one new ways to connect with Google duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's something I was waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, he's being sarcastic.  You can share your screen.  I do too.  I use duo with my daughter.  You can share your screen or brat to browse photos or plan activities.  Stuck in an apple family.  If people aren't catching it at a good time, they can leave a video message with automatic  captions.  That's nice.  Say goodbye to spam calls with Google's phone app.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been working for me today.  I had three calls where you could see the thing come up on the screen saying social  security and I know it's a fake call.  Yes.  It was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Very nice.  Happy.  So, uh, well, but I'm still struggling with just plain old D and D.  I wish the phone wouldn't ring when I'm in D and D because it's still ring when you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  supposed to ring.  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You tell me that's not right.  And I know I'm not the only one.  It also happened to my friend, Mr. Jason Levine during his live stream one day.  His phone was on D and D and it rang during his live stream.  It rang this morning while I was TD and floss weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it let some numbers through?  There's something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anytime is just a phone call because I don't get a lot of phone calls except for those  spam calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can, uh, yeah, you can say to let your favorites through or let the double rings  through stuff like that.  Maybe you should check the settings.  I have to say, this is one thing that the iPhone still gets right.  I don't know why more phones don't have physical silence keys or buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the Google used to, it used to have a thing where if you flipped your phone and  stuck it down,  I think it still does that.  Mine still has a half.  I don't want to say a bad word.  So it halfway does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Half rumped?  A half rumped way of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So sometimes when I, some of my notifications still come through and I don't know why,  but I know like when I'm listening to music and I accidentally set my phone down like  this, it's like, and I'm like, oh, right.  And anyway, oh, but you know what else?  Okay.  I just noticed this and maybe I'll have already noticed this, but I'm going to throw  it in the change log anyway.  Oh, wait, first.  Hi, dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, it's Stacy.  It's Mr. Higginbotham.  It's the devil getting whipped around the corner.  Dev, devil, devil getting his ass kicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The devil's working his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The devil's whipping his wife.  Mr. Higginbotham, you don't say that anymore.  Hey, Mr. Higginbotham, I hear the devil's whipping his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, dad.  We were talking about sun showers.  I was like, what's that word?  Okay.  But this is the change log, y'all, or what I was going to tell you.  The digital wellness thing popped up for me and I actually decided to use it.  When you charge your phone after a certain time at night, it'll turn it gray  and then it will put it on do not disturb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love that.  I do that actually because it's less compelling when it's gray scale.  It is.  All those colors make you want to use it.  As soon as it's black and white, it's like, ew, I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You who wasn't going to get a color television.  Yeah, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why I didn't want to call it TV.  By the way, Mars room in our chat room says if Google's bugging you with pro tips,  say, okay, Google, no, thank you.  I just turned off the pro tips all over America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you tell Alexa to, oh, sorry, y'all, if you tell Madam A to screw you,  she will also do the same thing.  Yeah, I have said that many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you tell Siri that, she says, that's not nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was at a sad place that I was like, I just screamed at an inanimate object.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's OK, because it is an inanimate object.  It has no feelings.  No, it has no feelings, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it reflects poorly on you and your control over your own stuff.  Is that what Mr. Higginbotham taught you?  My dad is one of the nicest men in the world.  I've never heard him say a bad thing about a person.  Except for the devil.  I am not as nice as he is.  I'm not.  He's honestly a very nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is your dad saying, what is this thing you do?  Why?  What?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  He knows who Leo is and he's watched the show before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I bet he is the greatest guy ever.  I can tell he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He may have already stopped.  We love Stacey.  Stacey is the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff, I'm going to tell you something.  Please don't get sad about this, but he's probably younger than you and me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  And Stacey, don't tell us.  I don't want to know.  Dad's 43.  Oh my God.  I envision a man with a well-crackled face.  I'm just not going to.  Incidentally.  I know.  Don't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't say it.  Google is also starting to roll out that thing where the duplex where you can book a hair  reservation for you or make a reservation in a restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were promising that for a year and a half now so we can finally get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently it's the part of the whole thing.  Who gets hair appointments now?  Yeah, I know.  Just in time, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now it's able to do it because there's so few being booked.  It's like, okay, finally we can scale this up and error test it.  It's a great time for this to roll out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see.  How else is your Android getting more useful?  New tools for hearing loss.  We mentioned that.  Communicate with action blocks when you don't use your voice.  You probably know something about this, Stacey.  Action blocks.  Oh, I see.  So we've seen these on iPads and things.  People who have autism or can't have difficulty speaking or whatever can tap blocks to say  something out loud.  It's an artificial voice for people with speech-related disabilities.  I think that's really cool.  Thousands of picture communication symbols from Toby Dynavox.  They're a company that's done this for years.  Making it easier to use the Android app alongside existing speech therapy and special ed materials.  That's really neat.  That's really good.  Yeah.  Action blocks.  And Google, it says enjoy the entertainment you love with a little help from Google.  That doesn't seem like it has anything new at all.  It's just a little plug.  Of course.  A little plug is an item number six.  I don't know why that's even there.  Oh boy, there was a lot this Google Assistant Developer Day.  Two new English voices for use in actions with improved prosody model to make assistance  sound more natural.  Actions testing.  What's prosody?  So if you as a Google voice say open the pod bay door howl, you can take that and I can add  a natural speech prosody.  Open the pod bay door howl and overlay it and it gives it a much,  it gives it the cadence, the rhythm, the tempo and pitch shifts that make it sound like more  like a human voice.  That's something we've been working on for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is Amazon.  Can you do an up speak one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Open the pod bay door howl.  You can accelerate it and give it a higher dynamic or more of a dynamic range and it'll  sound like Stacey.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Open the pod bay door howl.  No, no, no, you don't sound like that Stacey.  I sound like Vicky.  No, you don't.  Okay.  There's more actually but Karsten says it's boring so and I say the shorter the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten censored the change law.  Is everybody talking about it?  He censored it and should all be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The chat room is actually throwing stuff in.  Well wait a minute here's another one.  Google completes the worldwide shutdown of the Play Music Store.  If you were supposed to migrate if you didn't migrate yet.  We've been warning you about this.  You can know it.  Well it's not completely done but you cannot buy music on the Play Store anymore.  This is kind of sad.  You know they've replaced it with YouTube music and most people have migrated over by now.  You've certainly been offered that option.  I hope you did.  No more buying music from the Google Play Store.  Google Calendar side panel adds powerful Google Maps.  ScooterX is now doing the changelog.  Shout out ScooterX.  Nice job ScooterX.  Got it.  Here's another one from The Verge.  YouTube announces a slate of original series dedicating to amplifying black voices.  It's from the hashtag YouTube Black Voices Fund.  So I don't know if these are documentaries.  It's a hundred million dollar fund.  The shows include Resist which is a documentary.  Twelve episodes series about injustice in policing, bail, and incarceration.  The Onyx Family Dinner.  A kids series about families sharing different perspectives and thought provoking stories.  Barbershop Medicine.  Wow which examines how race impacts health care.  Bear Witness Take Action Part 2.  A follow up to A Special on Racial Justice.  HBCU Homecoming 2020.  Meet me on the yard.  A live stream event to raise money for the United Negro College Fund.  And the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.  So new YouTube content.  It didn't work ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you ScooterX.  Karsten didn't do his thing.  You know Karsten got rid of all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Technically Leo's supposed to put it all in.  Really?  Well yeah I mean my job during the week is to look for stories and clip them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought your job was just to stand on camera and talk to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well that's really that's all I want to do.  But unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some days you don't even want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.  I put a lot of stuff in it.  In fact one I'm very interested right below the change log once we're done with it to  hear your reaction to.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well I'll tell you what let's say this.  That.  That's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Too much prosody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the Google change log.  And right below the change log Nvidia creates super zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this news as old as it's real as it's helpful as it's for you as it's for us.  Well it's not making me think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah well we didn't talk about it last week so.  We didn't talk about it.  Yeah.  GPU accelerated AI platform they call it Nvidia Maxine.  Will allow video conference providers to improve streaming.  I did see some of the before and after and it's pretty impressive.  This is a problem of course when bandwidth is low resolution goes down.  Something's got to give for instance and whose picture is.  Perfect.  But there was drops and was bandwidth not crazy there'd been drops and stuff in the  audio but the picture.  You must have told Skype please I want a perfect picture.  And I don't care what I sound like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is ants like.  What is it calling power.  The beautiful.  Superpower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah he's brilliant.  He's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well he's also a.  Ant it would be hard to ruin and.  You know what I.  Strip to.  So this thing even recognizes the face so if you're looking away from the camera like I was  complaining about last week.  So think of it as computational conferencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at this.  It's basically.  Your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's some of the things you can do this is the one for you face alignment.  AI compression which gets rid of the you know the.  Artifacts.  Artifacts yeah conversational AI avatar look like an alien it'll do translation.  It'll denoise it'll do a virtual background that's always a problem  because the group without a green screen cutting out the person.  And put some behind it you've seen it before it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Terrible getting better though across the board though sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was watching CNN the other night their global coronavirus town hall.  They had a former CDC director who had turned on.  Fake background it looked like it was a real background his book shelf was all nice and  everything but you could he was in his kitchen so every time he moved his head you'd see the  kitchen table would appear and then disappear it really ruined the effect I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's getting better though it's not as bad as it was that's three four months ago.  Yeah yeah auto frame video definitely sounds like something for Nvidia with  with their they're always dabbling with AI one way or another so  makes sense for them to jump into this space so I don't see the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In this Forbes article you say there's a video no no no I have four items in the rundown.  Oh you are so smart all right here's the video demonstration trying to get Karsten's job.  You can have it.  Karsten will start teaching journalism at CUNY it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Karsten you're doing a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah pat him on the back.  Yes you are Karsten.  You're doing a great job who's a beautiful little Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Karsten if you want to hang up on Leo and just have the rest of us do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody throw Karsten a treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He can't he has no power he's at home it's jammer B that has all the power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to know that I wanted Karsten Kamm.  I pissed off Leo horribly by demanding Karsten Kamm.  He was not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You pissed me off I said no.  There's a difference.  There is a difference.  All right here my friends the virtual meetings of tomorrow with Nvidia AI research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just invented something amazing that basically replaces a video codec with a neural network  a neural network is it a generational adversarial neural network with more than 10 million video  streams estimated to be live at any given time video conferencing is the new connectivity

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  challenge for many so it's just the one on the right is a much lower bandwidth but it looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  as good as the higher assisted video calls a symbol a sender first transmits now see

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Karsten would have cut this whole segment out Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You calling my segment boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sends data.  I found it properly geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is computational conferencing we're using software to make the whole experience better.  It recognizes what's going to happen.  It's faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is beautiful.  It's giving it a beautiful filter.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at her teeth they're getting messed up but this very low bandwidth presumably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The number was earlier but you went right past it but keep going keep going.  Now we have oh look at that so look at the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah we're at point one two kilobytes per frame I mean it's very low bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notice the glasses are much better than the mouth.  It knows how to do certain things better than others.  Right.  The Yankees hat is perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It knows how to do that.  Well the less something moves the harder the right you know the less something was easier  it is the harder it is to mouth is always going to be hard but actually this is a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at his hair look at that was good definition in the hair.  Same thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It even works with a mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Stacey you think that's because it's been trained on things like masks and hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if I don't know if it's just filling in the spots.  This is the face alignment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah so this guy's talking as I as people often do over your left shoulder watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although now he looks like a video game character.  Yeah it's like that guy who talks to you in every video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's a guy who looks like a video game character and what are they going to do now.  He looks like a well-dressed young man.  He looks like Karsten actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No he's not wearing a bow tie.  This is a bow tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting and of course I thought isn't this really the product that Pied Piper was  coming out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh ladies and gentlemen if you go to what is it called out middle out compression.  If you just could just use middle out compression the internet we deserve is finally here.  Over the years Pied Piper has changed many landscapes compression data the internet.  Click below to look back at the evolution of Pied Piper revolutionizing one landscape at a time.  Year one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the Silicon Valley show.  And where is Gavin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was what they were working on right.  It was it was a Kodak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is basically the website.  I wonder if HBO did this or is this a fan made site.  Home box office copyright 2019.  They got to own that.  Home box office.  And here finally in year five the year we deserve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I do have a legitimate question.  Do you think this Nvidia stuff could actually be useful for the twit network at some point.  Well yeah when they release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff wants to be less pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nothing can help that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want AI to make me look human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah maybe what will happen is zoom or somebody like zoom will incorporate it into their engine.  And then and you know and if somebody does we'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so if Ants connection goes wonky it'll it'll prove it for us.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  On the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So wonky it leaves the no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes I'm going to guess it's probably going to require an Nvidia graphics card to work.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well so there's two ways Nvidia could win here.  One is you know the training.  So it's like wants us to use AI and then the inference or the way that it's actually implemented  on your machine may not require a graphics card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  But I bet it does.  Even if it doesn't.  Yeah.  If I were them I would.  And so we should just check in.  Speaking of zoom on zoom topia.  It's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We missed Mark Cuban.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh god I do not miss Mark Cuban.  Zoom topia what the heck is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scroll down you got this.  This is a live conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the agenda.  Well you got to sign in.  I signed into zoom with my Google account and won't let me do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I need a zoom account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep going down.  It was it was five o'clock Eastern time.  When's Kanye coming on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because that's what I want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exciting stuff.  Are they going to have Yeezy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should not let him out right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know he's actually doing well.  I don't think.  There's Mark Cuban.  It was a two.  Celebration of happiness by Mark Cuban.  Well we missed zoom topia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah too bad.  It's on for tomorrow too.  It's two days of zoom topia.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah we should probably start thinking about maybe there's something better out there than Skype.  We try other things all the time.  And Skype works for us.  But I don't know.  Most of the time.  Most of the time.  We're just not tied to it but it just it happens to work.  So I'm always if there's something better I'm willing to try it.  What is the Gartner hype cycle by the way?  You had that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you search for Gartner hype cycle you'll see the chart that they do.  And it has from underappreciated to overhyped to disappoint.  Oh so it's the technology trigger.  That's what gets going.  Then it goes to the peak of inflated expectations.  Then it comes down to the trough of disillusionment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm in the trough of disillusionment right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then it goes down to the slope of enlightenment and then the plateau of productivity.  Oh yeah there it is.  Every year they place technologies on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So where are we in the hype phase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on the technology.  Each technology gets placed on that chart.  Yeah I would assume so he took 25 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we're at the peak of inflated expectations in 5G for sure.  This is good.  That's the question.  Yeah so this is good.  Maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which means we're just a few minutes away from the trough of disillusionment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you're seeing it go through the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is actually quite I think quite insightful.  I don't know if everything follows this curve but a lot of things do for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah y'all have never heard of the Gartner hype cycle until this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No ma'am.  I'm ignorant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  No it's I think it's a big enterprise software.  Well I don't know we talk about it all the time so I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so here's an example it's 2006.  Quantum computing and DNA logic are just getting started right?  Augmented reality, model driven architectures, semantic web.  Now at the peak of the inflated expectations digital paper and e-ink,  grid computing, biometric payments.  But this is now going down into the slew of disillusionment.  Wikis, corporate blogging, mesh networks, sensors, tablet PCs.  Some of these did make it out of the slew of despond into the slope of enlightenment.  Let's watch and see what happens.  So this is one of the problems with this is they can just take people  I think them off the graph if they were wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they tell a lot of them were one year wonders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah yeah like the semantic web.  Look e-book readers.  We had to talk about ontologies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah they disappeared.  Biometric authentication though is getting there.  Speech recognition is at the plateau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blue is one time.  Red is 10 or more times.  Augmented reality.  AR stays on there forever.  But artificial, no flying autonomous vehicle right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know if you look at this there's a lot of hype and very little actual success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well there are things I mean like grid computing gradually became something else.  Cloud computing.  Yeah yeah interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking at the iPhone announcement and when the images showed up the first thing  that came to my mind was the iPhone 4.  It looks just like a design one.  But there's a reason for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the antennas.  So this is the thing that kind of bugs me is so much energy, so much engineering effort,  so much cost was devoted to this 5G.  I guess Apple felt like well we've got to do it it's now or never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's well they had to do it eventually so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eventually for sure.  But the question is where in the hype cycle are we on 5G?  And I think it's early to be.  And it's annoying because we're going to bear the brunt.  Who pays for all that innovation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah well we don't have to buy this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to pay for it.  I will.  The best in the world to be like eh.  Oh I'm going to get the most expensive one of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to shoot something with it.  I will I'll let you borrow it you bet.  I think I'm going to get my mom the 12.  Yours is the review I hear about.  What am I chopped liver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah yeah yeah.  Thank you Mr. Thomas.  I want the photo snob view.  I'm good on a cracker.  I want her to push it until it breaks.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh I should do another ad.  That's what I should do right now.  That would be a good thing to do.  Thank you Leo.  And Stacey had some things that she wanted.  I'm going to let Stacey.  We did Jeff's things such as they were.  Now it's your turn.  You were so excited with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you have to rest now and do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I must rest and do and talk about Zip Recruiter which is actually something I'm getting pretty  hyped up about because what's good news is people are actually starting to go back to work.  Hiring is starting to pick up.  There are a lot of people looking and if you're one of those people hiring God bless you.  Thank you.  Congratulations.  You're on the upswing.  But there's a lot to think about as you're in this process especially when you have to  think about enforcing social distancing and supplying masks and so forth.  I'm going to make your job simpler at least when it comes to hiring the right people fast.  Zip Recruiter.  It's kind of an amazing technology.  The first thing when you post your job on Zip Recruiter it sends it to over a hundred  of the web's leading job sites.  So you cast the widest possible net.  More people will see your opening than anything else.  And that's really important because the right person's out there.  You just got to find out where they are.  You got to reach them where they live.  But then Zip Recruiter does something pretty amazing.  They have powerful matching technology.  So they scan all the resumes they have on tap.  Lots of people come to Zip Recruiter looking for work.  So they can go through those resumes automatically.  Find people who have the right experience for your opening and then invite them to apply  to your job.  The upshot all of this is you're going to get qualified candidates very, very quickly.  Don't worry.  They're not going to come to your phone.  They're not going to be calling you at home.  They're not going to be filling your inbox with applications because it all goes into  the Zip Recruiter interface where they format the resumes, make it easy to scan them.  They give you features like screening questions to filter candidates.  There's a complete dashboard which makes it very easy to review the candidates, rank them,  and pick the right person fast.  That's what Monica Starks did.  She was hiring at her construction company, GS Group, having a hard time finding the right  person because there were so many candidates out there.  It's like a needle in a haystack.  That's actually why she switched to Zip Recruiter because they make hiring easy.  This is one of the hiring stories you'll find at ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  It worked really well.  Lamont Jenkins' profile was sent to her five minutes after she posted her job  because Zip Recruiter went through their resumes and said,  oh, Lamont's perfect for this and sent his application on.  Or actually, they invited him to apply.  He said, yes, I'd like to apply.  And then they sent it on.  And that is key.  We've had that same experience where Lisa would post for an opening at breakfast.  By lunch, we had two or three really good candidates.  In fact, Zip Recruiter is so effective, four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day.  Sometimes a lot faster.  It's really amazing.  See for yourself.  You can try it for free right now.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash T-W-I-G.  Zip Recruiter, it's the smartest way to hire.  And we are devoted Zip Recruiter fans here at Twig.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  OK, Stacey, is there any kitchen tech, any network tech,  any IOT tech that you're excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we doing the end of the show now?  Is that what's happening?  No, no, we're doing the things you wanted to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a chance for you to pick a story that you care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I picked a story where to go.  It's in the Google section.  So you're going to be extra excited.  Oh, so exciting.  It's called Google Police Search, which is a terrible, I just didn't want to cut and paste,  but Google is giving data to police based on search keywords.  Oh crap.  So this, though, is interesting because they're not doing it on the individual level.  Now police are asking, they're issuing warrants,  say, where they ask Google to disclose everyone who has searched for a particular keyword.  So like fertilizer bomb or something?  Yeah, so it's the inverse of like, I suspect Stacey, let's see what she searched for.  But like, let's say they think I murdered someone with a hatchet.  Yeah, but this is a fishing expedition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So yeah, it's what librarians refuse to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that, well, they're asking for it.  And they're getting it apparently.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So for instance, they have an example in this CNET article.  They, the police in Florida sent a search warrant to Google that said,  we want to see users who had searched for a particular address near where an arson happened.  So somebody typed in an address and they got back everybody who searched for that address.  Now, I don't know.  I feels like to me that's that would have pulled in a lot of innocent people.  In fact, mostly innocent people.  They did in fact arrest somebody for setting fire to a witness's car.  I don't know if I like that, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they had a librarian working for them, the librarian would have told them, you don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't go to the library and say, hey, can you tell me everybody who used your  computers and searched for fertilizer bomb?  Yeah.  Maybe they can now though.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, but I did find what I found interesting is that in New York, they've actually proposed  legislation to make this illegal.  So I'm like, go to New York.  I mean, obviously it's not passed.  And we're probably going to see some state by state.  Not enforcement rules around this, which could be confusing.  And then maybe Google will be like, ah, dang it.  Let's figure out something we can do federally.  Credit to a reporter for Detroit News, Robert Snell, who found the unsealed court filing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  on Tuesday and tweeted about it.  Google provided the IP addresses of people who searched for the arson victims address.  Arson victims address.  They then tied one of the IP addresses to a phone number belonging to the suspect.  Then he had then used phone number records to pinpoint the location of his device using  one of those pen warrants where he could say, hey, where was this guy on the night of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they did use this to like get a person.  They arrested him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is very much, you know, his digital footprint getting him in trouble.  Actually, let me revisit.  Arson got him in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  But he got caught because of his digital footprint.  Google has declined to say how many keyword warrants they've received in the past three  years.  But they did say that they work to protect the privacy of their users, but they have  to support law enforcement.  Quote, this is Google's director of law enforcement and information security, Richard  Salgado.  We require a warrant and push to narrow the scope of these particular demands  when overly broad, including by objecting in court when appropriate.  These data demands represent less than 1% of total warrants and a small fraction of  the overall legal demands for user data that we currently receive.  That's a really interesting policing technique.  I'm not necessarily against it.  I mean, they caught the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I mean, the question then becomes like how broad could those searching for that  particular person's address?  I can imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a pretty narrow search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have to be.  Let's say I'm throwing, I mean, it's COVID, but let's say I was throwing a party and  lots of people were searching for my address.  I mean, yes, they could argue, well, she was throwing a party.  I wanted to figure out and that would presumably absolve them.  But I don't know.  And sometimes I search for addresses like when we were buying a house, I was searching  for addresses all the time so I could see the house on Street View.  I don't know.  I mean, it's not.  It depends on the search.  It depends on.  And any time you get caught up in one of these, I guess the thing to ask is if you get caught  up in something like this, what happens to you as a citizen?  What is the burden put upon you to prove your innocence?  Right.  Because make no mistake that you are proving your innocence in this case.  So do you have to hire a lawyer because it's a pretty high thing, high hurdle to jump over.  So I think we should ask ourselves things like that when we're trying to figure out  if this is good or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I would say in a case like this where it's a very specific search and probably came  up with one or maybe a couple of people searching for that address, that's a very specific search  and that's more useful to the police.  They could probably eliminate some of the people by saying, well, that's the guy who lives there.  That's a friend who came over.  But who's this?  And that doesn't mean that they necessarily banged on every door with a warrant and said,  we're taking you downtown for questioning.  It's part of an overall picture that they're painting.  I have a little less problem with that than if they search for fertilizer bomb,  which might produce an eighth grader as well as a bad guy.  The more narrow I think the better.  Right.  Would you agree with that, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is true.  And as someone who is like, I have Googled various money laundering techs that I learned  about on like books or television.  I'm like, is that real?  Let's see.  You know, I'm like, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I Google crimes all the time.  Doesn't mean I'm going to commit them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't want my search to make me guilty.  Right.  Because I'm searching for something.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I thought you all'd appreciate that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I do.  EFF surveillance litigation director Jennifer Lynch said,  if Google stored data in a way that was truly identified, de-identified,  they couldn't do these kinds of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I wrote about that.  I think that story is out now, but I wrote about that for IEEE,  my column in that, and that was all about like privacy by design.  And basically, if you're going to gather lots of potentially intrusive data,  you must separate it completely from identifying characteristics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Google does not do that, but somebody like DuckDuckGo,  that's their selling point, right?  We de-identify.  We don't know who you are.  I hope that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that where you're doing your fertilizer bomb searches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's more like weird sexual practices, but I'm not, don't be judging me.  But no, seriously, I think that that would be a very good argument for not using Google for  searches, but instead using something that's anonymous.  It doesn't mean that they don't have to work well,  but why are they tracking who searches for what?  Why are they keeping that information?  Well, obviously, they're keeping it so they can ads for ads, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The better to serve you ads.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's a very good argument for DuckDuckGo, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or incognito mode.  Just throw it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's by the way, no.  Incognito mode does not hide you from Google.  It only doesn't save cookies on your browser.  Google still knows who made the search.  It still ties your IP address to that search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a public service for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Incognito mode does not protect your privacy that way.  I honestly think that that's now that you mentioned this,  this is a very strong case for...  I've kind of been looking for something beyond...  I don't care if these targets ads against me.  That's actually a benefit to me.  But if that data is also used, for instance,  in a phishing warrant by law enforcement,  that's problematic, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you want to tell us about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No.  That is, by the way, why many browsers, Firefox offers this,  allow you to do...  Well, actually, this wouldn't protect you, would it?  Would DNS over HTTPS?  No, it wouldn't protect you  because you're going to Google and saying,  tell me something, Google knows your IP address.  A VPN would protect you.  Yes, it would anonymize you.  That's a good reason you use a VPN.  The IP address associated with that would be,  the VPN is not yours.  Again, why it's very important to choose a VPN that does not log.  It doesn't log.  If you could go to the VPN and say,  hey, who was making that search?  And they could say, well, Leo was using that IP address at that time.  That would not be good.  I'm not trying to undermine police.  This looks like an interesting investigative tool.  I worry about overly broad phishing searches.  So good.  Yeah, really good story.  Can I bring one up?  No.  Well, Jeff, you may say no when I bring it up.  Don't ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about asking?  What about 26 and 35?  It seems like those two.  I do want to give yours to Ryan.  And it's 35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So I did see this in the Times the other day.  Google employees encouraged to speak up,  except if they're saying something about antitrust,  then we don't like that so much.  This is from the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the date on that story?  Because it's been around for about six weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  October 13th.  So it's a recent...  A, well, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been around.  B, when I worked for companies,  when I worked for media companies,  we were told the same thing.  Yeah.  I was given very strict instructions.  Words not to use.  To never use the word dominate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and think about it.  All internal email is property of the company  and is subject to warrant and search and subpoena.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Discovery.  So discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think that that's not unreasonable, actually, to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not unreasonable in the least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You may not have these discussions on our network.  You're using a corporate resource.  We ask that you not do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Big key there.  That's something that just...  Good answer.  A lot of people going in when they go...  When they take these positions or roles or whatever,  it seems like most people don't read the handbooks  because most of the time that's right there in their handbook  when they sign up for a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is.  And we put that in your handbook, Ant.  Remember.  Sure did.  No antitrust talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Leo is a monopoly.  Nobody else does this show.  We are the only one on earth.  This is a...  Twig is a monopoly.  Who else would talk for three hours?  Not about Google.  We actually don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have taught Google today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've crushed it.  We don't write our own handbook.  ADP does.  Because we outsource our HR.  So it's very possible there is stuff in there  that's just boilerplate that like,  well, one of the things you don't want to talk about.  Leo's hair loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should probably have someone read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, somebody reads it.  Just not me.  It's red.  It's red.  No, the employees have to read it.  Well, they don't have to.  Nobody's watching over.  Yeah, you should.  Yeah, you sign a thing that says you read it.  That's right.  Read your handbook if you have to sign it.  I'm sure Lisa's read it.  But I have to say I'm not an employee,  so I haven't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I probably should read it, shouldn't I?  For shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was your story, Leo?  What was your story?  Well, wait a minute.  Ant had another one.  Oh, I had another one.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google contractors say their work is being shipped to Poland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  After they started talking about unionize,  and I'm like, why is that news?  Because it just sounds like Google doesn't want to work with you anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but it isn't Google.  It's a contractor.  That's part of it.  So this isn't actually done by Google.  It's done by HCL America.  80 contractors employed by HCL America  voted to unionize with the US Steelworkers,  which is, according to Vice,  an historic victory for white-collar tech workers in the US.  But the NLRB issued a formal complaint against HCL,  alleging the company violated labor law  by failing to bargain with the Steelworkers union.  Now, and then basically firing the workers  and having the work be done by non-union members  in a Krakow, Poland facility.  It's a skib.  They don't work directly for Google.  But this is, by the way, another little scam that companies do.  They use contractors so that they are kind of off the hook.  Have some wiggle.  Yeah.  A lot of big tech companies,  almost all of them I know of,  use contractors.  So it just makes it easier for you,  not just with unionization, but things like benefits.  Benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I read that.  And again, I just thought,  didn't they realize they were contractors?  So there's going to be some rules of engagement  that's just not going to apply to them  because they're not hired employees.  They're hired independent contractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it sounds like HCL engaged in kind of  common union-busting actions.  The NLRB, which is responsible for enforcing this,  has scheduled a hearing for February  when it will prosecute HCL for violating  the National Labor Relations Act.  So it doesn't directly reflect on Google,  but it's sort of indirectly.  These contractors work as, many of them,  not all of them work as analysts on Google Shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, not an uncommon practice.  Oh, I see it happen all the time.  You have contractors to work on a certain project  in a certain department.  You see it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My story was a New Yorker story I'm sure you read  because you read it cover to cover, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, no, I limit how many I get a month,  so I chose not to read this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll read it in like three weeks  when I get around to that particular issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This came out in the October 9th issue,  so it's the newest New Yorker.  Why Facebook can't fix itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't going to use one of my three clicks on this.  I just said, nope, not doing it.  Well, maybe you should just open your eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to what's going on, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is where Ant and I go do something else.  We should have the Stacey Ant sidebar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The weekly fisticuffs between Jeff and me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on a second, I've got to get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, crap.  I guess there's nothing more to say about it.  The issue really is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff just went to get his,  I'm betting it's the moral panic bulletin.  Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the quote.  In retrospect, and he has a lot of establishing facts,  of course, it seems the company, Facebook Strategy,  has never been to manage the problem of dangerous content,  but to manage the public's perception of the problem.  Let's stop right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole concept of dangerous content  should be kind of offensive to a journalist.  That content, that speech can be dangerous.  We know that speech can be dangerous.  We can say, yelling fire in a crowded theater, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We know that forcing people to violently liberate Michigan  could lead to worse plots to kidnap the governor.  Facebook routinely eliminates the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It routinely removes ISIS recruitment propaganda,  but it's been far less aggressive  in cracking down on white supremacist groups.  So they do, in fact, police it.  The point is that it's-  As is their right.  As is their right.  No, I'm not saying they're doing anything illegal.  They refer to Nick Clegg, who wrote that Facebook,  and what is he, the head of communications?  He wrote, the Facebook takes a zero tolerance approach  to hate speech, but with so much content posted every day,  rooting out the hate is like looking for a needle in a haystack.  The author continues, the metaphor Cass Zuckerberg  is a hapless victim of fate day after day.  Through no fault of his own,  his haystack ends up mysteriously full of needles.  A more honest metaphor would posit a powerful set of magnets  at the center of the haystack, Facebook's algorithms,  I think this is true, which attract and elevate  whatever content is most highly charged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I need yours. Yours is better.  I need yours, Andy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is how the system-  Do you deny that that's how the system is designed to work?  That's what the algorithm does?  You don't think that's what it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see a Nazi insight in this.  I see no data, we can't get it out of them,  which is part of the problem.  They should be more transparent about this,  of how many Nazis there are and how many people see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Facebook's claim is, yes, we don't allow it,  but it's so impossible for us to stop it that we do the best we can.  I think it was my friend Ben Evans who went after Borat today,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because Borat was screaming about this,  and he said, you who traffic in satire should know how difficult it is then  to tell the difference between satire and real.  And it is not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what should Facebook do?  They should just continue to do what they're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think Facebook should do a lot more,  but I don't think they should do it under government pressure.  I'm not saying this isn't the government, it's the freaking New Yorker.  Well, but that's where it heads.  And today you have the case, just today you have the case,  where Facebook and Twitter decided not to promote,  and please let's not add anything to this,  a really awful New York Post story.  I saw that.  Then you have a Senator of the United States screaming that this is Facebook,  another public official screaming,  you're using the public airwaves as in sun towers and Wi-Fi,  and we're going to force you to put this back up.  And compelled speech is not free speech, and that's where this goes.  That's my problem.  So yes, I think Facebook should have a better rule set  for how they run their garden party.  They should have a North Star,  they should decide that things just aren't appropriate there,  and for whatever reason they decide it's not appropriate,  and it's our party, so screw you, we're taking this down.  I think they should do a lot more of that on their own,  but they should not do it under pressure from government  and media pressuring government,  unaware of what they're doing around freedom of expression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, I actually, you know, I should go to the end of this thing  and see what his prescription is,  because I didn't get that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably to subscribe to magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He does say these restrictions are likely to feed into the notion  that social media discriminates against conservatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This has become a right-wing talking point,  although the bulk of evidence suggests the opposite.  He refers to, as you have, Kevin Ruse's top 10 link posts,  almost always dominated by far-right celebrities or news outlets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's stop right there for a second.  He uses Facebook data from a Facebook company they bought,  which is a Facebook problem,  but as Facebook's people have pointed out,  what's BS about that, and I've written about this too,  all trending things, Twitter trending too,  the number of people who actually see that thing,  which is supposedly the number one news story on all of Facebook.  You would like this author, because he says exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He says it would be much more appropriate to rank by reach  instead of interactions,  but the problem is that information is sealed up inside Facebook  and they're not telling anybody what the reach of any post is.  Maybe that would be a useful thing Facebook could do.  Honestly, I understand why they don't want to give ammunition to their critics,  but if they don't give ammunition to their critics,  they're going to get more critiques, not fewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where the regulatory  transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation freedom of expression,  of which I was a part,  and the report says that yes, we need to get data about impact out of them  so that researchers can look at it and then come back and say,  this is a problem or this is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, this article, which I thought was quite well put together,  Andrew Moran's does not call for any action at all.  Oh, okay.  He's just simply setting the stage.  You don't have to use your click.  I've now told you everything that's in this 5,000 word article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In about four weeks, Stacey can tell me what it says too.  It's a little bit nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although I got to point out Clarence Thomas wants to reel in Section 230.  Oh, F me.  He is a, I believe, a justice in the United States Supreme Court.  Yes.  He says this was,  he wrote about Section 230 in a filing following the court's decision  not to hear a Section 230 related case.  He said his fellow justices were right to pass on the case,  which centered on whether Malware Bytes,  an internet security company, could be held liable for what Enigma Software says  was a wrongful designation of its products as malware, false positive.  But he said the Supreme Court should welcome the chance  to scale back Section 230 from the bench through a different case.  Extending 230 immunity beyond the natural reading of the text  can have serious consequences, Thomas wrote.  When the right case comes before us, it would behoove the justices.  Where is, where part of the country is he from now?  It would behoove, that's my fourth grade teacher, I believe,  behoove the justices to consider.  Behoove you to sit down, Leo Laporte.  Yeah, something like that.  And be quiet.  Yeah, behoove you to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someday people will pay to hear you talk all the time, but not in my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not now.  See, I told you, I told you they would let me talk.  Would behoove the justice to consider a narrower reading of the law.  He says internet companies have been granted sweeping protection  and the courts are reading more comprehensive immunity  in Section 230 than it was intended.  It's not exactly, let's overturn it, but it is interesting.  He's saying the court could have something to say about Section 230.  As well, as you know, I think there are six bills in front of Congress  eliminating Section 230.  Oh, it's just not ridiculous.  It's not ridiculous.  All right, I think...  We hit the ball here, we hit everything.  I think anything that I missed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is just amusing.  The WordPress is going to let you turn a blog post into a Twitter thread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No!  I thought that was nice.  No, it's between the inverse.  Oh, no, that was a plug-in.  A Twitter thread into a blog post?  A Twitter thread into a blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, okay, I'm okay with that.  I'm good with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, that's a nice feature.  I like that.  I will still understand why people write blog posts at 140 characters at a time.  It just doesn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how they're thinking.  Jeff, I shared in line 93 something for you that I just thought was very  amusing and you can share it with your students if you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is fun.  Into the meme woods.  Every journalist falls into one of these categories when writing or researching a story.  Lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm either chaotic good or chaotic evil, depending on how much time I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chaotic evil writes directly into the CMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know it's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Lawful good has an alphabetical digital filing system of color-coded folders,  docs and spreadsheets for each project.  I hate that person.  I hate that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to write straight into quark.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  That's like dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because then you could see your line breaks and everything.  Exactly.  I would get rid of all the widows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pick a different word.  Oh, yeah.  No, I got...  Well, you're writing for TV Guide because I am, after all, a former TV Guide, TV critic.  Little tiny pages, little tiny pages.  You had to worry about how things broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  When I went to J-school, Quark was our program of choice.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.  Quark is a page layout program.  So it's not quite writing into the CMS because you don't hit the publish button.  But well, no.  I write into the CMS all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I write into WordPress.  I used to write.  I had some custom thing for the papers, the deal, and I can't remember what it was,  but I wrote directly into that sometimes, too.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife, Leo, Entertainment Weekly, my wife set up the entire publishing system for that.  We were the first major magazine to go all Macintosh and all Quark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Is that how you met?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We met at Time Inc.  And then when I did it, I said, I don't trust anybody else to do this.  And so they had to figure out how to have us work together.  You married a geek?  No, she's a teacher.  Oh, okay.  And she taught special ed, and that was the perfect qualification for teaching journalists  what a cursor was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The CBS interactive CMS burned me once too many times to write directly into it.  So I stopped doing that long time ago.  There's that.  Just I go way back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will do it as I'm writing.  I'm like, this is a bad idea.  This is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it dies.  It's the worst bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go so far back.  Did I tell you the story about the Chicago Tribune CMS?  Did I ever tell you this story or not?  No.  Tell us.  Stop me if I did.  So the first one was a scab system, and I didn't realize that.  I trained the entire newsroom for the first time ever working on computers.  This is a cursor.  You have to have the cursor where you want to do something.  No, no, no.  Move the cursor.  This is how you move the cursor.  You can't just start that way.  So I taught everybody that.  Then they wanted a new system.  And my job was to go and just brainstorm with the staff and say, what kind of functions  would you want?  And then I left to go to San Francisco.  Well, they put every function that the staff wanted in the stupid system.  There was a button that the copy editors wanted that if the writer said the first reference  US when they should state United States, it would explode it.  If it was a second reference to the United States, then it would shrink it.  They made a whole button just for that.  Oh my God.  They added all these features in there and every feature in.  But then the cost went so high, so they ended up cutting back on some stuff and the paper  didn't come out a couple of days.  And they they sicked their Pulitzer Prize winning investigative task force reporters  to investigate their own CMS.  And what had happened was they cost cut and they took out memory and backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We we didn't think you needed that save button.  So we just eliminated that.  That's hysterical.  All right.  I think we should wrap this thing up and coming up.  It's time for our picks of the week.  And today I'm going to start with that because I always end with it.  So I'm going to start with it.  For picks of the week, your pick of the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have two.  One is OWC SSDs because I've been trying to increase the storage on my home rig here.  And of course, over time, SSDs start to get a little bit slow.  And this one, I've had it for a couple of weeks and been throwing a couple  Lightroom catalogs at it and even throwing proxy files and cache files to it to do some  video processing.  And it's been quite fast and it's so refreshing.  I just hope that this will last for another six months or so.  And I can still say this, but OWC claims it's not going to slow down.  But we shall see.  But I wanted to give them a shout out.  OWC Mercury Stream SSDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's so funny because I always think of them as a Mac company.  Their website is macsales.com.  But you're using a Windows machine.  Which cracks me up.  I'm on a Windows machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just plugged it into a SATA port on my motherboard and been firing away with it.  And I also tried it out just as an external SSD.  I have an adapter and I plug it into the laptop via USB.  But I get better speed plugging it into the motherboard and doing my workflow that way.  But I like the pricing on it.  It was $120 for a 480 gig, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, sounds right.  Yeah, I buy their stuff nonstop.  I'm an OWC fan.  Yeah, I said I'd give them a shout out because it's actually working.  Good.  Good.  What else?  You had two, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  And the other one is called Old Pilot Plane Tales.  But there's one in particular where he talked about, this is an airline pilot, former airline pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is a great podcast.  The airlinepilotguy.com.  It's a great podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it when you plug him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But this particular episode, he talks about doing the public address as a pilot or as a  flight attendant.  And there's some pretty interesting tidbits in there.  It made me think about even just doing podcasting because if people watch Mr. Leo Laporte, he says  things a certain way and it just comes out a certain way to present a certain message  and a certain feeling and emotion.  And it's the same when it comes to doing the public address when you're 30,000 feet in  the air and you're trying to keep people comfortable going across the ocean and things like that.  It was pretty interesting.  But at the end of that, it's a pretty funny story that I think you should check out.  I will listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm kind of an aficionado of poor airline announcements.  Yeah, because some things you just don't want to hear.  According to Thomas Wolff, Tom Wolff, not Thomas Wolff, Tom Wolff in The Right Stuff,  all airline pilots are basically emulating Chuck Yeager because he had a Texas kind of twang  and he was very relaxed.  No, no, it wasn't Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was West Virginia.  My father went to high school with Chuck Yeager.  Oh, right.  My father went to high school with Chuck Yeager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he has a certain way of talking and of course, he has the exact same accent as pilots.  Yeah, he was the great pilot, right?  He was the original test pilot.  Everybody, every pilot tried to sound like Chuck Yeager.  Yeah, and he does, right?  Isn't that right, Jeff?  When you hear it, you hear Chuck Yeager.  Oh, yes.  Oh, I hear it.  I hear Chuck Yeager.  I hear my father.  We're flying at 30,000 feet and maybe arriving in the...  Yeah, they all sound like they came from Virginia.  West Virginia.  West Virginia.  That's a unique accent, the West Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a stat in there where he talked about, if you're flying over the Grand Canyon,  the pilots, some pilots would like to get into these long soliloquies about flying over the  Oh, I hate it when they talk so much.  When they shouldn't do that because only 10% of the aircraft can actually see it.  See it.  I know.  So why do that to the other 90% of the people that can't see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The pilots bragging about what the pilot can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wish you could see what I'm seeing up here in the front seat, but it is a beautiful view,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ladies and gentlemen, of the Grand Canyon.  We're going really fast.  We're flying 60,000 feet right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chuck Yeager is still alive, 97 years old from Myra, West Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My father's 94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was a little behind him.  Went to school with him.  That's cool.  By the way, I just want to say Steve Martin has published his Halloween costume on his  Twitter feed, at Steve Martin to go.  He's wearing it right now.  It's a subtle costume.  You might not immediately pick up on it, but there is a fly in his hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that Cote Barrett also had a fly on her outfit?  No, that's a stirruffle.  The same flies going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That fly, it's going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a certain late Supreme Court justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you think it's Ruth?  I think it's Ruth.  It's RBG flying around pestering him.  Oh, man.  Stacey, what's your pick of the week?  It's another cooking thing, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I decided to give you a cooking gadget.  Thank you.  This is the cheaper thermomix.  Looks like an Instapot.  Pressure cooker.  It is like an Instapot, but it's $200.  And it comes with recipes and it has a scale, much like your thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's, by the way, the best feature because you put stuff in and it weighs it.  You don't have to weigh it separately.  I love that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you pick a recipe from the app and then the app connects to the pot.  And it's like, all right, you've chosen to make chicken and rice.  Cut your way, Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Chosen to make special pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so it tells you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I open the microwave, I cut the bag and I put it in and it's great.  This actually looks great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it just a pressure cooker?  Does it brown or do anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It also has a saute function.  Oh, nice.  Seems to be pretty good.  So it does a lot of things.  You can make traditional pressure cooker type foods like beans and things like that,  but you can also make pasta and they've actually engineered things like the way they release  the pressure to help ensure that things cook properly.  So this for people who are like, wow, the thermomix is really expensive.  This doesn't have like the chopping features that that does.  But if you can prep your ingredients, basically it's like dump this in now and you dump it in.  This looks great.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can make a chart in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the pudding, the custard, you make traditionally you make the custard in something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can make, you can actually make a double boiler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kachoi Pepe is calling.  Nope.  By the way, I don't know if we did the right thing for your pick.  I want to just tell people it's airlinepilotguy.com and it's the September 19th show.  It's not what you say.  So I want to make sure people could find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is what he says, but that's the title of the show.  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I loved it.  Jeff Jarvis, I think you should do us a number, but now I know we took.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I will even though I already, I already contributed one of the show  because that's the kind of guy I am.  I want to mention by the way, that Ted Cruz just sent a letter to Jack Dorsey demanding,  why did Twitter censor the New York Post?  By that man, a constitution to be sure to include the Bill of Rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't they have something kind of more important going on  than the post, which is not notoriously reliable?  It's a tabloid.  It's like saying, how dare you censor the National Enquirer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rudy Giuliani is involved, but we're going to leave that aside.  I don't want to give him permission.  So Facebook just gave a $1 million donation to Bletchley Park.  Oh, good.  It's because of COVID to keep them going over the hump here, which is nice.  And then I also want to mention a plug.  You were nice enough to put up the tribute reel, but my scoop awards  keynote, mere 24 minutes about the future of journalism and media and blowing it all up.  If you Google Jeff Jarvis scoop award, you'll find it under video tab.  It's brief.  It's in English.  Here's what I found.  No, you didn't.

Transcript:  I have something.  Ripped poker coaching from Evan Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting because that's my pick of the week is the John Hopkins  University poker course.  It's an intercession course.  So don't get all upset about the fact that this university fine university is teaching its  children to play poker, but it is a course.  That has lectures, slides, video materials, a PDF.  It's all free online.  Hopkins poker course.  I love the syllabus.  I think the syllabus kind of says it all.  This intercession course aims to take students from novices who may know nothing about poker  to average players in two weeks.  Okay.  It's not super ambitious.  The course will utilize hand examples and discussions of common poker situations  to study the fundamentals.  The math, combinatoric and game theoretical aspects of poker will be covered with practical  aspects.  Lectures will focus on core concepts at Texas Hold'em with an emphasis on cash games.  And you'll get a guest lecture by 2005 World Series of Poker Main Event runner up, Steve  Dannenmann.  The runner up.  Well, they couldn't get the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's a free course.  The other guy's off in Bermuda now having a much better time than this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think this is so awesome.  This is what the intercession course should be.  And you know what?  There's probably a little educational material in there.  Yeah.  Like game theory.  Yeah.  Math.  Yeah.  Raise your hand if you're gunning to win a trophy.  That is at hopkinspokercourse.com.  And we have come to the end of this extremely desultory kind of random walk of a show.
