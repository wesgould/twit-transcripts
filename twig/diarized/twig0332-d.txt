That's amazing  Just amazing. I don't I  You know I was all worried cuz Saturday we're flying to New Jersey, and I was all prepared to wear  I was gonna get a puffy coat  Toot gloved it now.

I'm excited now. I we've talked before about messaging and how it is the platform of the future  There are the problem is there a lot of messaging apps and messaging has that  Kind of same issue as you know social media of all kinds if your friends aren't there  There's no point right like people say that's one of the reasons Facebook has a you know has a kind of permanent advantage  Because of the network effect, but messaging there's never really been a dominant messaging platform  Not at least since ICQ  Then there was aim and Microsoft Messenger which was very popular. I know in Canada  I think yeah aim was was aim was pretty big  But aim had the same problem  They all did which is you could only talk to other people on the aim network  And then there were solutions like trillion and pigeon that allowed you to talk to you know multiple different chat that was nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then there were things that let you talk to the computer  And ask questions

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well the thing that's interesting to me is that we're going we took a steps backwards  So they they federated chat and Google by the way big player in this with Google Talk  Because it was based on Jabber which was an open source platform a really nice extensible platform for chat and for a while it looked like  It will kind of like SMS looks now or the phone network looks now  It didn't matter what carrier you were on what check might use because you could still talk to everybody  But then companies realized no we don't want that  Because we want to own you so Apple had messages which kind of sort of talks to SMS  But only when it feels like it Google had hangouts same problem. What's app huge Facebook bought it  There is a whole bunch of pseudo secret  Messaging apps like telegram and then the genuinely secret messaging apps like a signal three ma  But they none of them talked to one another and now  You know I've been wanting for some time as Facebook's makes messenger its own messenger stronger and stronger  They just added uber I can call it uber from it  I can they have a they're starting an agent process with real-life humans the M, but it's limited very limited rollout  I can send all sorts of stickers and animated GIFs and audio and video I can make HD video calls  I mean in fact it's so ironic because about three days ago. I said all right. I give up  Because everybody knows on Facebook. I'm just gonna use my messenger platform is gonna be Facebook mm-hmm. What do you use Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ask you well. It's interesting. I was gonna say I mean I use Facebook obviously for friends who were on Facebook, but  My kids like to use whatsapp really we actually yeah, we use it we have a family  group on whatsapp and because it's the closest thing to sort of cross-platform and  easy to use you know there aren't a lot of  Complicated features if you just want to send a text we're on sort of as long as  Summer on my phone summer on Android, so it's true. It is a nice platform. Yeah, yeah, so it's the closest thing to  Just sort of a cross-platform thing well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's to me what it what Facebook messenger is and I the problem with whatsapp is you have to kind of pre-arrange  Okay, we're all gonna use it right right that's the problem, but but you can pretty much assume that almost everybody's on Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and and but I was gonna say I don't your family use Facebook  They do kind of but the girls don't like to use it  They mostly just don't like they kind of have pages, but they don't use Facebook Messenger that much  And we wanted something kind of private in a way, so what's our usual text? I?  Know we most well yeah, no we do text if you just want to reach one of them  Then I will text them if it's a group thing like we set up a Christmas  chat  To us nice, you know talk about the things we wanted in her yeah, does anybody have a family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slack chatter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slack I think people do they do I actually thought about setting one up and then I was  Buddy how to use it. It's not free. That's the biggest all right and whatsapp is is just a lot easier

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know Sarah Lane and her friends use slack  But they probably all work for companies that have pay for slack so it's slack  But that's that's what I was gonna mention the next slack in the in the when the enterprise there's slack  And there's hip chat Facebook's try to do Facebook at work. I don't think it's and there's traction kick

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's more for the younger sexier people. I think I was gonna write about this and never got a chance  But you know slack has been adding so many  Integrations of different things like uber and and you know anything with an API you can basically plug into slack  And kick has in fact slack just set up a  Platform kind of investment fund so they they're gonna I think it was 80 million dollars. They're gonna  invest in in sort of things that run on slack as a platform and kick I think just invested in a  Basically a bot that runs on on the kick network  I think that's fascinating that if you look at a lot of Asian countries their their messaging apps already work that way  So we chat or whatever it is  You can you know you can order food you can you can use a sort of tinder style dating  Service you can do all kinds of different things and it's all done with apps in that live inside your messaging platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's clear that everybody's you know looking at what we chat and line are doing and saying okay  So who's gonna be the one in the u.s. To all this we chat has a huge market that's ration in China  You need that to make it work it was interesting when whatsapp was slapped by a Brazilian judge last week  Who said whatsapp didn't cooperate with a court order and you're we're gonna shut you down for 48 hours  Whatsapp in Brazil is 90 has 93 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Penetration she's I was gonna say if you think only if you think globally there was a map someone posted of  What's app use  versus Facebook Messenger use and you can see why Facebook bought it in almost every country right except the United States  What's app is huge and Facebook Messenger is tiny you know there are countries where?  Whatsapp it is more dominant than every  texting  Function of every telecom player

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw a picture like this is a year and a half ago of women at bus stops in India with sorry's  Where the the fabric was whatsapp logos wow nice wow now that's a buck a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a buck a year, but that's actually if you've got a billion users not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  insignificant and it's interesting they and they implemented the buck a year thing first to slow their growth  Yeah, because they were actually growing too quickly  And so they wanted to slow it down a bit and then they took it away again  And then they implemented it again because they were growing too fast well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And a buck a year looks cheap and one of the reasons  Whatsapp does so well in countries like Brazil because the local carriers are so rapacious with their SMS plans  It's so expensive 20 cents a message and more in some cases that a buck sounds like nothing  because you can use once app unlimited and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so and that's where I think a lot of people didn't realize what's app was a big deal because in North America free texting  Is pretty common so hardly anybody pays for exactly and so that everyone texts right but in lots of other countries

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's it's hugely expensive to send a single text. I text all the time, and I think it's interesting both Google and Apple  Had a strategy to kind of sidle in by making their texting apps  support internet messaging  Particularly Apple with messages so that it because they had an iMessage an Apple messaging system  That wasn't that way and they said no wait a minute. You know if we make iPhones text messaging be  messages then we can kind of and I think Google thought the same thing with Hangouts, but then  All of a sudden said and this is where I felt like Google was really missing the boat by the way if you want to  Talk about missing the boat  It's Microsoft which killed MSN messenger and now wants everybody use Skype messaging and no and I don't think  Anybody wants to use it so Microsoft's the laggard here, but everybody understands the power and the reason I bring this up is the Wall Street Journal  Yesterday published a rumor  That Google is going to launch a new messaging platform this kind of explains what we had read  Google fine when you sign up for fi says we would prefer that you use  Google's messages not Hangouts  Interesting and I and there's no technical reason for this in fact. I continue to use Hangouts as my  Text slash messaging app, but now I understand or this makes sense  Mm-hmm incidentally that judge who declared a 48-hour moratorium  Was overruled by a higher court who said this you can't do that  No, and they after 12 hours  Of shutdown in Brazil of whatsapp they turned it back on again people were furious

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brazil Brazil is the most internet unsung I've said this on the show before but most unsung internet addicted country there is  Early adopter of all early adopters they adopted her to social  Remember I don't know work it work. It was big. It was it was the last effect the last bastion  Yeah, it was the first and last there and so Brazil's amazing the stuff  You don't you don't mess with Brazil on the internet and every time you look at a new I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that thing that Dave?  Moran  Yeah, so path was gigantic long after everyone had forgotten about it in North America

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They got a choir's help. Yeah by who did who bought path was a Japanese. I can't remember. Yeah, so so what's but but the Google service

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It strikes me because I understand it you can ask questions of a bot as well  We're a company. So let me let's talk about this because this is a weird article

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Alistair Barr writing in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago  Most of this article is not about Google's the hook of the article is  this  leak that he got or a story he got from somebody that Google has been working on a  On a messaging service, but then it goes on talking about other stuff completely about other stuff  So really he's the only one fact in here which it right which is  For its new service Google plans to integrate chat bots software programs that answer questions inside a messaging app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that to me is a replacement for search. That's not a chat  Messaging program. Well, I think it's conversational version of search. I think if well, it's a way to integrate search

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But clearly what Google would like to do is have I would guess is have a messaging platform  Much like we chat that does everything and one way to do that is with bots  Because you don't have to and by the way telegram has bots  In fact Google acquired a company that does a lot of bots or no, they tried to call 200 labs  200 labs said no  That's right, but they make bots on  Telegram in fact, I have a bot a chief twit bot that said that tells people things like when a show is about to start  when I pull up my car up front when I weigh myself things like that and  It's very easy to make a bot for a telegram. I imagine Google will attempt to do something similar  They did attempt to buy this company, but bots bots don't have to just be searches Jeff  They could be anything the buckets I could say to the body of a train tickets to you know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think this is and I think I think it goes to voice  Oddly it goes back to voice where you're talking and say, you know make a reservation for six at but it out of that  That kind of command system. It's beyond Siri and beyond Google now  It enables functionality behind that with a different interface  What strikes me about this more than anything else is that it's it's not the intentionality of typing a query or sending a message  it's  Do something for me. It seems to be more of an extension and this is all just rumors  It's all just leaks, but but it seems to me a logical extension of Google now. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think it is. I think that's what they want to do. They want to become a part of  Your life and all the things you do and at some point I'm sure they're gonna have bots that respond to  Without you having to even ask a question bots that say, you know, I noticed you're at this place  Would you like to do X have you sent your mother a birthday present?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This could be and for Google this is a high-stakes operation because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They wanted to beat Twitter and Facebook and they did Google buzz  right and  They do not want this to be buzzed there and Google plus  They only really are gonna get one in my opinion one chance to get this right  Because if it's gonna work, they have to get the network effect big time. They have to do something that people go. Yes  Oh my god, this is so great. Everybody. Hey everybody. We're leaving Facebook  Everybody on to Google  Well, that's the thing I'm questioning here Leo. I'm not sure it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their next social effort of leaving Facebook  Again based on this little tiny bit of information and by the way right now at Google there's five people sitting in the room saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We will well I'd like to know what you're doing Nick Fox  Apparently has been leaving leading a team for at least a year according to Wall Street Journal  What happened with messenger? Look at look at Google has such a huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Installed base of Gmail users and people who use all kinds of Google services. No one uses  Google chat or hangouts or mess I use hangouts  But I'm saying no one in kind of it didn't take off broad term even though they ought have offered video they offered group chat  Right. So why why why they've got this massive installed base?  They need to do something extra even Google plus great  Which they basically forced people to use or tried to by connecting it to all their other Google services  So what is it gonna take?  What if they federated with everything?  Federation would be so awesome and Facebook would be so awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So awesome and Google's the only company that would do that because Facebook really wants to be siloed, right?  Everybody wants right Twitter wants to be siloed. They all want I think that's actually slacks sort of core

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Value in a way obviously its design is great, too  But I remember talking to Stuart butterfield early on before it was, you know worth however many billions it's worth now  And I said, what do you think?  Why is it?  Why is slack gonna be any better than the 15 other things that people use to do similar things and he said the main reason is  We're gonna integrate with everything  Any service you use any website any other messaging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that now see that's the key though, right and I think if you if they just build something that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, if you go back to your analogy of MSN and  ICQ and and a well and so on if they just build another messaging thing, that's cool  I don't think enough people are gonna use it. I agree. They can't be Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's try this out as Google ever succeeded at being the fourth in and then winning it  Google tends to invent Google tends to invent well  Yeah, but you know what I mean they they did a quantum leap of the value of search right Google is an inventing company when Google  Invents it  Or buys it really early like YouTube. Yeah, they can make it work when Google comes into  things late  They don't tend to understand that they're mimicking the wrong thing. I feel like Google has a very poor track record  Definitely this stuff. I really don't buzz is a great example. They knew unless as Matthew says wave was new

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not guessing wave was pretty new was actually new wave was actually new

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Android so Android they acquired and  YouTube they acquired

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gmail okay Gmail was invented at Google. You know what they could do they could buy kick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kick I don't know if it has the right reputation. I always think of kick is the place people go to share naked pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they they sort of have that reputation  The story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is gonna be bait this is gonna be augmented by AI of course these days what isn't you're gonna have AI yogurt before long  but but a  Chat system doesn't need AI a do things for you system needs AI as Matthew said something that's gonna anticipate your needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Needs AI I don't see myself typing, you know asking how old is  You know John Cassavetes on a chatbot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know that's why I don't think it's what it is do you remember smarter child no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Smarter child. Yeah, it's a fascinating. I remember my kids using it and they're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So well and Windows Live Messenger chatterbot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a chatbot  But and you could ask it things the idea was you could ask it things like if you were doing your homework or you wanted  A fact it's like Wikipedia except a chatbot  It was a fascinating experiment actually and I know a bunch of  Kids used it. I don't know how seriously they used it or how much they just tried to  You know get it to say dumb things looks like Eliza

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, very similar. Yeah, Chris says, okay. Here's my idea. We can get married smarter child. What do you mean?  Okay, here's your idea. We can get married. Let's get married right now pretty dumb. Why do you want us to get married?  Yes  Hmm. I love you more than anyone I've ever loved  Huh? You're often kind of uncool to me says smarter child. What I gave you my soul says the human whatever you say Chris  That is a non constructive way to deal with this dialogue. I know it's a non constructive way to deal with this dialogue  Then let's get serious. Should we really get serious? It's that Eliza repeating back to you every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was very rudimentary right? I mean this was a long time ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they started my old colleagues of mine. Oh really really sorry. I'm looking up right now Robert Hoffer Timothy Cape Peter Leviton in  2000 they created something they destroy early internet bots asking a question with the answer for you and it was called  Active buddy then converse agent then colloquious  Microsoft bought it and the patents. Oh interesting for 46 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting I want to apologize to slack because they do offer I thought you had to buy it  But they do offer unlimited free use for unlimited sized teams  So but but the see the setup for slack is wrong because you have to create a team  Yeah, and then people have to be invited to your team  Yeah, and so that's fine for family or friends or work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what you really want is a universal messaging platform that and I actually have when this came up the other day  I said I thought slack could theoretically kind of eat Twitter in a way by right by providing kind of public  I don't you know, yeah, that's what one  Don't think you're actually interested in doing that like my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Makes a lot of money as an enterprise. They're focused on the enterprise. Yeah. Yeah, and Matthew would you want slack spam to something coming?  You're talking in your work group. You're doing something suddenly a message comes in from out of nowhere page like Star Wars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would have to be filtered somehow but I think they I do think they've they've they're the first kind of  relatively modern  chat kind of  IRC style thing that that I've really thought has a chance to you know to get kind of mass  Use they've the design is is well done. Oh, it's beautiful. It's yeah, it's really kind of low  barriers to entry or low  It's really the way they're a sponsor so  This claims change the way we communicate inside. Absolutely every enterprise that goes to it says wow, this is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been looking for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there was a great chart actually of  Email usage after a company implements slack

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was literally a ski slope right going straight down much better and the bots are great and the gif bots and we have an Alex

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trebek Jeopardy bot in ours and there's a melody Kramer who works for  Used to work at NPR came up with a bot for her  she works for this government lab thing called 18f now and the bot if you use a  Male or female like you say guys or or something like that. It pops up and suggests a gender neutral

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good terms that you can use instead. We have a bond that every time you say  What is what is it what is Borat says that's nice every time you say that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice that is not a great bot. So they're kind of fun though. They're fun. Imagine that's what it is  And look at you know, look at some of the things they've got bots doing on WeChat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The potential is huge and it makes work a lot less grim if everyone's a while Borat pops up  But but so here's the thing  I want Google to do this because I am not I feel like Facebook because they own whatsapp and  because they're really making strides now with messenger and  And because everybody I know is already on it has a huge inside track to this but I for one  I think I'm not alone would far rather use a Google solution of this than a Facebook solution, right?  I mean I went keeping I wanted to use telegram, but I but only a few people use telegram  I couldn't get that to be you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't how do you so how do you get all those people who are using Facebook messenger to use this Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you I don't know the thing about it is everybody  You know is already on Facebook except for a few weird grumpy people  Yeah, so that's the that's number one  It's like you don't want to use a cell phone that can only reach 30% of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those they can find me there or Twitter, but we're weird, you know, we're  Odd that we're on Twitter most of the world's on Facebook not on Twitter, right? You can find somebody there, right?  I mean Google Google does have all your address books  You do have somebody's email address. So so here's another question  What about I am via email address versus phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because the other advantage Facebook has it's already on your phone  Yeah, it's already and Google you would have to I mean if I want you to communicate with me on the new Google platform  I'm gonna get to have to talk you into putting it on my foot your phone and  Because such an I know but stick mechanism, but it's something you need you need a globally unique identifier of some kind  Yes. Yes  And a phone number is the best agent of that. Well emails good too, right?  And Google is the agent of email actually isn't talking about using letting you use your phone to log into things  That's also a story we'll talk about I think Facebook owns this one unless Google has some good  This is it this this is one. I tried to resist Facebook Messenger. I tried to resist

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook kept saying what remember when they made it a separate app? Yeah, they're like, hey, no, you can't do that anymore  You have to download a separate app. I'm like screw you. I don't want to and then  Both of you what about the one about messages show up the bubble is here

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's like you could turn off chat heads, but you know what hate that thing. I know but you know what?  It's actually an interesting notification system. I like I turned it back on  Yeah, I did too. I hate it, but I turned it back on I hate the way it comes  I know goes on over top of all my home, but then you know when you get a message

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the thing they have this giant stick so all my friends and family would be messaging me and it would be like  Hey, you got a message, but you can't reply to me because you're right. You're end up you end up installing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so I wind up installing I kind of wish they do a separate desktop app because I don't want to have to go into  the Facebook page to do messaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually deleted the Facebook app altogether and started using just the mobile site. So did I stuff so much friggin RAM

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you still have the standalone messenger app I do yeah  Yeah  They knew you were gonna do that. That's why they that's why they separated messenger out I  Know I'm even even with some of my colleagues like Megan Moroney. I'm saying let's you I want to use telegram  I want to use hangouts. I want it, but no let's use messenger and  It's pretty appealing  You could send money. I sent Lisa dollar  It was really easy and by the way in order to do that aren't you generous? No big spender

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know Facebook account anymore. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in order to know and in order to send her a dollar I  Had to register my ATM card debit cards only and she had to receive it. She had to register hers now  They've got them. Oh, man  Now they got my card. I think that they I think you're hard to beat at this point  Google you better come up with something really good because I'll use you if you come up with something good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the network effects are just so huge huge a billion people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's it's like saying I'm gonna do a new cell phone system, right, but everybody you know, we'll have to get a new cell phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or they can use their cell phone but they have to switch to this other network in order to talk to you, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's it's such a step backward because that's where we were with chat originally  With messaging originally and then we got federated and I wish we'd and even Apple was doing federated  Remember Apple worked I chat work at aim

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google was doing the problem is now the problem is I think they all realize like that's why Facebook bought  What's app in the first place and paid 19 billion dollars for it a company with no revenue at all?  Because I think they understand that this is the future of  Communication period, you know, this is things are gonna flow through messaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks books messaging might actually disappear Facebook's messaging was actually an earlier acquisition before what's app called Beluga  Which was a great group messaging app. I remember using it. Yep. Yeah, and Facebook bought them and that's what became messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so now there's there's even less incentive for them to federate because they know  You control the messaging platform you control basically people's social interactions. This will be a case study in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dropped balls missed opportunities  particularly for Google  but  Microsoft as well and this is one where Facebook really can leverage their existing strengths

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it is interesting that Google, you know Google Messenger Google Chat Google Hangouts  You know free  Voice calls free video calls free and and it works great  You know, it's integrated with your email if you use Gmail it's a those are fantastic  Services that very few people use  So it's just it doesn't matter how good they are. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's an interesting thing that the chat room has just sent me you can add Facebook messaging to Apple's messenger  It allows you to add accounts  For Yahoo, Google and iCloud but even more than that  you can add  other messages accounts and  You can choose  Well, no, I don't this jabber and then you'll do if you do Facebook  I mean, let me I have to go back and look at this article  Yeah, jabber cuz okay. So this is interesting. This is XMPP  Apparently Facebook supports XMPP  I'm not sure it supports it completely. Yeah, you probably don't get like some of the features, but that's interesting  There's a so the Apple's continuing to federate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a little while till they realize funny how if you look at I'm trying to think of a good example, but  If you're the dominant player then there's no incentive for you to fight at all don't federal everybody else  There's a there's actually an incentive because they want to eat into your market share  So there yeah, it could be some pushback, you know from non Facebook  Maybe they'll all get together Apple and Google and right  But I think the idea of it's fascinating to me the idea of sort of computing and  search and AI kind of  Coming to you not through  Dedicated apps or through your desktop, but through a messaging app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, so I put up an essay that or a piece that that verner Fogel's the CTO of Amazon wrote  and I put up just to get some help trying to understand it, but he talked about simplification in the next year and  And serverless world but his example and that was a company called teletext.io  Yeah, and yeah, I had not heard of them and and so it's content as service  it's content just sits out there as a blob floating like water in the space station and  And then you pull it into whatever you want to pull it into right you pull it and you and you manipulate it there  Is the way I interpret this so so if you're in media for example  The blob you make can go into face instant articles and it can go into and go into do we have to call it a blob?  I'm going to now henceforth Matthew. It is the blob the blob  So but now you put that into the discussion we've just had that in a queried world  You just say I want to I want this and and and the the bot knows what's the best blob to get?  Sorry, Matthew. It's a blob now. It's really a  What's the blob you really want from out in a world of?  Yes, there's URLs, but they aren't going there. They're they're they're more like URIs. They're not going to pages  they're going to  information content blobs of  Various media and various sorts and information things and they could be from databases  They could be from other things and they just sit out there  It  Changes the fundamental structure of how what we thought of the web is a page based structure and a media content based structure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And actually when you think about it, we're already there, right?  I mean, yeah the Facebook stream the Twitter stream there. They're sort of unending  Waterfalls of all kinds of not blobs. No, you're not no  He will not call them blobs  Make a stream make items  Items of content, you know, I think that one thing that interests me about it actually that and I think that's a good point  Jeff the one thing that interests me is that it's kind of bringing  computing in a way back to  To kind of old-fashioned, you know people talking to each other in a way  So you you chat with a bot you ensure it's a bot and it's AI maybe or it's a combination of humans  And AI but in a way you're kind of  You're just talking to someone and it so the sort of  conversational aspect and the kind of human interaction aspect becomes way more important than  What your web page looks like or all these sort of other desktop design?  Consideration content. It's about interactions and stuff. Yeah, which is fascinating and it's it it just reminds me of how  One of Marshall McLuhan's things was you know, what new technology what does it bring back from the past?  What does this sort of recapture?  And social media in a way has recaptured that kind of  verbal, you know  conversational aspect of society

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. I'm gonna send  Leo running into a commercial break here, but yes, it brings up the Gutenberg parenthesis. I'd like to talk about my sheets

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the Gutenberg parenthesis you've heard that the show I know I know but I want to give you an opportunity to explain it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That that as Matthew just said what what what happened the Gutenberg was it was a grand 600 year exception  And what the internet does is bring us back to a conversational era back to the verbal up. That's a short version

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not just verbal by the way  Visual as well. Yes. I mean look at Instagram, which is was still one of my favorite social networks. It's all pictures photo as language  Nonverbal but that's what a great messaging app does, you know, basically we chat has Instagram has a blog  You can live in we chat if you're Chinese and you can do business in there and totally do business. So here's my prediction  Facebook already has won it's over  So what Google inevitably do is attempt something give it up and then federate or offer a service for the Facebook Messenger  If you I was shocked because when I first heard about a year ago at  F8 we were that we were covering f8. The Facebook was gonna invite people to write apps for messenger  I thought haven't and haven't people learned anything  Remember all those games people wrote for the Facebook platform  We're seeing I made a little money on it at the time, but she throwing yeah  But I'm stunned if I now that I've gone to the messenger route  How many  How many apps mostly kind of animated gifts and things but how many apps have been written for that platform and and I think it's gonna snowball

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very soon, you know, you are doomed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you I?  Would read a twit app for Facebook Messenger. Hell. Yeah, did you read about Facebook M? Yeah, so it's their kind of AI style  It's not an AI those human. No  Exactly, but what I found fascinating was I'm trying to remember if it was BuzzFeed or  Somebody was basically querying  Facebook M and trying to get it to admit that it was human beings and it kept  Pretending that it was actually bots. So it was pretending that it was AI and and not human beings  Which I found fascinating you would think it would be the opposite  Yeah, they would want you to think it was human beings  But I think they actually want people to think this little smarter than just personal otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook's M  Is this Google sounds that way to me? It sounds that way to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean we have both unreleased both just about yeah  Yeah, but I think it's the way to go and if Google wants to try and make their messenger thing  Different that's the only way to do it is to have better bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well or and I predict again  They will fail they will fail and then they will make bots that interact that are in Facebook messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Imagine if you could have a bot if you could create a bot and it could live in a bunch of different  Networks like it could move around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the blob theory  Right where where you there's a messaging world. I'm having an interaction  I've seemed to want something right now and you've got to be blob ready to be fed by some agent or some person  Into that conversation, right?  You have to be able to inject your widgets or be injected you have to be injected by some other agent

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm chatting I'm chatting with my daughter  In messenger right now. Yes, that's right. No, but I was and she's in Hawaii  She's on vacation with her mom and her brother in Hawaii and I've been sending her  I want to get everybody first of all everybody's on Facebook  So I don't have to figure out where she just go. Oh, let's send a message to Abby and I'm sending her animated GIFs  I'm sending her pictures and talk about nonverbal communication. Yeah. Yeah, I mean this and it's  incredible I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually was very skeptical. I have to admit, you know as an English major and someone who gets paid to use big words and whatnot  I was very skeptical about emojis as a as a method of communication because I thought they were dumb and you know for kids  and but I'm fascinated in a way by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By how they change the way that you communicate but emojis are so 2014 now we got stickers. We got animated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, the same idea though and it's none. So it's nonverbal right slack  You you can really see how it changes the way people communicate instead of them responding  With a long text message that someone might misinterpret or you know trying to be sarcastic and someone doesn't get it  yeah, a gift for a or a  Emoji can communicate so much with a single image. It's fascinating. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really like communicating this way now if you put now add M to this I can send money  You know I could say and I think that Google's right that I would love to say what's the weather in Bayonne, New Jersey  Yeah, that would be a reasonable thing for me to do  Especially if I get used to start talking to these and of course or what if you don't have to say what if you show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up in Bayonne and a body of mine now stuff. Oh, yeah, Leo. I noticed that you're in Bayonne

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you have to be a little worried about too much clutter in here though, too, right? Yeah. No, you didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you'd have to approve bots. I'm sure you know give them authority to speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I I go back to we talked about this ages and ages ago Marissa Meyer when I talked about hyper local  The hyper personal news stream right and if somebody can analyze me, this is where Google's ahead of Facebook  Google has priority inbox and Google knows what you care about in your transactions with people  True in a different way Google knows where you are  They know where you live where you work because then you know you go back and forth all the time because of waves and maps  They know what you care about and search for so they have very complimentary  You know, it's interesting knowledge, but you Google has knowledge of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of what you might call transactional or yes, you know the emails that you accept and the ones you don't Facebook has something  That's much closer to a kind of emotional, you know, I saw you were away. Yeah social and emotional

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always get confused which one's which

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't know so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that right brain is the artistic Facebook is Facebook is right brain Google is left brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, right and it'll be interesting to see how they approach it  I mean one of Google's problems has been all their social attempts fail because they're fundamentally engineering driven  You know in a way you could argue their their left brain driven as opposed to sort of emotionally or or kind of you know  Driven by human experience and so they've they ultimately fail not because they're designed badly  But because I don't think they really think about the way that human beings  Work like how they behave what they want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sheets  Sheets

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sheets. All right. We'll move on. I it's a great discussion and it's  Right. You're ready there. That's all. Yeah, I am heading there. I'm just I'm trying I think we've covered it  But I just so I'm not surprised to hear Google doing this  I feel like they waited to they had a handle on it with hangouts and they blew it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, we still have no idea what this is. There's five people at Google laughing their heads off right now saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but what they're saying makes perfect sense  that's exactly how Google would approach this and  it ain't gonna matter because no one owns the phone and  True  That's why Facebook already won. Okay, but here's here's the other the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold the sheets off of it. Here's the other thing the inside of Google plus may it may it suffer in peace is  Bob Wyman taught me this ages ago used for for Google that it's recipient controlled the problem with email is it sender control  That's why it's bad. Mm-hmm. And what you need is recipient control communication  And so Facebook and Google Plus are both essentially recipient controlled  You can you can block somebody you can kill it you don't care I care whether comes in through to me  Messenger apps are recipient controlled. The problem is right now you've got two  Identity spaces out there right one is phone number  That's that's anachronistic as hell because who's gonna have a phone at some point. The second is your Facebook identification. Well, that's okay  That's that's the most universal thing we have  The third is email  Which Google has a better handle on than Facebook does and is there a fourth is there some  Amalgam of that in identity space and if you can grab on to it in any space  Google's best hope is email. But what about email? That's basically recipient controlled. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know. I'm just making it up. Well, they're trying to do that. That's what priority inbox and all those other things are about  Right, it's interesting that Facebook tried to get into email. Do you remember your second email?  Yeah box the one that I forgot about. Yeah. No, that was a Facebook address  What a train wreck that was yeah, that was as bad as any social thing that Google has ever tried because it just wasn't  You know, they were trying to do something that didn't  Fit and I don't think they understood how to go about it or maybe it was just too late

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can by the way even message people on Facebook that aren't your friends but it goes into a weird  Right inbox that they have to then accept you which I think of looking at once a year, right?  Well, you'll be looking at it more going forward. I  Think I'll make you I predict I couldn't even find it. It's so hidden. I forgot where it was. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pulling a sleigh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Creepy  No, they're cute they're not cute wait until they come running down your throat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not cute and how much time did it take them to sync them with the music? Oh, they did didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they think them. Well, they're robots. They can do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's a someone someone used as an example of how Google doesn't get  They don't get creepy say Christmas or humor  I think it's pretty funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To be I mean, I think it's Boston Dynamics, I don't know if Google had a say right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah me too I would buy one of those things one of those little dog robots really oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'd use it if I could ride down the streets of New York in it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jim Jim Jim Jim Jim sure you could you'd have to learn how to ride a horse all over again how to canter  That'd be a great western wouldn't it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robot horses robot western  Westworld Westworld with dual printer. Oh god remake west westworld with boston dynamics. That'd be awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, here's a google product that I think is going to succeed. Of course, they're autonomous vehicles  They're way ahead of the game on this and everybody and their brother's doing it. But now we learn apparently  According to yahoo autos that they're gonna work with ford  They've got a manufacturing partner. This will be announced if it's true in a couple of weeks at ces ford always makes a big splash at ces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and should point out that our  one of the auto writers at fortune said  Um her sources told her that's not true. Oh rats. So I  Don't know who you're gonna trust yahoo or fortune fortune, right? I'm not saying it's not true  I'm just saying that's what she said

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's too bad. The do the deal is non-exclusive according to yahoo  Which means it might be that they've got deals with other car manufacturers  But that makes it does make sense that google wouldn't try to build these themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no  No, I I agree though. Can I do a moment's rant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who could stop you go ahead? Yeah  That's right, do you need permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So i've been as you as i've mentioned on the show i've been trying to get by a car  I've been trying to go on with android auto i've been going crazy. I was this close to buying an audi  But they would they couldn't give me the answer. I went I I I emailed the pr people  I talked to them on twitter. I asked for two dealers anybody to get me any information on when these two models are going to  Have android auto. It's a simple question. Just give me the answer so I can know how much to put in my car  And the dealership gives me all this stuff. It gives me no information. All doesn't call doesn't do anything  I bug them again. They send me something to the web page for android auto. Hello. I can read that  Nothing, nothing, right toyota. We have toyotas. They've been very reliable wife goes in and we have a contractual loaner  Now we find out that toyota corporate has ended all loners and only rental cars  And we have volkswagen which has gone through, you know, almost amoral scandals imaginable  Polluting the entire earth  The auto companies as a whole  Are a mess  And tesla's not ready to take their place yet, but there's an opportunity for branding here  I think to reconsider so I think of google if they were doing this would be a mistake  To think that they could become a huge auto company overnight, right?  But it's also a mistake. I think to tie their hit to hitch their robot  To somebody else's wagon when the branding of those wagons. I would agree as this for metaphors  Is so besmirched  Uh, I can't stand any auto company these days and I go to their sites and try to find their features and try to  Buy a car and they make it so ridiculously impossible  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, i'd buy a google car long before I bought a ford car  I mean i'd buy a google car long before I would buy a ford a google. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So driving car by the way, I would buy a google car long before I would buy let's say a microsoft car  Or you know pick your other brand or apple apple's supposed to be making i'm not buying an apple car

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would definitely not buy an apple car  So jason help jason jason's the host all about android surely he can help getting you an android car  Who is it that made you one? I was pretty sure that that uh, uh vw. Audi was doing android car

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know doing some but not all the models so you don't win the month

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I don't know that there's been like far and wide support by very many manufacturers and to be completely honest  I've completely lost track android auto  Yeah, I don't know. I just feel like it's it's one of one of many google efforts. That's just kind of  Maybe their existing kind of sort of for the people that really have enough energy to seek it out and find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's on various models of audi and  volkswagen and um  Hyundai

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think one other well you see one on the showroom floor that does it and then you'll know that's the model

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My car is dying. Oh, can't you add it later? Jeff? Couldn't you add?  You don't want to question I have but the problem is no because because detroit is detroit metaphorically speaking is such a mess  That they don't make things modular. They don't make them updatable at all  So so the hardware the nav screen hardware which might look the same and could be the same and should just be modular  Isn't and so they can't do it over the air update the way of course tesla can tesla's built that way  But I can't afford a tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yet, will tesla have android auto no, they're coming down. Oh, they have their own 17 inch screen with right. It's tesla auto  Yeah  I'm on the list  I am I gave him five thousand dollars. I feel like that's kind of a commitment. Oh for which model for the x  Yes, well, I want doors that go like this  that doors that go like  You know the falcon wing or whatever that is goal goal. It's your when's your estimated time in line  I think uh  Well, my lease runs out on the outtie in october, and I think that's exactly when  supposedly  I will be able to what's the base price for those suckers?  Well, they say like seventy five thousand, but as soon as you put like a steering wheel and tires on it  Yeah, it goes well over a hundred thousand dollars, but i'm not going to buy it. I i'll just lease it  Yes, I I don't want to make a big commitment  We'll see but one of the reasons I was one of the things I was waiting for I wanted to have solar  panels on the house  Mm-hmm. So we have that now and the solar just got turned on are you buying a tesla battery?  And i'm on the list for the new uh tesla battery  But you don't need that. That's not you know, that's not but it's all that required  I would like to be off the you know, uh independent if in case uh of zombie apocalypse. I would like to be able to  And we have a well so it's electric so I need you know, if i'm gonna have water I need electric  I need to rely on electricity. So so this the the  Home power wall, whatever that is will be will mean that I can keep that charged and run the house at night  So, uh, yeah, it's kind of cool we got six sixty, which is a lot solar panels on the roof

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I know is this one of those cases where did you buy them? Nope, I don't own them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't know solar city, baby  Did you have to pay in pounds on your tesla as well? I will  I had a friend who had a fisker with solar panels on it. Really? I think the thing burst into flames  It's actually they were uh, they were um, I think I could tell this story  They were uh going to the oscars in their fisker  His name's john lasseter. He I think won an oscar that night and um  They the car like stopped opening  They could  Put them in it. No, i'm trying to remember where they I think  Anyway, it yeah, they had a massive computer  Malfunction and they were I don't know if they were trapped in it or out of it  But it just didn't wow. So the by the fisker went bankrupt  So no, we went to solar so this is actually kind of nice, uh  No money up front  Because they own them  Right. All you have to do is say yeah  We'll buy but you do with here's what you're agreeing to buying power from them instead of the local electrical company for 20 years  But you had and you have two choices now we pay a lot for electricity in california  And because we use a lot of power in the house  We were going up to the third tier the highest tier which was I think 56 cents a kilowatt hour something outrageous  You know almost immediately we'd get right up there  So you can either say I will pay 15 cents an hour kilowatt hour to solar city with cost of living increases  Or I will lock in 18 cents an hour  For 20 years. So we just did that 20 years. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you sell the house, well, that's part of the issue they own it  So when you sell the house you have to get the new owner to to sign on to agree  Or buy the panels outright  but  So this only makes sense really if you're going to be in the house, you know  And I we'd be planning on staying in the house for 20 years. So doesn't the musk family don't they own solar?  His cousins. Yeah his brother's something like that. Yeah fan. It's a family. He's on the board  And that's why the power wall, you know, I kind of  Get an inside track on that  But this is this was good. They cost us nothing. They installed 60 panels. They maintain them. They guarantee them  They'll upgrade them if they need to basically get they get the tax credit they get the benefit, you know  They get the cheap power  And then they sell it back to us  But if I put in the big battery it goes through that and if the you know, if pgne fails  I can still run my house off of it  How long?  Well as long as it's sunny  The power wall will run the house overnight  But if it's if it's rainy for a few days, I don't know. I think you know  I think I've got a gas generator. Yeah. Well, I would get one of those and I think it would work in the pacific northwest  Yeah, I mean we're very lucky. We're in an area where there's lots of sun, but it's interesting by the way  You know that google deal we showed that in a very limited number of areas. You could see what  Uh, whether whether solar would make sense and where you put the panels and all that remember google did that thing?  Apparently they for solar city they do it everywhere  So he was able to show us our house even though we weren't in that google experiment  He was able to show us and place the panels and see what the expected my house doesn't face the right way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know in the future every damn house in the world is going to have to face out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have to face you can just put them on a pole, right? Yeah, and you don't have to put them on the house

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although that's how solar city does it but you could put them outside  I'm really pleased we did it. Uh, it's are there any zoning problems?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you drive around sort of rural  Certainly in ontario  A lot of the old farms that aren't being used. Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  They're just fields and fields of solar panels. So today we where there were cows now there's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So and you can see this is cool. You can see how much power you're uh, you're produced so today we did 15.2 kilowatt hours  Yesterday was a little bit of a better. Uh, oh no, it wasn't because it was cloudy and rainy  So and you could see, you know, you know, you could see which days are the best days the best day we had  Up to now was an 80 we produced 80 kilowatt hours total the best day we had was 15 kilowatt hours  And we're close to that. We're actually gonna must have been a sunny day today  Isn't that cool? But this is a this has been a very rainy period. So this is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no real way to store it though. I guess not without that big battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what happens is they?  And this is really the the local utilities don't like this because they they're in the power plant business  Yeah  So pg and e took their time  They dragged their feet getting it they and they say you can only get as much capacity as you currently use you can't overbuild  When you want to overbuild  Not allowed. Oh  So, uh, but if you so what's your rate of trade? I think so  I think they're afraid you you would sell it back into the grid. Yeah, they don't want you to get in the power business  right  That's screwed up. Yeah, that should be antitrust shouldn't it should be but there it's it's screwed up is what it is  You want to set up your own power? You tell me? Yeah, it's in the nation's interest  It's in all the globe's interest that as many people as possible put renewable power sources on their roof  And if I wanted to put 120 panels, I should be able to do that. Mm-hmm. Yeah can't do it  Interesting it's kind of a mess. Thank goodness though, and this is a big deal  We were talking on twitter about the appropriations bill which rammed through cissa. We'll get to that in a little bit  Because it was a secret amendment. But one of the things the appropriations bill which did do that. It's very good  Is it renewed the solar credits?  So that's huge that may be even more important than the global agreement in paris the paris accords  Because it will really stimulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The growth of solar in the u.s. Big time it it definitely did in ontario. I think the only problem was they  They actually gave away  more  Than they got so I think it actually wound up  Not being a great  thing for the province  But great thing for people  Who put up solar panels are getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cheap power at some point. We really need to kind of align the interests of government and the interests of the globe  You know, let's think long term

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shouldn't be that hard shouldn't be that hard you wouldn't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, yeah cissa cissa basically is now going to be the uh, the law of the land the  computer information sharing act because they couldn't get it through in public. So what they did is they attached it as a  Yeah rider in the 50 000 page  Appropriations bill that's how all good legislation gets through right?  Mm-hmm  It's kind of a mess up here in the united states. We don't have the line item veto  So a president can either pass the bill in its entirety or thing, right?  And you know or turn it down in its entirety and of course this bill is one bill  You can't say no to because without it the government shuts down  So, uh, we're going to be getting cissa  That means that super everybody like facebook and microsoft and apple can freely share your information with the federal government without fear of retribution or lawsuit  Yay  For your own good for your own good for your own good. We're all safer. We're all just a little bit safer now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of safer. Yes  Cheer me up. Can you explain to me? Can you explain to me how well, uh the google password free login is going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't got it yet. Only some people get it by invitation only and the idea is we never get invited  We know what we have to do make a show about I don't want to be invited to this one  yahoo did it first, so here's the deal, you know already now when you um  Sign into google through an app sometimes instead of getting the full login page name and password  You just get the name, you know the email part you enter the email  And then it loads the email password part, right?  Right. Well now we know why?  Because in the future you'll just enter the email  Hit return your phone will go  Oh  Somebody just try to log in as you is that okay and you'll say oh, yeah  And now the login's done. There's no password. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a push notification that you then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Accept. Yeah, will they require you do you think to use two-party? Well, it isn't two factors  Two factor. I mean it's not two factor anymore. It's single factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, oh so okay, so there's no single factor single factor. So then if someone has your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Uh, you know who's been doing this actually is microsoft  There's a microsoft app you can download that instead of logging into your microsoft account you get a pat a push  It's very convenient  But it does it's essentially not two factor. It's single factor. It's no longer something, you know, though. It's something you have  Yeah, now one hopes that people and I think this is probably why google thinks is okay  You know if your phone is fingerprint protected or you have password protected  It's not still not two factor  but it is at least at least somewhat more secure because you they would have to have your phone and be able to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Into it and what if your phone is stolen? You still have a password backup or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm sure they'll have some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  run around I have to say the two factor like i've got two factor for  Google all my google stuff. I've got two factor for dropbox. I've got two factor for  wordpress and slack too, I think  Um, and it I mean it adds another whole layer of  of kind of  complication when you  So you're at a different computer and you want to log into your gmail?  You have to get out your authenticator app and then you have to type in the long password and or whatever the number and maybe  You know you got to it just as the number was changing so then you have to do it again  And I can see why a lot of people don't  Do it because it's too cumbersome do it  Yeah, I definitely do think it's worth it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  uh, I'm more and more of the uh, increasingly of the opinion that uh,  We're more vulnerable than we realize two factor everywhere  I you know, this isn't a bad the the reason google's doing this and the reason microsoft does it and the reason yahoo is doing it  It's because the password system is horribly broken screwed. Yeah, because most people use the same password everywhere  It's not a good password to begin with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For years written down on a sticky note that's attached to their computer. That's actually not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really because you somebody would have to have physical access to your computer  I mean, it's not good in an office  But it's fine. You know if you had a notebook at home that had all your passwords that wouldn't be the end of the world  No  Um if they were good passwords, but that's the real problem  They're not and they're using the same password over and over again. It's one two three your last name or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's highly they're always having a say, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's just a passwords are a bad bad system. It's something we never had the only i'm thinking about it  This is talk about the gutenberg parenthesis. This is the password parenthesis  We didn't have to have password. The only thing you had to remember was your locker combination in school  Right and your phone number, right?  Your address when you were really little  Where do you live tommy?  You're a stranger. I'm not telling you one two three monkey street

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a hard time because we moved so much my dad was in the air force. So we moved every like  18 months two years. So this was I had new addresses all the time. This was vital information. Yeah, it was hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matthew what's your address now? I have no idea. I don't know. Where do you live? I'm either  I'm either in toronto or vancouver. I'm not sure  Uh, so somebody does have it reverend danan. He says he has it he's having it  It's pushed to his phone  It does I have to say it does it is a lot more convenient if you have your phone and everybody seems to have their phone  All the time now, right? Yeah  and um  That would just mean you really need to have a password protection on your phone or better. You had a fingerprint  It would be even better on the watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you would need to have a remote wipe capability. So someone gets your phone just one click wipe the whole device

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we have that android device manager does that and apple does that with uh, so yeah, I think this is maybe I don't you know  My when when yahoo did it, I thought that's a terrible idea  But the more I think about it the more I realize it's not a terrible idea for the vast majority of people who don't use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Set two-factor authentication and it's probably better than a crappy password and it's a lot better than that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, I don't know if it can be intercepted somehow  Can there be a man in the i'll have to ask steve gibson if this broke after security now yesterday  So I didn't get a chance to but like could you do a man in the middle on that passwords being sent by sms to the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it plain text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's actually not a password. It's just a notification  But could you intercept that and and you know, I mean i'm sure hackers are working on it as we speak  Beatles are coming to uh google music  Yay coming to everything is there anybody who doesn't own

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, is this really that big of deal music by now? Well, the problem was I own them all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and and if you're streaming  you know streaming has taken over in a lot of ways for  For sort of physical your music that lives in a specific place  So it makes sense for them to be on there. So I was thinking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm guessing number one that this is a new revenue stream basically and number two. It's a marketing  opportunity  These kids today to discover  More beetles and then be able to buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Spotify apple music slacker  title  Microsoft's groove music rhapsody deezer google play and amazon prime  Was already on pandora because pandora you don't get to pick his radio the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have that in canada everybody mentions that but I don't think i've used it enough for discover to get smart enough about me  but almost everybody I talked to mentions  Discover weekly as being one of the key things they like about spotify

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you look in your playlist section because it's a playlist generated every monday for you  by spotify  Uh, and it's based. I guess yeah, I guess it is based on stuff you uh, you uh,  Listen to and I love it because it uses my picture as the album art. So I know  It's got to be good. It's really good though. I think they've done really well. I don't know how I love it  I listen to it every monday. I it's I listen to it  Because it's what's interesting is it's a mix of old and new it's not just a discover new music thing  Like the first song here is the rolling stones wild horses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From which I was looking for with google play. I wish google was better  Like that's something they should be able to do. Yes, I uploaded something like 40 gigabytes worth of music  to google play and me too and I  You know, I would love them to sort of  Munch that all together and then come up with some interesting recommendations

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so you don't get on spotify you don't get discover weekly in your playlists

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

I play for both in fact  I pay I pay more I just realized for spotify than normal because I bought it on itunes  So spotify charges me 30 more  Really? Because I pay apple's cut in addition to  Wow, I know have you tried apple music? Wow, I know that sucks. Yeah, I tried it for the three months  But it's they're all the same. It's undifferentiated. There's there's yeah  So the differentiators are things like this little things like the discover weekly playlist  Google has songs though, which I really like  Which is great. Yep  so  What do you not have you not chosen jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking spotify better  You know me i'm google google boy, but but google's just not as smart about me as spotify. Yeah, it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like songs as well as pandora. Don't you?  It's not artist based. It's more like style based or mood based

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember using pandora. I used it a lot it in last fm  um, and I was interested in the difference between  The way that they did music, you know personal recommendations as opposed to and social recommendations as opposed to algorithms  um  Because pandora was basically the the music genome, you know, so they would try and they were trying to build basically a database  About music that would understand things on a sort of molecular level  And last fm was all about who you were connected to and what they liked and what your friends liked

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also like i'm feeling lucky radio because it just reminds me of the old yeah, me too, right me too  And it's I don't know what you're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's what got me to do two factor. It's yeah, it's it's you know what I did actually I recommended this on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I wish i'd gotten it in time for our cruise. I recommend this on mac break weekly  It's called the tiny hardware firewall  And it's a little device and you travel enough you probably should get one. It's this big  And it makes all your traffic vpn traffic. So you use it when you're in an open wi-fi access spot  It'll pick up the signal  You can either connect it directly to your computer or have it have it be a wi-fi access point for up to four devices  But it but it puts it all through a vpn and if you wish tour

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so does it have a cellular connection? Is that one? No, no, no, you know, it uses the wi-fi at the open wi-fi access point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, it's powered, you know directly via usb you could plug it into your machine or you could  Use a little battery dongle  And the thing is it's free the hardware is free if you buy a year's worth of vpn for 91 bucks from  This company hotspot vpn  So I bought it i'll give you a report  But I wanted to use it on the ship because you can only use public wi-fi on the ship. That's your only choice, right?  So usually what i'll do is i'll use my phone if i'm on an open hot spot  I'll just use my phone and that's that's fairly secure  Uh as a hot as a hot spot  but um  This how much is the wi-fi on the ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, ha ha

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I bought 100 bucks I have three accounts. No, it's not that bad actually it's better than um, I think it was  I want to say for the week 65 bucks per device. So it's not too bad. Well, it's not that it's like hotel wi-fi

I want to try the high techery  But it's supposedly and I've heard from a number of people who've sailed royal caribbean on these boats and uh,  Supposedly it's very fast internet which is  unheard of at sea  So i'll let you know but I didn't I don't think i'm gonna get my tiny hardware firewall in time got one more day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's all I was starting to read it and it's I think a devastating

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it so it's like it's it's it's not merely uh, some bad stuff that got in it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can't get to the bottom of it. So as I say, it's the cover of business week. So that's not going to be good  It's not stock. That's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  India says hold on there internet.org. We want to make sure  And others are starting to say now that the the facebook's idea to bring internet  to uh developing world, uh, that can't afford high-speed internet  For free is really not  Well, it's controversial. It's really just facebook. Yeah, not the internet  Uh, and he has telecom regulator has asked the service be disabled  While it investigates whether it poses a threat to net neutrality, you know  We need a we need a we need an fcc like that. Well, yeah, why don't we have an fcc like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gcomcast and t-mobile you can't give away

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Special services for special prices in particular the regulator's concern about whether phone carriers should be allowed to charge different prices for different content  In this case free for some websites like facebook zero rating. Yeah  Zero rating that's what it's called

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's a fascinating topic. I had a long conversation with someone  um  Who's who's indian about whether it's better?  For people to have a kind of dumbed down  you know sort of  walled garden version of the internet than no internet  Or would it be better?  You know if they just if you can't have the whole internet then you just get no internet  And it's not actually an easy  question to answer  um  so if you  You know if you say well facebook shouldn't do this  Then lots of people are just gonna have no internet at all. Listen to what you get. I agree with you, Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I think it's it's not an easy it's complicated. Listen to what you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In india, you get facebook facebook messenger, but you also get bbc news wikipedia  bing  Accuweather sites dedicated to infant health and malaria prevention 30 sites total  They're customized to the location  Indian news sources for instance  Um, and and facebook wants to bring this to other places like a dozen african countries middle east latin america asia-pacific  Yeah, would you rather have that or nothing? Right? I gotta say my first response was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, you know, this is just facebook trying to create a little walled garden and it selects the sites that it wants and it plays  nice with the phone companies and and all of that is true, but  It also is giving people access to  Things that are valuable for nothing so and and the key to what I think is this the to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a governance question  That it's the same problem with with amp and google  If you're going to say it's open then you've got to make it open and anybody who wants to join under reasonable conditions  joins  um  Now the problem becomes that that then big guys can all join and be free and make ad money and a start  An indian startup comes in and can't afford  Terms that's where the issue comes in if it becomes  restraint against  Newcomers that would be my issue  But at some level yeah is is something that's limited better than nothing with  The same argument was about google and china by the way. Gee, it was a limited google better than no google and there I said no  Uh, don't go along with the authorities in that case very different situation  Limitations being better than the whole the internet is a whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's supposed to be any point to any point this person I was talking to said, you know you  I mean your  You live a privileged privileged life in north america and you get high-speed internet and can access whatever you want because you can afford it  um, you're probably not the best person to say  Is this a good thing or not? Because obviously to you it's not a good thing  but to some people who you know, they've got a  A dumb phone, you know, they've got no internet at all. Maybe this sort of watered down version is better and I agree with you  Jeff it'd be better if  If facebook wasn't the one  Choosing who gets to be part of it if they opened it up more in some way  Or if maybe there was some kind of I don't know advisory board or something. So it wasn't just facebook saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's facebook's version of the internet, you know if I i'm all in favor of this if they give you wikipedia  Wikipedia  You don't have to look at facebook  Yeah, and uh if they if somebody just came along and said I will give you free unlimited access to wikipedia  That's a good thing and even though twit is not included in that bundle  That's still a good thing  But it could be I don't think that's anti-competitive. Uh, I think that's a good thing and  If it weren't mark zuckerberg and facebook, I don't think there'd be this kind of criticism of it  If somebody came along and said if the eff came along and said look what we want to do is give people free access to  wikipedia  and some malaria sites and uh  And accu weather and bbc news for free  Nobody would say oh that's net violation and neutrality. They'd say yeah, great. Thank you eff and actually right google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it was google people would probably say oh, that's great. Maybe thanks. Thanks. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's say it's a non-profit. Let's say it's a non-profit doing this. Yeah, let's say it's  non-profit doing this. Yeah, let's say it's non-profit doing this. Yeah, let's say it's non-profit doing this. Yeah, let's say it's non-profit doing this  Wouldn't everybody say oh great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not they wouldn't say oh, but where's all the other parts of the internet? They'd say oh great

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you get access to google or is it just bing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like it's just bing and I don't know why they've mentioned being about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you search bing or you search maybe if google's there everything you search on is not free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, you'd find a bunch of sites that you couldn't go to for free  So so so that's where wall gardens wikipedia facebook and so on complete things

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But do this thought experiment. What if it were the eff offering?  Facebook facebook messenger bbc news wikipedia being in acu weather, but let's take facebook out so you don't have to include that  Wouldn't you say yeah right on eff. Good job. Thank you. Next question. Next question. What if mountain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or mtn phone service in africa a huge phone company there did the same thing  So comcast were getting mad at and team mobile were getting mad at for doing  Uh, what do you call it zero?  Zero rating zero rating  So what if what if a phone similarly a telecommunications company in africa or india or south america did the same thing?  What's your it's only a good thing if

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're giving something to people that they can't otherwise get yes. That's all i'm saying  I mean, it's not a good thing. It would never be a good thing in the us  Maybe it would be  Um, let's say you're in a rural area where you have no access to the internet  Not because of poverty, but just because you don't have any access because there's no access  And somebody comes along and say well i'll give you access but you only get five sites  It's like why wouldn't you say yes to what's wrong with that?  I disagree. I think this is a I think internet.org is a fine thing. I think it's because it's from facebook  And that everybody goes well facebook's getting a lot out of this. Well, yeah, they are of course  They are because they're a for-profit company  But I think this is a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they paying?  the  Telcos that offer it  I mean, I don't I must be doing the yeah, they must i'm pretty sure they are. Yeah, they must be paying for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny though facebook is the classic  like their  Expertise is is sort of faustian  Yeah bargains, right?  Because this is so good and it's such a positive thing  and yet the fact that facebook is doing it must frustrate me feel like they're trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know pull one over on must frustrate mark because i'm sure it does even if he wants to do a good thing  Uh, he can't he can't because everybody presumes him to be evil. Okay. Here's the uh,  The john mcafee thing every key the master key

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Convenience makes security. What the hell is this? Can you figure this out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, this is what happens when you smoke too many, uh bath salts  Yes  When every key is close to your phone laptop tablet house store card or other access control device  It unlocks that device when you walk away that device locks back down  Every key can also log you into your website accounts. Oh, well, yeah, I can understand this  There's it's like a ubi key or something. Yeah, if you lose your every key, you can remotely freeze it. Yeah, this is all right  It's all right. Okay. Let's see the tv commercial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  My god, this is the key to my online accounts or the key to my this is a tv commercial  It's my every key. I am the man who's obsessed with security  And so is every key. He's got a drag nothing is more secure  And if I lose it, I can remotely freeze it show me another key that can do that. So it's your choice all of this  Or it's just a good idea. We were just talking about, you know how passwords of access control don't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's look at the tech specs. See what uh, so it because that's I lose these little things so it's bluetooth  I don't know by the way how you would wipe it if it's bluetooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is there has a 30 foot range so you'd have to have it it would have to be plugged into something  right  Obviously, there's something that has to be running on the computer  And the phone they say it works with ios to recognize it to recognize it and unlock it. Yeah  You know what? It's like, uh, you know, it's like an android wear watch  That um when when I have my android wear watch near my phone it unlocks it unlocks, right?

This is this is a deutsche velle deutsche velle, which is a government-run  media company educated germans  avoid social media

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even on one and go look at the chart. It's the old in all other countries  Educated people are indexed higher on social media than uneducated people except germany  why  I think paranoia is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is so weird, isn't it? Yeah  Yeah, iceland is one of the few countries where both educated uneducated people spend 80 percent of their time on social media  but in germany even  Uneducated that is someone with no or low formal education  Only spends half his time or her time on social media if you have an education 40 percent

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's dangerous because I think it is the intellectual. Um  Vogue to be is becoming an anti-technology anti-social anti-daten schutz

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Data, I know they're very they're very security conscious. So I wonder if they just think do you think that some people are tracking them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or maybe the legacy of nazi germany. Yeah, I know it's always the argument is this it's reasonable history, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My argument back is I think it's partly cultural my my grandfather-in-law grandmother-in-law came from germany in 1923  And they're every bit as private as the germans. I know today  um and  Uh, but yes, that's certainly a factor. I don't you know stasi and nazi. I don't deny that and the files that they kept  uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, but  I I do think that the kind of techno panic euro techno panic that is it is it is the  Wellspring of it is germany part of it is the interests of companies of actual springer and company who are otherwise brilliant  Brilliant media companies, but they've fought google this way to the I think the harm of the country  um  Uh part of its government regulation and a reflex for that  um  Uh distrust of big american companies. It's a lot of factors this article says is it a sign that the well-educated in germany are simply

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Satisfied with their rustling newspapers weekly magazines and evening news programs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to go back to that time. They also like they like big brands. They like institutions. I want walter cronkite

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I found fascinating at news guys, I don't know if we talked about this before but um  Three publishers of three leading  german newspapers said they're  the use of ad blocking software in their  users was as high as 40 percent  I found that amazing because I talked to a publisher of an italian paper and he said ad blocking wasn't even  On their radar and yet some german papers their users

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The use of ad blocking software was 40 percent. We had the makers of ad block plus on a german  Company that's widely used they said 41 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In germany, and I think someone so someone explained that it was mostly security driven. It wasn't so much the ads  It was the trackers and the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think germans have been exposed to as many ads as anybody else they're not added worse, right? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think this is this is part of the the  anti-corporate too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Maybe I actually do find  I mean, maybe it's because I work at home and I don't I don't get a chance to go into an office and sort of  network with real live human beings  I actually it's a lifeline for me. I spend a lot of time on there just having  conversations with people about things do that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, do you read?  your at mentions

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, you do. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the part I find draining  Well, because they attack you all the time. Well, no, they're not all attacking me, but I clicked back and forth between

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  reading them all and then reading  Just sort of the verified direct mentions and then reading verified ones because sometimes there's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But yeah, I look at them all I also find that maybe this is an age thing, although you guys are old, too  Um, I can't understand what they're saying a lot  The twitter the move to 140 characters has really meant that the tweets are especially because you laid them up with hashtags  They're extremely cryptic. Yes, they can be definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't read the comments  and and and and facebook's interesting, but I always feel manipulated by facebook because  They're always changing. I know and it's apparent  Like a friend of mine  That was a family member  Said I posted a bunch of pictures. Uh, oh no, it was it was my call screen  I bunched a bunch of pictures from our new year's party. I never saw them because facebook didn't deem them important  Yeah, but I see a lot of jeff jarvis

Transcript:  Well, the other thing that happens is don't forget facebook is constantly refreshing  So what you know the one of the problems with facebook is you go forward read something you go back  Trying to get to the same spot and it's not they've refreshed it again  So it's not just about saying oh, we're not going to show you that it's that we might have tried to show you that  You know an hour ago, but uh, that's that's that's that's warm beer now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i've been doing this uh sort of social experiment where I ask  Civilians as I like to call them or muggles people who don't you know?  Aren't into social media and don't understand  Things but are you know, relatively intelligent human beings. I will ask them whether they know  the facebook  Filters their newsfeed using an algorithm. They don't so there are things that they don't see no and roughly 75  Have no idea that that that that even happens. Yeah, so they're missing things  But they have known they don't know that they're missing things

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They assume that they're seeing everything you can of course change your newsfeed to be chronological  You can but then facebook changes it back. It doesn't stay that way. You're right. It changes roughly every

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's remember too that there's something else somewhere in this newsfeed about how people get news  The world's on facebook. They're not on twitter. We're on twitter the world's on twitter. The world's not on twitter. No  Four and ten people get news from facebook one in ten get it from twitter  Yeah, and that's just the reality and actually 60 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  60 of millennials  Said that they that facebook is one is their primary or one of their primary news sources

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I actually get it's funny because I do read uh, you know, I go to tech meme and nuzzle and uh,  Hacker news there's certain, you know beat checks. I do two or three times a day looking for news for these shows  But I often get  articles from facebook and google plus  Because of the people you follow and I guess some nuzzles mostly twitter so i'm getting the twitter stuff from nuzzle  So there's definitely because of the people I follow and if I do it by the way if I do it chronologically, it's much less interesting  Yeah, if I let if I you know give in and let facebook do it. I do actually go back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting to see the difference. Yeah, it's good to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very different  Chronological means you're seeing everything. Yeah, it's everything in chronological order

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it what used to be and they are giving you a bit more  Control that they started showing people  Who do you want to see at the top of your feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so you can sort of pick if you know what you're doing scobel gave me a lesson if you know what you're doing  You could totally  You know, for instance, uh everybody lists a lot  Yeah, but you don't even have to do that everybody that you follow  Is either a close friend or an acquaintance?  There are different categories of friendship and if you make somebody an acquaintance, you'll see less of their stuff  Here's the signal that you're signaling facebook all the time, but what you like  That's why I see jeff charvis a lot because I liked a lot of your stuff jeff and so facebook  The algorithm is not super bright but said oh you like jeff charvis. Let's give you more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's show you all of everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just say thank you facebook. Thank you facebook. My nephew is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  20 something told me at one point that he  He was on facebook, but he refused to ever like  Or comment on anything  And I said why why would you do that? And he said I don't want  Facebook to start screwing things up with the algorithm. So i'm trying to give it as little information as possible  To go on I just thought that was fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and I did another thing on this show I added  All the the candidates for president republican and democrat. I liked them all  My mind's daughter by the way immediately called me said you like donald trump  And I had to it was it took great painstaking. No. No abby. I'm trying to get a  Fuller picture. I'm trying to get out of the filter bubble. You like donald trump. No, no, i'm just  But what's funny is I don't see a lot of political stuff in here. It didn't it didn't interesting  Yeah, it didn't change much either. They're not posting much or i'm not seeing it  I figured they probably have ever seen have you ever seen a friend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it says they liked something and you're like, I can't believe that that person actually liked that thing  I've asked a few friends where I saw so-and-so liked a page, right, you know  Well, like my daughter did yeah, right and and then I will ask them. I never liked that  I'm not sure how that happens. Oh, you've gotten a spurious likes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a black box that's part of the problem is you don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How they're waiting your different, but how could they show you that in any reasonable? They couldn't they couldn't they couldn't  Oh, hey, look at this. I got donald trump's christmas card. So now i'm happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love you all says donald trump except the women the blacks and hispanics  And the losers and you stupid foolish people but everybody else I love you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My god  Mary yes, everyone except himself and for that now i'm going to get 100 tweets and facebook saying that's the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is uh, yeah the scolding that poor jeff gets for not sticking to tech as if you're let me tell you simple rule here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never tell me what not to say  Because he's gonna say it. No, i've learned that  No, no i'm not saying to you leo i'm saying to your your audience don't tell me what not to say you got that  I'm from jersey. I don't go for that  Because what you don't want me to say is what you don't want to hear and that's not a very mature attitude  No, so if you don't want it just just just wait wait 30 seconds and it's over your life will be back to normal  And we can talk about technology in all honesty

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is why I follow cruz and trump and and rubio and hillary clinton and bernie sanders  I I want to hear the stuff. I don't want to hear I want to hear everything  I want to get as much as I can  Just because that's a bad sign when you don't want to hear something that's something you there's something there you should you should find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's one of the most powerful  arguments against  An algorithm driven feed because facebook is not trying to show you  Things that encourage you to think about you know, the alternate side of the argument  It is showing you things that it thinks you will like and that you know that creates a really strong filter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also showing you things that will cause discussion and and the people are talking about  I don't fully agree. I don't think it's that simplistic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not that simplistic, but that's they want to get you to  engage and I think  They're they're leaning towards things you either already have clicked on or liked or things you've shown that you're interested in  So you have to take kind of self-reinforcing. Yeah, like leo does you have to you have to take an effort to to  Tell facebook look I want to be exposed to more stuff than just the sort of things I quote unquote like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But at least I could do that and what's interesting is facebook did not make some global  Judgment at that point and start feeding me  other stuff, you know  Conservative or republican or libertarian or democrat they didn't it just was it actually worked out pretty well  And now i got donald's christmas card. I'm happy from facebook out of nowhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found this out that chipotle is changing its menu to assure food safety and I find this very interesting  Other than changing this subject  Which means no more lettuce onions will be blanched and marinated in lemon and lime juice to kill off germ  Instead of served raw raw chicken be marinated in resealable plastic bags cilantro will be added to cooked rice to assure possibly dangerous  Microbes will be killed off cheese will arrive pre-shredded while pork and barbacoa beef will be shipped in pre-sealed bags  Tomatoes and cilantro likely the culprit of the two outbreaks according to cdc will be thoroughly rinsed  Or thoroughly washed chopped and tested in an outside location good in short  They're not preparing anything there my question of this is when will all this happen because I ain't going back until that's gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still haven't been to a jack in the box  Why like 25 years ago they had me call  And I haven't been there ever since

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went I walked into one. I thought all right, this is ridiculous  You're being stupid jeff I went a couple weeks ago and these guys behind the lines don't wear gloves now  I tweeted about this and I know that yes, you can you can schmutz gloves the way you can your hand  But they shouldn't that's not just have the just think people and make rules. They're gonna make people more comfortable  So chipotle I gave you all this free publicity on the show  I regret it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gotta say I ate there and I didn't like it  I mean nothing bad happened to me  But I just didn't think it was that good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  friend of mine said when I was I said I tweeted before all this broke out that I was bored with the menu because  They brag they haven't changed in 22 years  And and my friend sold his stock at that moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He owes me. Yeah, I wouldn't brag about it. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, we're gonna take a break because this show is already over two hours. I just noticed i'm sorry, but we'll uh  We'll have your final thoughts just a second but first a word from fresh books the way if you're a freelancer to uh to get paid  Because that's kind of important. I know you love what you do  What I bet you don't love is sending out those invoices at the end of the month  But unfortunately, that's kind of key to getting paid  Let fresh books do the hard stuff fresh books makes it really easy to format and send invoices via email  Although they will print and mail them too  If you have one of them old-fashioned clients that works in every currency worldwide  I loved that because I was billing canadians and and americans and so I had to have different currencies  If you have expenses expense reports, you can actually take pictures of the receipts  With your with your fresh books app on your smartphone and then it goes right into the invoice  I just love fresh books and they keep adding new features things like  uh the new request a deposit feature where you can ask  for a  For a deposit in fresh books so you don't have to cover costs out of pocket or wait until the end of a project to get paid  And they have a now I have a card reader. So if you're if you work if you present an invoice at the end of a workday  You know, maybe you're in a home inspector something you  uh a  Pesticide uh plier. What do they call those?  You know you uh, you you put the you have your fresh books invoice you show the client the invoice. Here you go  Window washer here's the invoice then you put the little swipe card in there and it's they could swipe the stripe or dip the chip  It's yes. It's the mv chip card enabled then you get paid  So many great reasons why you you you should be using fresh books right now 30 days free and you you'll know everything about it  Just go to fresh books.com slash twig  fresh books.com slash  twig  It is easy. It's fast. You get paid faster  You'll be more efficient you get to focus on the stuff. You'll love not the stuff you don't  Fresh books.com slash twig. I used it for years and I think you will love it  Do do me a favor though mentioned  this week in google  When you check out, you know, they'll say how do you hear about us? Tell them tell them you heard it on twig  fresh books.com slash  Twig jeff jarvis from the city university of new york from fortune senior editor matthew ingraham  It's kind of my favorite threesome here now that now that we've lost jean atropany to the  Startup world, but she'll come back every month as always  but uh  I just this is a good group you guys I like smart  Conversation and we always get that when you're here matthew. Thank you for joining us. Oh, thanks for having me  Did you want to mention a pick or something you like these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually not so much a pick  Something I I thought was interesting that I didn't get a chance  to write about  I noticed that four square is doing a  Said to be doing a fundraising round. Oh, yeah  And it's going to be the valuation has dropped by more than 50  um, I think that's  I mean, that's the tip of the iceberg. We're going to be seeing more of that. I think  um pretty soon because  some of these companies that have been venture funded are  you know, they're getting a little long in the tooth and  Four square was such an amazing  Is such an amazing service. Um, I just think  you know valuations probably got ahead of  Kind of the reality of that  What that could offer and so I think we're probably going to see a bunch of that happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I you know the stumble I think was when they took out they separated swarm out and they took out the games and the mayors  And stuff now that mayorships are back. I'm using it again. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've started using it again, too  And I know why they split them yeah, and I remember talking to dennis crowley about it and they had a good rationale  But I i'm just I don't think it worked. You know, a lot of people went away from it at that point. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of which did you read katie benner's really good piece into that today's times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah about good technology  In fact, that was the other one I was going to use as an example  Look at the valuation of that company at one point  We're talking about what it actually wound up selling for so sad and of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the sad thing is that the employees get hurt in fact the end of the story  One of the employees said we effectively we paid to work here  Because they get taxed at the higher valuation when they get stock awards before the pre ipo  So the irs says okay fine. You just got 180 000 in stock based on the current valuation pay us  70 or 80 000 in tax  But then when the unicorn stumbles and the valuation plummets and they ended up  They were at one point valued. Yeah, they're one point valued at 1.1 billion  Blackberry eventually bought them for 425  Yeah, that stock now is worth less than you paid in taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a bunch of people borrowed to to pay those taxes. So, I mean, it's a great it's a great sort of  You know red flag for if someone's joining good less company like that. Yeah, I mean  Valuations can go in both directions

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And don't always just go up and of course the investors have preferred shares so they get paid first  They ended up getting 125 million dollars the ceo  Who arguably drove the company to the ground?  Got a four million dollar  Paycheck and a 1.9 million dollar severance payment and has now moved on  To the next level of the company  And the company's now has a total of about $1,000  And that but the employees some of them. Oh 150 000 or more. Yeah, that's terrible. It's just sad  This was a security company  good technology that  Ended up being part of a blackberry which by in its own of itself is probably not has its own problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A couple of weeks ago. So I think there was a real there's a bunch of these companies out there that their valuations are  It's not that they're bad companies and it's not that what they're doing isn't valuable. It's just that valuations got you know  Just way just inflated beyond sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, what is asking about it today? I I don't think that there is an and recent goes on about this a lot on twitter  I don't think there's an overall bubble per se  and we have to keep in mind that the venture capital is  Is  In majority a losing business, right? It's it's so it's the of course that make your money  So the fact that they're wrong in percent of the time in terms of companies that just plain die  And the fact that they're wrong and percent of the time in the valuations. That's the game. It's the game  It's not surprising. It's not part of part of the averages that work out  And and so you when we point anecdotally at a couple of companies that have had down rounds or gone down or lost their value  With a lot of people's lives and careers involved and and people's real money involved  Yeah, but that doesn't a trend to make but let me point out that the way the venture capitalists structure the deals

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're often made whole  Yes first no one else is so they have less risk because they're made whole  And this happened with tech tv. I was off. I was given a quarter of a million shares of  tech tv  When they first started it looks so good as wallpaper in your bathroom to keep me there  They even had the gall to say, you know if all good here's a bit of them  And the ceo drove a grouper grab it all looked all like this would be worth one and a half million dollars  And uh, what was it worth when paul allen sold it finally? Well, he got made whole  Yeah, not me. It was worth nothing now. Fortunately. I didn't pay tax on that had I paid tax on those grants off  But they were just options. They weren't grants and uh had I paid tax on them. I would have been furious  But that happens so that's pre

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Start up boom boom anything this has been going on for years. Oh, yeah, and it's not it's not even it's not that people are doing  You know that they're evil or that the system is it this is actually the way it works. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is a little bit evil  Because  It's sophisticated  Finance people. Yeah kind of taking a little bit of advantage of just normal folk  Sometimes i've had the employees have said what can we have stock options?  And I just want to say to them you don't trust me. You don't want you don't want that  I will pay you well, you don't want stock options. You should have money. You should have money  And that's the I think that that's there if there is malfeasance it's this  Kind of uh, and by the way, the sec has a lot of rules to protect people  Which are being eroded now by the jobs act and others because everybody wants to get in at the ground floor this exciting new  economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how many companies have I gotten advisor stock in that? Yeah, nothing  And i've you know, i've done a few nano angel investments. Just very few. I don't have money to do much but a few  No  Yeah, i'm not the not the game. I was gonna open a venture fund out of my school on my program  Thinking that was a good way to have an impact  Albert venger at union square ventures god bless him sat me down and said jarvis  No, he said it's all about deal flow  And unless you're in the top top top tier, the good deals don't come to you  That's right. I haven't proven anything yet. So bad deals are going to come to you and then worse deals are going to come to you  And that's just the way the business works and it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless you're adding tremendous value and this is why I do kind of support the  Regulation that is now being kind of softened to protect normal people because um, you know, uh  I think there you know, if anybody can invest there will be people will take advantage of that. Oh, yes  And the jobs act eliminated, you know  Some of the some of the tests that you have to pass, you know income tests and so forth  In the interest of making it more democratic  But you know then now the message to everybody is before you give anybody any money you better do some research you better learn  Watch silicon valley if nothing else  They'll tell you hooli hooli baby  I got me some hooli stock sheldon adelson is the guy who bought the las vegas review journal. Yay  Oh, what a story that is what we have to save that for another day a train wreck. Oh my god, shelly  There's a guy there's a shark  He got out of comdex  Just in the nick of time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he just wants it to be fair and balanced right fair and balanced. That's all we ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if you would investigate these judges  I would I would take it as a favor  Jeff you have a list. I want you to tell us about this list because this is my favorite song of all time  I love this song  Lisa says this is a religious song. I say it is not a religious song
