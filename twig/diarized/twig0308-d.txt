It's time for Twig This Week in Google,  the show where we talk about Google, the cloud,  social media, journalism, privacy, war, peace, humanity,  the coming AI singularity, the inevitable robot uprising,  and Chipotle.  You never know what we're going to talk about.  The show is still somewhere in Europe.  He may have gone all Colonel Kurtz on us.  We don't know, but with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he has.  He has.  You have to show the picture of him.  You have to show the picture of him.  OK.  While Jason's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, while Jason's.  Wait a minute.  We're going to have to send somebody out there up the river.  It is Lederhosen, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lederhosen.  Do I just do a search for hashtag Lederhosen Leo LaPorte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look up his Facebook.  All right.  All right, I'll get back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll look at that picture of Lederhosen.  But that is Jeff Jarvis.  That is Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism  at the City University of New York, author of Public Parts,  What Would Google Do, and Gutenberg the Geek,  and Buzz Machine, and so on.  I'm just inspired by Leo.  It is inspiring, isn't it?  I want one of those giant horns.  Or is that Swiss?  I don't know.  So is Edelweiss.  I'm messing it up here.  Anyway, great to see you again, Jeff.  And we also have as our guests two very distinguished  gentlemen who I love being on shows with,  starting with Matthew Ingram, who's senior writer at Fortune  Magazine, formerly of GigaOM, who  writes about the evolution of media and the social web.  Welcome to you, Matthew Ingram.  Thank you very much.  It is really cool to have both you and Jeff on the same show,  because the two of you on Twitter and also Jeff on Google Plus  are just like my journalism firehose,  always talking about all the big issues on journalism.  So we may talk about journalism today, folks.  It's possible.  I don't mean to threaten you, but this could happen.  We also have Kurt Wagner, associate editor  for social media at Recode, formerly of Mashable and Fortune  and a frequent guest on America's favorite technology  news show, Tech News Today.  Welcome to you, Kurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you so much for having me, Mike.  It's weird to see you in a different show.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's weird for me, too.  Yes.  But I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it.  It's good weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Well, do we have native Leo yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  See, the problem is I'm too good with my passwords.  So I don't know my Facebook password.  So I'm getting it right now.  I'll get back to you on this.  I promise.  So Jason hacks his own computer.  Yes, pretty much that's what I'm doing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll start with.  Password 123, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on the sticky note right there.  Yes.  OK, so Jeff Jarvis, the right to be forgotten  may be coming to our own shores if Consumer Watchdog has its way.  This is a complaint that's been filed with the FTC saying  that, hey, darn it, we want to be like Europe.  We want the right to be forgotten right here in the US of A.  Does the Constitution prohibit this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the difference is we have a First Amendment.  And it ain't going to happen here.  And if it is going to happen here, by God, there's  going to be a huge fight because it really  does have an impact on the other's right to know  and to continue to know and to remember and to speak.  And it's just an absurd notion that has spread dangerously.  I've complained about it since the first mention in the EU.  And it's getting more and more dangerous.  And it's spreading to Matthew's land, to an extent,  up there in the cold, nice lands.  This idea that you have a right to anything about you.  That's what's absurd about this, right?  I know something about you, Matthew.  You can't erase that from me unless you're a men in black.  It's in here.  That is my knowledge.  It is my right to hold onto it, my right to remember it,  my right to repeat it as much as I want.  And that's just the nature of what we call being public.  And to try to restrict that, governmentally,  as somebody said on Twitter, well, George,  what do you think Google's getting rid of revenge porn  links?  Well, that's Google's right to do.  But Google, under government fiat to kill things,  that is the definition of censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things, Jeff, that I have a slightly different  obsession about this whole issue than you do,  if I can just slip this in there.  Because I think to a certain extent,  people do have the right to privacy  about their own information.  And they can, to some extent, determine that  by choosing social sites or whatever that may guarantee that.  In other words, that could be a service that  could be offered by social sites, by any site.  So for example, people are concerned about the drunken  pictures when they're in high school getting out there  and being seen by their coworkers, whatever.  Whatever it is.  And so to a certain extent, this kind of privacy  could be offered by services.  People can choose those things.  But the problem with this is it's about search engines.  Search engines are supposed, and this is the obsession part,  search engines are supposed to reflect what's  actually on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you can prohibit a search engine from doing it,  then what comes with the newspaper work, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  They would never, in Europe, for example,  they would never go to The Guardian and say, OK,  people have the right to privacy.  We're going to take those articles.  You are banned from showing that.  I don't, I mean, I don't think they can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the country that made The Guardian destroy the NSA  computers, which is what forced The Guardian to send the data  to The New York Times so that it was safe from the UK government.  And Michael, I take your point about the privacy of the service.  But again, once something is known, it's known.  The danger of this is the idea of regulating knowledge.  If I know that you, noted gourmet, actually  ate a Pizza Hut hot dog crust pizza.  Now you're just being ridiculous.  If I caught you and I reveal that to the world,  you may try your best to get it erased.  But I'm sorry, it's out there in the stream.  In fact, Jason, I think you should order one for Mike  so we can see him eat it.  The bloodstream, you mean?  We should force him to eat it on the air as a dare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really taking a turn for the worse here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm calling right now.  There's no getting out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew Ingram, what's going on in Canada?  What's the conversation like in Canada around the right  to be forgotten here, there, or anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess we prefer the term Kanukistan.  OK.  I guess, I mean, I think what Jeff is talking about  is we have laws that are trying to keep people  from saying bad things.  And the risk is that those laws will  be used against anyone who says anything  that someone feels is either bad  or could be interpreted as being bad.  So the impulse is we need a way to go after people  who are posting hate speech, people who are posting,  you know, terrorist sympathetic blog posts or whatever.  And so I think the risk is, and this happens in Britain  all the time, risk is everyone can think of an example  or knows an example where they would actually support  someone's right to remove information.  So let's say there was a charge and it was reported,  you know, child porn or something,  and it was reported in all the newspapers  and all those articles are everywhere.  And they come up whenever you search someone's name.  But they were actually acquitted.  And, but no one wrote about the acquittal.  And so none of that shows up,  just the ones where they were charged.  The problem is you can think of an example  where having those laws would be a good thing,  but there are an infinite number of more examples  where it would be a bad thing.  And where, so the problem is who decides  which information should be forgotten.  That's my problem.  Is it a government panel?  Is it some kind of a shadowy court somewhere?  I mean, that's the risk is that you don't know  who's going to decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, and the other part of that,  that, you know, and I don't think it matches perfectly  with your example, but there are many examples  of a censorship, for example,  there are moves in Turkey and elsewhere to remove content  around, you know, sort of insurgencies  or, you know, sort of Islamic fundamentalist movements  and so on.  And the idea is that by removing this information,  you're going to prevent people from being exposed to it.  And therefore that you sort of suppress  that sort of those, that set of ideas.  The problem is that you don't know  what the unintended consequences  of any sort of censorship is.  For example, just, I guess, to try to make your example work  of somebody being accused of child porn  or something like that, then they're acquitted.  And then I think to a certain extent,  it's the media's job to talk about that.  And when we, you know, when people get outraged  as they should that a person's being talked about  in a way that's mistaken, it's a way to sort of put pressure  on the media to do follow-ups.  I mean, this is in fact an ongoing long-standing problem  with journalism.  They make a big front page error  and then they do a little tiny correction  and, you know, it doesn't have the same impact.  And I think to a certain extent, it's legitimate  for publications to be held to account and to go back  and make sure that the people who got the wrong idea  get the right idea and so on.  I don't know, that's a bad example, I admit it.  But the fact is when you start removing information,  you don't know how you're affecting  what the public thinks about what needs to change,  what needs to be fixed and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and in fact, one of my favorite examples  of censorship that was done for presumably a good reason  but has had bad effects is Facebook took down  a huge number of pages related to Syrian terrorism.  Elliot Higgins, Brown Moses has written about this before,  I've written about it before.  They took them down presumably because they didn't want  quasi-terrorist groups posting videos  of people's homes being blown up  because they thought that's, no one wants to see that.  But Elliot's point is that removing that information  actually removes a historical record of those events  that can be used by people like him,  investigative journalists, to piece together  what's going on in that country.  So that's a significant negative impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, well, we, I think we've beaten this one to death.  I think that it's more or less unanimous  that the right to be forgotten is a bad idea in the US,  it's a bad idea in Europe.  And so we'll keep an eye on this  and make sure that it doesn't happen.  But again, as Jeff pointed out,  we do have the First Amendment, thank goodness.  If that hadn't been enacted when it was,  give it another 100 years,  we would never have had the First Amendment.  We would never have had any of this stuff  and it's a great thing that the United States  was founded when it was.  So we got that set in stone  and it's very difficult or impossible to change  and that's why we have that protection.  Well, we're gonna check in on Leo here  who has reportedly gone completely native on us.  If you're their children in the room,  please have them leave the room.  There we go.  Oh boy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are we worried yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, the shirt is all wrong.  Like the later Hosen are fine.  The shirt's all wrong.  That's what you wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're gonna have to talk to Leo about that.  To me, it's all about the socks.  Yeah, they're okay.  Yeah.  And he can also carry six gigantic mugs full of beer too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what I'd like to do is run this through Google's  deep dream, deep learning image processing  and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please don't do that.  A beautiful segue.  Jason, that was beautiful.  So Google apparently has this deep learning thing  that will, can anybody explain this?  I don't know.  Kurt, have you checked down this story?  Essentially, Google has this software  that will make images based on its own,  I guess it has biases toward human parts  and animal parts and stuff.  So it creates these images out of other images  and the end result is pure unfiltered LSD.  It's kind of crazy.  I mean, this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad you picked me to try and explain  the deep learning artificial intelligence technology  that we're talking about.  I have seen this.  I can't explain it.  I know that both Google and Facebook  are obviously really interested in deep learning right now.  I think more for practical matters  than necessarily coming up with really trippy photos.  I saw this cool,  I wish I'm gonna try to explain it to you guys.  Saw this cool video yesterday where essentially  if you have a string of photos,  maybe 20 photos of you walking through some long hallway,  you stitch them together in what I believe it's Google  and what they're able to do is kind of like fill in  the blanks of those photos in some kind of seamless video.  So essentially, instead of a flip card  where you're going from photo one, two, three,  and there's dramatic sharp pauses between each photo,  it's able to like fill in that blank space  just based off of everything that it recognizes  in the other images.  And I think that stuff is just so fascinating, right?  I mean, you can see it in their products  like Google Photos, whatever were you.  I don't know if any of you guys use Google Photos,  but you upload images and it creates like a GIF for you  or create a little slideshow based on images  that seem to be in sequence.  I think this stuff is all pretty cool right now,  but there's obviously a long way to go  besides just looking at these trippy images  and zoning out at work for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's called the Deep Dream Project.  It's available on GitHub and it relies on the Cafe  deep learning framework.  Isn't that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those of you on audio are now seeing dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, seriously, spaghetti turned into dog faces.  It's just disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what is interesting about this  and also the technology that Kurt was talking about,  about filling in the blanks as you're walking down  the hallway or wherever,  is this is closer to how the human mind actually works.  I mean, your mind does fill in blanks.  Mike?  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Jason, can you call the guys in the white coats  for Mike if this is how his brain works?  Let him think he's gonna get a pizza  and then take him away and get him taken care of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are more likely to see Jesus in their spaghetti  than dogs or other pets,  but people do see things that aren't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's a good point, Mike.  This is extremely disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is horrible.  This is fear and loathing in Las Vegas.  Ran through it by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those of you who are listening to this program  and not watching it, good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Super disturbing.  But you're right about it.  I mean, a lot of the software is based on trying to simulate  what the human brain does, which is pattern recognition.  You look at a piece of toast,  you look at grains of sand on the beach,  you look at waves or whatever and you see things.  You look at, kids look at clouds  and they see animals or birds or whatever.  This is sort of trying to teach computers  how to do the same thing.  Can you take images and see other things in them?  And obviously if you take that to its natural conclusion,  it's an LSD trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, this is a lot cheaper than LSD  and a lot safer.  Yeah, way cheaper.  Yeah, so anyway, just wait till they put this  in Oculus Rift.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man.  That is going to be absolutely horrible.  Well, we're gonna take a break and when we come back,  we're gonna talk about less horrible, less trippy stuff.  But first I wanna talk about this bad boy right here.  This is the future of your doorbell.  It's called the Ring Video Doorbell.  And you know, there are a lot of home, let's face it,  there are a lot of home automation products  that don't make a whole lot of sense.  They add some minor convenience,  enable you to turn on your lights with motion detection.  It's nice, you don't have to flip the switch.  But this, the Ring Video Doorbell is something  that makes so much sense, it's not even funny.  Basically how this works is you install this,  it has a battery or you can connect it into the electricity  into your house and it functions like a regular doorbell.  Somebody presses the button, the doorbell rings,  but then something else happens.  The virtual doorbell in your smartphone rings  and you could be in China,  you could be anywhere with an internet connection  and you will hear your front doorbell ringing.  And then you pick up your phone, you look,  and there it is, the video through the camera  and you can see who's at your door.  And of course, even if they don't ring the doorbell,  it has a motion detector to show you  who's on your front porch or standing in front of your door  and you get that information.  It is so useful, you can imagine  how somebody comes to your door, they ring the doorbell,  and they don't know that you're not home.  For all they know, you are there.  And if it's somebody you know,  you can call them or whatever.  It's just such a great way to provide security.  Here's something that's really an interesting fact  that everybody should keep in mind,  which is that burglars who usually rob,  it's not the person with the black mask on  that comes in with a flashlight at night,  that's not how burglaries work.  They usually happen during the day.  And what burglars typically do  is they come to the front door  and act like they're just,  they come up with some excuse  in case you're out and so the door  and they ring the doorbell to see if you're home  and when nobody answers the door, they say,  okay, let's rob this house.  Okay, but when they ring the doorbell,  you're being notified.  You can call the police because you can see  what's happening through the camera.  It's just a great, great alternative  to the old dumb doorbells that almost every house has.  Right now, you can get the ring video doorbell  for only $174, that's $25 off the normal price.  And you can protect your home,  you can have peace of mind  and know what's going on at your house  even when you're not there.  So just go to ring.com slash twig,  that's ring.com slash twig to protect your home  and have total information awareness  of your own front door.  Well, Project Fi, this is of course,  Google's pretty interesting technology, I think.  The most interesting thing about Project Fi  is the way that it will enable you  to use two carriers plus Wi-Fi,  seamlessly transfer calls and data between them  so they always have a great connection  and an efficient connection no matter where.  The problem is, according to this article  in the Wall Street Journal by Nathan Oliverus Giles,  the problem is that it only works on the one phone  and they need to roll this out to a lot more phones.  Has anybody received an invitation to this Project Fi?  On the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we all know it was on Nexus 6 only,  we all know it's a pilot and he's trying to act like,  oh gee, Nexus 6 is only one phone.  We know that, they're just trying something new here  and they're pushing, come on.  Now I got different reasons to get mad.  Is that, I mean, Matt Cutts, we thought,  I love you, Matt, had a lot of clout,  I'm still 12 weeks before they decide  when I get Project Fi.  Wow.  Matt was offering to Leo and you too, Jason, right?  Have you had any change in status?  No, I haven't, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll go to three years from now, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the rates start at $30 a month  and it sounds like really interesting.  It's got some good technology,  it's a good thing for Google to be doing  and again, I think that this is a lot  like Google's fiber project where they're trying  to pressure and squeeze the carriers out there  into having better services, clearer services.  One of the things that's great about this  is that it's a set price and everything is up front  if you use more, you pay more and so on  and it's very clear and open,  unlike your typical carrier situation  where it's like, oh, we're gonna subsidize your phone.  Your phone is only gonna be, your $600 phone  is only gonna be $200 and we're subsidizing it.  No, they're not subsidizing it.  Subsidizing it is when they transfer money  from one person and transfer it to another.  In this case, they are, you're paying,  you're essentially being subsidized by yourself  because they will make sure that you pay  for that phone for the two years,  so it's stretched out over two years  and if you keep your phone longer than two years,  you're just gonna keep paying for that phone.  That same like $20, whatever that they added  onto the monthly bill is gonna continue  even after the, long after the phone is paid off.  So this is a great thing for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, I don't know if this is gonna work or not  but I'm all in favor of things that will try  and create more competition for phone companies  and cable companies for that matter.  So if Google wants to offer free fiber,  wants to offer Wi-Fi calling, I think that's great.  More pressure they can keep on phone companies, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so there's a lot more animosity  in the tech journalist community about Google Glass  because they're back in the news for two reasons.  The first is that a product went up for approval  at the FCC website, it's codenamed GG1,  which is almost certainly Google Glass  and all the other, you know, it's whatever this thing is,  it supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi  and it's a mobile device of some kind,  it's probably Google Glass.  The second reason is that there's something in the works  called the Enterprise Edition of Google Glass,  which looks like it may have an actually larger prism,  if you can believe that, and an external battery pack.  This would be for companies to use  for vertical applications.  Two things here that I wanna talk about.  One is, why does the press hate Google Glass?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because, you know, I bought it, I paid $2,000 for it,  I'm a schmuck.  I'm a complete and absolute Google fanboy schmuck.  I tried and tried and tried to say,  oh, look at all it could do, look at all the wonders,  look at everything, no, I'm sorry, it didn't work.  And you know what, I gotta say in this case,  Google messed it up, I don't think they've admitted it  to themselves, I don't think they've admitted it  to the world, or to the people who spent thousands  of dollars on this stuff, and I'd say it's one area  where Google's worthy of ridicule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did they mess up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't work well, it doesn't make sense, it hurts.  They tried to cram too much functionality into it.  I mean, all kinds of things, and it just,  it brought all kinds of privacy problems on them  that were absolutely unnecessary.  If there'd been a red light or some kind of transparency,  I could go on, but why should I?  It only brings the pain back out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was a classic, you know, I don't know this,  but I think it was a classic sort of,  the rollout was just poorly handled.  So if it had been described as a really experimental thing,  and only a few people, and originally it was that,  the Explorers program, if it had stopped as a sort of,  hey, super nerds, help us test this thing,  but it became a kind of, this is the next big thing,  and everyone's gonna wear it,  and it's gonna change your life.  And obviously it didn't do any of those things,  and most people are never gonna wear them,  because you look like an idiot.  But if it had been, if it had been sort of couched  in the right way, I think it would have been  a very cool thing, lots of people would have done it.  But you know, the vast majority of people  just are not interested, never will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kurt, did you ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've worn Google Glass.  I was gonna echo what Matthew,  I explored, as they say.  I was gonna echo what Matthew just said,  just about the way that they even look.  I mean, I think the big thing is like,  if you're gonna go out on a limb,  and you're gonna wear this thing on your face,  that already makes you look kind of a little weird,  or a little wonky, like it better be pretty amazing.  And you can see that with a lot of these watches now,  even, right?  Like a watch isn't even on your face,  and yet people, as soon as they started wearing smartwatches,  if it didn't dramatically improve their life,  they were like, I'm not gonna wear this thing,  it looks like a big calculator on my wrist,  this is ridiculous.  And that's why the Apple Watch is so important  to the smartwatch movement, if you will,  because actually a lot of people think it looks good.  So I think the fact that this thing looked like  a high school science fair project  did not help Google's cause at all.  Well, I think one of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, plus it also, it fed into a lot of the things  that people already think about Google,  and already think about Larry and Sergey,  and already think about Silicon Valley,  and already think about tech nerds,  that they have no sense of what real life is like,  that they're willing to use any old gadget,  even if they look like the Borg,  that it just fed into all those sort of preconceptions  about what tech nerds are like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the central problems with it also  is that the camera is the problem.  On the one hand, the camera made everybody nervous.  They felt like when they're talking to somebody,  they thought, you know, falsely,  it's a terrible spy device,  you can completely tell when somebody's taking video,  but nobody knew that.  It was an unfamiliar product to the public,  so if you're sitting there talking to somebody,  there's a lot of discomfort around that,  and at the same time, really,  the camera's the only thing anybody used it for.  And so, you know, removing the camera is impossible,  and leaving the camera there is impossible.  I mean, I remember one of the first times I realized  that this is actually kind of a new medium as a camera  is when Gina Trapani took a picture of her baby.  Her hands were full, of course,  she's a mother holding a baby,  and you got this picture of the baby  looking right at her mother.  And, you know, Gina's hair was hanging down,  so it was really like a first-person-you-are-there  kind of experience.  And I took a lot of pictures with Google Glass  when I was traveling around and had my hands full,  and there were situations where I could take a picture  with a wink, which is one of the gestures that took pictures,  and yeah, I looked like a complete idiot,  but I took some really great pictures.  But I ultimately think that this kind of technology  is going to succeed only when they remove the camera.  So if they can build it into ordinary eyeglasses  and have notifications that are subtle and appropriate  and minimalist and important  and actually benefit people in a way that's very,  you know, non-intrusive,  I think that could be an application for this type of,  in fact, I'm certain of it,  that this is, you know, the future of eyeglasses  is going to have some sort of intelligence or notifications.  The problem is that you had this giant, you know,  this giant thing.  But the camera, like you said, the camera was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Matthew.  The camera was half of the reason  why people were interested in it.  Right.  I mean, to me, the one thing I wanted it for  was to walk around Europe in some unfamiliar city  and have the glasses tell me what the heck I was looking at.  I would actually pay money for that.  So am I going to wear it all the time?  No, but I think it would make a really great  targeted device for specific purposes.  So maybe that's part of what they're thinking of doing.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they tried to cram too much into one thing.  And there's a pack we have, I think,  on the rundown where you could try to frame pictures for it.  I think a point of view camera is its own product.  I think alerts are their own product,  which I think the watch is fine for.  I don't really want them up here.  And then instructions for certain activities  will work up here,  but I don't need and want everything up here in view  because people will just bug me with it.  And so the watch,  so you split the three things up and they could work.  Sorry, Kurt, you were gonna start to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, that's okay.  I was gonna mention something along those lines.  And actually, I was gonna say that in my thinking  that glass would in some ways replace your phone,  but if it doesn't have a camera,  then you still need your phone.  And the way that people are taking so many photos now,  videos, you look at like Meerkat, Periscope,  the idea of live broadcasting as well.  If none of that could be done with glass,  I just don't think that the notification stuff alone  is enough to get someone to shut out  that kind of money for it.  I mean, obviously they'd probably make it a little cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also think that this product may just be way too early.  I mean, do you remember someone posted something  on Twitter earlier today?  Hey, remember when we were all creeped out  about sharing our phone's location?  Remember when that was a huge deal?  Now everyone does it, no one thinks about it.  All kinds of companies have access to your phone location.  I wonder if this is the type of product  that years from now will just think is totally normal.  Of course, someone's taking pictures with their glasses  or of course, whatever, but it was just too early,  too sudden, too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I agree with that, Matthew.  And I think the way that it's probably going to enter  into the popular culture is through sports and fitness  and other things like that.  You can easily see that scuba diving masks  and ski goggles and things like that  are going to get data about your speed, your depth.  Important things, right now, if you're a scuba diver,  you have a dive computer on your wrist,  it's a gigantic thing.  You're already wearing this, essentially, it's an interface.  It should be just heads up display right there.  Of course, cars will get heads up displays,  which is better to have it on the dashboard,  to have it on the windshield or to have it in your,  in your watch using. I'm not sure.  I don't know. Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, who knows?  But I think that glamorous applications  of heads up technology on something that's on your face  are going to happen and then people will be influenced  by Ray-Ban, which of course is owned by Luxottica,  which of course has been reportedly working on a version  of Google Glass for some or one of their brands.  You can see that kind of thing coming about,  extreme sports, whatever it is.  And it'll have to get the cache that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at where GoPro's, right?  GoPro does a lot of the same things that Glass,  not the photos so much, but live video,  but it's much more obvious and it's much more specific  to certain activities.  Nobody walks around with a GoPro, you know,  all day during the regular life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look how cool it is to have a GoPro on your head,  like to have a helmet with this like weird thing.  I mean, so you look ridiculous,  but if you're jumping out of an airplane,  nobody's going to think you look ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, at Google, what Google needs is somebody  to look even more ridiculous.  So once Oculus Rift becomes popular  and people are wearing basically a face mask  where you can't see any of their face,  then Google can say, look, we look way better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if Google could have convinced a bunch of,  you know, hardcore snowboarder and surfers  to wear Google Glass instead of all the tech engineers  in San Francisco, maybe that would have changed  the whole perception from the get-go, right?  Because I mean, that's what GoPro is so cool, right?  There's a cool feeling to it  that Google Glass just never had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google did get the models, right?  The models on the runway to try and get the,  I don't know, the fashion aspect.  Which actually in retrospect is kind of hilarious, right?  Like they went for fashion, but in reality,  that's what everybody knocks on glasses,  doesn't it look ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it doesn't matter  what the model's point of view is, does it?  I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, a model on a catwalk,  their purpose is to model the clothes,  and it's a many to one medium, if you will.  The experience of being somebody wearing clothes  is not all that compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to see Rory McIlroy wearing a setter,  you know, somebody doing something  that you would want to actually take part in  or see from their point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  All right, well, speaking of things  that Google's getting into that maybe they should,  maybe they shouldn't get into,  Google has launched through its Waze division  in Tel Aviv, Israel, a new service that's not like Uber,  it's more like a carpooling service.  They're testing it just in that one city, Tel Aviv.  Of course, Google bought Waze two years ago.  Waze is a social mapping and navigation app  that's actually very cool in many ways,  cooler than Google Maps,  because they crowdsource the location of the police,  of hazards on the road, of gas stations and things like that,  and you can see other users as they're driving around  with little cartoon avatars and stuff like that.  My question is, and I'll throw this out to,  I'll start with you, Kurt, is this even a business?  I mean, carpooling, it's like,  if Google wanted to get into the Uber and compete with Uber,  I could see, yeah, that's a big business,  but carpooling, it seems like small potatoes  for a company like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, I would have probably said the same thing  about Uber and Lyft even just trying to get into their,  like what they're essentially doing, carpooling, right?  Their shared rides where I'm getting picked up,  and then three blocks later,  they're picking up a stranger  and taking us to the same spot.  I mean, I think just the whole idea of taking advantage  of the fact that people are doing the same kind of thing,  and like, okay, if we're all doing this,  let's do it together.  Yes, it's maybe small potatoes right now.  I do think there's a need for taking advantage of that,  and maybe Google thinks that they can help fill that need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the cost is de minimis.  It brings far fewer,  in most ways, it brings far fewer complications  than Uber and Lyft  because you're not a professional driver.  You're just in fact saying, we'll share this ride.  Now there may be some liability involved.  You put somebody in a car with somebody dangerous,  and Google does that.  That's another matter, but it's good for the environment.  It's a lot easier.  It's limited to only being able to do two rides per day  so that you don't use it as a fake Uber.  You agree upon what you're charged.  I think Google gets 15% of that.  I think it's really fascinating,  and I think that there are other ways to consider.  This is more about a true sharing economy.  This is where you're sharing the ride,  and there's a way to make that possible, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you think about something like Airbnb,  when Airbnb started,  it was literally blow up mattresses in people's living rooms,  and many people, including me,  thought no one is ever gonna do that.  That sounds ridiculous.  It's clearly not a business.  I'm not saying this is gonna turn into that,  but I could see this does make sense to use an app,  to use technology to connect people who need to go places  and wanna share a ride.  That's a clear and obvious need where technology,  and particularly social technology, can help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  Well, we'll see how that goes.  I, for one, would like to see Google do more with Waze.  Waze is one of those companies, I think, like Nest,  which is kind of off on its own.  It's more or less churning out the same product  that it would have done had Google not acquired it.  And I'd love to see the social features  built into Google Maps,  because I think Google Maps is-  I completely adore Waze.  Yeah.  It's a great service.  It's a great service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  I would argue that if we thought expansively  about journalism,  we'd be thinking about ways to help the public share  what they know.  No pun intended.  What was the pun there?  Waze.  Waze.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  Oh, you got-  You got-  Is that really where you are, Jeff?  Deep dream going on heavy in your head.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't get this dog spaghetti out of my mind.  Anyway, please proceed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it's a way that people  just can share information and help each other,  and that's what we ought to be enabling,  but that's-  We never think that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, Waze is another one of those things.  Maybe I'm betraying a flaw in my thinking,  but Waze was another thing where I looked at it  and thought, no one's ever going to do that.  No one's ever going to take time to type into their phone,  hey, there's a cop at this intersection,  or this light is out, or there's an accident.  You know what?  Hundreds of thousands or millions of people  are more than happy to do that.  And when you're using it, it is incredibly useful,  especially the cop stuff.  Yeah, can we be honest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all about the police, knowing where the police are.  Yeah, come on.  So you can speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The police thing is great.  But I have gotten to the point where we have a GPS  in our car, which I never look at,  because it's stupid and it doesn't update,  and it's hard to search for things.  Waze is now taking control of when we go somewhere,  if Waze says, don't go that way, go this way,  I'm going to go that way.  I'm not even going to look, because every time I do it,  it winds up being better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  Well, let's take another break.  And when we come back, we're going to talk about  whether algorithms can be sexist,  or in fact, whether Google's algorithms for job hunting  are in fact sexist.  But first, let's talk about hiring great people.  You want to hire great people,  no matter what gender, no matter what.  And then the problem with hiring people these days,  of course, is that people who are looking for work  are everywhere.  They're on the social networks.  They're on dozens or hundreds of job boards.  They're just absolutely everywhere.  And if you want to go from site to site to site,  you're actually going to need to hire somebody  to help you with that.  There's a much easier way, which is to go to ZipRecruiter,  one of our sponsors today,  where you can post to 100 plus job sites  with a single click, and social networks,  Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google Plus.  And the Twitter feature will even auto post your jobs  as soon as you post them.  Off goes the tweet.  And so people following your Twitter account  will see that right away.  They even support LinkedIn groups and Facebook pages,  and you can post to profiles, whatever you want to do.  And they will automatically and instantly match you  to candidates from over four million resumes  in their Gigundo resume database.  They're used by over 400,000 businesses,  and you can try it now for free.  And they also have a feature called Traffic Boost.  So if you get the Traffic Boost feature,  they will put your post into ZipRecruiter's  daily job alerts for that really, really important job  that you're trying to hire for.  Put it in Traffic Boost, you'll get a huge, huge return.  And you don't have to wade through all of the responses  that you get because ZipRecruiter will separate  the most qualified from the least qualified  so you can spend your valuable time  on the most qualified candidates.  You also want to check out their blog  at ziprecruiter.com slash blog  where they'll give you great advice  for how to hire the best people.  Try ZipRecruiter today with a free four-day trial  and get your perfect candidate  before they go to somebody else.  Just go to ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  All right, well, Jeff Jarvis,  can ad targeting systems be sexist?  What do you think?  Is this story on MIT Technology Review  by Tom Simonite?  How do you say Tom's name?  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  This is the problem with the print journalists.  All names should come with links to pronounce it.  Thank you, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is this sexist?  Do you think this study is onto something?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about, every data set has its prejudices  and every algorithm has its prejudices.  Yes, built in, and you can only know them when it comes out  and to treat this as if, oh my God,  Google is evil and racist.  No, the algorithm is evil and racist.  No, it's the same problem we had last week,  that horrible, horrible, horrible episode  of the photo algorithm identifying African Americans  not as people.  Awful and immediately seen as terrible  and immediately fixed.  And this is what these big technologies will do.  They will reveal themselves, reveal the prejudices  of what was put into them because of that.  The same argument made, I would argue, about Facebook  and the echo chamber is, well, if all you pay attention to  is liberals, then that's all Facebook is gonna give you  of liberals, because that's the data it has in  and that's the formula it has.  So there's something off, not so much with the company,  but with the data or the formula, and this reveals that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think there is a larger point,  which Stacy Higginbotham tried to make in a post at Fortune.  Her argument was that part of the way,  part of the reason this happens  and part of the way that you can correct it  is to have a more diverse workforce  working on those algorithms.  Yes.  Because presumably those things will occur to them.  Well, as we said last week, Matthew.  It occurred to all the white guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and we said last week,  if you had more diverse people dogfooding the applications,  then that would expose these things sooner  and help you fix and make better algorithms  and get better data.  But to throw our arms up every time and say, oh my God,  what are we trying to do here?  Say, well, the technology's broken.  No, something's not perfect, it's never gonna be perfect,  it needs to be fixed.  And Stacy, you were quite right about that,  the more perspectives you have using it,  the better off you're gonna be.  But at some point, at some point it's gonna get out there  and it's gonna discover something else  and we have to be able to just basically say,  this is wrong, what's wrong should be fixed immediately.  If you don't fix it, then we'll get mad.  But if you fix it, then we're collaboratively here  trying to make all these things better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually, this is very similar  to the dog heads in the spaghetti,  if I can make that analogy.  Because- I wish I could forget that.  Matthew's not gonna let you.  That'll be in your dreams later.  Because we're Google, Facebook,  everyone is trying to teach their algorithms to think  and to recognize patterns.  And so if your algorithm is trained badly,  it's going to recognize faces where there aren't faces  or it's gonna imagine that certain things are other things.  And you have to train it better  and one of the ways you can do that, as you said,  is to have more input, to have more diverse input  so that your algorithm gets smarter faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we talked last week about the black users  of Google Photos being identified as gorillas,  which Jeff, you mentioned.  And our solution was, you can't just let the algorithms  be without, you have to have human intervention.  And here's another case, according to Stacy,  human intervention, again, is the solution here.  Theoretically, although I think it's less of a solution  in this case, simply because the problem  with gender discrimination in the workplace  is a deep societal problem.  So you'll even find many women  who have subconscious expectations  that women are going to be offered lower pay, et cetera,  even though they don't want it,  even though consciously they don't say it,  it's such a deep problem in our society.  That's why inevitably it's showing up  in these algorithms and so on.  So to a certain extent, you need human intervention  and you also need analytical tools  that will surface these things, like this report,  like this study, this tool that surfaced this.  So we can examine it with that in mind,  because again, biases are cultural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, I think you can use the bias for good.  You can say there's a problem in society.  For example, try this out.  We would agree there are not enough women in technology.  And it is bad for the technology industry.  You could choose to try to skew such a service  to try to push more technology jobs first to women.  You could use the bias to a different reason.  You could choose to do that,  but you have to be aware of what that bias is  and how you're doing.  Now the next problem is, oh, they're manipulating  the market, they're manipulating our minds,  they're manipulating anything that's on Facebook, whatever.  That's where some level of transparency comes in.  What's happened in this case, I think,  it was not even transparent to Google.  It was, oh, crap, look what happened.  And those things need to be tested.  But there are moments where you could say,  let us purposely overcompensate for something that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm glad you mentioned transparency,  because I remember a study where Facebook effectively showed  that, or researchers showed that by manipulating  the news feed in certain ways,  they could encourage more people to go and vote,  which obviously seems like a great thing.  So one thing you could take away from that is,  Facebook can use its algorithm for good.  The other thing you could take away from that is,  holy cow, Facebook can manipulate the news feed  and make people do things.  Not always a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there again, it's the devil's in the details  and there are unintended consequences for everything.  Exactly.  Maybe it's not a good idea for everyone to vote.  And what I mean by that is,  this idea that you would get more people to vote  sounds on its face like an unalloyed good.  So essentially, the people who are most interested  in politics, the most engaged in the process,  who read the news, who follow the,  those are the folks who are gonna vote.  And as people who don't care, who watch reality shows,  don't follow the news, don't care what's going on,  those are the people you're gonna go get to vote,  can't sell out your vote.  I mean, I think that, yes, it's good if everybody's informed  and everybody votes, but I don't think it's better  that nobody's informed and everybody votes.  See what I'm saying?  So there are unintended consequences to all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's not forget that journalism tries  to manipulate people too.  Yes, yes.  It tries to manipulate them too, go vote.  Only for good.  Marketers try to manipulate, ministers try to manipulate,  manipulation's all around us.  And sometimes you can see it and sometimes you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so I wanna manipulate this panel  into a conversation that's highly controversial  and nobody's having this conversation  and I think it really needs to be had.  We sort of kind of started to talk about it  on Tech News today.  We didn't really have the chance to do that.  And here's the problem.  So we know that, Jeff, you mentioned,  and this is not on the rundown, I apologize for that.  But Jeff, you know that, you mentioned that  there aren't enough women in technology in Silicon Valley.  We also know that the diversity numbers  also poorly reflect on the diversity,  the ethnic and racial diversity within the United States.  African-Americans are wildly underrepresented.  Hispanic-Americans are wildly underrepresented.  Women are wildly unrepresented.  Here's the part of the story  that hardly anybody's reporting.  White-Americans are somewhat underrepresented.  In other words, the percentage of white employees  of Facebook, for example, is significantly lower  than the percentage in the United States.  And what's really happening is that Asians,  mostly from China and India,  are overrepresented in Silicon Valley.  But that's where you can find women engineers  from China and India.  So you get super talented engineers from Asia  and they're not anywhere near as bad as the United States is  in terms of preparing women to become engineers  and be in other technical fields.  So pulling people from Asia is a great way  to boost the number of women,  but it also contributes to the fact that  Chinese and Indian and Asian employees  are so overrepresented  as a function of the population in general.  Of course, Silicon Valley has its own demographics  and many of those are informed by immigration.  H-1B visas and all the rest.  I guess the conversation that needs to be had here is,  to what extent is our Silicon Valley technology companies  masking an even greater problem of women in technology  by pulling so many women from Asia  while simultaneously skewing the racial and ethnic numbers  away from wildly underrepresented minorities.  Matthew Ingram, what do you got?  No, see, nobody wants to have this conversation.  That is not a softball by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think I see your point.  I see if Facebook and Google and other large tech companies  are kind of beefing up the number of female employees  by getting female engineers from Asia and India,  then that doesn't help the US solve its problem,  which is how to get more girls and women interested in science  and interested in technical fields.  Well, actually, if I can interrupt you,  to a certain extent it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My son works for a Silicon Valley company  and they've got a senior woman engineer in the company  and she spends a lot of time going around to elementary schools  and middle schools and stuff, talking to girls  and telling them what a great career it is in Silicon Valley  and to do engineering.  So there's some benefit in terms of role models and so on,  but I'm sorry I interrupted you.  Yeah, I just think, I mean, what you're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is a huge societal problem that has been a problem  for hundreds of years.  I mean, it's not, obviously,  technical jobs haven't been around that long,  but those issues are ones that society  has been struggling with for a long time.  They're not kinds of things that you can change with a visa  or a tax break or a job break.  A tax break or, you know, it takes generations  before those things are solved.  I wouldn't claim to understand how those things happen  or how to make them happen faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff, do you have any thoughts on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that it's a mistake to set the goal  as exactly reflecting society in one plane.  Yeah.  There are many, many definitions of diversity  around what a company or a government or a school needs.  And we pride ourselves greatly at CUNY on being diverse,  and we try to define that in many ways,  and that includes things like economic opportunity,  economic discrimination, it includes international voices,  it includes sexual preference.  Right now, if you were an institution that had no,  for whatever reason, if you could have,  I think this is possible, but if you had no voices of LGBT,  you would have missed out on what was happening in society  the last 10 years or so.  You would have been dumber for it, even if you're,  let's say, look at all the marketing companies  that went crazy wonderfully, I think,  after the Supreme Court decision,  that had to come from diverse viewpoints  within the companies saying this matters.  So diversity has many, many, many definitions.  And I think that rather than saying that,  I mean, I don't think it's a,  it's not a problem that whites are underrepresented per se,  or that Asians are overrepresented.  I think that's the wrong way to go.  I think that the right way to go is to say,  what perspectives don't we have that are gonna be useful?  And then to try to figure out how to build that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how can you encourage as much diversity as possible?  Not kind of mathematically, how can we represent,  sort of mythical society or represent,  or reflect the breakdown within the US?  But how can you have as many diverse voices as possible  in your company in different places?  Not, I mean, to say all Asians are the same  or Asian women engineers are the same,  or you should have as many different voices  and perspectives represented as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead, Chris.  Sorry, if I could just hop in.  I mean, on that note, it's important to remember  that these companies that we're talking about,  the Apples and Facebooks and Googles of the world,  I mean, they're building products  for a global audience now too, right?  So I mean, the fact that they're bringing in engineers  or employees from Asia or Europe or South America,  I mean, that's obviously very important  to building products that can connect  with those communities as well.  So this idea of like, okay, well,  it doesn't reflect the demographic breakdown  in the United States is really,  that doesn't necessarily matter in the sense  of they're building things for the majority of their users  are outside the United States.  And so maybe this is actually a way to improve  their products in other parts of the world  that we're kind of not thinking of  because we're in Silicon that we're here  in the United States and really kind of thinking  about ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that, you know, if I'm being honest,  the absolute truth about this whole technology  diversity issue is the fact that culturally,  children are told these are the kinds of people  who are interested in technology  and these are the kinds of people  who are not supposed to be interested in technology.  It's the cultural messages that kids receive  are so overwhelming or so overpowering.  And I think it's toxic because, you know,  each and every person has their own personality  and their personality and their skills  and their interests are going to direct,  and we're derailing that to a certain extent  by telling kids who they're supposed to be  when they're a very young age.  Of course, this problem before the mid-80s  barely existed because we didn't at that point  get around to telling girls, for example,  that tech was for boys.  Like, you know, commercials and movies and TV shows  started doing that in the 80s  and now we're suffering the effects of that.  So, you know, I think that, you know,  it's a tough problem and I think journalism,  to a certain extent, does have a role in this  because, you know, and media, entertainment media,  has an even bigger role, actually.  And so I just think it's a vast and vast,  societal problem.  And I'll also say that there's an economic element to this.  If you sort of rank the economies of the world  by, you know, richest to poorest,  you'll find a fairly strong correlation  between the degree to which you have inclusion  in the economy and wealth.  The greater the inclusion, the greater the wealth.  And when you get down to the super poor countries,  you see that, you know, only a certain caste  or only a certain group or only a certain gender  or whatever is involved in all the activity.  And so, you know, I think that there's also  an economic problem, not just in the US,  but around the world.  And, you know, so anyway, we're not gonna solve it here  the more we talk about diversity.  The diverse it gets.  So let's, why don't we take a break.  And when we come back, we're gonna talk about  whether BlackBerry should or should not  get into the Android racket  and what their next steps should be.  So for now, though, I wanna talk about lifelong learning.  I wanna talk about following your passion in life.  I wanna talk about lynda.com, one of our sponsors today.  You know, I believe, and I think everybody on this panel  believes that you should never ever stop learning.  And, you know, we go to college  or we go to high school, go to college,  and then we graduate at some point.  And lots of people just, they're done.  They're done learning stuff.  But that's no way to live life.  Life is too short for that.  lynda.com is for problem solvers, for curious people,  for people who wanna make a difference,  who wanna make things happen.  You can learn, for example, how to develop an Android app.  Even I could do that.  You could master Google Analytics or Sharp HTML skills.  lynda.com has everything you need to learn these things.  One of the things that I've learned so much about  from lynda.com is about photography.  You know, I take vastly better pictures  with my smartphone now than I used to  with a very expensive DSLR a few years ago  because lynda.com showed me so much  and taught me so much about taking the pictures,  about editing them, about selecting them,  all aspects of that.  For example, you know, there's a course,  it's a weekly series actually, called The DIY Photographer  with Joseph Lynashky.  Now, if you know about photography,  you know Joseph Lynashky.  He's like an awesome dude, a great teacher,  a brilliant photographer.  He'll teach you things like how to make your own macro lens  for a few bucks.  Macro photography is awesome and it's even more awesome  if you're making your own lens.  There's so much to be learned from Joseph Lynashky.  His course is just one of many, many that lynda.com offers.  They have courses on Adobe's Creative Cloud Updates  for 2015, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Audition,  After Effects, InDesign, and Illustrator.  It's just a fantastic service.  It's, the learning never has to stop  and it's so much more fun with lynda.com.  To a certain extent, a lot of this coursework  is a lean back experience.  You can relax, have a cool beverage,  and learn a new skill, enhance your career,  follow your passions.  lynda.com has it all for you.  Your lynda.com membership gives you unlimited access  to training on hundreds of topics, all for one flat rate.  That's right, one flat rate and you can learn all you can.  Whether you're looking to become an expert,  whether you're passionate about a hobby,  or just wanna learn something new,  I want you to visit lynda.com slash twig  and sign up for your free 10 day trial.  That's right, you can try it for 10 days.  That's lynda.com slash twig.  And we thank lynda.com for their support  and also for teaching me how to take pictures.  All right, well, it looks like we've got some photos  of what might be BlackBerry's upcoming Android phone  and it could be coming to AT&T,  which brings up a big question.  There are two big paths in the smartphone world  that BlackBerry could take.  One of them is to say, okay, we're a software company,  we have security, we have enterprise readiness,  we have all these features and benefits.  Let's de-emphasize the hardware.  Our specialty was the physical keyboards  and that's over for the most part.  Or the other approach is say, no, we're a hardware company,  we have innovative hardware, everybody's on Android,  why don't we become an Android vendor?  Kurt, what do you think?  Which is the better course,  or should they even make that choice for BlackBerry?  Should they become an Android company  or should they become a software company  and do their own thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm of the mindset that they should become  an Android company and this is a little bit  outside of my realm of expertise,  so take this with a grain of salt,  but I look around and outside of the United States,  I mean, it seems as if the majority of the world  is on Android or maybe not, obviously not the majority,  but a huge portion of the world is using Android devices  and I think that it's an operating system  that people are familiar with and building for  and thinking about long term.  And I think that it's smart for a company like BlackBerry  to simply associate themselves with something  that seems like it's gonna be around for the long term  versus trying to get into some kind of a competition  with both Google and Apple,  which seems like it clearly hasn't worked out  so far for them and it doesn't seem like  it's worth the effort at this point.  So if you can build something smart  that offers something unique to the Android audience,  I think that sounds like a better move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it would have been a great move five years ago.  I think I'm not convinced it's gonna make a big difference  to BlackBerry right now.  I mean, part of me feels like they should just  forget about handsets completely  or at least de-emphasize them.  And just focus on software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's it like now Matthew in Canada?  Sorry, what's it like now in Canada?  I mean, down here, I made a friend of a friend of a friend  yesterday who used to be a BlackBerry fanatic  and I said, well, let's do that.  He said, I haven't seen BlackBerry in anybody's hand  in probably a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't the president still have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  In Canada, the whole BlackBerry.  I see them all the time.  You still do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see them all the time.  I still see them all the time.  Lots of people use the passport.  I make fun of them of course,  because I think it's a ridiculous device.  But they seem to like it.  In most cases, they're using it because their company  has a deal with BlackBerry or the arm of government  they work for has a deal with BlackBerry.  So they're kind of stuck with them.  Is there kind of a Canadian loyalty to it?  There's a little bit of that, but the security aspects,  they probably had long-term agreements with BlackBerry.  So to some extent, they're stuck with them.  To some extent, I think lots of people  like the physical keyboard.  So it's not that there isn't a market there.  I think there probably is.  I'm just, I'm not sure how big it is.  So could they do it?  Sure.  But is it gonna make a big difference to the company?  I'm not convinced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, good luck to BlackBerry.  Let's talk about something else  that I think is a really interesting development,  which of course is the new war  between Facebook and YouTube around video.  Now, YouTube of course is the undisputed  heavyweight champion when it comes to video,  video advertising, it's a fantastic resource.  Lots of people spend lots of hours there, a lot of eyeballs.  And now Facebook is really, really getting into this.  Kurt Wagner, you wrote a piece late last week  about this very thing.  What is Facebook doing to compete with YouTube nowadays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Facebook's doing a handful of things,  but the most recent is that they're essentially  trying to create a stream of videos  that are all kind of related around a specific topic.  And they're selling ads against that stream.  And in order to lure people to build,  and excuse me, create and shoot videos,  they're sharing some revenue.  And that's something that YouTube has done for a long time,  trying to convince people to put stuff onto YouTube  that can make some money while doing it.  Facebook's never done that before.  So now what they're trying to do is essentially  lure these content creators to come to Facebook  in exchange for taking a little bit of the money  that they might get from the ad revenue in exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's really smart.  I mean, I was talking to someone off the record,  in the industry who was talking about Facebook and video,  and they were saying Facebook is a huge video platform,  but they don't do revenue sharing.  And so YouTube still has one up on them.  This is obviously an attempt to go after  that sort of weakness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, PewDiePie, who is a YouTube star,  we just learned that he made $7 million last year.  He's a 20, what is he, 24-year-old guy  who just does goofball, gaming-oriented videos  and other things.  He just came out with a book, a somewhat ridiculous book,  but he's got an incredible platform.  No, it's ridiculous.  It is, it is.  It's even more ridiculous, if you can believe it,  than Snooki's book.  But anyway.  That's our standard now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's kind of defensive about the money too, apparently.  He's kind of defensive.  So I make $7 million, leave me alone.  So I do ridiculous videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is too bad, he should be victorious, shouldn't he?  He said, look, I'm the future of television.  I've built my own new empire.  He should be proud of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He should be, but I think he appreciates the fact  that he's kind of ridiculous.  Yeah, well, that's true.  I mean, I mean, I think he's a little bit ridiculous  in the name, the shtick,  but is it any more ridiculous than there's a woman  somewhere in Florida who makes $12 million a year  unboxing kids' toys?  So at least is that that much more ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.  So Kurt, does this set up now,  what entices me is does this set up competition  for YouTube and Facebook to be one-upping each other  on business terms and business benefits  to popular video makers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  I think that Facebook's pitch is gonna be,  hey, we have 1.4 billion people on our platform  who are coming here every month,  but more importantly, we can show your video  to people who don't follow you, right?  I mean, that's kind of the point  of this suggested video feed is that your video  could appear in front of fans  that you don't even know you have.  And I don't think that YouTube,  I mean, YouTube kind of does that right.  If you watch a video, you get to the end,  it may have suggested videos.  Of course, you're gonna stumble across things,  and I stumble across videos all the time from people  I'm not following on YouTube.  I think Facebook's pitch, kind of be like,  our algorithm can do this for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have our attention for a stream.  Right, they can put it in a feed, right?  Facebook has that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it has it on Google+, but it goes there, except Mike.  Yeah, well, that's not good, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I wanted you to explain the other story you wrote, Kurt,  which is the next one down at the rundown,  is that Facebook is now separating out,  and I think this is a part of this,  that if you're in its stream,  and if certain actions happen there,  there's one business benefit.  If you have to click off to a site, it's another.  Can you explain what Facebook has just announced there,  what they're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, the ad click stuff from today?  Yes.  Assume, yes, so this is interesting.  It's not quite specific to,  well, I guess it kind of falls into this category.  Twitter's done for a while, by the way.  I wanna point that out for one of the very first times,  it seems like Facebook's actually  kind of taking a page from Twitter,  whereas typically I feel like we see the opposite.  But what is happening is Facebook kind of changed  the term click and what it means for advertisers.  So before, if I'm an advertiser,  I'm paying for every time someone likes my ad,  every time someone comments on my ad.  That's not all that helpful to me.  I mean, maybe someone liking my ad, like great,  maybe I created something good that's reassuring.  But really, I want them coming to my website  or I want them installing the app  that I've included in that ad.  And so I wanna only pay for those things.  And so that's Facebook's, they're going to advertisers  and saying, we're only gonna charge you  if someone clicks on the thing that you want them to click,  if they go to your website  or if they actually install the app that you're advertising.  We're not gonna charge you for a Facebook post like  or a comment or a share.  Oh wow.  Yeah, and I mean, there's an option.  If I'm an advertiser, I can choose.  If I still really want likes,  maybe I can pay for those, those will be cheaper.  But if I just simply want app installs,  I'm willing to pay a little bit more,  but only pay for those app installs  versus the engagement metrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really going to a Google model  of the original Google of pay per click.  But let me stay on this for a minute more.  So in instant articles, what Facebook is saying is  to hell with clicking off to new sites,  experience it here on Facebook with an ad,  with a rev share, and it's better off for everybody.  It's gonna be faster.  It's gonna be more the experience.  You'll have more engagement.  You'll have richer media in Facebook, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I assume they're gonna say all of that same stuff  they've said to these first nine news partners  to advertisers as well.  And there'll be, at some point then,  there's a pricing structure for attention in the stream  versus clicks out of the stream.  And I would think that Facebook is gonna say,  we can really control the industry  and we can charge premium for that.  So just even a lot of timing to me too,  that they're valuing clicks higher now  at a time when they're telling media,  forget clicks guys, it ain't working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a bit of a interesting  back and forth right now  because they also showed off some ad.  These aren't ads that they're actually testing,  but kind of a prototype of an ad  that they could envision on Facebook.  They showed that off at Con earlier,  I guess last month to all the advertisers over in France.  And those ads looked very much  like the instant article type thing.  So I would click on an ad  and I'd kind of go to this almost like unique website  that's still on Facebook,  but for that marketer, for that advertiser.  And so I'm looking at their products,  I'm looking at these beautiful images  and I can download an app,  but I'm never leaving Facebook to do that.  And that's kind of what they're saying  they envision the future of ads to look like.  And yet right now, here they are saying,  we all know we're only gonna charge you  if someone clicks and actually goes off to your website.  So clearly I think that what they're trying to do  is they're trying to appease advertisers.  I'm sure that they came to them and said,  hey, look at Twitter,  we're only paying if they install our app.  We're not paying for a retweet or a favorite.  Like why are we paying for that here at Facebook?  I'm sure that when they get enough feedback,  they were like, all right,  well, let's make this an option for people right now.  It'll be interesting to see in the future,  maybe clicking instead of going to a website,  maybe that click is gonna go to this kind of Facebook  version of a brand's website.  Maybe everything will just live on Facebook.  I'm sure that they would love that.  It's a trap.  It's a trap. It's a trap, get out.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The biggest story here is the degree to which Twitter  and Facebook are becoming to resemble each other.  Mostly this is Twitter copying Facebook.  And this week they added the ability for you  to put in your birth date.  You basically go to your profile,  edit profile, and now there's a new birth date feature  to incentivize you to add that.  The privacy settings of the date are different from the year.  So you can make your date public  so that everybody wishes you a happy birthday,  but you can keep your year private  so nobody knows how old you are.  I'm such a scrooge about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get all these, people are, oh, it's somebody's birthday.  They're all gonna say happy birthday.  Then the person's gonna say, oh, thank you all.  It happens once a year.  Jeez.  What it does, because I went here,  I'm now sick of birthdays completely.  I don't wanna have them.  I don't wanna know them.  I'm gonna ignore July 15th, which is next week,  and just act like it's any other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Subtle birthday drop there, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's subtle plug for your birthday.  When was that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get alerts from Facebook.  Obviously people lie about their birthdays  because I'm constantly getting alerts.  So-and-so's having their 157th birthday  or so-and-so's having their 12th birthday.  So they're clearly putting in the wrong dates  because they don't want people to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The obvious benefit for Twitter, of course,  is that when they know what,  even though you keep it private what year you were born,  that's the information they really want  because they can, if you're 18,  that's one set of advertising.  Yep, true.  And if you're 80, that's a different one.  And so, again, they're becoming more like Facebook.  But again, this is a pretty rough metric.  They want your location, but with your location,  with your age, with your gender,  and a couple of other things.  They can probably sell ads at a higher cost  than they would otherwise sell,  as if we don't know who these people are.  And it is a creeping phenomenon  that they will increasingly harvest information from you.  They will increasingly algorithmically filter  your streams, they'll see what you click on,  how much time you spend on this, that, and the other thing.  In other words, they will increasingly become  just like Facebook.  Mike, you got to understand, sorry to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think while the year is most important  for if you're gonna do mass targeting, right?  Hey, I wanna hit all the 25-year-olds,  all the 35-year-olds on Twitter, there you go.  I think the birthday is important too right now  because, hey, maybe they don't know how old I am,  but they know that my birthday is in December,  and all of a sudden I'm gonna get,  hey, Kurt, happy birthday.  Here's an ad for 10% off at some restaurant, go celebrate.  Or here, happy birthday, or it's Kurt's birthday,  let's go ahead and send him a gift, you know what I mean?  And you can buy that gift through Twitter  with a discount or something like that.  So I think the specific date could actually be  just as valuable as the year, depending on how it's used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also if they know your relationship,  if they know who your spouse is, they can say,  hey, here's the perfect gift for that guy in your life  who's a geek who spends a lot of time on social networks  and who lives in San Francisco, intent,  you know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So-  Remember when Facebook, you could give people virtual  presents, so you could give them sort of a little,  remember that?  I bet Twitter adds that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet they do.  I saw that most recently on a long list of things  that Facebook introduced that failed.  There was literally like 50 things on the list.  And I remember, I'm sorry, I remember that,  I remember that, what happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that was the most fun thing to me  in Zuck's Q&A last week where somebody said,  why did you invent the poke?  And Zuck's answer was, it seemed like a good idea  at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seemed like a good idea at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh man.  And then he-  Didn't he single-handedly write the poke app or the poke?  He did.  The feature, yeah.  Unbelievable, unbelievable.  And that was like the hot thing for like three days.  And then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still get pokes every once in a while.  Yeah, it's longer than three days.  Yeah, there's like 20 pokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It went through, it got creepy,  and then people stopped doing it and it got stupid.  And then it became a thing again,  and then it got creepy again.  It went through a whole cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the original-  It was the cycle of creepiness.  Yeah, it's the cycle of creepiness.  The cycle of-  All right, well-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny.  Sorry, did you want to move on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, go ahead, go ahead, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna say, when we were talking about  Twitter copying Facebook,  I remember when Instant Articles came out,  the first thing I thought of was,  I bet Twitter wishes they could do something like that.  They tried to do, or they have done,  they have cards, Twitter cards,  where you can pull up an excerpt of a story and so on.  They've tried to have partnerships with media companies,  and I bet that's the type of thing  they would really like to do with their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, I think that Twitter has become so much  like Facebook now that somebody,  I think there's a big opportunity for somebody  to come out with a messaging service  where you just put in 140 characters or less,  and you can text, and do it through SMS,  and just have it be super minimalist.  No photos, no video.  No photos, right.  Well, the New York Post,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the New York Post, not exactly the leader  in business and technology reporting,  but had raw speculation today  because the Sun Valley confab  of the rich and powerful is coming up.  That, you know, if we see Zuck sitting down with  the Dorsey, Dorsey.  Will that mean that Facebook's gonna buy Twitter?  Not gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not gonna happen.  It's amazing how many companies should have, would have,  could have bought Twitter, Apple, Google, you name it.  Everybody was gonna buy Twitter.  The rumors have been flying for years and years,  and they just don't wanna sell.  I think that, I hope they never do.  I don't think they would be any good  as a sort of a division  of one of the other giant Silicon Valley companies.  Well, why don't we move on to our tools and numbers  and toys and stuff like that.  Oh, the week.  Jeff, do you have a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, hold on.  You beat me a little fast.  Since we're talking about Facebook,  I don't know if those numbers are old,  but it's just amazing to me every time.  Needham doing analysis of common score data,  and Kurt, you tell me how old this is.  1.44 billion users,  an average of 20 plus minutes per day,  accounting for 20% of all time online.  However, wondering whether there's a bit of Facebook fatigue,  which we keep on hearing perennially  that the US usage is going down.  Nonetheless, it is just an amazing behemoth.  And I have to say, partly inspired by you on Google+, Mike,  I took a bunch of German publishers and editors around  to hit important media people in New York,  three times they said to the Germans,  listen, you all may be on Twitter,  but they pointing out there are on Facebook.  And so in the last six weeks or so,  I've just made a much more concerted effort  to live on Facebook.  I still do Twitter, Google+, not as much, I'm sorry,  but really trying to understand Facebook better.  And it is a pretty amazing phenomenon.  The more I use it, the better it gets,  the more interaction I have.  I have far more followers on Facebook  than I do on Twitter.  Granted, I don't know what the algorithm shows  those followers on Facebook,  but then I do know that on Twitter,  a hell of a lot of people never see the tweets,  because following doesn't really matter as much.  So it's the same problem, but it's pretty amazing.  And it's easy to see how people can spend 20 minutes on it,  and easy to see how the value of that stream  beats the value of page-based media.  So anyway, that's the number of the week.  Kurt, are those numbers really old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Embarrassed to say I couldn't tell you,  but what I will say is that I think those 20 minutes  are spread out among multiple, multiple sessions.  I think that it's pretty common for,  no one's really opening their phone  and sitting for 20 minutes scrolling through their newsfeed,  although that could change  now that the video stuff is happening, right?  That's what they want.  They want you sitting there sucking your time away,  watching video.  But I think what's more important to Facebook  is that you're going to the app five, six, seven times a day  whenever you have free time, and that's what they want.  And that just includes Facebook.  Think about Instagram or WhatsApp  or these other properties they own as well.  They're taking over the home screen.  That's the goal, right?  They want to be all of your free times  on some kind of Facebook property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's also interesting and worth noting  that the battle between Google and Facebook,  in terms of eyeballs, is interesting in the sense  that Facebook has been so successful  at getting so many people to spend so much time on Facebook.  And on Google, there's really nothing like that.  I mean, of course, the amount of time people spend  on Google Plus compared to Facebook,  I mean, it's just minuscule.  And it's pretty small on Twitter too,  but back to Google, things like search.  Google's trying to get people off search  as soon as possible.  It has nothing else except for YouTube.  YouTube is the other big place on the internet  where people spend huge amounts of time.  And again, this is why, even back to the story  we talked about a minute ago,  why Facebook wants to take that away from Google.  Because it's the one place where Google can capture  and hold eyeballs for big dollar advertising  like pre-roll video ads and so on.  And Facebook wants it all.  And so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask each of you, all three of you,  in cum time, which is your point, Curt,  and I think that's right, in cumulative time in a day,  rank the time spent, the attention spent  you give to the various platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll go, this is the journalist's answer probably,  is Twitter is probably number one.  I'm refreshing Twitter,  what feels like constantly, unfortunately.  And I'll throw one thing out there about Twitter.  I'm surprised, given what Mike just said  about kind of finding places  where you can really get sucked in  for multiple minutes at a time,  I'm surprised Vine hasn't been a little bit more  a part of Twitter's plan.  I mean, they're obviously starting to,  they just did autoplay video and all that stuff.  But I would think Vine would-  So much of it is so irritating to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just not-  It's like a gif world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not all that great, unfortunately,  but it'll be interesting to see if they can figure out  how to take more advantage of that.  But I would say Twitter's probably first.  And then if I'm just talking about  like stuff I'm actually doing on my phone,  Facebook's probably second.  I'm rarely using Google on my phone,  but when I'm on my desktop working,  gosh, I'd probably go to Google 50 times a day.  I'm just always using it,  but it's more of like a means to an end  than it is somewhere where I go to enjoy my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'd have to say-  Go ahead. Yeah, sorry, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go ahead.  Okay.  Typical Canadian being polite and saying, you go ahead.  Yeah, I mean, clearly I spend most of my time on Google+,  but I also have,  I also use Friends Plus Me to have that go out  to Tumblr, to Facebook, and Twitter.  I do that for certain things,  but I spend a lot of time on Google+,  interacting with comments,  because the comments are oftentimes very involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has that changed recently, Mike?  Is that going down at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has changed.  It has changed.  The intensity of the comments on Google+,  from where it was like two years ago,  it's very different not only in the quantity of it,  but in who's doing it.  So nowadays, I get lots and lots of people  who don't really quite speak English  say things that I don't really understand,  even with the translate tool.  And there's a lot of that.  And the number of people who have the kinds of comments  that you went to Google+, for,  the substantive, intelligent, engaged people,  that's dropped to maybe a third of what it was  a couple of years ago.  They're still there,  but you have to weed through more fluff,  and you also have to accept the fact that  it's not gonna be like it was,  although it used to be overwhelming.  It used to be way too much.  Not that that's a benefit.  Where did those people go, I wonder?  Who knows?  Where did those people go?  Yeah, I think people are scattering generally,  because there's so many more places to go.  We also have messaging applications,  which are competing for people's time.  I think everybody's suffered,  except for Facebook for the most part.  I think they've done really well for themselves.  But I would say that,  so Google+, first, Facebook, and Twitter are probably tied.  The thing with Twitter that's interesting though,  is you either use Twitter on twitter.com,  or you use a third party app like TweetDeck,  or like TweetBot, or something like that.  If you use, let's say, TweetBot on a mobile phone,  and you click on a link, you tap on a link,  you kind of remain within TweetBot.  It has its own internal browser,  and you can go out to Chrome,  or something like that on your phone.  But most of the, it's interesting to me, Kurt,  that you spend most of your time on Twitter,  because most of the stuff on Twitter  is sending you off Twitter.  Whereas Facebook has worked so hard  to not send you anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just find that I'm refreshed.  I just feel like you can barely refresh the feed fast enough.  And there are times throughout the day  where I want to pull my hair out,  and I just close out Twitter,  because it's incredibly distracting.  Especially if I'm on deadline,  or trying to do something quickly.  It's just like, I need this out of here.  But it is definitely where I feel  that I'm looking for news on my beat.  I'm looking to see what other journalists are writing.  I just, Twitter seems to be my priority.  I'm the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the same.  So Twitter is probably number one.  Slack would be number two, just for work stuff.  But Facebook is way down there.  I don't really go there that often.  I have to be super bored to sort of pull up Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I decided I needed to change, Matthew,  is that I was kind of the sad,  I'm not quite as down on as you were,  but a lot of time on Twitter.  And just personally, I've got 150,000 followers on Twitter,  and 450,000 on Facebook.  Wow.  Yeah.  And so I said, what am I doing?  Let me cultivate that, see what that turns into.  There's a lot of people I respect,  like Roger Nerazzetti at the Wall Street Journal,  contribute a lot of stuff to Facebook.  The groups really work.  I'm really getting into, I met last night  with the guy who's in charge of News Feed for a little,  he's doing an off the record friendship tour  of media in New York.  And it's really, really interesting.  So I just, as an educational thing,  as what we do for a living,  I decided that I had to really go all in on Facebook.  And I'm enjoying it.  Part of the problem for me was,  my Twitter feed was going over to Facebook.  And that's still the case.  Yeah, I noticed that.  But when I try to do things specifically for Facebook  that are appropriate to Facebook,  it's like Google Plus,  or that's the only time that's ever been said.  Yeah, Facebook's like this thing called Google Plus,  it's wonderful.  But I would recommend to you to try a time,  like a Matt Cutts 30 day thing,  try to delve into Facebook.  Because the fact that 20% of web time,  of net time is supposedly there,  says we have to understand that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what-  Yeah, I guess I have, the problem I have is that,  I tried to quote unquote fix Facebook.  So I friended everyone.  Lots of people followed me.  I had thousands of quote unquote friends,  and it just was not working.  So I got rid of 80% of those people.  And I tried to make it just people I actually knew.  And so the problem now is if I start posting  all sorts of stuff into that stream,  or even cross posting from Twitter,  everyone's gonna get mad at me and unfriend me,  because it'll just be too noisy.  So now I don't know,  I basically don't know what to put there,  other than a link to the odd post and sunset photos.  I'm like, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing there.  Is it just connecting with friends,  or am I trying to do the whole Matthew Ingraham experience?  I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's great for those Venice,  like floating on the Venice Canal photos.  That was awesome.  The other thing that has to be said is we don't know  what these numbers really mean.  I mean, Jeff, you said you have hundreds of thousands  on Facebook, you have millions on Google+.  Twitter engagement, it's kind of like saying,  I have a radio show and X number of people have radios,  and therefore, it doesn't mean anything.  Yeah, same with Google+.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  In those two cases,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an algorithm decides what's gonna be of interest,  and if it decides I'm boring to people.  So you think that Twitter is more realistic  because it is a straight river.  But we know how few,  what small percentage of tweets  are actually seen by people.  So whatever you write on any of these three platforms  is seen far less than you might dream,  but we don't know how much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I don't understand is I will post something  like a picture of my daughter  or a picture of me on a boat or something,  and it will get liked by dozens of people  in foreign countries who I don't know,  who don't speak English.  I don't understand what are they doing?  Why are they doing that?  What do they hope to achieve?  I don't know whether they're trying to make contact with me.  They never comment.  They never do anything, but they will click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was being a bit voyeuristic.  You put up a picture of your boat,  and I saw this thing in the corner,  and I swear it looked like an eight-track drive.  So I gave a smart-ass remark,  and then your family,  members of your family were coming back  defending your boat.  It's all in front of your family.  It felt like an odd invasion into your nice lake in Canada,  but I enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of the weird things about Facebook  because somebody you were in the sixth grade with  gets into a conversation with a current coworker,  and you're just like, my worlds are colliding.  But I'm sorry to cut this off,  but Kurt has a hard out,  and I really want to get his tool,  so I'm sorry to interrupt the conversation  because this is great stuff,  but I want to get Kurt's tool in before he wanders away.  Kurt, go for it.  What's your tool of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cool, sorry to kill that conversation.  My tool for the week is an update  that happened just this morning to Meerkat.  Meerkat is that live streaming app  you guys may be familiar with.  It's got a rival called Periscope that Twitter owns.  What Meerkat did, there's a product update to it,  but there's also a business angle,  and I'm more interested in the business angle,  but I'll start real quick with the product stuff,  which is that you can now share  your live stream with somebody.  It'll be interesting if I'm doing a Q&A, for example,  and I'm saying, hey, ask me anything about Facebook,  and people are actually tuning in and listening,  I could click on another user,  and essentially they would show up.  They would use their own phone to appear on my stream  for up to a minute, and they could ask me their question,  then I could get rid of them off the screen,  and I could answer, and then I could pick a new user  and do the same thing.  So they're kind of trying to create this sharing element  around live video, which I think is kind of interesting,  but from the business standpoint,  what I wrote about this morning was that  they're kind of buddying up with Facebook.  So Twitter has Periscope,  and Twitter somewhat famously, I guess,  if you follow this stuff,  cut off Meerkat's access to its social graph.  So when Meerkat first launched,  what it did was you signed up with Twitter  and you were automatically following all your friends  on Twitter who also had the app,  and Twitter said, sorry,  we're not gonna let you do that anymore  because we have a rival product  and we don't wanna help you grow your network  over there, Meerkat, so they cut them off,  and now Facebook is letting them do that instead.  And so what's kind of happening is  you have this Twitter Periscope on one side,  Facebook and kind of Meerkat on the other,  even though Facebook obviously doesn't own Meerkat,  but it'll just be kind of interesting to see  if the integration between Meerkat and Facebook continues  and what that might do for kind of this Twitter-Facebook  rivalry that we've already touched on  a few times during the show.  So I think from a business standpoint,  they're aligning themselves with someone,  a big, big social network that may,  someday down the road, say,  hey, live streaming's pretty cool,  maybe we buy Meerkat, it's already integrated  into a lot of our products, so there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do seem very, very friendly.  Kurt Wagner is Associate Editor of Social Media at Recode,  and it's a great beat, and you're great  at what you do, Kurt Wagner.  I love having you on Tech News today.  You're pretty much on the show,  maybe on average, like, once a week or something like that.  Feels like it. Yeah, it's always great to have you on,  and thank you so much for coming on Twig today.  Thanks for coming in for great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks, guys, it was fun.  It was a lot of fun, I appreciate it.  Thanks for having me, hopefully we can do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, we'll see you on Facebook.  Adios.  All right, take care.  All right, Matthew, what do you got tool-wise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I don't, this tool might be old for a lot of people,  but I've been having a lot of fun with the Nexus 6  I got recently.  I tried a Nexus 6 for a little while.  I was unconvinced initially that it was gonna be,  that I was gonna wanna use it,  because it's so huge.  Every time I take it out, people are like,  is that a phone, is it a tablet?  And I thought no one-  Are you happy to see me?  Sorry.  No one is ever gonna use a phone this big,  I can barely hold the thing.  I can't single finger type the way I used to,  but I got so used to it,  that when I had to give back the demo I had,  I really missed it.  And I could have gotten a 6+, I guess,  but since I'm mostly an Android guy now,  I thought, and I've just gotten so used to it,  I can't imagine using a smaller phone.  I try and use even the Nexus 4 I used to have,  or God forbid, an old iPhone.  And it's like typing on a candy bar, a Barbie phone.  I just can't get used to it.  The screen real estate is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is very cool.  I was cleaning out my garage over the weekend,  and I ran across a little case that I had  from my Blackberry Pearl, and I was just like, wow.  It's like a little tiny, it's like a box of chiclets.  So tiny.  How far we've come, how large our phones have become.  And we've, like you say, it's like going to first class  when you have to go back to coach.  It sucks.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing I don't like about it,  the only complaint is it's just a little bit too big  for the shirt pocket.  Right?  And a little bit too big for the front jeans pocket.  That's what cargo pants were invented for.  What?  Cargo pants?  Oh.  That's what cargo pants were invented for.  You can pull them off better than I can, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff likes to wear skinny jeans, so it's a real problem.  So.  All right, well my toy of the week is something called Hooks.  This is an app from a startup in Spain.  It's been available for iOS for some time.  And just this week it became available for Android.  This is a fantastic app, especially if you have a smartwatch  because what this is, the way I like to think about this  is that it's like IFTTT, if this then that,  which is a simple, easy to use macro tool  that lets you connect different things together.  You can basically have, you know,  if something happens over here in this app,  you send a text message, it will turn your lights on.  That's what IFTTT does.  What Hooks does is very similar  in terms of how easy it is to use,  but the end result is always a notification.  So there are 100 or so channels.  There are a million or more user-created alerts  that you can just select, but it lets you do things like,  you can be alerted when a TV show airs.  So you can go in there and say, here's the TV show,  and I wanna know one hour before it airs,  or one hour after, or two minutes before it airs,  give me an alert.  Weather events, let me know when it's gonna rain tomorrow.  Sports scores, whenever the Mets have a game,  just as soon as you know the score, shoot me the score.  Articles published by Keywords,  whenever Jeff Jarvis publishes anything,  I want it to be a notified immediately.  Movie releases, restaurants, when they reach certain rankings.  So for example, if you live in Boston, you can say,  okay, whenever a restaurant enters into the top 10 in Yelp,  send me a notification so I can go check it out.  Tweets by Keyword, when videos are posted  on a specific YouTube channel, for example,  I have a Google channel set up  so that whenever the Google YouTube channel has a new video,  I get a notification immediately, I check it out,  I'll post it, whatever, and I can be the first to post it  because I'm getting notified.  Software vulnerabilities, RSS content, lottery results,  product hunt, Keywords, new movies on Netflix, you name it,  there's so many things you can do with this.  If you like notifications, if you're like me  and feel like you don't get enough of them,  then you're gonna love Hooks.  Again, that is a free app for Android,  and you've gotta check it out.  And here's one of the great things about the fact  that usually it's a bummer when you're on one platform  and something ships first for the other.  In this case, it's actually a big benefit  because all of those sort of user-created alerts  that were created by iOS users are available  to Android users.  So on day one, this thing had a million things  to choose from, or you can, of course, roll your own.  So you gotta check out Hooks.  That is my toy of the week.  You guys wanna talk about anything else?  Is there anything on or not on the rundown  that you guys wanna discuss before we shut this thing down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't do the other topic in two minutes, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't, eh.  All right.  All right, well.  It's gonna take way too long.  All right.  We'll do our own show.  That's right.  It's about Facebook and the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Jeff Jarvis is a professional professor.  I did that last week, too.  I said professional.  It says professor right there, and I said professional.  He is a professional.
