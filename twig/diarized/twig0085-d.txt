Hover is domain name registration and management that's simple.  For 10% off your new domain, go to twig.hover.com.  It's time for Twig, This Week in Google and the Cloud.  We cover Facebook and Twitter as well as Google.  We just call it Twig because then people know what they're going to get.  And Google is such a good brand name.  And if we did this Week in Facebook, it would be Twif.  And nobody wants to say that.  Joining us right now from San Diego, California, and her home, Gina Trapani, or her office.  I'm not sure which.  Hi Gina.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You heard from her bicycle lab?  From my bicycle lab, exactly.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Going great.  Somebody just told me Glee's been back for three weeks and I didn't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  There's a new episode last night, but the week before that there wasn't one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but I think I didn't know that they would restart it.  So I think I have at least a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you've got a Guinness episode to watch.  That's very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Week in Glee.  I'm sorry.  Did I say it was This Week in Google?  It's This Week in Glee.  Of course.  Of course.  Jeff Jarvis is also here.  Man, he's sharp looking today.  Look at that.  You look like an undertaker.  Do I scare you?  An undertaker.  You're going to interview the fashion forward, Vanessa Meyer, in about an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have my Prada tie on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I'm not New York for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Barney's warehouse sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Tim Armstrong together on the same stage?  Yep.  Wow.  Tim Armstrong, the new CEO of AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We get to talk about great things like the AOL way and Ariana's way and the quality and  content and fun stuff.  Can people watch this event?  Yes, they can.  I gave you the URL.  Now I've got to figure out where the heck it is.  I have it here somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the inauguration of your new Tao, what's it called?  Tao Night Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tao Night Media.  So if you go to dubs.journalism.cuny.edu slash live.  Again, journalism.cuny.edu slash live.  Good.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can watch.  This is the inauguration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Star 8 at 7ET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the inauguration of the Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An oxymoron, damn it.  What is it?  It's journalists making their own jobs and making journalism sustainable and figuring  out what the real is.  Like Twitter.  Yeah, exactly.  Like what you do, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, that reminds me, Leo, I've got to have you talk to the class.  I'd love to.  In your copious free time, we'll get you it on site.  So you do a class on entrepreneurial journalism.  We now have a whole certificate program where we have students here that are full time for  a semester just on this topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you there are a number of working journalists who want to go to this and take this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we have now.  We have returning professionals, read unemployed.  Yeah.  And so we have 11 students from all over, Sri Lanka, Denmark, Rwanda, and Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when I talked a couple of years ago to the Online News Association how interested,  you know, currently working, sometimes really big name currently working journalists were  in this subject because A, people feel like newspapers are failing and B, because they  want to control their own stuff.  That's what started me.  It wasn't a lack of work.  You were the great white hope, Leo.  I wanted to control it.  Yeah.  And especially in RB because frankly, we're so geeky and nerdy that no mainstream media  enterprise wants anything to do with the kind of content that we do here.  Speaking of which, let's talk about HTML5 also joining us.  Seth Ladd, he is a developer advocate at Google.  And Gina, why don't you introduce Seth since you were the one who discovered him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get discovery, the discovery fee.  Seth did a great tech talk at an event here in San Diego called Refresh about Chrome and  HTML5.  And it was a great presentation.  And like I said, I ambushed him right afterwards and recruited him to be on Twig so that we  could ask him questions about Chrome.  And actually, this is perfect timing because Chrome 10 dropped today.  So I thought maybe Seth could tell us a little bit about, you know, I use Chrome.  I love it.  And one of the things I love about it is that it just sort of updates without me having to do much.  Like it just tells me like, hey, you should you haven't restarted in a while.  Like if you do, you'll get an update.  And I love that.  I don't even think about it, which I love, which I love.  But maybe Seth, you can tell us a little bit about the Chrome 10 release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  So the auto updating feature, I mean, it's a browser for the Web and the Web doesn't have,  you know, long standing releases.  Anytime you just save a new page to the Web, it's automatically available to everyone.  We wanted to take that model of essentially instantaneous distribution all the way down  even to Chrome.  So, you know, we're going to try to keep pushing this as fast and fast as we can get and just essentially  eliminate the version numbers and we can do that.  That's just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Version numbers are not a human thing any more than URLs are a human thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  Especially with Chrome, right?  Because we update all the time.  It's beginning to lose meaning.  And we just really like that because it just gets the latest and greatest end users, like you say,  without even thinking about it, you just restart and it's just magically there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had to go into Chrome's about box to see if I had the latest version and I did and I hadn't done  anything to get it.  I just said, oh, look, you know, Chrome 10 got released.  And it seems like every Chrome release is much faster, seems to be one of the marquee features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, definitely with Chrome, our mantra is speed, stability and security.  And so especially with Chrome 10, we're pushing out Crankshaft, which is our next iteration with the  V8 JavaScript engine.  So see some really significant speed improvements.  So, yeah, we hope to continue that trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome is based on WebKit.  How much of this is WebKit getting updated?  How much of it is separate?  Is Chrome work?  How much from Google goes back into WebKit, which is an open source project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we're all committers here to WebKit.  We play nicely there and we definitely push there.  We work out of the WebKit tree very often.  And so, yeah, we want to keep that very up to date with what we're doing.  Certainly some aspects are not WebKit like the V8 engine, but a lot of the HTML5 functionality, all that just flows right into WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Crankshaft is a Google specific feature.  It's not going to be returned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Currently that's tied to the V8 JavaScript engine.  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have a great site, by the way, for HTML and HTML5 advocacy site called HTML5 Rocks.  This is a Google sponsored site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're actually trying to get that out and not be really browser or Google centric at all.  We post articles from outside resources, people that have done good work for us and just for the Web.  And we'll also we disclose which features work across different browsers.  And so our main intention there is just to make sure that great HTML5 resources are out there for everyone.  Because that's really that's Chrome's technology toolkit, right?  Every platform has an API and Chrome's platform API at this very foundation at its core is HTML5.  And that, of course, is a fabric of the Web.  And so even the resources we put out there is all just about pushing the Web forward across all different browsers, of course, including Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got to ask you about video.  Yes.  The bracket video bracket tag.  And this is all about HTML5.  The decision Google made to not support H.264, but to support WebM, which Google bought and is open sourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. Yes, it's open source now.  And really, the way I like to look at that decision is to the normal web developer that is the everyday web developer.  This actually changes nothing to get coverage with your video codecs.  You're going to still need to encode H.264 and WebM.  So really, I mean, the impact to the web developer is minimum to none.  And really, a lot of people use white labeled video hosting services or branded ones like Vimeo or YouTube anyway.  And they take care of the encodings, the social experiences, sharing, embedding and all that.  So really, in the end of the day, this really doesn't change anything for a web developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just changes kind of what is official under the video tag in HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly, we hope that the community eventually adopts an open source, high quality video codec.  And we believe WebM to be that option.  And so certainly, we want to keep promoting that as the go-to option for video on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the option that Chrome supports even if you don't put any plugins in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. WebM comes built right in with Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although Flash comes with Chrome right now.  Absolutely.  Are we going to see that stop? Is that going to end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. We're really pragmatic about that.  I mean, we're bullish about HTML5.  We definitely think this is the future of the web for numerous reasons.  But in the end of the day, I mean, you have to look at what's on the web today.  And a lot of that is great Flash content.  And so it behooves us to ensure our users have a great experience.  And so we build that Flash plugin right into Chrome so we can also auto-update Flash for you,  which is huge as well because just like any other software,  you want to make sure it's up to date with the latest.  And so it's just one last thing users have to worry about for just a great kind of smooth web experience.  And of course, that includes Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also sandbox it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of Chrome 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that is a very exciting feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adobe, of course, announced its Flash to HTML5 converter.  Does that exist out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is out there today.  I believe my team's taking a look at it now.  I think it comes with a lot of caveats, but we definitely think this is really exciting for web developers.  Something that Adobe does very well, of course, is tooling support.  And so we hope they continue to support HTML5 and the web going forward.  And so this is a great first step.  They do not. It's very specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do not support video.  So they avoid that whole H.264 WebM Flash Nexus.  They just say, no, this isn't going to do video.  But it is a lot of SVG support.  SVG is HTML5's way of doing kind of animation.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.  So that's a way to actually embed graphics like circles, rectangles, curves directly into your HTML page,  right alongside your head tags and title tags and all that.  It's interesting to compare that against another technology a lot of developers are familiar with,  which is Canvas, which is your 2D bitmap drawing surface.  So developers really have two options.  They can work with high level kind of blocks and circles right in their HTML page,  or they can just draw bits to a surface.  And a lot of animation work is actually happening there as well in Canvas.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you look at Chrome and the Chrome Web Store and all the capabilities that you get with HTML5,  animation and graphics and offline use,  Chrome really becomes a viable platform for releasing a desktop application.  I built a command line task manager and an Android app, and we're having this as open source.  We're having this discussion on the mailing list, like, hey, we want a desktop GUI for this.  So what are some ways that we can build that?  So the first one that came up was Adobe Air, right?  Because you want to write it once and have it run anywhere.  So I was like, OK, Adobe Air, we can write that one way and it'll run on every platform.  And then immediately somebody said, why not a Chrome app?  And this is an app I don't want to do any hosting.  I want this to be like all the data stored in Dropbox,  and I just want this to be offline in the browser and then communicate with Dropbox  and have it all done in HTML5.  And that is possible at this point, right?  Like, given the Chrome Web Store, you can package a web app into a totally a desktop.  You know, it's files that get saved on your desktop and which can do offline storage  and maybe do some API calls to cloud sources, but not necessarily be a real website, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. So for those who don't know, Chrome Web Store is an open marketplace for great web apps and games.  And it's a consumer facing web store built right into Chrome.  So you can find, you know, utility, productivity, entertainment, news, and of course games.  There's two ways to build apps for the Chrome Web Store.  One is your traditional hosted web app, which is like you're saying, you put it on a web server.  It has a URL. Anyone can get to it.  That's the very traditional one we're all familiar with.  And then there's a second option, which is your you're talking about, which is what we call a packaged app.  A packaged app is a self-contained HTML5 app that you can just fully upload to the Chrome Web Store.  And when someone installs it, they download that entire package.  They run it locally. And you're right, no web servers involved.  So in that model, it's a lot closer to a traditional software model, which is, you know, you send down all the bits and you just run it locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there is a limit to the size of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I think that's that's a leftover from the extension days.  So right now, the size limit is 10 megs.  But we heard a lot of strong feedback from our partners saying, you know, we need more.  And so we're definitely looking at addressing that very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting. I just installed on camera Super Mario Brothers thinking that might be a package.  It's not. It's a Web page.  And I know because I'm getting an ad for a pregnancy test right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know, it's interesting when you install stuff from the Chrome Web Store.  When I first looked at it sort of as a tech reviewer, I thought this doesn't look too different than just sort of like glorified bookmarks.  But actually, it's much different when you think about offline apps.  It is full. It is a full on app store.  This is a flash. Yeah.  Yeah. Interesting.  I have to ask you the question that I'm sure that everyone asks you, which is about Android and Chrome and how these these two products are becoming platforms for app distribution and whether or not they compete with one another and how the teams interact at Google and how there are both.  And is Chrome ever going to run fully on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly. So I think the best way to look at that right now is that Chrome is a great experience for your desktop laptops and netbooks.  Things with keyboards and Android is a great experience for smaller form factor devices without keyboards.  And right right now, that's I think how the teams are looking at it.  Things happen very organically.  But for now, that's definitely, you know, we're building an ecosystem for the web and platforms with keyboards.  They're building an ecosystem for mobile.  And of course, they have a browser on there as well.  And so a lot of this HTML5 capability works on Android as well.  And that's oftentimes how we talk about it to our partners.  We say, you know, build with HTML5.  That's how you get across all these form factors.  Tablets, TVs, even, of course, desktops, laptops, netbooks, phones.  Across the board, HTML5 is probably the most ubiquitous technology toolkit out there.  Hopefully that helps.  And it lets you play Centipede.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really amazing Centipede.  I don't know if it's Flash or if it's in the web store.  But that's pretty impressive.  Now, is the heart of the Android browser the same?  I mean, is the JavaScript rendering engine the same and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so absolutely. Great point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just UI you were talking about that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the Android browser is WebKit based.  And we brought over a version of V8 as well.  And so they do have a common ancestry, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So we'll get advances in Chrome.  We'll kind of migrate to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, via the WebKit route. Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting. On Google TV, the browser is called Chrome.  But on every other Android build I've seen, it's just browser.  So I wondered about whether or not there's a full kind of Chrome build on its way to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's because the Google TV guys use Chrome.  They have version 5 on there now, and they'll be updating that later.  The Android guys just use a WebKit version of their browser.  So it's a different browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing I can't wait for is offline reading of Gmail and such to bring back the things that we lost.  When is that going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you and me both are waiting for that.  So that message is loud and clear.  But to Gina's point as well, I think we had a lot of offline functionality with the product we maintained and launched a couple years ago,  which was called Google Gears, which was a plug-in to browsers that brought a lot of this forward-thinking technology.  And even some of that has rolled up now into HTML5.  We've now deprecated Google Gears, and we will support HTML5 going forward.  And so you'll see better functionality, taking advantage of more of the platform going forward via HTML5.  And that, of course, includes offline.  Speaking of offline, there's just actually a wide array of options giving developers really great choice.  Something called local storage, something called indexedDB.  And then, of course, we have a sandboxed virtualized file system in HTML5 as well.  So developers can now start building, for instance, games or photo editing apps where you can store large objects actually into a virtualized sandbox file system via the browser.  So bringing these kind of strong offline capabilities is a big part of HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really cool.  That makes me really want to build a GUI for my app in Chrome versus anywhere else.  It becomes the kind of right ones run anywhere, online, offline, dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're working hard to make that reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet I get scared when you say build it in Chrome instead of anywhere else,  because isn't the web really supposed to be about completely cross-platform capabilities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's interesting.  So you can go either way. You can go with the hosted version where you're communicating with a web server and any browser can do that.  But it's that offline that Chrome offers that's really...  But is that going to be unique to Chrome or is that HTML5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Firefox will also have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great point. Yeah, that comes with Firefox 4 and more modern browsers will bring along these technologies as well.  So I think you build for the best experience for your users, absolutely.  And right now, that's the modern browsers.  Chrome just seems to be leading that because we have this very frequent automatic update.  But as other browsers like Firefox 4 come online, you just broaden and broaden your reach and yet get to deliver a great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  HTML5 rocks your website.  It seems to be aimed at developers particularly as opposed to end users.  You start by getting developers to write for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely. Definitely.  We have some really great demo sites out there that appeal more to the eye candy end users.  But right now, most of our efforts and outreach is absolutely centered around developers, web engineers, web programmers to get them excited and realize this is a viable option today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great. I click the playground and I get an IDE, a full IDE with debugger.  I mean, I'm sure that's intentional. The developer goes, whoa, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty sweet.  When you think about the cloud, right, and what Gina's talking about, putting everything in a Dropbox just running in the client.  This is a big deal for us. So you might have heard Cloud9 IDE is an option today that just came out of, I think, beta as a full IDE running in the cloud.  And this cloud thinking becomes more and more important as you have cloud connected networks like Chrome OS, which only runs Chrome.  So of course you need everything, even your development environment in the cloud.  So these things are coming true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having my IDE, having my development environment in the cloud was the one thing that kept me from using this.  I have a CR 48 and it's something that I wasn't able to use day to day because I code day to day.  So that's really cool. I hadn't heard of Cloud9 IDE.com.  This just got released, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also available in the Web Store and you can find it via searching.  So other people, I'm sure, will come out with Cloud IDE. It's the logical next step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt. And it integrates with GitHub, which is exciting.  Yeah. So speaking of CR 48, does your team also work with Chrome OS?  Are those separate teams at Google? And how do updates roll out to Chrome OS?  Those are two, those are different releases, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chrome OS is a separate product, but the best way to think about it is it's Chrome with a paper thin Linux bootstrap layer.  And so, yes, it's a separate product because it's built to run directly on netbooks.  But the advice we give to our partners and developers is just build for Chrome and you'll be successful on desktop, laptop and now netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And presumably compatible with other modern browsers as they come out. You're not doing Chrome specific extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry. Absolutely. Yeah. When I say build for Chrome, I mean that's how you hit Chrome OS or that's the way you think about Chrome OS.  You build for Chrome. Got it.  Yeah, which is right. Modern HTML5 app. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Which is exciting because it means the universe for the CR 48 and Chrome OS.  Now, the guy running Chrome OS has departed for Facebook, has he not? Isn't that where he went?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think I read something. Unfortunately, I can't comment on that. I just don't know the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. So, but as far as you're concerned, Chrome OS is alive and kicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a part of the Chrome ecosystem that we're building. Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bookmarked a couple of sites during your talk. One was the HTML5 rocks.com. Another is HTML5 boilerplate.com, which looks like a pretty good template to use.  And another one is can I use.com, which gives you kind of a rundown of what browsers support what HTML5 capabilities.  So as you're developing, like Seth said, you develop for you know, you develop HTML5 capabilities, but then you can gracefully degrade for browsers that maybe haven't haven't caught up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm really glad you brought that up. I mean, HTML5 boilerplate is a really fantastic resource because it not only says you we can get you up on HTML5 today.  It actually brings over a lot of the best practices that web developers has begin to discover for many years.  Things like the best way to cash resources or not to cash the best way to compress or not to compress.  And all of these things have been kind of like old wives tales or just like dark secrets of the magic.  And they're they're pulling it all in together until just a few different configuration files, which you can just use to bootstrap your project.  So that that's one thing I'm really happy to see. But I'm really glad you mentioned to hear you say gracefully degrade because I think that's that's the right way to approach HTML5 development.  You really want to start to deliver the best possible experience.  And the way to do that, of course, is to implement and utilize all these great HTML5 features like Canvas and CSS3, 3D transforms, the file system APIs, sorry, the history management API, et cetera, et cetera.  And these are going to give you essentially a native app feel. But of course you want reach, right?  That's why you go to the web. So you build for the best experience that which generates revenue and excitement and eyeballs.  But then because it's all of these specs are written, understanding that it's a global worldwide open spec, you can gracefully degrade and provide a subset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Using IE6 as I'm showing here.  Comparison between IE6 in pink and Chrome 10 in green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, IE6. Even Microsoft now is saying.  We talked about that site that says stop using IE6 from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That must crack you up. It's actually kind of exciting, Seth.  It seems like there's some real momentum building behind HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And finally, as my son Jake says, it's the kind of the Prince spaghetti sauce.  Oh, it's in there. That'll solve it. HTML5 would do that with every problem that came up.  You know, we got to we got to get on with it and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you can look at some of the game industry there.  I think it's pushing hard on HTML5.  I mean, Disney's recent acquisition of the game engine, I believe it's Rocket Pack or Rocket Engine there.  You know, Zynga is exploring HTML5.  Facebook, of course, is investing in HTML5.  Obviously, Google, Apple and Microsoft all agree that it's the future.  So, you know, things so we've all been green.  It's the future. But this year, things are happening.  And so you're right. This is very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seth, thank you so much for being here. We really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I appreciate any time. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess the best place to find out more about this is HTML5 rocks dot com.  But you stop by. Thank you so much. Thanks.  Seth Ladd from from the Google from the mothership.  He is developer advocate at Google. Take care. Thanks.  That's neat. Thank you, Gina, for for getting that for us.  Sure. Great. I like to go for that.  Yeah. Yeah. I just it does feel encouraging that there is some momentum and things are actually happening.  And it's boy, I stopped using any other browser.  But Chrome quite a while ago, it's just so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. You know, and I love Firefox.  And but, you know, when when there's a new Firefox release, it was like a big deal.  You download it. Your extensions wouldn't, you know, wouldn't be compatible with Chrome.  It just happens in the background. You just don't think about it as much.  You know, it's got it's just got so many great features.  So they've learned. I think that's an important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just going forward is more and more. I had lunch today with the CTO at Adobe, Kevin Lynch.  And he was talking about Adobe moving over more and more and more to cloud stuff.  You get to that point where applications can become more fluid.  This whole idea of another version does become silly. Right.  It's just we're always improving it. And here's an improvement. And there it is.  And that's that. And you should be able to expect that that's going to be the case.  It's process rather than product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of typical in computers. I remember Tim Berners-Lee telling me,  I never thought anybody would look at URLs. We didn't ever intend for URLs to be exposed.  Those are not HTTP colon slash slash is not designed for humans.  Clearly. Yeah, obviously.  And now I think, you know, I can't remember which browser it is,  but one of the browsers is getting rid of that bar entirely.  I don't know if that's Chrome or Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the funny thing there is I keep on wishing that that whole HTTP colon slash slash WWW was reduced to,  you know, one colon something that that that would then we wouldn't need shorter URLs and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't need to tell the proto. You don't need to tell the well, that's the problem with Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is it doesn't know it's a URL because it doesn't have a shorter way to say this is a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just stupid Twitter. To be honest, right, Gina.  I mean, a little grip magic and you could tell if it's a URL or not.  You look for a TLD preceded by a dot. You look for slashes.  You can and maybe even you could even check to see if there's a website there and see if it has malware.  Not so hard to do. OK, so we get Twitter to fix, not the whole internet.  But I do. You don't have to fix the Internet, just fix Twitter.  But that but that's exactly what happens.  And that's I'm sure why URLs got exposed in the first place is mosaic and then Netscape did.  And it didn't matter what Tim Berners-Lee thought.  It mattered what people did. And that became how it was done. Unfortunately.  Hey, let's take a break. We got there's a lot of news, including Android malware.  Gina, any gingerbread love for your Nexus one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I've got it. I've got it. You got it.  I like it. You got it. You got it. You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a ROM. You didn't you didn't get the up because I'm still looking at my Nexus S for an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen a thing. Wait, the S. Oh, you're waiting for the OTA for the Nexus S.  That's crazy. You still haven't gotten it. OK, that's weird.  In fact, I have other friends of the Nexus one who did get it. They got the OTA on the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you needed it more than you needed more than the X did.  I mean, the one the one. Let me just check.  Just because I you know, it really wouldn't be a day without checking system updates and saying your system is currently up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Android needs to learn a little from girl update faster.  Just updated. I don't want to know. Just update. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We got more coming up. Also, some issues with with I mentioned Android, the Google Apps Marketplace, celebrating a birthday.  And YouTube with a kind of an interesting acquisition that finally came through.  Before we do that, though, I want to talk a little bit about hover dot com.  Hover is domain name registration done properly.  It's clean. It's simple. It's easy. If you use the other guys, you know, you know, you can't you can't buy a domain with one click of the mouse.  Fifty clicks later and you're still saying, no, I didn't want that. No, I don't want that. No, thank you.  I just want to buy a friggin domain. Go to twig dot H O V E R dot com and take a look at hover.  This couldn't be simpler, cleaner or easier to use as domain name registration made simple.  You go there, you tell them the domain you want. A couple of clicks of the mouse later, you've got the domain.  And here's the beauty of it. They don't have to do the upsell and privacy because they just build it in automatic.  Who is privacy and more? And if you are moving a domain over, if you're transferring, what a great deal.  It costs ten dollars to transfer, but you get an additional year on your domain name.  So they extend the domain name for a year and and you get the transfer.  So I think that's pretty exceptional. Use hover domain management to set up an email address, forward email, redirect domains to other websites, create URL extensions, set privacy controls,  all with fewer clicks and without them trying to sell you something you don't want or you don't need.  And if you're transferring a bunch of sites, they've got a great one fee, twenty five dollar fee for transferring all your sites from one to a thousand right over to hover dot com.  Do us a favor and give it a try and please use the twig offer code when you do so we get credit for it.  Those other guys at twit, they don't need the money. Twig. I'm competing against myself.  Twig.hover.com. Twig.hover.com. Please, please do it for Jeff and Gina.  Use the offer code twig. Well, it just it has come to my attention that some of you not remembering the offer codes just use twit because it all goes the same place.  Right. Bad fans. Bad fan.  It doesn't cost us anything because, you know, we don't we don't like we don't do cost per click or anything like that.  But it it does mean that people that are advertisers don't know where they're getting the references referrals from and we want to make sure that they know people listen to this fine show and support it.  So twig.hover.com.  Now we got to 12 minutes till Marissa Meyer shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. I'm OK. I'm OK.  We go to like five fifteen or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to be the guy who made you late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just didn't. Leo, I know you now.  Yes, you've learned to say this.  You would start at six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  I know you and I love you, Leo.  But yeah, we do that thing where you set the alarm 15 minutes early to try to trick yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that doesn't work because I know I'm tricking myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You you run on a California clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Gina, I don't know what your problem is.  I'm timing.  It's New York. New York time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on. I got I made them.  I'm always late.  So in New York, I was always late in California.  I'm kind of sort of make it on time because three hours later showed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a doctor's appointment at 830 showed up at 842.  They said, yeah, that's fine.  We expect that it's California.  Hey, I don't be late for our event at South by Southwest.  We're going to be down there this weekend.  Everybody, this is I look forward to this.  I won't. This is my second time.  I never went before. I know Gina, you've been since almost the beginning.  And everybody always said, you got to go to South by.  And now I understand why.  It's just a freaking party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. I'm really looking forward to it.  I don't know what I was thinking, considering not going.  I'm really excited about this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when you get there, make sure you get our get glue sticker.  I think if you watch a Twitch show and you use get glue now, you'll get our limited edition.  Tweet South by Southwest sticker from get glue and then come to Momo Sunday.  This Sunday, we're going to be there from one till we start with one with the Tech Guy show.  And we will continue with twit five o'clock.  You guys will be there five to seven p.m.  We were doing a little meetup afterwards and we have one thousand of these special edition twit stickers.  I think we're going to do these from now on for every event.  So it says twit at Essex SW 2011 and the zero is the state of Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I need that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My thinking and we will have regular twit stickers too, but I'm thinking don't you want to like collect sets of stickers from different events?  So I thought that'd be kind of fun.  You can find out more by going to our blog inside dot twit dot TV.  That's where the schedule will be.  And we also have a plan cast account.  Plan cast dot com slash P slash three X two S.  I might as well just say Http colon slash slash for that one.  Holy cow.  Slash P slash three X two S.  Is that like twit?  I don't even know what that one is.  I guess we created a twit plan cast account.  So Chrome 10, we already mentioned that.  That's out.  Everybody likes it.  No negatives, right?  No complaints.  Working for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Faster sandboxed.  I love the sandboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's key.  That's critical.  I mean, that's really critical.  Instant mobile previews are now available on Android and iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, these are really cool.  So there's a little magnifying glass next to search results on Google dot com on your phone and you tap on it and you can just sort of swipe through screenshots of the site, which is neat.  I'm not sure.  I generally know what I'm looking for, but in the case where you're not sure, really neat little feature.  So it's a little magnifying glass in the bottom right of the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't really think of these things as being not only needed, but even working on a phone.  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, for phones that have mobile versions that are crappy or for sites that take a long time to load, an instant preview via Google, which is fast, is a nice way to just check to see does this look like what I'm looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I guess, yeah, you're right.  And they cash those locally, not locally on the go.  Right.  So you know, there's no load time or anything.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've only tried it on Wi Fi.  So I'm not sure how it does on on 3G, but it was pretty fast when I did try it.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iOS 4.3 came out today, too, by the way, if you're an iPhone user.  Jeffrey, you've gone Android, right?  No, I both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going to have my galaxy to happen?  I have my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you are going to get a iPad to write.  I don't know.  Friday night.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  What my wife looked at me and basically, what are you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, come on, Jeff.  All right.  Let's see.  I think I think I have it fired up here.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Look, there's a little magnifying glass.  So that wasn't an update in the browser.  That's just built into Google.  And I click it.  And then look at this.  These are the little thumbnails in a page.  Oh, that is sweet.  It's nice, right?  That is nice.  That is sweet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So look, there is a little load time there.  Yeah.  But for the most part, it's nice to see like, oh, is this the site I was looking for?  And these are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so if you go back, you just go back to your search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  That's a good question.  There's no back button on the iPhone.  There it is.  There it is.  Yeah, this is an iPhone.  We don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish you had that kind of UI within, let's say, Twitter where you could see a photo more  easily or.  So this is what it's doing is pulling thumbnails up from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it cached them, by the way, thumbnails up from the whole page.  So this is like a different kind of search page with the thumbnails.  And it does show the search results below it.  So that's kind of I think that's kind of a swell feature.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Wow.  I didn't even I didn't even know that I have to listen to the show more often.  One of these days, I'm going to listen to this show and I'll learn a thing or two.  21 malware apps on the Android marketplace yanked them, but did something that we didn't  know.  Well, I think they did it once before.  Still it's kind of always a little bit of a shock when they do this.  They use the kill switch.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  What's that?  And this is the kill switch.  The kill switches for they remotely uninstalled the apps from phones that they knew it was  installed on.  And they know what's installed on your phone when you do it through the market.  So these apps were attempting to root the phone and get personal information about the  phone, the IMEI number, which is unique to each handset and some other some other information.  As soon as Google knew about it, they said within minutes they use this remote application  removal feature, which basically just reached out, reaches down to your phone and uninstalls  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I had chess and super sex positions.  So screaming sexy Japanese girls falling dodgeball.  Then you know what?  They're covering the waterfront because they got also scientific calculator, advanced currency  converter and a game called Pew Pew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just the worst PR for Android ever.  I mean, it just it just makes everyone who's ever been annoyed with the iTunes stores policies  go, see, that's why they do it.  Malware.  You know, and it just it makes you just feel like you're back in in the heyday windows  when malware was this was this huge problem.  Viruses and trojans.  I just feel like I feel like because Google has the market, there should be another needs  to be better sort of reviewing, testing a detection of this kind of stuff before things  get published.  As a developer, I wouldn't mind having to run my app through a series of like an automated  test suite on the Android market side and get and get approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one of you had that idea before where you have a higher level marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to eliminate open, but you just say if maybe you could charge for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would be like, or maybe that's the value that Amazon should add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why doesn't Amazon or Secunia or somebody say, hey, here's the secure marketplace?  I know why, because you cannot and no matter what Apple tells anybody, you cannot do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't always.  You can't always detect the exploits, right?  You can sometimes.  I mean, the Amazon app store for Android does have a review process.  I submitted my app and it took them a couple of weeks to approve it.  Really?  It hasn't launched yet.  Another interesting model is Mozilla.  So I developed Firefox extensions.  And when you upload your extension to the Mozilla add on site, it just goes through  all the code, which is just XML and JavaScript and checks for external URLs and then must  have some sort of database which flags certain URLs, which are good or bad or malware.  So it had these little checks and it'll say, we found this URL.  We're not sure about it.  Like, it'll give you the green thumbs up and the red stop.  The Android market could do something like, you know, passes the extra super clean malware  check certification stamp, you know what I mean?  That maybe as a developer you pay for.  There are other ways to do it.  You don't have to sacrifice open, I think, to do these extra checks and have maybe, you  know, a higher level, you know, the elite class of apps that have been verified somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google might make a case that the system does work because they did find these 21.  They did use the kill switch.  So, I mean, how long were they in the market before they were discovered?  Not that long, a week, two weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the question.  I mean, the question really is how many installations were there and how much information got leaked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would hope that Google would let that information come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Question.  So if you go through Amazon, Amazon is not going to have a kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but Google still will.  So presumably Amazon could then say to Google, please kill these.  Google, by the way, I was told by our chat room somebody got killed and Google sends  out an email.  You get an email saying we deleted an app from your phone because it was malicious.  I can't imagine anybody getting upset about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, believe me, we'll hear somebody say, well, Google could be evil with that.  They could misuse it and all that.  But if Google did, then they're hurting their own business for God's sakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And every phone has this.  I mean, iOS has a kill switch.  We know it.  I'm glad they have it.  They need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you don't want is that you don't want them to use it evilly.  And that's really the issue.  Right.  But if they kill a book or something, that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in the Google mobile blog, they say Tuesday that we were made aware of this within minutes  becoming aware we remove the applications.  They did take advantage of a flaw in the current 2.2.2 or higher versions of Android, which  is a little doesn't say they've got the they've got the update.  It doesn't say how long they were out there.  But at war, who told them?  Does that mean that there are some security people watching?  It wouldn't be such a hard thing to look at what kind of stuff your phone is doing on  online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wish that they caught this stuff before it went down to people's phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's what we want.  Android is number one in the US smartphone market share now outpacing a rim.  So they beat iOS a little while ago.  Now they've beat rim.  There's nobody else.  They are number one, according to Nielsen.  Android has 29 percent market share.  Oh, are these your numbers?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  20s.  I have you trained well, Leo.  I'm glad for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In anything numeric, we worry about Jeff has a trademark at all numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to put a charge on your chair on your ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple and rim are tied with 27.  Now that is consumer market share.  Nielsen also notes that when you look at it from a different angle, manufacturer market  share because of course, Apple makes one phone.  Blackberry makes a number of phones.  Google doesn't make any phones, but there are a lot of people making phones using the  Google OS.  When it comes to handset manufacturers, Apple and rim are clearly ahead.  The next biggest manufacturer, Apple and rim have 27 percent.  Next biggest manufacturer is HTC.  12 percent Android, 7 percent Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7.  12 percent if you talk about the biggest manufacturer, which is HTC.  Still, that was the same argument people made about PC market share versus Mac market share,  but there's only one Apple.  Well still, they're all running Windows.  Apple has released an anti-fragmentation kit to respond to complaints that the Android  market is fragmented.  This is programmer Gina at the ready.  What is this?  It says it's a static library that allows access to the honeycomb fragments API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so when you develop an Android app, you set a version at which the app is, the  baseline version that it's compatible with.  My app is compatible 1.6 and above.  But what you don't want to do is make, you don't want that to mean that you don't have  access to only the features that are available to later versions.  So I have not tried out the static library, but it sounds like this library lets developers  take advantage of the stuff available on honeycomb, that fragments library that lets you create  panels that arrange themselves in different ways on a larger screen in their app without  sacrificing earlier compatibility with earlier versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always wondered why they didn't do that because it seems like it would be possible  to write an app that automatically kind of senses what, because unfortunately there's  a big variety in screen resolution in real estate, but it would sense that and kind of  rearrange itself elastically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that what Adobe Air does?  Yes, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's what a web browser does.  It lays out a page depending on the viewport size.  And so the new static library allows access to honeycomb fragments API, which lets developers  produce resolution independent apps on any device running Android one six or better.  So from diminutive pay go phones to 10.1 tablets.  So this is just a matter of way to lay out your app so that it shows up well and no matter  what the screen size is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Easy fix.  And in response to Steve Jobs last week saying there's only a hundred honeycomb apps.  And I thought that was a little, I mean, that's kind of not fair because yes, there's a hundred  for that size tablet, but there's hundreds of thousands of apps written for all Android.  And what is, I don't have you looked at?  Well, I remember when I had the galaxy tab, even apps that weren't written for a seven  inch screen for the most part looked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They look great.  They look wonderful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really hardly ever notice.  Yeah.  If you use layouts well in your app, it would just size up to the screen.  And that's just sort of the nature of the layout, the way that you do layouts and Android.  My app worked fine on honeycomb.  I mean, there's a lot of extra white space.  And I do rewrite it for honeycomb.  I'll take advantage of the fact that I could fit another panel, but it totally works.  I mean, you know, look, Steve has a point when the first iPad came out, one of my arguments  against buying it was none of the apps have been written for this large screen yet.  So, I mean, I think that that's a reasonable argument to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a little different in iOS because on iOS, what happens if you have an iPhone  app, it's tiny and you could double it.  It does, there is no resizing at all.  And so Google, I mean, Android handles it, I think, better and differently.  So there's a big difference between there aren't native iPad apps and there aren't  native tablet apps for Android.  That's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think you're right.  I think the fact that the way the Android layout views an Android just expands naturally  because handsets have different size screens to begin with, unlike the iPhone, that things  did expand to fill honeycomb well.  So Steve's argument is not as strong as maybe the initial argument with the iPad.  I do hope to see a lot of really good apps kind of expand to fill that honeycomb screen.  But things like Angry Birds are fantastic on honeycomb, right?  You're not going to change anything.  You're not going to add panels or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you get glitches with the graphics like jaggies, you know, artifacting or aliasing  or the fonts or do fonts scale nicely and graphics scale nicely?  Do you have those issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From what I saw on the emulator in the 10 or 20 minutes I spent with the app itself,  everything looks great.  It scales up.  So Android gives you, so when you create your graphics for Android, there's a low, medium  and high resolution.  You provide assets for high resolution and smaller resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they are bitmapped assets.  Although I imagine there's also vector graphics.  That's where SVG would be great.  And I imagine the fonts, do the fonts scale and to do text, do the fonts scale so that  it looks, they don't look jaggy, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They look great.  They're anti-aliased.  I think that that's a little misleading to say there's only a hundred apps.  There's hundreds of thousands of apps that work fine and look fine.  But there's only a hundred apps that are written specifically for that screen size.  But I don't expect you to see a lot of apps written for that screen size because then  that leaves out the rest of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn it back around.  That's the limitation of iOS is that Steve does make you rewrite them, you know, write  these complicated double things and on Android it just works.  Not to sound like a fanboy but...  Well I think it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love that.  I was critical of Steve's three big lies at the event.  And look, if he lies, he lies.  It doesn't mean I'm a Google fanboy.  When Google lies, I get upset too.  If somebody's lying to you and it is not our job to represent companies, we are here to  represent end users.  If a company's lying to you, you deserve to know that.  Oh, he's attacking my team.  I wish people would stop thinking of it as a team sport.  It's not teaming up.  Me too.  And if you're on a team, you're on the human team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the Apple team or the Google team.  You're on the consumer team.  You're not on the big company team.  You're on the consumer team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember which team you are on, friends.  We're on team Leo.  Well no, you're not on my team.  I don't want a team.  Team Twig?  Yeah, Twig is good.  Team Twig, I'll go for that.  New Google Maps navigation, the beta version will round traffic, something that GPS have  done for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But hey, it's free.  I didn't even know that.  I've never used GPS.  I've only used Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of GPSs will do this and I think that's a nice feature.  I've seen it on some of the GPS software on iOS as well.  Where do they get their traffic information?  Where does Google get that information?  That's what I'm wondering about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's basically a monopoly now.  Metro traffic and shadow traffic.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same people who do it for radio are doing it for computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually think that the navigation app does send statistics to Google if you let it about  your movement.  That's what it should do.  Yeah, I think it's gathering its own data as well, if I'm not mistaken, with your permission.  That's where it's always been best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your phone should be saying it.  It knows where you are, how fast you're moving.  It doesn't need anything else.  You're in a 65 miles an hour zone going through miles an hour.  Send that back.  That's the information we want and it's up to date.  You can date stamp it.  I had a little Dash GPS.  They went out of business but that was a really cool idea.  All the Dash users were sending information back to Dash and saying, so you had a very  up to date traffic information.  The problem is nobody bought it so there was four of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In 1995, I tried to convince Metro Traffic and Shadow to do a very manual version of  this where it would be a data for data marketplace that you'd call in and report.  For every time you called in to report a problem, you'd get a free report back when you needed  it.  Oh great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't do it.  That's because you're an entrepreneurial journalist.  I think Marissa should send you a glimpse.  That GLYMPSE app, I love that app on Android and iOS.  It sends you a…  You've never seen this?  No.  GL what now?  LPGT?  What?  I'll make it my tool.  Actually, I was going to do to do text because Gina, I've got it working so…  I've done it before so it's really not fair to do it again.  But I've got it working so sweetly.  You're right.  I don't use the text file in Geek Tool now.  I just use the shell command and it just works so…  I can't pull it up.  It works so…  I got my thing down.  But it works so nicely and I use Quicksilver to automatically with keystrokes send a new  to do stuff.  It's always on my desktop of all my computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are my target user Leo.  It's awesome.  Can't tell you how happy this makes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why we want to do a GUI.  That's why I want to make a Chrome web app.  Well, there's a great Android app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that makes the Android app you could do everything you would do in a normal to do  thing.  But because it makes a text file which you would then put in Dropbox, it's so great.  And you can always find apps that interact with text files.  So it's not like Quicksilver appending to the file makes it so easy to add to my to  do list and it's always on my desktop.  I just love that.  Awesome.  I don't know how I got it.  I just did an ad for you.

Transcript:  To do dot text touch.

Transcript:  To do dot text touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's a terrible name.  I'm not good at names.  It's clearly an engineer name.  You need help, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just so you know, just so you know I'm not making it up.  There it is right there.  Right on the front page of my Nexus S.  What do you have to do, Leo?  Lots of stuff.  Let's see here.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that.  You can tell you're using it like next actions.  I got prioritization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Amber, he's going to call you.  Yeah.  Amber's going to get a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's Doctor Mom who for my wife's birthday in September made her a necklace  which I still owe her 60 bucks for.  Sometimes just putting it on the to-do list doesn't mean it gets done.  Yes.  That's my problem.  No, but you know what?  That list was a lot longer yesterday so it doesn't work.  A couple of acquisitions from Google and we're going to get to your tips, tools and numbers.  Google bought a British price comparison site called beatthatquote.com.  Yes, it's time to play beatthatquote.com.  I never heard of them but they are British.  167 million, I'm sorry, 61 million dollars.  They're going to use that technology to provide new ways for consumers to find the right financial  products.  It's price quotes on money.  They also bought, and this was rumored for a long time, YouTube bought Next New Networks  content big YouTube content production company with something like 60 producers including  the Gregory brothers and Too Hot for Words or whatever that thing is called.  Interesting play for YouTube to become a content creator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the issue.  I talked to Fred Seibert who founded Next New Networks as a friend before this when  he had to wink at me a lot.  I said my concern is that if Google finds itself in the content business, it's in huge  channel conflict.  It just can't do that.  And the wink is, and the press release made this too, they're going to take the shows  that Next New Networks owns and put some kind of wall around them or do something with them.  That's not why they bought it.  They bought it for a platform to create better content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know how or is there some technology as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Technology but also I think more systems and structure to do that.  I'm not sure exactly what that is.  That's in YouTube's interest to have better content.  YouTube as you know a week ago, I think we talked about this last week, is paying hundreds  of producers six figures a year and thousands of producers five figures a year in compensation.  So people can start to make a living at this and the more of that there is, the more things  we watch instead of big old network TV, the better it is for YouTube and Google.  So that's what's in their interest but owning shows and competing with their own distribution  platform would bring up all kinds of problems with people saying that it's the discussions  we've had.  Is YouTube favoring its own stuff and things like that?  So I think that they can't, I hope the case is, I really hope the case is that they find  a way to slough off that original content and not own it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting they brought it for workflow.  That's what Dvorak always told me.  He said, work on your workflow.  That's what people buy.  They don't care about the content.  They want the workflow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my bad impression.  I have no idea what that means but yes John.  Yes John.  Yes John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't even anyway.  What did they get?  They got like 30 million, something like that, 50 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard something like 50.  I think there was 26 into it.  You know it was a problem of trying to find ad sales.  Ad sales are tough.  That's what they were doing.  Yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The newest Google website ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for official royal wedding 2011.org?  Are we sick of it yet?  It hasn't happened.  Are we sick of it yet?  This is Google.  They're using Google for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I actually felt grateful to Sheen for reducing the royal wedding media coverage for  a little bit there for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh you ain't seen nothing yet baby.  So it's Google App Engine that they're using for the, I mean I guess they wanted bandwidth  galore I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that's true.  Not Squarespace, not WordPress, not Type Pad.  I'm sure they all would love to have had that big old website.  Hey Charlie Sheen couldn't kill Ustream.  That's pretty good for them.  Ustream.tv 200,000 views.  Did you see Charlie's last broadcast last night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know he's sick.  The man is sick and it's getting worse and worse.  We're watching him destroy himself in public.  It's not nice to watch that.  But Jake, an update from Jake, he just said that Sheen said he needs help.  Oh good.  Where did he say that Jake?  Some tabloid.  Yeah well true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not just a social media intern to help him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he needs help doing his Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see how many applications he got?  He got like 42,000 applications for the social media.  If he's going to put 18 porn stars up in the house I might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  70,000 applications for the social media.  I want to be in the Charlie Sheen new media consultant house.  Is it next to the porn star house?  Warner Brothers starts running movies on Facebook.  Big deal.  Wow.  It's the dark night.  You have to actually go to the dark night page on Facebook to rent the movie.  It's a very interesting nexus.  And it's not in here but Facebook is now doing comments as well.  I'm very tempted to use their comment engine.  I saw the TechCrunches.  Thrilled with it.  I guess we talked about that last week.  Yeah we did.  I can never remember what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was controversy there.  I wrote a piece on my blog.  I took a snippet out of the book about the argument about anonymity and how we ought  to have more than one identity.  And I side with Zuckerberg that we have one identity.  Facebook.  That's the Facebook web.  You side with Zuckerberg?  Not necessarily Facebook but we have our own.  I like the new Google profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how I get it or don't get it but I like it.  We talked about the new Google profile search and now we realize where that came from.  It came from the new Google profiles.  I haven't done it yet.  I have an update in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Profiles.Google.com.  I don't know.  Sometimes I get the old one.  Sometimes I get the new one.  I don't know if my something with my cookies or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a real nice update.  More bits of information.  They took away the Flickr integration which bummed me out because that made me happy because  I used Flickr and I thought it was a nice use of another company's API.  But that said the layout is really nice.  More questions.  More links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you think it's a little bit Facebooky for instance here when you change your information  you could put location, birthday, relationship and gender under your picture.  Yes.  That's Facebooky isn't it?  It is very Facebooky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a long rant about those drop downs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Larry Page creates a page for his dog then we know that it's a war.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still on here although you can finally turn off the buzz tab.  Let's not show my personal information.  You can choose the pictures here finally.  At least a little bit more granularly than you could before.  You can manage those photos a little bit better.  I like it.  I think it's a nice looking profile.  That's kind of what made me think of this when you talked about Mark saying you should  have one place on the web.  I don't know if you should have only one but you should at least have something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was saying that you don't separate your work identity from your home identity from  your this identity from that identity because they're going to come into conflict.  Better off to have one identity and be yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Be yourself.  This is who I am.  I'm CEO bitch.  He lives that actually.  For those who think I was unnecessarily profane that actually was his business card.  I don't know if it still is.  Gizmo 5 just an update shutting down April 3rd.  You can transfer your credits to Google Voice.  Google bought Gizmo and finally has dropped the other shoe on their head.  I think we should get to our tool number and tip.  I know you've got to get going to see Marissa and Tim and we'll find out more about Kevin  Lynch and your lunch with him and Marissa and Tim next week.  How about that?  That's good.  Gina Trapani your tool or tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gmail added a new feature in the labs called smart labels.  So I think this is kind of like a way to jumpstart folks who aren't using filters and labels  very much.  If you enable smart labels in your Gmail account the labs link it automatically creates categories  for bulk called there's actually three labels bulk notification and forum messages and these  are just these are just filters that that look to see you know is this just a newsletter  or subscription is this a mailing list subscription and you know kind of promotional email and  filters them into those those labels automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  I knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah it's nice.  You know I had many of these filters I kind of created them by hand that serve a similar  purpose but this is really for folks who hadn't had a chance to do that or wanted to just  kind of get a kickstart on their labels and once you enable smart labels you can go into  your filter settings and you can tweak them you can add addresses and other criteria to  them you'll see the smart label filter listed there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've changed the UI it looks like I now have a gear for the option so I was looking  for the labs link and you have to click the gear now in the upper right hand corner of  Gmail and then you can get to the settings and then you can get to the labs and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can go to labs right and they have enough to do that in Google Apps yet so I hadn't  seen that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's cleaner that's how they should it should be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep and it's smart labels one word like wiki word so I'll go way down because it's alphabetic  so many labs features it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well these are all my enabled ones so I have to go down to the disabled ones smart mute  smart labels fan freaking tastic turning on now saving changes now.  Good tip thank you Gina.  Yeah sure.  Jeff your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well the obvious one is fortunes most admired companies Apple Google one two but I'll do  another number which is two thousand one hundred twenty seven which is Henry Blodgett's profit  last year for Business Insider.  What how much.  Two thousand one hundred twenty I mean two thousand one hundred twenty seven dollars.  That's all.  Well but he's made a profit as he said is better than not having two thousand one hundred  twenty seven dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot more jiggering the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah you said it I didn't.  I shouldn't say that I don't know anything I know nothing.  Now what Henry did what I like is he went ahead and released his financials put him  right out there so he made about four and a half million in an ad revenue and do you  think that's high or low for what he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four and a half million is about right I would say.  Yeah I'd say that's right where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're right right in that area.  Yeah he's investing in the business and he and he and you know there you're just as transparent  as Henry is you're putting that out.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he reinvested so it wasn't that he didn't have revenue it's just that he didn't take  anything out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He invested back in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's somebody told me that you should always tell people you made five dollars profit.  Because your salary is part of the cost.  Right.  Well you're also telling the IRS that.  Yeah.  Yeah I always at the end of the year I got five bucks left in my pocket.  Won't mention the savings account in Zurich.  I guess it's OK to say that because I see that he is still is banned from the securities  industry.  Yes he is.  He's found he's open about that.  He'll ask him about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He'll he'll talk about it.  That's what happened.
