Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the saddle again. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they say. Although your chair is much less saddle like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not saddle like, but that's okay.  I think that the Dr. Evil chair is bad luck for anybody else to sit in it.  It's just my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right. I think our team does not let anybody else sit in it.  I think when I see somebody sitting in my chair, I almost like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen Padre sit in it. He can sit in it.  Now that he's out of town, I'm going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is out of town, but he's doing a great job in Barcelona covering Mobile World Congress.  You were there last year. That is becoming each year more and more like CES.  That is this year, everything was going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like CES, but it's in Europe and so people wear nice clothes.  And there's jamon.  And they eat late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So much we've seen from Mobile World Congress.  We'll talk about a lot of that.  I guess what we should do is a little bit...  I don't want to go deep into the Department of Justice versus Apple.  Probably we will be talking about it yet again because in two days,  Apple's response is going to come out.  So I guess we'll be doing more of that.  But I think, Jeff, since we talked last week,  and we had, I think, a very valuable debate,  you, me and Matt Ingram.  Matthew Ingram.  And Steve Gibson.  But what's interesting is how this story has almost developed.  As the facts became better known,  it's changed and I'm curious...  First of all, we haven't talked with you, Mike. It's fresh for you.  But the question is, what is the story if people's opinions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  might have changed based on what we've learned?  Well, here's the problem.  And it's also the thing about this whole story that's so interesting,  which is that it's ultimately a political battle.  Apple is not on one side of that battle necessarily.  Apple is the battlefield. It's one of the battlefields.  The battle is between people like the FBI  who want the advantages of being able to get information on phones.  As Steve Gibson said today,  the details are one thing.  The overall intent is what's really important.  There are a bazillion ways to get data off a phone.  So there are people on one side like the FBI  and the people on the other side like the NSA,  which understands that strong encryption  is in the national interest.  And there are people in the community, among the citizenry,  who understand encryption  and are on the side of the NSA, ironically.  And then there are people who don't really understand encryption  who just think, well, let's go get the terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's about, by the way, more than half of the population in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the scary thing about it.  And the grandstanders will drive it home.  Well, not just Donald Trump, but John McCain, lots of people in government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like also the tech industry is a little knee-jerk on this as well.  Defend encryption at all costs.  I also want to point out it's not really about encryption.  I mean, encryption is done. That's not even debatable.  I mean, there is this notion we should put this golden key backdoor in encryption.  And they may try to do that, but it can't even be done successfully.  It can only be done with U.S. companies by U.S. Congress.  But there's so many other places you can get strong encryption  that that debate's over. The math is out there.  And I thought Denise Howell had a question.  I thought Denise Howell had kind of encapsulated it very well yesterday on TNT  when she said, really, the public debate we should be having is  whether you should have the right to privacy about what's on your iPhone or not,  or your smartphone, I shouldn't say iPhone, but your smartphone or not.  Whether these devices should be somehow specially protected.  And Steve Gibson mentioned that one of the things that's happened  is that technology has given us the ability to make these things impermeable,  to make them completely private.  And so, of course, there's now this balance between law enforcement that would love to be able...  Man, if you think about it, this is the best thing that ever happened to law enforcement, the smartphone,  because it's a GPS, it's a microphone, it's a camera, it's got everything we do.  Our whole lives are on it.  And they want that little treasure chest of evidence for law enforcement that never existed before, by the way.  Never existed one place where they could go and find out everywhere I've been,  everything I've done, every thought I've had, it's all in here.  So naturally, they want the key to that treasure chest.  So really, the body politic and we the people should be debating  not this particular incident as much as the whole notion of,  well, what kind of protection do we want to give this device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The protection of privacy.  Yeah. And I think that's why the FBI chose this particular case,  because the perps are dead, the phone belongs to the county.  It's a very clean case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The government owns the phone, the government's given permission to look at it,  there's no right to privacy once you're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I agree with you. I think that they picked this case to make Apple look like a douchebag if they resist it.  Because this is really bad politics, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, you're going to pick the strongest case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. And this is Washington's game, this is not Silicon Valley's game.  So Apple's at a disadvantage here because they don't understand what's coming in terms of the public wrath at Apple.  But I'll take Denise's point a step further.  The issue is not about whether our phones are encrypted.  The issue is whether our phones are encrypted by default,  whether the average novice user who doesn't think about encryption still gets encryption.  Because of course, ISIS and all these other people are afraid of, they will have strong encryption.  And the geeks who are into encryption will have encryption.  The question is whether, and to me I think there are lots of things that we need to protect ourselves from.  Terrorism is one of them. Industrial espionage is another.  So if there's any way for...  Government spying is another.  Yeah, whatever the solution is for the FBI to get access to our phones,  also invites in the Chinese state-sponsored hackers and even ISIS.  So what will happen inevitably if there is this mythical back door, if it's crackable, if phones are crackable,  if the messaging is crackable, someone will crack it, they'll make it available on the open market, and ISIS will buy it.  So if you want to be scared about ISIS and do fear-mongering around ISIS,  we are at risk at having a situation where ISIS can hack everybody in the US,  and we can't hack them because they'll have strong security because they are motivated.  So this is the fundamental question. Are the unmotivated people, the un-technical people going to be protected?  The rest of us should we have privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the only question.  I agree with you. And dumb crooks.  What do you think is the main new thing that we've learned, Leo?  Here's the thing that really is huge, and actually what I'd like to do,  and then we'll move on, is pose this question to you and everybody else in light of what I think we now know.  So, and this comes from Steve Gibson yesterday, and let me kind of just summarize this,  which is that the Department of Justice is not asking Apple to decrypt the phone,  but there is a weakness in iPhone's encryption. It's strong encryption, but the weakness is the passcode.  It does, in fact, decrypt the phone.  So what the Department of Justice is asking Apple to do is make it possible for them to brute force the phone  and get what's on it, thereby unlocking the encryption gets what's on it.  What Steve said, and I thought-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it might as well not be encrypted in the first place, once that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, whatever. I mean, they're asking Apple to help them get the password. Yeah. Okay?  Right.  The thing that is, really, I think, okay, if that's true, then the salient question is,  will this tool that Apple generates be useful in more than this one instance?  And the metaphor we used came from Bill Gates, of all people.  He said, Bill Gates came down in favor of the Department of Justice, although he's since kind of recanted a little bit, so I'm not sure.  Yeah, he's stepped back a bit.  But what he said was very good. He said this to the Financial Times in an interview.  He said, it's as if a bank tied a ribbon around a vault and said, we won't cut the ribbon.  And the FBI says, well, you need to cut the ribbon so we can get into the vault. And they say, we won't cut the ribbon.  The question is that, with that metaphor involved, the question is, is Apple cutting this one ribbon  or giving the FBI a ribbon cutter that can be used to cut all ribbons?  Are they giving the FBI a tool the FBI could then use to brute force other phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The answer is no. But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's what Steve Gibson has said very clearly, technologically.  This is a one-off because of the way it works. This could not be used for other phones.  Right.  Now, does that change?  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Explain that to me again.  So, Apple would not be... So, one of the arguments people say is, well, once you give this to the FBI,  then it leaks out from the FBI, and then everybody's got it, as you just said.  No. That's not actually the case. What would happen here is Apple would give the FBI firmware  that would turn off these protections for this phone only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, every update that Apple does is individual to each and every phone.  To each phone. That's right.  And so, technologically, they could do it easily without any risk of creating any kind of backdoor.  Politically, that's a different question, whether that's a precedent which now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, they're not being asked for a backdoor. They're not being asked for a tool.  Exactly.  They're being asked for... Now, I understand why Apple's fighting this because it does open this precedent that...  They've already said, Cyrus Vance Jr., the attorney general of New York, has said, oh, I got 10 more phones.  The Department of Justice has other phones.  Exactly.  Lots of people have phones. And once Apple says, well, we'll do it for this phone...  And now Apple's going to argue, I think, we'll find out on Friday, that's an undue burden for them.  They don't want the burden. It's not about privacy. It's just an undue burden.  They're suddenly in this business of unlocking phones. They don't want to be in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little bit more scary than that. The burden is for them...  They can do one of three things policy-wise as a company. They can say yes to every request.  They can say no to every request. Or they can be in the position to decide whether the request is valid or not.  Well, I think what they will do is say, we aren't going to do it unless there's a court order. The court will decide.  That's in the US. But what about China? What about Turkey? What about Pakistan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And that's the issue. There's two issues here. One is that remains... You're right. It's a precedent, a matter of precedent,  where once this capability is known, then every bad guy, every bad government in the world will demand it for every phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, the Chinese government said, we haven't done it yet. We haven't asked Apple yet because the US hadn't. We were waiting for you guys.  What a great idea! Thanks, FBI!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The second thing is... I forget who said this, but in essence, Apple's being forced to... enslaved to write something. It doesn't want to write it.  It's not just a case of saying, we'll... Okay, now we'll tell you the secret. Now we'll tell you the secret number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. And that's absolutely right. And that's the all-ritz part of this. And the defense against that is very clear, and the judge even said this in the order.  Apple can argue that it's a burden on them, which I think they will argue, because that's the only way out, by the way. They can't argue the Constitution.  They can't argue encryption. They can only say, well, this would be a lot to ask of us. And then once you start, we're going to be suddenly in the forensics business.  We don't want to be in that business. For every local police department, every...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what if you as an individual... It's like, I don't want to serve on a jury where I'd have to do the death penalty. I won't do it. I refuse to do it. You can't make me do it.  There's some things you can't... Well, you might go to jail for contempt of court, though.  What if every coder said... told Apple, no, I don't want to do that.  Yeah, but then you might go to jail for contempt of court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no. So the individual coder? Apple says, oh, we'd like to, but nobody would do it.  Well, somebody's going to jail. Somebody's going to be fined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing I read that I didn't... I don't know if this is true or not. I don't know if I buy it, but one speculation was, at least, that Apple was going to make a First Amendment argument.  It's hard for me to get my head around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really think people are going to be disappointed at Apple's defense because a lot of people want Apple to stand up and wave the flag of strong encryption and privacy.  And I don't think they... I think their lawyers will rightly say there's no argument there. That's not where you have to argue. You have to argue on the burden.  And I'm not a lawyer, but I suspect that's what's going to happen.  But Denise's point is very well taken. She is a lawyer.  What we really, as a nation, need to be debating is do we want to have our smartphones be private? Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I say yes. Exclamation point.  I say yes.  And I'm not an expert on this either, but I do watch the TV show Billions.  I love that show.  It's a great show.  I'm sorry.  But I think that Apple can't win this one. They're going to have to settle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're going to lose. I watch The Good Wife, so I know about law.  Exactly.  No, they'll go all the way to Supreme Court, probably, if the Supreme Court reviews it. If not, then Apple will have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll be destroyed. This is an election year. They're going to be killed in the court of public opinion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, because everybody says, well, that's a terrorist phone. Why wouldn't you help them?  I think Apple isn't even saying we won't help them. I think Tim Cook's saying we need to have this conversation. This is what's been happening.  I think Apple's going to say it would be an undue burden, not that we won't help them, but gosh, we're a business.  We can't be spending all our time helping you crack phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to talk about a burden. This is This Week in Google.  What about the Android world, where presumably every single OEM, and there are a thousand companies who make phones, are going to have to do what Apple is being asked to do to a certain extent?  Because if you want to crack the encryption on some Android phone, well, where do you go? You don't go to Google.  You go to Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although most Android phones are not encrypted by default, only the Nexus phones right now are encrypted by default.  I imagine Samsung, but all of them can be.  Yeah.  I imagine Samsung is as well.  Yeah.  The interesting thing is when you encrypt a phone, and I suspect Google kind of thought ahead, when you encrypt a phone, a non-Nexus phone, when you turn on that encryption, in every case I've done it, it requires you to enter not a PIN, not a passcode, not a gesture, but a long password.  And then that means, and I suspect, by the way, going forward, that this is what Apple will do to avoid this.  Yeah.  The only reason Apple can be forced to do this is because it's fairly weak to have a four or even six digit numeric code.  But if Apple says, and by the way, it's an option, and everybody who wants to be private can do this, and it will be private.  There's nothing Apple can do about it.  Right.  If you use, instead of the PIN code, it's in pain in the butt, but a long, strong password, then there's nothing Apple can do.  Right.  And in fact, on my Linux box, you have the option when you first install most versions of Linux to encrypt the disk, and you give it a passphrase.  And you can't even boot into it unless you give it that passphrase.  If that's a good passphrase, no government in the world can compel any manufacturer to unlock it.  It's not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think Apple will be happy to do that because really...  I think that's what's going to happen.  Because of the fingerprint ID, because all the phones are, all the high-end phones have fingerprint, then the burden on the user of a long password is not so great.  Because most of the time you unlock it just with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but as soon as you have a fingerprint, then they can compel the suspect to unlock it because you're not protected against use of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would have been easy in this case because he's in the morgue. They just go down to the morgue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it works if you're dead. I don't think it does.  I think the fingerprint requires flesh and blood. Live flesh and blood.  But for people who are watching, you don't have to wait for Congress or the courts or Apple or any manufacturer to decide because they've built in strong encryption unless they backdoor it.  Use a strong password, not a PIN or a swipe, and your stuff is protected.  And that, by the way, is also true for any terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means that every single time you use the phone, you have to use the strong password.  That's the disadvantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, so Denise's question is interesting.  So we need to decide, do we want these to be private?  Guess what? We know how.  Do we want it to be private even if you had to enter a 10-letter password every time you started the phone?  No, probably not. That's too much trouble.  That's too much trouble.  The good news is strong encryption exists. The math exists.  If you're worried about a backdoor, use an open-source strong encryption technology.  There are many of them available from non-U.S. companies.  I think that that's been solved.  And the real issue here is because Apple kind of opened the door to this because they wanted it to be convenient.  And they said, well, you could use a four-digit numeric code or six-digit numeric code.  If you had a strong password, and by the way, you can't turn, you can use a password on your iPhone.  If this shooter had used a passcode, password, nothing Apple could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also would predict that once they do get into this phone, there's not going to be any data there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They know that. I don't think it has anything to do with that.  In a way, it's a little cynical of them, I think, to go to the families of the people killed by the terrorist and say, what do you think?  And bring their, you know, they're going to file a court opinion.  That's cynical because it's not going to happen in the investigation, I don't think.  But we don't know. I mean, that's their job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anytime this has become not just political, as Mike said, it's become religious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's also becoming a kind of a left-right issue.  Is it?  I think it is. I think, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's interesting. Even in government, the NSA supports strong, unbroken, unbacked door encryption.  But nobody understands.  And the FBI doesn't. That's two branches of the government.  Right.  So there's not even agreement within the national security infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think there ever is. I mean, everybody wants their own job to go the way they want.  I mean, imagine how much more effective policing could be from the policeman's perspective if they didn't have Miranda rights, if they didn't have all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As I said, they see this treasure chest and they go, God, if we could only get in there, we'd know everything we need to know. All the evidence is in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like any sort of political issue.  There are certain people that want something and they want it for whatever the reason is that they want it.  And they wait for an event to take place where they can say, now this is why we want it.  See? Think of the children.  Right. So this is the, and I hate to sound this cynical, but this is why terrorism is convenient.  It actually tries, changes minds, it scares people into agreeing with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's be honest. Number one, these were not organized terrorists. These were two complete dorks.  They're bad guys, just like any other bad guys.  But are they organized across, are we going to hold on to a network of 100 terrorists? No.  Number two, to convict the guy who helped getting the weapons, that's what they do. They got everything they need.  So you're right, Mike, this is not about this case at all. There's absolutely nothing I believe they really want here.  This is the ideal case to use to shame Apple into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And establish a precedent that Apple is very reluctant to have established.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the best case scenario for the FBI and the people in government who want the back doors and access  and for there not to be easy encryption on phones by default is for Apple to fight this and fight it and fight it and fight it  until public opinion is so overwhelming that they cave and then everybody will be scared into just laying down  for these types of requests and they will have won the political battle. That's the ideal thing.  That's why I think Apple should immediately just say, okay, yeah, sure, we'll cooperate in every way.  Just to take the wind out of this particular one, because once they're publicly shamed, once the mighty Apple,  the world's most valuable company, is publicly shamed into cracking under the pressure based on the fear of terrorism,  then everybody else will just do it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's proof of what you say, because Apple wanted this to be sealed and private all along.  Had they not made a big deal about it, Apple probably would have complied silently and nobody would have known and they would have gone away.  But the FBI and the Department of Justice did not want this to be private because they wanted a precedent.  And I don't blame them. I think they want to do the best job they can, capturing bad guys and preventing us from terrorist attack.  I don't blame them. Again, it's a treasure trove. You've got a treasure chest. You're waving in front of me.  I want in. And the truth, though, is we should be having the national debate of how private these should be,  or even the larger national debate of whether encryption should exist.  Actually, that's the biggest debate, the big debate, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wrote a column before all this hit talking about McCain's Bloomberg View piece where McCain argued for backdoors and things like backdoors.  The way that politicians are viewing it right now is like, oh, we can always solve these problems later.  We'll figure out exactly how we get access to phones, but we'll do that later.  But he was basically using a different case, the failed terrorist attack in Texas, as the reason why all phones need to be insecure.  And my view is like, there are other bad guys out there. For example, China just recently unveiled their new bomber, which is identical to the US bomber.  They literally stole all the technology.  And you've got to think that the lack of encryption helped that effort over the last decade and a half or whatever it took them to steal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the real point. It needs to be made to John McCain and everybody else that we're safer with encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are such a porous society that it's so easy to steal technology and so on that universal, easy encryption would help us a lot.  We uniquely need it, I think, to a certain extent.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So all right, that's enough of that.  But I think that what's interesting how and I guess this is a case study for your journalism class, how it's very hard to report on a story like this in the first 24 hours and report accurately on it.  And this has been a story where as we've learned more, as we as reporters have learned more, not merely facts, but understood better what we're talking about, the story has changed considerably and refined considerably.  And, you know, I think we did a pretty good job that first.  We had just learned a story on Wednesday.  But now knowing what we know now, I think we can make a more nuanced case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been saying for a couple years now that the key skill for journalism is really to say what you don't know.  That what's known is known by everybody.  It's out there for all to see.  That's good. What don't we know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to know the difference between your beliefs and what you know.  And because a lot of times it seems so obvious.  And, you know, because journalists are human.  Most of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not now. Watson.  Is Watson in journalism?  Is writing headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Actually, we're in a we're in an interesting position here because I don't think we break stories or we tell facts so much as we try to give people an understanding of the underlying technology and what it means for them and that kind of thing.  I think that this discussion is a perfect example.  And we can do a better job.  Once all the reporting is done of explaining what it means.  That's really what Twitter's about.  Let's take a break. When we come back, we'll talk about walking robots and how they've been bullied.  You know what?  New new hashtag. No robot bullying.  Or maybe we need a new hashtag. More robot bullying.  Yeah.  Don't make him angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't make him angry.  I'm going to show him who's boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk about AMP.  It's about to be here in Google's now shown that it is evil.  And we'll let you let you respond.  Oh, I've got to.  Yeah.  You might be surprised.  And what's happening at Yahoo?  All that and more coming up.  It's so nice to have Mike Elgin back.  What do you want to plug, Mike?  Are you still doing?  I hate to say this.  Are you still doing the Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still on Google Plus.  Yeah.  How long?  I haven't been exclusive to it.  This is not your fault, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  I love Google Plus and I think Google mismanaged it, dropped the ball.  But I do feel like it's kind of over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me, the biggest event in the world of Google Plus was that Sundar Pichai in his  weak defense of Apple over this whole thing that we talked about.  Didn't use Google Plus.  He used Twitter.  And I thought, oh my God.  I mean, everybody would have followed his commentary wherever it was.  So he could have done a post on Google Plus with a link from Twitter.  But he thought, oh, why should anybody use Google Plus?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had to do it like four different posts.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like, come on.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's sad.  I had high hopes, but that's life.  So where else can we catch you?  In Computer World.  You're writing a lot now, which is great.  I'm writing a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on Twitter.  Mike Elgin.  I'm on Facebook.  I'm even on Pinterest.  So I'm exploring my feminine side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if you ever want to do a thing on man bags, I'll be there right there.  It's not a purse, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a European.  It's a European carry-on.  It's a mers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my mers.  Seriously, every geek.  I understand Patrick Norton always used to carry around like it looked like an 800 pound  pack.  Because you want to have your firewall and your chargers and your stuff.  It occurs to me frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have this over the one shoulder kind of a messenger bag type of thing that I carry  with me when I don't have my full backpack.  And I'm in there looking for things.  And every once in a while I'm like, this is a freaking purse.  I need it.  Yes.  Where's my lipstick?  I can't find it anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'll talk about the new phone that just came out.  I just got it today.  Jason Hallow just got his.  This was a Kickstarter from a company called Nextbit made of former HTC and Google Android  folks.  The Robin is here.  And you know what?  It's better than I thought it would be.  And we also have lots to talk about from Mobile World Congress.  I've also ordered a Galaxy S7 Edge.  And that'll come in a couple of weeks.  So our show today brought to you by Texture, the mobile app that lets you access the world's  most popular magazines whenever, wherever you want on your phone or your tablet.  There's some great writing and great reporting, great journalism, great fiction, photography,  photojournalism in magazines, kind of locked up in magazines.  Some of them are on the web.  A lot of them aren't.  But the last thing I want to do is bring home a pile of glossy four color paper every week  and put it on my coffee table.  I don't want the mailman to bring it either.  They're kind of hidden away in a vault until Texture.  Texture gives you all the best magazines, exactly the same form as you'd get on the newsstand.  Current issue plus past issues, even bonus features like video you can't get.  There's Adweek.  There's Wired.  There's Vanity Fair.  There's Fortune.  There's all the magazines.  Bloomberg Markets, Bon Appétit, Billboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the best magazine in the world is, Leo?  What's that?  It's the New Yorker magazine.  Love that magazine.  They have the best fact checked, most wonderful stories in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's always an article in New Yorker I want to read.  But you know what I don't like is it's weekly and I feel guilty.  Yes.  That I don't read a cover to cover.  Yep.  So for the cost of about three magazines a month, you subscribe to it and the National Geographic.  And by the way, Entertainment Weekly, Us, and all the gossip magazines.  Rolling Stone, there's almost every month there's an article I want to read in there.  Do I want to subscribe just for that one article?  No.  You don't have to.  This is like Netflix for magazines.  They're all in there.  Yeah, I'm so glad the New Yorker is in there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually, it's...  Just the cartoons alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But if you only read the cartoons, you feel like, why am I killing all these trees for just the cartoons?  Anyway, here's the deal.  You could try it for free right now.

And Facebook articles also out for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That happens, I think, in April.  Oh, it's going to.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not Apple News.  You still have to be kind of a publisher with Apple News.  But these are three platforms that are designed to make mobile content faster, easier, lighter, better to read.  Right.  And, you know, Facebook's a walled garden.  I was talking to somebody who said, I don't...  Oh, it was Dan Gilmore who said, I can't understand why anybody would bury their content in Facebook,  except that that's what people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you maintain your copyright.  You can put it anywhere.  You're cross posting it there.  And even Dave Weiner just put a post up today.  Really?  How Instant Articles helps the open web.  Okay, good.  Dave is the toughest critic you could imagine.  Good.  If you go to scripting.com.  Yeah, it supports RSS, for example.  Which, of course, Dave likes a lot and supports.  Exactly.  He invented.  And I won't go into the details, as I'm sure I'll mess it up.  But it is interesting that if you consider...  And Dave has been critical of me using Medium and others using Medium.  But as long as you can export, as long as you put them all in one place, you own your own stuff,  the question is why aren't you putting it in all these places to reach people where they are?  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you write a blog post, you put it on Medium.  I don't put it on my blog as much as I should.  Yeah, well, I would.  And I kind of yell at you for that.  I mean...  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Kevin Marks here telling me I should use No to put it in all places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go posse and post on your personal thing and syndicate to everybody else.  But you can't do that.  It's kind of time consuming to do that because you have to do it by hand in many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AMP...  I talked to Jinguers and Google this week, and I've been defending AMP on the fear that Google...  Because it was in an ad-age story about two weeks ago, Jinguers was misquoted or mis-summarized,  and they presumed that Google would favor AMP content in search and such.  And I looked into this...  I asked them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Richard was very clear, no, no, only to the extent that because it's faster and we favor any faster page, will it be favored?  But...  And if it were favored, that to me would be a monopolistic move by Google, strong arming by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the issue I do have, which is that if you do a search on a topic like look up AMP and there comes a carousel,  which is probably a new thing, not always at the top, but it's prominently displayed.  That is just AMP content.  I thought at first that was only going to be used for the demo purposes to say, oh, look what it can do.  Fine, I had no problem with that.  But now that AMP content is there...  I asked them and I said, well, what's your definition of fast?  If I can make my page as fast as AMP, how are you going to do that?  Why am I not in the carousel?  They don't have an answer there.  They don't have an answer there.  So the carousel is just promoting AMP content.  And I think that makes me uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is, by the way, only in mobile search because they say again and again AMP is really just about speeding up mobile.  Although so there's a burden on the publisher because you have to create an AMP page.  AMP is not an open standard.  They could say that all they want.  But Google sets the standard, including what tags are allowed and not allowed.  They've read the big you know, the big example to me is redefining the image tag.  That's been an HTML since day one.  And no, you can't use it telling you what JavaScript you may and may not use from a kind of this purist engineering standpoint.  I understand. Well, it speeds up pages.  It's really my here's what I think is going on.  Google was very nervous about ad blocking the boycott of of ads because Google's an ad company.  And they said, why do people block ads?  And they actually didn't get it right.  They said people block ads because it makes pages fat, fat and slow and sluggish.  So we're just going to make pages fast and lean and they'll still have ads, but they'll be acceptable ads, you know, ads that we allow.  But what they don't understand is a people block ads because they don't like ads period.  B, they're worried about security concerns.  Maybe this addresses that.  Some of it is, of course, the waste of bandwidth and speed.  And this does address that.  But but I don't think.  OK, so it's a response to ad blockers.  It's in their financial interest.  And now they're going to favor it in their search results.  And you cannot deny that a carousel is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are there are given to me when I when I raised this question, which I did with them, it was I bar goad until today was, well, the carousel won't always be at the top.  You know, other more important stories may be above it.  OK, but the carousel is still a favored position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an example, by the way, just Googled on my phone.  FBI Apple.  OK, one story from Wired at the top.  Here's the amp carousel, which is the more compelling, interesting content, which are you more likely to link to?  This is content.  And by the way, this is big publishers.  It's a BBC.  It's USA Today.  It's ABC News.  It's the verge.  It is not the Jonathan Zdarsky blog.  It is not twit.  It is not any of the independent content you might be interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I searched on Obama and the first thing in the carousel is the blaze, which is probably in trouble with some of your users now.  So your viewers, but is is is a right wing that job site from what's his name?  Breitbart, who does?  Yeah, no, no, no.  The former Fox News guy was even too crazy for Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right.  That guy, that guy.  Yeah, that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what what's the news?  What's the news?  I was into Glenn Beck.  Thank you.  What goes into the people?  You know, yes, you can waste your time emailing me how I'm a dork by criticizing Glenn Beck.  Save your effort.  Get a life.  Relax.  So, you know, what's the news judgment?  What's the structure that goes into the carousel versus what's above?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, what they said, I should point out, by the way, yes, when you search for Obama on Google, you don't get an app carousel, but you do get a bunch of YouTube videos.  Well, I know I don't get that.  I'm getting all these YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not associated with Google in any way.  Which is not associated with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I getting?  Only YouTube video.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I clicked videos by accident.  Oh, I see.  All right.  But guess what?  I do get a Yahoo story for me and then a bunch of AMP content that to me is more than favoring AMP.  That is like putting it front and center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's another issue also, which is that AMP delivers up components of a web page that are both Google's version and in some cases come from Google itself, come from Google servers.  There's another thing that we'll probably talk about at some point today called Project Shield where journalists, you know, websites are cached on Google servers and so they can't be brought down with DDoS attacks.  Nice.  It's nice.  And then this is tied in.  Stick with me here with internet.org, which doesn't give people in poorer countries the internet for free.  It gives them a cached version of the internet on Facebook's servers for free, a very limited version.  And so what we see by Google and Facebook is an attempt to get to move people off the public internet onto the ones that are on their own private servers.  I think that's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike, I think that, yeah, I'm hearing that this is a...  that AMP is somehow another walled garden.  I don't buy that.  You don't have to use the CDN.  You can make your own if you want.  You can use Akamai.  You can use anywhere you want.  They're offering you a free CDN, but it is not a requirement of AMP, period.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand.  And I don't think there's bad intent.  I think this is just what's necessary to make these good things possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what often happens with Google is they do things that make sense as engineers, not knowing completely what the impact will be to public opinion.  And yet I have to point out these are both...  Project Shield's not.  I like Project Shield.  But AMP is self-serving, ultimately self-serving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no.  I mean, though I was just critical of that part of the execution.  Making the...  We in media messed up the web.  We said this with the show before.  I think making the faster web is generally a good thing.  It is an open standard.  They will have to figure out the governance to make it a truly open standard, because right now it's Google's open standard.  I would not reject AMP just because Google does, in fact, benefit from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Google's version of zero rating.  And I think it'll be very popular with people just as zero rating is, you know, when T-Mobile says, hey, Ben John, you're not going to go against your data plan.  Everybody yells at me for saying that's a bad idea, because that's a great idea from their point of view as is AMP.  Everything's faster and nicer and slick and sweet in the beautiful Google universe.  But it is not.  It's just like zero rating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's wrong with being in Google CDN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Akamai is not open.  You pay for Akamai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but well, I don't...  It's not so much about the CDN that bothers me.  What it is is that Google is now going to favor web pages designed with its own proprietary non-standard format.  So let's hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what if tomorrow they said, oh, gee, OK, all right, we'll get rid of the carousel or we'll include fast...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm just saying I told you so, because nobody...  Because I said this and everybody said, oh, don't worry, it won't be in any way favored by Google.  I told you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if they got rid of that?  They're not going to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the whole point.  What if they did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the only objection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it'd be better.  They wouldn't be using their...  See, Google's strong arms, people.  Look, I agree it's a good idea that all sites should be HTTPS.  But then as soon as you start using your...  And this is that argument I keep coming back to on this show, that because search is so important, it should be a priesthood.  It should not serve Google's commercial interests.  It's a company.  I understand it's a company, but it's a company with so much power because the power of the Google search is essentially the power to exist on the Internet.  As Microsoft ruined the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When are you moving to Germany, fella?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really...  Look, this is Google saying, hey, don't worry, we'll take care of this.  Well, in some cases they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do it and they do take care of things.  We can't also shut ourselves off to the notion that a company can do something right.  Yeah, but this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, there's a theoretical dimension to this.  Of course, I think Google is trying to do the right thing.  Yes, faster pages are better.  Yes, they're being open to a certain extent.  But this is why we have...  I think your argument in the initial part of this...  This is why we have standards.  Standards.  Every company says, this is the way to do it.  And another company says, no, that's not the way to do it.  This is the way to do it.  This is the way to do it.  And that's why we have standards bodies.  They can all figure out and agree on one thing and that's the standard.  Standards bodies are bureaucracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they move slow, so let's just go right ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, with this internet.org thing, Google says, come on, everybody's welcome on our version of the internet.  And Facebook goes, well, everybody's welcome on our version of the internet.  That's where I think you're going too far, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where I think you're going too far.  Here's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then where are the Google sites on internet.org?  They're not there.  Why?  Because Google is a competitor with Facebook and they don't want to live on Facebook's internet.  And so now you're criticizing not Google, you're criticizing Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm always criticizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it goes both ways.  That's the point is that Facebook has instant articles, Google has AMP.  But AMP is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AMP is in fact open to anybody can use it.  Here's where it's going to change.  And I've said this on the show before, so I'm repeating myself and I apologize for those who've heard it before.  It's only coincidental that this happens to start with news because they want to do something nice for news in Europe.  They come back.  Dave Besbrust says, I want a faster web.  I want to clean up the web.  It's a mess.  They put those two things together.  What's going to happen fairly quickly here is that AMP is not going to be just news and news publishers.  AMP is going to be any damn page on the web.  And then the carousel is going to become pretty much meaningless.  And the question is, are pages fast or slow?  And in a mobile world, slow pages will indeed perform badly.  And one by hook or crook or one standard or another, pages will have to get faster and lighter and clean up the mess we made of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's the irony of this is that according to Dave Weiner, Facebook is using open web technology and standards.  They're using RSS and it's compatible.  In fact, you don't have to host it on Facebook for instant articles to work.  You can do your own thing.  It's where you're served.  You're hosted.  You are.  No, he says you don't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says you are all he says you can create outside.  But at the end, when that has actually served to you, Leo, the port on your Facebook, Facebook serving that they're cashing it through to.  Yeah, I was wouldn't be fast.  But he says, but he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to because it's an open format.  You can post use the same format, same content to post to LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium or any new service that might come along.  So Facebook does not have an exclusive on this flow.  They are not being a silo.  How about that?  But he says it's he says it's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just to correct what you said a minute ago, though, he says you can't be turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're using right.  But it doesn't have to be.  You could have instant article content served by others.  You can't say with same with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amp is just a subset of HTML full stop period is something you don't like.  But it's a subset.  It's a web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is just I would love to get Dave Weiner on because what my sense is of this is that oddly enough, Facebook is not using.  Nonstandard tags.  They're using standards, including RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when you are served in instant articles, you are cached by Facebook servers served by Facebook servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says I can and will modify River five to support the instant article format.  That's his new content system.  All kinds of new services can boot up on the flow without depending upon Facebook servers.  You can't be turned off by Facebook.  This is the key feature of the open web.  It's the platform without a platform vendor.  What's interesting about AMP, you're right.  Others can host AMP, can cache AMP content, but only Google can say what's acceptable in AMP.  Only Google can say what JavaScript can exist in AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Instant articles also takes a subset of HTML.  You can't do anything.  But a legitimate subset.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that's important.  Who is against?  Is there anybody against AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to do pop-up ads.  This is what drives Jonathan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's me and Mark Zuckerberg.  If I want to do pop-up ads, I can't do them in either format.  There are things that I am not allowed to do.  There is a subset.  I'm not allowed to do pop-up ads.  Yeah, it allows a subset, but it's not a non-standard subset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in other words, if you serve AMP content to Firefox right now, it'll go, what?  I don't know what this is because it's not standard.  If you serve instant articles to Firefox, it'll go, yeah, let me render that.  I don't know.  Let's try that.  Isn't that the case?  Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  You try that.  Open up Firefox.  Put an URL in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you have to use Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know yet.  Maybe it is to start with, but they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you create a new standard with non-standard tags, maybe I'm misunderstanding.  Maybe it generates standard HTML.  Is that right?  It might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Test it.  I can't open up Firefox because I have a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I had this question before and I should have probably answered this to my satisfaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't find an AMP article...  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have Safari on here.  That would be awesome.  Take that URL, put it in and see what happens.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If anybody isn't going to support it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  So let's do a Google...  Oh, but see, I'm not on mobile.  Shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can still put it...  No, no, you can still put it in the new AMP.  How do you get an AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you get an AMP?  Open up a story in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, let me open this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this URL...  Who is AMP'd everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Washington Post, Guardian, New York Times.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  BBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I see them all on the...  It's the format for AMP.  On the carousel.  Yeah, but it's not showing the AMP'd URL.  I don't know what the AMP...  Did you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we need Kevin Marks.  AMPersign, AMP or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought so, but it's not showing that, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Force, AMP content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can show source here, can I show source on my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, don't show source.  That's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's saying AMP does work.  EvilIRC and our chairman says AMP does work on mobile Safari.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, if that's the case, if in other words you write the page in some non-standard markup,  but it generates standard markup, then actually I don't have a problem with that.  Okay.  As long as it's standard, as long as what goes out on the web is standard.  I mean, Node.js is non-standard markup when we write pages for our website.  We're not writing it in HTML.  But same thing if you use CoffeeScript or a lot of other things you use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's another issue to AMP and Facebook's version of this that's really kind of interesting  that we should stop and take notice of, which is that assuming those are good things,  that faster mobile websites are good, and I think that's a safe assumption.  I agree with you on that, yeah.  That's part of a larger trend where the mobile web is now becoming vastly better  than the desktop web, if you can call it the desktop web.  Oh, yeah.  We used to think that mobile was a subset.  So for example, there are all kinds of new startups launching on mobile only.  Atom Bank in the UK, Pokemon Go, for example, Poshmark, Game Time, Go 90,  a mobile-only weather show called The Lift from the Weather Channel.  So these are actual content and services that exist on your phone that you can't get on your desktop.  So there are things like the...and then there are features coming out on apps  where the new features exist only on mobile devices like Spotify's Party feature.  You can't use that from a laptop and so on.  And of course, Facebook and Google are making the mobile web faster.  So we're getting to the point where increasingly the mobile web is pulling away from the desktop web,  and the desktop web is the Internet's unwanted stepchild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another thing to fear, although given the move to mobile, I guess it's almost inevitable.  That's just everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you open up the Neiman Lab piece I put on, how fast is it on the rundown?  I think it's very interesting.  You'll see the relative speed of similar content, AMP, non-AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, that's like...I understand.  That's the same thing you could say, well, isn't this nice that I don't have to pay T-Mobile for my Netflix viewer?  No, but how...  It's good. Yes, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a faster web page, period, full stop.  It's a faster web page. That's a good thing.  We messed up the web.  And let Google fix it.  And this makes it faster by limiting what you can do.  So what do you want? Yahoo to fix it?  We didn't fix it. We could have fixed it in media. We didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why everybody uses ad blockers.  By the way, the web is nice and fast with ad blockers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but I'd sure rather have fed to journalists with ads on faster pages and fewer people motivated to put in ad blockers.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a bad thing for my business.  I need to actually do some research and make sure...  Because I don't understand...  So you can get AMP content on a knot without Chrome.  Like, I don't have to use Chrome or a Google browser to see an AMP page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm not saying it does. I'm saying we've got to test that. I'm not sure. I do not know.  I know that they've said that. Pretty sure they've said that they intend to make it work for all browsers, but I can't remember when that was said.  So I better... I don't know.  So if you take a New York Times story that on the web, the good old fashioned web, took 0.985 seconds to begin the load and fully in 3.82 seconds.  OK, the mobile version, similar, 0.857 seconds to start loading, fully loaded in 2.99 seconds.  I stipulate AMP is faster.  Let me just say a little praise here.  The AMP version, note the amp.html in the URL it says here, loads in 0.24 seconds and is fully loaded in 0.646 seconds.  So, you know, it's substantially faster and it changes the basic experience of the web.  I don't feel like I'm going to the New York Times. I feel like when I click on a NuzleLink now, I feel like I'm reading it there or the carousel or wherever.  I don't feel like I've had to go somewhere.  Right.  That is a fundamental change in the experience of the web.  This notion, and this goes back to all my yammerings years ago on the show about the link economy.  And when I saw this, my epiphany on this was the idea that we had to send readers over to get to the content.  Why doesn't the content come to the reader?  And this is a moral equivalent of that.  That's fundamentally important.  And the fact that Google did it, I mean, I had this argument at Newsgeist.  People said, well, should we do this?  I said, we talked, we complained about this a year ago at the same conference and nothing happened in media since then.  So Google went out and did something.  Good for them.  You don't have to use AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're an impatient man, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't it bad if Google favors AMP in their search results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I've just said.  I agree.  So I'm criticizing Google here.  I think that the carousel is a problem.  I think it's a problem for, as we like to say, optics.  I think it's a problem in Europe.  I think that they're being a little naive in that.  And just saying that, well, the first thing on the page is disingenuous.  And I think that's a vulnerability.  Yeah, they need to pay attention to that.  So what Google has to do, my suggestion is what Google has to do is to set a standard of speed, whatever they set that.  And however you meet that standard, if they want to have a carousel of fast stuff, that's how you get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how you foster the reverse of this ad tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they did one version of speed.  They should be open to many versions of speed.  If all they care about is the same problem I have with the notion of the digital news initiative, it's a European liners initiative.  And all they're doing is playing. They're not really caring about news in that sense.  OK, so here's this.  They really cared about speed.  They would care about speed and have one of many versions how to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an AMP URL from USA Today.  I put it into Chrome.  It loaded very fast, Jeff.  You're absolutely right.  And this is what it looks like.  Looks bad there.  The headline's not good.  Well, that's why I'm getting some rendering issues.  Don't worry about that.  Now I load the same thing in Safari.  This is the same URL, but as you can see, this is a non-AMPed version.  Not render well.  So my question is, I don't know what my question is.  That's an issue they've got to figure out.  I don't know what my question is.  Now the question is, again...  Is this HTML? What is AMP? Is it render into...  I mean, it's out as of today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the question for me is what we should ask is, what I'm curious to get the answer from, is what do you do?  What do Firefox folks say at Mozilla about AMP?  And I don't know.  And I've got a friend who's there, and I should ask her what their stance is on AMP.  And will they render AMP, or will they somehow protest and agree with Leo that it's the work of the devil?  I don't know.  I would think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the other thing I have to point out is...  You know, one of the things that we don't want to do is load a bunch of JavaScript, unknown JavaScript from Google.  I mean, I don't think that's a good idea.  Yeah.  So, okay.  So...  I'm getting back some weird...  Here's a tag, amp-pixel.  Yeah, it's kind of odd looking HTML.  This is in Chrome.  Yeah, see, amp-image is the image tag here, okay?  So...  And let me look at the same source in Safari, because...  That's interesting.  I feel like I'm getting a different page.  And that's definitely non-standard HTML, which Chrome handles, obviously.  So that's another thing.  What if you made pages that only got rendered properly by a Google product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what happens is that the other browser can look and not get the AMP version.  It gets the regular version.  But what it requires is...  Here's the question to me.  It requires publishers to then maintain two versions as long as there's that separation, which is the issue you're right with non-standard.  If I were a publisher tomorrow, what you want is a system that would enable a publisher to say, screw it, I'm going to produce one version of everything as an AMP version.  If that doesn't work, then you're right that they're disadvantaged.  The other thing that is a little bit of news around AMP is that one of the things that the European publishers had demanded, no surprise, was treatment of paywalls.  So now on the client side, not the server side yet, though they're working on that.  On the client side, when you go to a paywall page, it does that thing where it grays out the bottom like the Wall Street Journal does and says, oh, you want to see this?  Pay up.  And as I understand how that works, the content is actually served on the client.  The client just blocks it until you're cleared, as opposed to a server side solution where the content would only be served up if you're a known user.  But that was a big requirement for publishers who have paywalls to be able to make AMP paywall friendly.  And Instant Articles is not paywall friendly.  I'm not a big friend of paywalls, so I don't necessarily care.  But that's a big difference between the two right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Briefly, a little quick investigation.  The page that I was served in Safari does not have any of those weird AMP image tags, amp-image.  So even though I went to the same exact URL that has AMP in the URL, cpt-amp.production.connect, it served up a version that Safari could see,  but it's not an AMPed version.  So this is another problem I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a pointer in the source code probably from one version to another.  I'm not sure how that works exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever. If an AMPed page requires a Google product to load, there's another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Yeah.  But this is where I'm saying early days, and this is where I'm also saying this is why, number one, I'll repeat myself.  Number one, what Google should be doing, I think, is saying we favor the fast web.  Here's our way to get to it.  Here's the standard we set.  If you have another standard that gets you there, hunky-dory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a case to be made that the way standards do get advanced is by unilateral effort, like from a company like Microsoft.  And they create something, and then everybody says, oh, that's great.  Let's put that in the standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or they fight over it and it doesn't work.  There is an open standard structure for this.  It is on GitHub.  You can see what the JavaScript does and doesn't do.  That's open.  But that's one issue.  The second issue is the carousel.  All right.  How many hours have we done?  I know.  We've slowed down.  I know.  Podcast world with AMP discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Shut up now.  I know.  By the way, this project shield is pretty cool.  So the idea of this is to provide DDoS protected.  The reason I'm very aware of this is our friend Steve Gibson was DDoSed off and on for days, bringing his site down.  And the problem is that the features of his site, like Shields Up, could not be used in a DDoS protected environment.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how does Google exactly do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It basically caches the site on Google servers.  And then Google servers are so gigantic that they can't be destroyed by a DDoS attack.  And what's interesting about this to me, the most interesting...  But they're doing this for free for people?  For free.  And who's doing it?  Jigsaw.  Now, I thought Jigsaw was a think tank.  I thought they were sitting around smoking opium and stuff and just coming up with grand ideas.  But this is actually a service that is being provided by Jigsaw.  So I think that's really interesting.  So they're going to actually be doing things, not just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This works roughly the same as commercial DDoS protection sites like...  I'm trying to remember John Graham Cummings company, Cloudflare, by reverse proxy.  So exactly right. It goes through Google.  The problem is that Steve raised with all of these sites is that they have to own the certificate.  They have to own the domain name.  And that he cannot then provide outbound services like Shields Up.  But it's fine for a news site.  And what this is intended to do is protect news sites against being brought down as a form of censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's even better than just protecting news sites from censorship.  And in their announcement, they talked about a specific Iranian news website that was brought down by the Iranian government, most likely,  to prevent them from reporting on shenanigans in their election, etc.  But what's interesting about this is that they're neutral in terms of your left and right or whatever politics.  But they're not neutral in terms of what kind of news site it is.  So if it's a government owned website like China TV or state media, they will not protect those sites.  So now we're in a world where government sites can be DDoSed.  Well, presumably the Chinese government has equal resources.  But does the North Korean?  Maybe not North Korean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  South Korea would argue would need protection from North Korea.  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, to bring down a modern site, you need a lot of bandwidth.  By the way, we talked a lot about this on Security Now on Tuesday.  I encourage you to listen to that episode.  But DDoS attacks could easily be mitigated if ISPs would simply block packets coming out of their networks that don't have IP addresses within their IP range.  In other words, spoofed IP addresses.  That's how you have to do this.  You have to because otherwise if you can't if you're a bad guy and you're trying to bring a site down, you can't use your IP address.  They just block those IP addresses.  So they use raw sockets and other techniques to spoof the IP addresses just to make up IP addresses so that you can't block any given IP address.  That's come from many.  You can do that with a botnet as well.  But if in general, ISPs just simply it would not in any way impinge on their effectiveness simply said, look, that that address is not from our network.  Why are you pretending to be that address?  We're going to we're going to drop that packet.  None of this would happen.  And I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are there any implications at all to that happening?  Not that I know of.  VPNs or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Well, it would it would it would mean that you would be able to be anonymous on a network, but you can still go out of the network using Tor and be anonymous.  It seems to me like this is a very simple thing.  And I think Steve Gibson agrees because, you know, every Internet service provider, every connection, the Internet is is is provided with a range of IP addresses that they own that they're legal addresses.  Your address when you use Cox or Comcast or Time Warner is within that range of addresses.  If none of your computer your computer is coming some other address, that's bad behavior.  And no, no, I can't think of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm wrong here.  This is DDoS attacks are not coming from Comcast.  They're coming from Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Well, that's the problem.  I bet you I don't know.  But I would say that Comcast is probably doing the right thing, although for years they didn't block port 25.  They didn't block spam, outbound spam.  My my but you're right.  I mean, it's it's got to be all ISPs.  It can't just be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the issue.  And you know, there's going to be evil ISPs somewhere in the world run by governments.  In some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think the guy who's bringing GRC.com down is coming out of Russia.  He's got botnets perhaps in Russia, but he's got it all over.  He's put it all over.  Certainly would mitigate it considerably if the you know, the top 20 ISPs did this because you need bandwidth.  He's Steve was hit with 13 gigabits per second.  Oh, that's how you bring somebody down.  And and so if that if she was cut in half.  A botnets the same thing because a botnet if you get this, I mean, yeah, if you had a botnet of one hundred thousand bots using their real address, it'd be hard to shut that down.  So in that case, yeah.  Google wants to replace SMS with a better messaging platform called RCS, rich communications service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like another effort for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this one's a standard and a good standard, by the way.  It's it's a number Apple, which has its own and the fact it wouldn't work with messages.  I messages because Apple uses its own protocol.  The idea is SMS should be as capable as WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I can't help but think that Google tried so many times to compete with the WhatsApps and the Facebook messengers with Hangouts, et cetera, and failed completely.  And now they're like, OK, fine, we'll just be that way.  We'll just launch this standard that will make WhatsApp, you know, unnecessary because it will support most of the stuff that and carriers are on board with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is.  Oh, yeah, they've been wanting it for years.  The GSM Association, GSMA, has global operators, Google and the GSMA, a line behind adoption of rich communication services.  Here's the press release out of Barcelona at a mobile world congress.  SMS is a very old technology and an antiquated technology that doesn't even handle rich media.  You have to use MMS for that.  So RCS would allow you to group chat.  Can't do that without mod.  That's why you use messages.  Apple messages, high resolution photo sharing, read receipts, video calling, perhaps.  And RCS could even continue to support SMS and MMS within it.  Google's working on a universal RCS client currently called Jive at Jive, J I B E dot Google dot com.  Yeah, you never know what's going to happen, but you can actually.  You know, can you download this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to think this is going to be a great thing because Google is going to put it on every Android phone.  It's not.  And it's, you know, every there's so many social networks now and so many people on different networks that it's really problematic again or still.  And it's great to have a central standard that does the kind of things that people want to do a messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's but if it's not adopted by Apple phones, then it won't be a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Apple's in its own world anyway.  Yeah, really.  Really? I mean, I guess it works with SMS.  So maybe Apple would if the carriers demanded that Apple would have to support it.  Right. If if you know, a carrier moved to RCS away from SMS, which I bet they would like to do, they'd have to support it.  It's data. It's data.  Not SMS is a weird technology.  It's not a data technology.  So I'm all for this one.  I think this is a really good idea, but we'll see.  You know, yeah, you're right.  You got this big Apple right now.  Android users are at a disadvantage when they communicate with Apple users.  Yeah, Apple users can create a group that Android people can't be in.  Right. You're a you're a green box instead of a blue box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My message is great.  And yes, unless you're on Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So I like this idea.  I think this is something Google and the operators are probably going to do.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should mention just very quickly that Digital News Initiative in Europe, Google gave away 27 million euros in grants to tons of publishers and independent people to do innovation only in Europe again, only in Europe, because they're the trouble.  They're the problem children, but they're trying to do so.  And Sundar Pichai gave a big speech in Paris today pushing AMP and the Digital News Initiative and Project Shield emphasizing how much they care about news and care about journalism.  And Sundar saluted that flag ably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in a completely unrelated story, a German court rejected a suit by publishers against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I missed this Friday.  If I'd seen this, I would have been tweeting all over.  It's kind of beautiful because they said, I love this part that while Google linking to people is a win win.  Yeah.  Imagine that.  This is the Axel Springer suit.  Yep.  I don't know where this sits in with the panoply of suits that have been going on.  So many.  Right.  Right.  But I find it absolutely fascinating.  Related ruling on whether publishers should receive payments from Google for displaying their news articles is still outstanding.  So I don't know where again, as I'm not sure where this one fits in.  Nonetheless, a judge said, are you fools?  Are you crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gee, that's so makes such sense.  Yeah.  I don't know if this is a big story or not.  Spotify chose Google's cloud over Amazon Web Services.  All of Spotify is now on Google servers, which I don't know.  Maybe this is the beginning of an acquisition, although why Google would buy Spotify?  I guess for the customers, right?  They're the biggest.  Google Play.  Yeah.  I mean, compare them over Google Play Music.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where was it before?  I mean, I saw it was on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was.  It was all on Amazon Web Services.  That's right.  So it's a big win.  Yeah.  Google is number three behind Amazon, Microsoft, Azure.  Not sure why they did it.  One of the Spotify vice president, Nicholas Harto, said Google's ability to analyze massive amounts of data tipped the scales.  They like the analytics.  That's where Google has the edge.  That's where we think they will continue to have the edge, Mr. Harto said, according to The Wall Street Journal.  It's funny.  It almost felt like Google had given up on cloud services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think they've been quietly pursuing it more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, we negotiated hard on price, said Mr. Harto.  It's free.  Whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where did I put this?  Oh, I put it in the number, but I don't care.  It's the first one.  Google's calling on drive manufacturers to rethink the three and a half inch drive that's used for the cloud.  Really?  And they're trying to get that to be more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They buy more drives probably than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Amazon, God knows.  Google does buy more than anybody.  It'd be interesting.  So what do they want?  More storage.  Well, if the story is they want, if they're three and a half inches, they want higher stacks so they're more efficient.  More drives.  Where was it here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, they can move.  They're big enough.  They could probably move the market a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google proposes taller drives than the standard one inch for three and a half disks and 15 millimeters for two and a half inch drives.  Taller drives allow more platters per disk, which adds capacity.  It amortizes the cost of packaging the printed circuit board and the driver motor actuator.  Given a fixed total capacity per disk, smaller disks can yield smaller seek distances and higher RPM due to platter stability and thus higher IOPs, but worse gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a standard form factor because you've got to fit them into your cases and your server racks.  And if Google says, we don't like that size, make them make them this size.  They probably buy enough drives.  They could move the market.  You think that'd be weird because then everybody else would have to redesign their their enclosures.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting if you go to the Clayton Christensen world, you know, it was all it was it was about the disruption was all about disk drive sizes and disk drive types.  And I was thinking about it as I saw this week was because consumers don't use disk drives anymore.  We are unaware of changes in the disk drive industry.  Really?  Yeah.  We're using SSD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We buy one drive every few years.  Right.  There are some changes, though.  I mean, I showed you that Samsung terabyte drive the size of a matchbook that I use.  I carry around in my purse.  And then now that that was another see a man purse is so different from a female purse.  They don't have terabytes of them.  They don't have terabytes in their purses.  Yeah, they got lipstick and things.  Now they're going to do they just released that that was the T1, the Samsung T1.  They've just released the Samsung T3.  It's two terabytes.  Same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Little problem is I'll lose that.  I bought it.  I bought a big thumb drive and I lost the damn thing.  Keep on losing them.  And now that I've got one that's a USB A versus C.  Yeah, and since I can do both, which is nice.  But it's so tiny.  It doesn't have a clip on it.  Use encryption.  I hope you use encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got nothing of note on it.  Oh, OK.  Believe me, Samsung ships with encryption built in.  And I made sure to keep.  First, I took it off.  Then I thought, what am I doing?  That's my whole life on that thing.  Yeah.  I want to I want you to have a good night's sleep.  So I'm not going to show you the nightmare inducing video of the robot.  No, yet.  First, I'm going to tell you about a mattress.  Then then smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why they pay him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to get a good night's sleep before you see this, because you will not be sleeping for some days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also might want to go to the mattresses against the robot army.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Casper, the best mattresses ever.  We're going to the mattresses.  Yeah.  I love that line in The Godfather.  I don't think The Godfather's mattresses were this good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how these mattresses do against shotgun blasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would have been great because they could have gotten them in those compact boxes.  They wouldn't have to like haul them on big trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much easier to go to the mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It comes they deliver it to you in that.  That's a queen size mattress in a box.  That's the size of my lower torso.  I don't know. I don't know.  I can't think of what that is.  That size is right there.  Free delivery.  And here's the best part.  Painless 100 day returns.  So if any time within the first hundred nights you decide this isn't for me, they come and they get it.  They return you every penny.  Because they want you to be happy and they know because they don't have a showroom.  They're say you're saving a lot of money.  You're shipping direct to you.  But they know you want some way to try it.  But I like the idea of having 100 days to decide.  These are beautiful mattresses.  Just the right sink and bounce.  They're firm but soft.  I don't know how they do it.  And they're cool.  Summer's coming soon.  I hope.  And you know those hot nights, you're going to be glad you have a Casper mattress.  They breathe.  They breathe.  They do some sort of open cell thing that really is nice.  They also, they smell great right out of the box.  Which is, I don't know if that matters to you, but it matters to me.  I love my Casper.  And many people do.  You should try it.  Also check out Casper's pillows.  I'm using Casper pillows now too.  I'm all Casper baby.  I'm all in on the Casper.  They have a dual layer pillow.  That is literally the most comfortable pillow.  It's big.  It's like a king's.  I guess maybe I got the king.  They have other sizes.  Because it is really, that's like a body pillow.  I got to get one of those.  I want to marry this pillow.  This pillow is, they do have a standard size.  This pillow is awesome.  And you know I used to think I had to have a feather pillow.  This is not.  And it's much better than my feather pillows.  It's also much more consistent.  You know the feather pillows get lumpy.  This is nice.  Casper's mattresses, made in the USA.  So you feel good about that.  You're buying direct from the factory.  They're nice guys.  And you're going to save too.  In fact you're going to save an additional 50 bucks.  Because you're listening to the show.  Go to casper.com slash twig.  Use the promo code twig.  And 50 bucks off any mattress.  Terms and conditions apply.  For details visit casper.com slash terms.  Starting at 500 bucks for a very nice mattress.  450 with the discount.  Casper.com slash twig.  Don't forget the offer code twig.  Alright you ready for a scary robot video?  This is from Boston Dynamics.  The company Google bought.  They made that scary dog.  Remember the dog?  But those dogs were like diesel engines.  And they were kind of noisy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Marine Corps turned them down because they said they're way too loud.  No way we're sneaking into some village.

Transcript:  This robot is electric?  All it sounds like is zzzzzz.  And untethered.  And untethered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are no strings on me according to the company.  Ladies and gentlemen I give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's his name?  Atlas.  Atlas.  The Boston Dynamics robot.  He's walking. He's bipedal.  Now you might say that's a lot of work to go to.  I mean you could just put it on wheels.  But they want robots that are like human.  Since it's the Fukushima nuclear plant.  Humans had to go in there and fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way notice the robot has a cod piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a cod piece.  That's a European carry-all.  Look at this.  He's stumbling.  He's stumbling but no.  This is snow.  He's walking through snow.  And the snow is even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But underneath the snow there's uneven ground.  And so he stumbles and recovers.  He's a little drunk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He had a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go home robot.  You're drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean okay.  Pretty impressive.  But imagine that coming at you.  Yeah.  Inextricably.  He's walking next to a fella.  You can see it's kind of normal human size.  Got arms and legs.  They're having a good talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to say look we're going to be abusing you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See here he is lifting boxes.  Putting them on the shelves.  Doing a pretty good job too.  So he could work in a warehouse.  Again warehouses are designed for humans.  So a human robot makes sense in some situations.  Not all.  Look at that.  Now okay fine.  You could put a box on a shelf.  If you just pick it up and put it on the shelf.  But what if you take the box.  If somebody with a hock.  Some schmuck with a hockey stick.  Knocks it out of your hands.  And then pushes you back.  That was mean.  Don't anger the robot.  He's been marked for deletion.  Look he's got the hockey stick.  He's sliding the box along.  He's clearly Canadian.  Yeah why a hockey stick.  Canadians would be too nice to do that.  That's Boston.  He's a Celtics fan or a Bruins fan.  So here's the question.  By the way notice the QR codes.  The robot readable codes on these boxes.  And you'll see too when it uses the door.  There's codes there.  So they have some sort of vision.  This is so mean.  He keeps moving it away from the robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah the hockey guy is trolling him hard.  By pushing it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey don't do that.  Oh he knocked him over.  That's just not nice.  He knocked him on his face.  He did a face plant on the concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the robot does what I think is reasonable.  Make sure you play it all the way to the end please Jason.  He leaps to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He gets up and he's like you know what.  I'm just going to keep on going.  I'm leaving.  I'm out of here.  He's opening a door.  I'd leave too.  The thing is okay just do you feel like the guy who knocked him over.  Just a little tiny part in the back of his mind is thinking I hope he doesn't get mad at me.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's going to be payback.  Robots never forget.  And when Skynet happens he's going to come back with his friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I even think he's just thinking like I know I wrote the software.  I know this thing isn't going to get mad.  It's just a program.  It's a robot.  It's just a machine.  But maybe not.  Maybe like because it could crush him.  Really.  Like you could just go wham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason can you pull up the new trailer for the new season of Silicon Valley.  HBO's Silicon Valley.  Oh is it back.  Yeah there's actually an Atlas reference in there.  There's actually a scene where Erlich kicks the big dog.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  There is.  I can search too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll show you this.  Apparently there's been a Twitter account set up by the Atlas robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big dog has told me what you've done.  Yes.  Using my OCR to read your ID I am close to getting your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They...  Boston Dynamics slash Google is really good at this recovery system where they knock them over, they kick them, they put them on...  It's hard to do for bipedal.  Very hard to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You understand why they're doing it because there are places that you need...  So here's Silicon Valley that you need the humans in there.  This is coming back.  This is the best show for people were into...  I'm lying.  For people were into technology because it was all in jokes written by people...  It's very sad.  Like the...  Ventriloquist dummy.  If I'm lying you look like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to be CEO of Pied Piper.  I think that's the only one.  This is my company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worked my ass off to build this company.  He kicks the dog.  He kicks the robot dog.  I deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's reindeer antlers on it.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you say to that?  Action.  Oh!  Ow!  You were standing at this.  What were you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you...  That's comedy my friends.  Go, go.  That is comedy.  Have you watched this show Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you a fan?  I'm behind.  It's one of those cases where I got behind and then I...  So yeah, I have been but I've got to catch up before it starts again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not hard.  It's only half an hour.  Yeah, I know.  It's only like nine episodes a season.  Yeah, it's really not much content compared to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm watching Fortitude now.  Have you watched Billions yet?  Same thing.  The problem is because I travel, the things that I can download through Google Play or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon...  Billions is...  But you still have to wait.  That's the problem.  I hate watching a show when it's still on.  I hate that because then I can't binge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen Scorpion?  No.  Good.  Have you seen a show about smart people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was called Big Bang Theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I learned something interesting about the show.  Hey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what the show is about is about a guy named Walter O'Brien whose IQ is 197.  He's like you, Leo.  He's got this enormous intellect.  And so he forms together this team of geniuses.  Really, I'm only 187.  Oh, you know, who's counting?  Give or take 10.  He puts together this team of geniuses and they help...  Oh yeah, I've seen the trailers.  Yeah, okay.  So here's what's interesting about it.  Walter O'Brien is a real person.  Scorpion is a real thing.  What?  They've existed for 25 years.  Doing what?  They are geniuses for hire.  There are 2,500 of them now.  They outsource this and they hire these super high IQ people.  So if you need anything done that requires the work of geniuses, they'll say,  okay, $5,000, we'll do it.  What?  They do all kinds of crazy stuff.  Now here's the craziest part about it.  Where did the show come from?  They expanded so much that they were having trouble hiring more geniuses.  Yeah, well there's a limited pool.  So they have this process for figuring out how to solve problems.  They applied that process to the problem of how do they get more geniuses,  and the solution was the TV show.  So they went to Hollywood and they said, okay, we want to do this.  It's all about hiring.  The TV show exists to help them hire.  No.  Yes.  So Walter O'Brien was a hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scorpion was his hacker.  And in fact, I think you should have a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I think you should have Walter O'Brien on triangulation.  I will because he probably wants to hire some people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have smart people watching this show.  Absolutely.  I'm sure that's why he did it.  Okay, get on it.  Get on it, somebody.  So smart people, can I ask you a question?  Otherwise I'm hiring a scorpion.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a corvette.  No.  I'm just saying.  There's no port on a corvette.  It's a dumb show.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do.  They did this.  It's like Gilligan's Island.  Because they're geniuses, they calculate these things even in the absence of data.  So there's a rock slide.  It's like according to those 97% chance that this is going to ... based on what?  You don't know anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a little bit of a prejudice against people who claim they're geniuses.  Mensa.  Like if somebody says, I'm in Mensa, I go, yeah, well, nice.  That's nice for you.  Good luck with that crossword puzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mensa is for people who are insecure about their genius.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got a question.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yes.  Oh, Mensa guys.  So as you know, my Pixel C died.  Yes.  Horrible death.  Sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a new one.  It's wonderful.  Thank you very much.  Now you made me nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  It really went over the edge.  Can't start.  So then, here's the other problem.  So then I tried to use my phone and I went out of town with my new Pixel C. So I tried  to download movies for the plane onto my phone and said, oh, five devices.  I can't find any place where I can tell Google to ignore the old device, which I couldn't  clear, because it died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody know how to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to call somebody at Google and get on a white list.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really annoying.  So you have to do that every time you buy 87 Android things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so I was able to get some ... I complained about it.  Yeah.  Because I think you have to wait.  There's a period.  There's a waiting period.  And this, by the way, isn't Google's fault.  This is the music industry.  They do all of this shenanigans to keep you, because they have some notion that you're  going to give it to your friends and let them use it for a day and then deauthorize them  and use it again yourself or something.  I don't know what they're thinking.  Five devices is five devices.  If I want to deauthorize every day, I should be able to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not how it works.  I don't even see any place to deauthorize.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to go online.  Oh, I should try that some day.  You can.  Manage devices.  Just Google manage ...  I can't find it.  Google manage devices.  But the problem is that there's limits on how you can do it.  It's maybe Android device manager.  No, that's not it.  There's a way to do it.  I'll find it for you after the show.  But I was complaining about this.  And somebody from Google sent me a note saying, yeah, you'd use a lot of devices.  We can whitelist you.  We can whitelist you.  So you can ask them to get on the specialist.  But that's not a solution for the rest of the world.  But we're in an unusual situation.  I'm in an unusual situation.  I've got a new phone every few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Manage devices is the Android thing where you can have ...  No, my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's google.com.  No, that's not it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's the Android device manager.  Yeah, accounts.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah.  Or does that get you into the device manager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll stop talking about this.  Nobody in the rest of the world cares about this.  But everything I got was from Google Music, not from Google Play.  Oh, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open your web browser.  Navigate to the Google Play Store.  Click the gear button in the top right corner of the screen.  Select Settings.  Right.  Right.  No, that's from the store.  Never mind.  Oh, right.  How to deauthorize Google Play music devices.  That's what we want, right?  Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want music.  No, I don't want music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want Google Play.  It's different.  Oh, yeah, because you have Google Play music on 10 different devices.  Right.  I've got shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want shows.  On Play.  And that's where I cannot find it anywhere.  Oh.  Am I the only guy who uses Google Play that much?  It's never come up before.  You're it, Jarvis.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google smacked you.  I'm sure somebody will get a hold of you.  I thought you were talking about music.  You're talking about TV.  TV?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other problem was, so I had, I'm watching Fortitude, which is really amazingly weird.  Arctic.  I love Arctic things.  And I had some episodes on Amazon on there.  But once they're downloaded on one device, you cannot download any other device.  Hello, Amazon.  It's dead now.  Sorry, man.  You're right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's not their fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the stupid Hollywood.  It's Hollywood.  So a lot of new devices at Mobile World Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Robert Balancer is there doing our coverage.  You can watch live feeds all day every day.  And we've got the specials online at twit.tv slash specials.  Let's start with the first device I think announced, which was the LG G5 phone.  I'm sure that they talked about.  I think I know they talked about this and all about Android yesterday.  All the phones.  The G5's of G4 was a very popular phone with an excellent camera.  Apparently they've done something kind of interesting.  They've got these phones are now modular, which means you can do the hand jive even better.  The bottom snaps off.  There's a button so you can swap batteries, but you can also swap what you put in there.  So there's a camera cartridge that gives you a big battery, 4000 milliamp hour battery,  and a dedicated camera button and a dedicated zoom.  Although I think it's still optical or a digital zoom.  So big deal.  Yeah, sure.  There's also a hi-fi module that they did with B&O that gives you a high res music playback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you actually get a headphone jack unless you have that module in.  Is that correct?  I think that's true.  I didn't hear that part.  Don't quote me on that until we can establish that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be weird.  They also have two cameras on the back, one with kind of a normal 78 degree angle,  one with 135 degree angle, which means you get very wide.  That's kind of nice.  I mean, one of the issues really, the only issue I think with using a camera phone,  the cameras have gotten so good, is zoom.  Right?  Is the ability to zoom in and then there's unaccountably a woman with a beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's the cool thing about the zoom wheel is instead of tapping the screen to zoom in,  you can just scroll that wheel to zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's digital zoom, which means all you're doing is blowing up the pixels.  Right, but it's a smooth, when you have that many pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's smoother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a higher res.  This is problematic.  I mean, essentially, conceptually what they're doing is they have a module to improve photography.  But photography is already so great.  How many people are going to, how much better is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's bulky and it's a big bump.  The other thing both Samsung with its new galaxies and LG with the G5 are doing is an always on display,  which I like.  These new OLED displays are so efficient that they can keep time or a calendar or something always on the screen at all times.  Not when you tap it or wave your hand over, but at all times.  LG says it only reduces battery life by 0.8% an hour.  So that's a great feature.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Samsung had, LG announced one other thing we should probably mention, which is its VR.  Finally has its own VR solution, which looks like those goggles, the steampunk goggles.  Opera glasses.  Yeah, and they have a, the steampunk goggles have their own screens.  So you use the type C cable to connect the phone.  Yeah.  And that way they're lighter.  They're a little easier to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you not like the looks of them?  I mean, I think.  No, they look great.  They look better than the visor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Is there a picture?  Let me see if I can find one.  They've also announced a 360 degree camera that looks a lot, frankly, like the Ricoh Theta S.  Everybody's doing this now.  It's kind of amazing.  Here's a picture of the 360 VR visor.  You look more like data from Star Trek than you look like one of those.  It was a lot lighter.  Boston MX, robots.  Yeah, it's a lot lighter.  I think that's a good idea.  Well, then along comes Samsung and they announce, of course, the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge 5.1, 5.5 inches, respectively.  Looks like an amazing camera on these new phones.  So one F1.7, which is very fast.  They reduced the number of pixels from 16 to 12 number of megapixels.  And they say that's so we can give you bigger megapixels.  So that plus the high F stop mean much better low light performance, much better focusing too, because every pixel of the 12 is able to do phase detection.  So apparently the focusing is very quick.  So a good low light camera that can focus fast.  That's good.  Optical images stabilization is available.  So these are this is two really excellent phones.  These two were kind of the best phones of last best Android phones of last year.  So I'll be looking forward to it.  I got, though, the new Robin and I'll talk about that as my pick of the week in just a little bit.  Also, Samsung announced a 360 degree camera that announced pricing, but theirs looks pretty good.  It's two lenses.  Why more to use for tripods and stuff than carry it around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's better. You don't want your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I realize with the theta, your hand is not you shouldn't have it in the picture.  You want to put that on a tripod.  They do. You can't hold the tripod or monopod on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And conceptually, it's similar to the Ricoh Theta with two lenses and same idea.  12 or whatever.  Stitch together in real time.  Yeah, I'd love to see that.  I'd love to see that built into a smartphone.  I would buy that smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they pitched was interesting is it does.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy, I presume S7, but I don't know.  If you have a Samsung Galaxy, you can link it to that and then the Galaxy in real time will see it.  In fact, you could put the Galaxy in the VR headset and watch in, it looked like real time as your friends are streaming 360 degree video of their visit to Barcelona.  You could be at home looking around, looking up, looking down.  If that's the case, I'm buying that right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could mount it to your helmet and then you could see as you're walking around through the goggles.  Would that be awesome?  Yeah, you could see the sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then I don't even need to use my eyes.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never have to take off the goggles, Jason.  To heck with reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go virtual reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, the SD card is back, baby, which is nice.  That was something Samsung got last year, much to people's dismay.  Only 32 gigs in the US, so you can need the SD card of storage.  Then they also brought back waterproof or water resistant IP68.  Bigger battery too.  Why don't people carry more of that water proof?  Yeah, big battery.  I don't know.  I think it's a great feature.  I ask that too.  You like it.  You drop the phone in the toilet a lot?  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if it goes in the toilet, we're going to have to figure out what to do.  No, but I just think it's a great feature.  You could wash it off.  It's easy enough, it seems, for these companies to make things waterproof.  Water can be fatal to a phone.  It's just a nice ... Rain, there's a lot of reasons why you could get water on your phone.  You can drop it into the whatever, into the ocean.  I like that feature.  I just think all phones ought to be waterproof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Plus was updated.  Google Plus is also waterproof.  Okay, the parade of celebrities quitting Twitter is growing longer by one.  Steven Fry quit last week.  Adam Baldwin, I don't even know who that is, is quitting for good because Twitter is censoring conservatives.  Buddy.  He is in the TNT hit show.  It says so right here.  The last ship.  He's got a very muscular, manly, kind of conservative body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it has to be said that Steven Fry's farewell note to Twitter was really hilarious.  Of course, everything Steven Fry does is hilarious.  The headline was, too many people have peed in the pool.  He goes on from there.  I don't blame him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't blame him.  But I, for one, despite wanting to quit Twitter, I was, by the way, I just want to point out I was the first person to quit Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I've quit Twitter more often than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe, but I quit in 2007.  I don't think anybody quits sooner than that.  But at this point, Twitter is what Twitter is.  I still love it.  I can't leave you.  I'm wearing my Twitter patch.  It's kind of indispensable.  Are you wearing a patch?  That might help.  It is because that's how you know what's going on.  You just go to Twitter.  I keep a tweet deck running on one screen on my desk all day.  But I don't know how people live with one account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one account for incoming and one account for outgoing, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you wrote an article on that.  Highly recommended it at the time, and I recommend people still read it.  It was Datamation.  Where did you write that for?  I don't recall.  It was an unusual magazine, wasn't it?  One of your regulars.  But just Google Mike Elgin, multiple Twitterers.  That one was actually crazier than the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That one required three Twitter accounts.  That's right.  You've narrowed it down.  Right.  I have a Twitter account where I put content that isn't on Twitter and turn it into Twitter  content and then I subscribe to that feed so it shows up in my Twitter account.  For example, there are multiple ways to turn Google Alerts into tweets.  It's for Baseline magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Baseline magazine, that's what it was.  How you know what you need to know all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the technique that I use, and it's really fantastic.  You can take Reddit content and turn it into an RSS feed, then take the RSS feed and turn  it into a Twitter feed, and then you have the end result.  It's convoluted.  If I read this article, would I know how?  Yes, it's specific, step-by-step on how to do that.  But the end result is one feed, one Twitter feed.  I'm using, you can use TweetDeck or any number of other services to make it automatically  feed.  I wish Twitter would keep TweetDeck up to date and understand what they're doing.  My feed has become a thing of beauty.  Then you add Google Alerts to it.  Google Alerts, you can add, there's all kinds.  You can use IFTTT to turn just about any RSS feed into ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IFTTT and Zappi and Google Alerts are all very useful ways to make your ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's something people to try.  I don't think a lot of people know how to do this, but go to your favorite Reddit subreddit.  At the very end, make sure there's a forward slash.  Put .RSS at the end, and that's an RSS feed.  That's all you have to do.  Once you have an RSS feed, you can do all kinds of magic stuff with that.  This is just one of those things you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, are you up for this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's too busy quitting Twitter.  No, I don't quit Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need an end service mic.  You just come here, we'll do a little show.  How many people have you blocked?  Oh, many.  No, actually, I stopped blocking.  You know what I do now?  Don't tell anybody this is my secret.  I mute them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, so they don't know that you've blocked them.  Yeah, because they know if you've blocked them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you mute them, they just keep nattering on without ...  Well, the knowledge that you've blocked them is ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's success.  ... constitutes getting a rise out of you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, muting is great, because basically ...  I can mute kind of liberally, because I just go ...  It's not necessarily even a negative.  It's just I don't want that in my feed.  I'm trying to refine my feed to make it more useful.  And it's very nice.  I have a very nice feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've come to a new place with trolling and haters,  and in the case of Stephen Fry with politically crep mobs,  that's his main beef, which is that it's so universal  that there's literally nobody who has any sort of public presence on Twitter  doesn't get seriously harassed.  And you see celebrities reading mean tweets on Jimmy Kimmel, I think it is.  Hilarious, but the point is that it's just become a kind of background noise now.  I think that to leave Twitter because of trolls or whatever, it doesn't matter.  They're still going to attack your name on Twitter, whether you're there or not.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So whether you're there or not.  Somebody like Stephen ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody was mad about something Stephen Fry said on TV.  Where are they going to say it? On Twitter.  So the people who are harassing him about that don't even care that he's on Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Margaret Sullivan, who we love as the public ...  What do they call her? The public editor of the New York Times.  She's the one who, when the New York Times screws up, which it does fairly frequently,  goes to the reporter and says, what did you do?  And then writes about it.  And it's kind of the old concept of an ombudsman.  She just brought it to a whole new level.  She did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And brought a tremendous intelligence to learning the lessons about journalism in broader ways.  She also took the times to task for its anonymous sources and other things.  But tremendous respect. Just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think raised the level, the quality of journalism at the New York Times,  which is kind of a big statement given that those are in theory the best journalists in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Margaret was the longtime editor of the Buffalo Evening News.  Really?  Or is it Evening News, but Buffalo ...  Interesting.  Buffalo Paper.  She's got a new job.  Yeah, she does.  Where does she go?  She's the new media writer at the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to feel like this is almost Jeff Bezos poaching somebody from his arch-ride.  Well, yeah, it is. It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think that David Carr, may he rest in peace, was the media writer at the New York Times.  And he, as we know, passed away about a year ago.  Great one.  And Jim Rutenberg has been named as his replacement.  Margaret would have been ... Margaret, I think, is ...  And they say nothing against Jim, but Margaret, I think, was the heir to David Carr and writing about media.  But she couldn't work for the New York Times.  Because it would have been a revolving door for the ombudsman to say,  Oh, you know what? I think I might want a job there someday. You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if she wanted a normal job at the time, she couldn't do it.  She'd have to go somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Yeah, because you're making yourself suspect in your motives.  Is it hard to be the public editor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was there three and a half years, which they say is longer than anyone else.  It is. It is hard.  Because the people you work with hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the newsroom ... you know, the newsroom ...  You're their man.  ... growl as you pass.  Right.  And you've got to deal with the other things.  I think none of them say, none of them says, what I think has really got to be hard  is dealing with all the crazies out there who want to complain.  You can imagine how many 9-11 truth or emails she gets.  And somebody has to deal with them and say, well, no, actually, I don't think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She did a very nice job of not being a nanny, not being a scold,  but of really kind of teasing out ... like that story that Times wrote,  which was a wonderful story about the guy who kind of died alone.  And then they went back through it.  And the reporter had been working on it like a year.  And I read it and I felt a little queasy about the privacy violation and everything,  but it wasn't completely ... it wasn't cut and dried.  And I thought she did a great job when she wrote a whole column about it,  teasing out both sides of it and talking to the reporter about it.  I thought it was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, when they did their big Amazon expose, I suppose, at least she came back.  I was among those who said, I think it went overboard.  And she came and looked at it and said, well, there's a point there that it's overboard  and another point that's there.  But she would come down to conclusions.  She would make tough rulings from the bench.  She scolded the New York Times many times.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  But she'd also tell readers, when knows you're wrong, the Times did this right.  Just really, really intelligent, really nice person, really smart about the business,  about journalism.  And so I'm delighted that she stays as a voice in writing about journalism and media.  I congratulate The Washington Post for getting her.  I think it's too bad that she couldn't be David's heir, but I understand why.  So it's not a bad outcome at all, except that she's kind of a neighbor in New York  and I don't want her in Washington.  I want her in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if she has to go to Washington.  If you're going to cover pop culture, I think you'd probably do a better job in New York  than in Washington.  I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get her a Pixel C. She can do it from home.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to do a weekly column related to digital media  and how that transformation is affecting people's lives and works.  That's interesting.  That'll be, you know, couldn't think of a better person to do it.  She's a very nice writer and she will be moving to D.C.  You're right.  Tragic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, did you read an article about TMZ in The New Yorker this week?  No, no, I'm not as classy as you as you might read in The New Yorker all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read an article about The New Yorker and TMZ.  Is that counted?  Yes, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes either way.  It's called The Digital Dirt and it's about TMZ.  It's about Harvey Levine and why they do what they do, where he came from.  It's fascinating.  I will read it.  And it made me kind of a TMZ fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I watch Harvey Levine as he talks to his bullpen of gossip columnists on TV  and I find it quite engaging even though the content makes me feel dirty.  It's really well done.  You know, is he not a journalist in the British style, the kind of Nick Denton style of the muckraker?  Is that kind of where he comes from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the most controversial thing he does is that they buy stories.  They pay for it.  But beyond that, he's different from a tabloid in that they actually dig up facts.  They actually get hard evidence and their stories are based on hard evidence.  So in a nutshell, where he comes from is his dad was owned a liquor store or something when he was growing up.  He grew up in LA.  And his dad was part of this witch hunt by local police over underage purchasing of liquor.  Meanwhile, there were similar stories in the news about these posh clubs of celebrity underage drinkers  that nobody was doing anything about.  And he realized and got a chip on his shoulder early in his life about a double standard between celebrities and the public.  And he's always been obsessed about bringing celebrities down to everybody else's level.  Oh, dear.  He's kind of a bit of a crusader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not my favorite guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but in Hollywood, it's kind of an interesting thing because he noticed, for example,  he's the guy where TMZ broke the, what's his name, the guy who...  OJ Simpson?  No, no, the anti-Semitic rant by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, Mad Max.  Mad Max.  Yeah, why can't I think of his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they broke that story.  And what happened was, the story was originally he heard that this event took place where he's going on this rant  and cussing out the police and all this stuff.  And when he went to investigate it, there was this huge...  Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson, thank you.  There was a huge cover up by the police.  They literally lied to him and said, no, that never happened.  He never said those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As they should, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so when he finally got the hard evidence of...  They had a whole transcript of everything he said.  When they got the hard evidence, that's now two stories.  One is Mel Gibson is a raving lunatic.  Number two, the police routinely in LA do cover ups for celebrities, which they would never do for non-celebrities.  And if you're watching The People vs. OJ Simpson...  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see this in The People vs. OJ Simpson.  The police were dying to give OJ Simpson a pass because they were buddies.  He's the juice.  He's the juice.  Anyway, so the article is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, another great show you got to watch, Jeff.  Add that to your list.  American Crime Story.  People vs. OJ Simpson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really good.  The casting is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the casting is great.  John Travolta is hysterical.  It's Robert Shapiro.  But what's good about it is we all know that we lived through...  Those of us of a certain age lived through it.  And so you go, oh, there's Marcia Clark.  Oh, the Kardashian girls when they were 12.  It's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a scene in there where Robert Kardashian is lecturing his kids in a restaurant and  saying, we're Kardashians.  Fame means nothing to us.  It's all about having a good heart.  And that's not about fame.  Fame doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of tongue in cheek, like, look ahead, look back, things like that.  The girls are watching themselves, you know, their father on TV and they're shouting his  name.  It's really...  Because you know what's going to happen to them that makes it all the more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a great cautionary tale about the media because you see the Marcia Clarks of  the world realize the incredible power of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in fact, she's in vain.  She says, I won't use a witness that's been paid by state channels like TMZ for their  story.  I can't use them.  But the problem is they all did.  Right.  Brilliant.  Breaking news.  Yes.  Just in.  This just in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just as in...  Mark Andreessen has tweeted again.  Oh, dear.  Oh, no.  He's back.  Just to promote a new hire on the team.  But he's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's easing in.  Slowly.  He's insulting China this time.  Yes.  He's slowly easing in.  I'm sad to say, I read this this morning, we've often recommended a company called Slysoft.  They made a very good Blu-ray DVD ripper called AnyDVD.  They were in Antigua.  They had to be because if you were in the United States, of course, making Blu-ray ripping  software, you'd be out of business very quickly.  Well, apparently there is nowhere safe from the Motion Picture Association of America.  And for those of you making archival copies of your Blu-ray DVDs that you bought legitimately,  Slysoft is no more.  The website has been shut down.  AnyDVD is no longer for sale.  According to TorrentFreak, the action came several days after a group of Hollywood studios  and technology partners asked the U.S. government to intervene.  If you go to the website, Slysoft.com, it says, due to recent regulatory requirements,  we have had to cease all activities relating to Slysoft.  We wish to thank our loyal customers, clients for their patronage over the years.  They had been brought to court in Antigua.  And in fact, the local court found the owner Giancarlo Bettini guilty of violating the Copyright Act  a whole six times, and he had to pay $5,000 for each offense.  That's $30,000.  That didn't really slow him down, I guess.  So anyway, he was breaking the law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  And I guess because of treaties, even Antigua and Barbuda are signatories to the convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there you go.  But if you can't break U.S. law in the Caribbean, where can you?  Where can you?  I mean, what's the world coming to?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon they'll be going after my Canary Island funds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First Swiss banks started obeying the law, and now this.  Shocking.  Next thing you know, Facebook and Apple have to pay taxes.  It's an outrage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know that Google employees may receive prophylactics with the slogan,  I'm feeling lucky on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This feels like something for Snopes, but it's on Business Insider.  It's not safe in April 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, why not?  Don't be evil.  First of all, good on Google for putting a hand in them out.  Why not?  Great.  It's contraception, prevents transmission of STDs or helps.  They've been doing it for six years, it says here.  And if you're going to have a condom that's made by Google,  what better name than I'm feeling lucky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And colors, primary colors.  Google colors.  Google colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they are.  They're Google colors.  Missed that.  It's not easy being green.  Missed that.  All right.  We're going to wrap it up right after this.  Watson.  Watson.  Do you want to talk about Watson real quick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went on a Watson Festival on the rundown.  I see quite a few Watson stories.  What is Watson?  Well, you remember all we were.  Watson is IBM's super smart, jeopardy-winning computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see John Markoff's great New York Times article  where they talked about the different voices  that they were considering for Watson?  I didn't see that.  Including the creepy kid's voice.  I guess Markoff has a new book about this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, well, David Kenny, who sold the Weather Channel to IBM  for Watson use, is now the head of Watson.  And David was ex-president of Akamai,  ex-big mockety-mockety ad publicist, the ad agency.  David's got an amazing career all around.  So he's just Facebooking, linking all kinds of great stuff.  So I just thought it was Watson is going to be used  by a dating service to try to give you the right date.  Watson knows when you're sad from your writing.  Watson is now being used.  They're offering it up as a service for customer service  and understanding all the connections with your customers,  which means you better have them.  And finally, to just scare the heck out of journalists,  Watson's going to writing headlines.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how do you feel about machine intelligence being applied  to any sort of journalism job?  Jeff, I mean, obviously there are sports  and also financial news stories that are written entirely  by computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As I've been fond of saying, articles are just another form  of data visualization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  And I tend to think that anything that can be done by a machine  as well or better than a human ought to be  because that basically indicates that the human,  after you realize that, doing that job,  will be functioning as a machine.  So that's not good either.  So I'll be curious to see what they do.  Although when Watson was acting as a chef  and inventing new recipes, I find that highly suspicious.  Delicious.  Chocolate burritos and like weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that would...  The other thing I don't like about this is it personifies machines,  which I'm against.  Because the anthropomorphization of machines...  Well, just like the robots.  ...is what makes it creepy.  If they're just machines, they're not creepy.  And I don't think there's like a box that's Watson,  like there's Watson.  It's like a lot of...  It's a division of IBM.  It's not a computer, it's a division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, but Mike, back to your point.  Answer me this, both of you.  Because I've been trying to think about this through.  If you were going to utilize...  And I emailed Kenny when he got the job and said,  I want to talk to him about this at some point.  If you utilized artificial intelligence for journalism,  what would that mean to you?  How could artificial intelligence be used?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, have computers been writing sports articles for years?  That's one. Yes, they have, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that's easy. It's very formulaic.  It's data visualization.  I mean, when I said it, you're taking a box score  and you're making it readable to our brain.  But how, in terms of investigation  and finding anomalies,  using new sources of data...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Investigative journalism, I think,  would be killer for that because essentially,  imagine if you had an artificial intelligence agent  and you have a story where you're working on this thing.  And for that to pursue,  everybody mentioned in the story  all the facts, all the companies,  find linkages, find...  Go see where the public information is available.  And then come back to you and say,  okay, you need to request these documents  under the Freedom of Information Act.  You need to call this person because this person knows  three of these people for some reason.  You need to find out why they're all connected.  You know, that sort of thing to basically  function as a chess computer functions  and see and pursue all of the avenues  to see where they kind of lead.  I think that would be extremely valuable  because reporters these days just don't have...  Usually don't have the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to recommend a really good book.  I think it's going to be the authors of it on Monday  on triangulation.  It's called The Future of Professions,  Richard Susskind and Daniel Susskind.  How technology will transform the work of human experts.  And it really...  We talked about these exact issues.  Like where is the line? What can a computer do?  What does expertise mean?  What is the human expertise  versus machine expertise?  And the book...  This is actually quite a scholarly book.  It's not a popular science book.  It's from Oxford University Press.  And it's very interesting.  There are some really good issues.  It was, I thought, a fascinating conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this feeds in beautifully to my pick this week.  Good. Well, we'll get to that in a moment.  By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the answers might surprise you in this book.  In other words,  machines can do a lot more  maybe than we would like to give them credit for  along these lines.  Our show today brought to you by those good folks  at Zip Recruiter.  Zip Recruiter, we love this company. We've used this company.  You can post to 100 plus job sites  including social networks  with a single click of the mouse.  So you're going to reach the largest audience.  And you know, the more people your job posting reaches,  the more likely you're going to find that exact right person  for your new employee.  And that is so important.  The people who are your company  are your company. It's made of people.  And a great person can bring your company up.  A bad person can bring your company down.  So you want to get this  great employee in.  Of course, the problem is,  you're doing it yourself. You're doing it probably at a time when you're short-handed.  This is why I love Zip Recruiter.  You also will get instantly matched  to, I think they have like  six million current resumes  in their database.  So literally, within the first day, you're going to get a bunch of applicants.  Now, here's the good news.  They don't come to your inbox.  And they don't call you.  They go into Zip Recruiter's interface.  So you can quickly screen them and rate them  and find the right person fast.  So you reach the biggest audience.  You've got tools to handle  the applications.  And you're going to hire somebody within just a few days.  And you're going to hire the right person.  We got an email from a listener named Dan.  He's been using Zip Recruiter.  He said, the hardest part about running  a business when you need to hire is that you have to spend extra time  recruiting when you're short-staffed.  But with Zip Recruiter, I've gotten  quality candidates within 24 hours  of posting a job.  Zip Recruiter's website makes this process so much faster  by letting me manage candidates  in one place.  I hope that  you've heard me  and you're going to try this.  Because if you're in charge of hiring, this is a lifesaver.  We've used it for over 400,000  businesses have used it.  And I want you to try it right now, free for the next four days.  Go to ziprecruiter.com  slash twig.  Ziprecruiter.com  slash twig.  And you get to try it free.  I think you're going to like it.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  What was that pick of the week, Mr. Mike Elgin?  Okay, well the pick of the week is  a service called

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  x.ai.  And this is a service  that uses a  Siri-like artificial intelligence  agent to schedule meetings.  Now this is  you can look at virtual  assistance in two categories.  One is the all purpose kind,  Siri, Google Now, Cortana, etc.  And the other are verticals.  These verticals are much better at doing  the one thing than the all purpose  ones are. So for scheduling meetings,  there's nothing even close to  x.ai. The virtual assistant  is named Amy or Andrew, depending on  which gender you want.  And they're going to allow you to pick any name that you want.  But essentially, it's going to cost  nine bucks a month. And what I  encourage everybody to do today is get on their  list. There's a wait list on this thing. It's still in  beta. They  go public later this year.  And this looks really cool. But when it's in beta,  they'll take care of it. Have you used it?  I've used it on the  I'm signed up for the beta, but I've used it  to actually, I've interviewed the CEO a couple  days ago. Oh, neat. And to schedule that  Oh, yeah, of course he's using it.  He's using it. And so what you do  is let's say, let's say I want to meet with you  so I send you an email and you're a user.  You simply reply to me and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  copy Amy. So here's an example.  Mary writes to Greg, it was nice to meet you.  Do you have time for coffee? I'd like to talk.  Greg sends a response to  Mary, but CCing Amy.  Sure, Mary. And then says, Amy, can you find  30 minutes for coffee in my office? Cheers, Greg.  Then Amy, now does Amy act like a bot or does she?  It's just like a person.  Most of the people who are on the recipient side

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet it is a human.  I bet it is a human.  And they have all this data about people asking her out and sending flowers.  Amy, you're cute.  So basically it goes back and forth  and if you reschedule the meeting  the software will take care of that  and it learns your particular  like for example in your case  you don't want to schedule meetings for Thursday and Friday  and so  or Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday  or after a certain hours  or when you're doing a show.  Probably not Sunday either, yeah.  So it will learn all of the times when you can't do  and so over time it's sort of like  constantly learning and just about everybody I've talked to  who uses  x.ai says it's just amazing.  They don't even have to think about meetings anymore.  It's just all handled behind the scenes.  And so again  what I recommend that everybody do  whether you think you're going to use it or not  is just sign up because it's going to be a little while before  you get to the point where you could use it.  And once you do get to the top of the class  I think it's a month free.  So you'll be able to try it.  You're going to forgive me for being skeptical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I just read the article about  Xanafits and the fact that  while it looked like it was all automated  they had all these people in a sweatshop in the back  doing all the hard work.  This is really good computer or is there a human involved?  Okay so I talked to Dennis Mortenson about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the CEO and he  they're working toward  total automation.  Because a computer is not that smart.  What they're doing, but they're using  people to train it.  So they don't actually see the emails.  They see data.  So they see what the replies are to their data  and they go and tweak it and they do various things.  And then  but they claim that  probably by the end of the year it will be  100% automated.  And again they're always working toward that.  But yes, it's not like Facebook M  which actually has people.  That's real humans, yeah.  Depending on the query.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Human supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're going for this  super automated process.  And I think it's brilliant that they have this  virtual assistant living in email.  Because it lowers your expectations about the speeds.  If you ask something of Siri  and you don't get a reply  in a quarter of a second, you're like, oh this is terrible.  I can't do this.  But if you send an email, if you get that email  in like 10 minutes or whatever, that's fine.  And so  it's just, it's like having a personal assistant  handling your meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it. I'm signing up.  I can do that many meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have Amy reject people.  So I just signed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and if you want to jump the line  I'm in group 150.  You tweet it?  You tweet it and you can move up.  So move up three groups,  one per share, move up ten groups, two per  for referrals. So folks if you see my tweet  and sign in, I'll move up.  Oh good, I'll sign up through your referral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  X.ai, by the way,  superb URL.  Yeah.  Very nice. Nice job.  Your number of the week,  Mr. J.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go with the amazing Jorge Ramos  who has been using Facebook Live  like crazy from, mainly from the primaries.  But just been going on.  David Folkenflick  at NPR just wrote  a story about him  doing this. And they're kind of amazed  that he spends sometimes 45 minutes  or an hour on video.  Try twig.  But on  the night of the Iowa caucuses  he was viewed by 2.6 million people  in New Hampshire.  They did three videos, totaled 75 minutes,  viewed total 4 million times.  That's beaten cable audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately,  these Facebook numbers where the minute the video  starts, you're counted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  I don't know how live is counted  versus other videos.  It's a really interesting question.  So I don't know who the numbers are and all that.  But he is gaining, even if the numbers  are specious,  all numbers are, he's gaining  new audience. We got to try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're doing exactly what he is.  He's streaming as he sets up  and shoots and comes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do that all the time.  That's what this show is.  Tape a phone to the camera.  I remember that Ramos was the guy who challenged  Trump and Trump kicked him out  and then he came back.  He's made huge branding efforts.  He's a fascinating guy because at Univision  he is the  anchor of  Noticiero Univision.  He's on every night on their newscast.  On Sundays on their public affairs show called Al Punto.  Then he's also  the anchor of the weekly news magazine America  on Fusion.  Fusion, neat people,  they're not seeing that much.  I keep waiting for them to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  come out.  Like what's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got to do more of this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. Also the Guardian  just did an experiment for the Westminster  dog show and they tried,  I don't know what the results were, but they tried  Periscope versus Facebook Live.  So media companies are trying this now.  Facebook Live is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what Mashable does is they do  Periscope and Meerkat at the same time.  Why not just tape three phones  and just prop it up there  and let them all roll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more audience. Otherwise speaking of news apps,  have you guys tried the new Quartz app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's absolutely. Yeah, I have.  It's funny. Yeah, it is funny.  They say on Android it's coming. We showed it on iOS  today on Monday.  It's effectively an app with a chat  interface. So you're chatting with a  news bot and it says, well, here's  story one. What do you think?  And then you could say, yeah, tell me more or  no, that's enough. Next.  And you have a conversation six stories later.  They go, that's all there is today. See you tomorrow.  And I have to think  it's a trial, not for an app, but  for a news bot.  I would think so. Well, I make an app.  You can just do that and make a bot that you can  join with Messenger.  They can add ads and stuff like that.  They do. They have lots of ads.  I think it's interesting.  I kind of like it. I don't find myself  going to it regularly.  But I use news differently. I'm looking for  a way to share it. If I see a story I want to talk  about, that kind of thing. This is just  kind of more like if you're lonely,  you can chat with your news bot.

Transcript:  Well, there's a  bot in China  that Microsoft makes called Xiao Ice.  I think we've all heard of it, which is  for interacting just for the sake  of it. And I can't talk  about what I've learned  recently, but there are some of those coming  to the English language world  and to the US. I'm ready. Because I'm a lonely  person. It's just, you know,  people are overrated. It's nice to talk to a machine  once in a while. As long as I don't

Transcript:  push them and they come after me. Well, Amy's  coming. Amy's here.  I don't have much time. We've got to run.  We're way late. What a  shock. But I'll just mention  I got the next bit. Robin, this was a  Kickstarter. Kind of  a pretty good pedigree  on this phone. Next bit  was founded by... Looked like an arm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  processor there for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very clever.  Very clever.  Was founded by former head of  design at HTC.  In fact, you can see some of the HTC  pieces in this.  And then one of the  folks who started  Android, I think was early  on Android. I'll have to  look. But it's, by the way,  you may look at this and say, Robin's Egg Blue, but they have a black  or midnight blue  version. The point is, it's relatively  inexpensive.  It's $399 out  the door, unlocked.  It has some very nice features.  I love the screen. It's  kind of an interesting feel. And you felt it,  Mike. Yeah, it's cool. It's pretty  interesting. It's soft,  kind of touchy plastic.  I might have it for long enough to try  the camera and so forth. It's got front-facing  speakers like the HTC One.  I like that. I just feel like it's a nice  looking phone. USB  Type-C connector on the bottom. But here's  the secret sauce, which I don't really know  if this makes any sense  at all. It only has 32  gigabytes of only, 32 gigabytes  of storage, which for most people would probably be enough.  So what it does is offload  apps that you don't use much to  their free cloud storage.  And if you need  the app, you tap it and then it downloads it.  You'll see lights on the back. There's a little  cloud on the back to show you. So it's  periodically looking at what you do with your phone  and then how you use it. And then  if you don't need that app, it'll  just move it off your phone. It comes with  its own launcher, which I'm not crazy about, but there's  no reason you have to use their launcher.  Although  the compelling reason to use their  launcher is if an app is moved off the phone,  the icon will be  a little grayed out and that way you'll know,  it's not there, it's going to take a little bit longer to launch it.  I don't think  that's a compelling enough reason for me to abandon  my Nova launcher. But I have to say for $300  it's a little, you know, that's not super cheap.  There's great $200, $300  phones out there, but  for the price  it's still less than the $399,  it's still less than the flagship phones.  This might be a very good choice. It's unlocked.  And you can find it at  nextbit.com.  And I'll probably have a more detailed  review for you in a week or so.  I just got it.  But I mean, you know, it's kind of friendly.  It feels friendly.  A fingerprint reader, which this is unique,  is on the on switch.  So you both, you switch it  on and you have the fingerprint  reading at the same time, which is  pretty convenient.  It's pretty standard Android.  Looks like, yeah, except for the launcher  it looks like stock Android. They've  colorized stuff a little bit, you see.  Widgets, I'm not sure I'll use  their launcher. Widgets are not visible  on the screen there. You pinch to  see your widgets, which is  really weird.  I do love the screen. I think it's a really  crisp, nice screen. I don't know if  it's OLED or IPS, but  although that's kind of  table stakes all of a sudden now. Everybody's got  great screens.  Anyway,  Jason Howells has one as well, and we'll probably  have reviews for you soon.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much.  Professor of Journalism, City University, New York.  My personal hero.
