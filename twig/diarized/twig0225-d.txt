Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis has the week off, but Kevin  Marx is here. Believe it or not, we'll talk about programming philosophies, but  also a lot of Google news. Stay tuned. This week in Google is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netcasts you love. From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Twig. Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Episode 225, recorded November 20th, 2013.  Crows are hot.  It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show that covers the Google-verse, the cloud,  and anything we darn well want to talk about. Gina Turbani is here from ThinkUp,  from SmarterWear.org, founding editor of Lifehacker, soon to be Brooklynite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, hello. Have you started packing yet? Oh, have we started packing? You can't see the boxes  in this shot, but basically everything outside of the shot is just cardboard boxes. I hate moving.  I hate moving. I'm trying not to be cranky about it, but it's going to be a good move. I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having moved now and unpacked and there's no box left behind, it's a nice feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's worth it. On the other end, it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worth it, and especially since you're going somewhere wonderful.  You might also say, as we did, I will never move again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really hope that. I don't want to move for a very long time if I ever do it again.  It needs to be long enough that I've forgotten the trauma of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's like childbirth. Yeah.  Yeah, and that's my line is, the next time I move, I want to be in a pine box.  They'll carry me out of this house in a pine box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Either that or rich enough that I can have people come in, pack all my stuff for me,  carry it, organize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's overrated. So I did that kind of. I packed a few things that I was nervous about,  but I ran out of time, so I said, you're going to have to pack it, and they did.  Problem is, they pack everything, and they pack it in no particular order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, when we moved to the US, that's what happened with us.  Basically, you know, Apple's as part of the relocation thing said,  oh, we'll pack your house and ship it over and we're done with it. Oh, great.  And it's 15 years later, and I still have some boxes I haven't unpacked.  The last time I cleared a block of them in the garage,  well, they really did wrap everything in the kitchen up in bits of paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. And it's like a battery wrapped in paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need to be rich enough to have somebody pack it all up for me,  and then unpack it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I figured. I think what I thought is, okay, the solution for this is a personal  assistant, because then you say, okay, you know, put everything in order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do it. Just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what you really want is someone who handles estate sales and say, okay, pretend I died.  Sell it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sell it all. Yeah. We had a giant garage sale.  Sell all this crap.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let us talk. Oh, I didn't even mention. I'm so sorry.  No, we didn't introduce you.  Jeff Jarvis has a British accent. We don't know why. No.  Where is Jeff? Jeff is off today. He's traveling here in hither and thither.  I forget. He mentioned it last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did say it last week. Maybe on a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure. Is he a WF thing in Abu Dhabi? Is he that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something like that. Let's say he's in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good... He's in Espana. But good news, as always, the wonderful Kevin  Marks is here, and we love Kevin. And he's out on his patio with occasional rain gusts going  through, so that's just what you... So I have a weather map to check.  So let us know if a cell approaches. I'm muting cases.  So we're glad to have you. Thank you for being here.  Where do we start? Where do we start?  I guess we could start with a changelog, actually. You want to do that?  Sure. We always bury the lead.  I think we should... Wow, the lead. All right.  Sure. Well, I think in this case,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's some pretty big news. There is some pretty big news here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So break out the trumpets. It's time for the changelog.  The Google changelog.  Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Play Music is now available on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes! Oh, I'm so happy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, really, really, really cool. A free version of the app allows you to access your  existing library that's stored in the cloud in Google Play Music. So what you have to do to get  music in Google Play Music if you're on iOS is you have to buy singles or records through Google's  storefront, which is only available on Android or the web because iOS has that whole thing about  buying stuff, as in you can't buy anything from anyone except Apple. Or you can just sync your  entire local library up to Google Play using their Music Manager app, which is free for Windows and  Mac. And then all your music will be up in the cloud and you can listen to it using the new iOS  app. The new iOS app for Google Play Music also supports All Access, which is Google Play Music's  streaming product. It's about, I think it's $9.99 a month and there's a 30-day free trial if you  just want to try it out. And like I said, that's included in the new iOS app. And overall, I mean,  it's really nice. Chad's playing the demo video here. It looks a lot like the Android version.  In fact, it uses a lot of sort of Android's design conventions, which is interesting and seems to  look really good. Really, the only thing that you can't do is upload music to it or buy music

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from it. And that's an Apple rule. That's because they don't want to give Apple 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Well, and I'm not sure that... I thought that on iOS, you actually couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  set it up so that users can purchase stuff. It could be an in-app purchase, but Apple would take

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  30%. It would be in-app purchase. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And what you can't do is link to the web. Kindle does the same. Yeah. And you can't do... So  Kindle does the same thing because Amazon doesn't want to give 30% to Apple. So what it says you  want... And Audible does the same thing. You want to buy a book? Go to our website. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. But it can't actually give you a link to the website. No, no. It can't even do that.  It has to say in text. You can go and type this in your own website. Go to the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other missing feature is it is iPhone only, although I'm putting out on my... It's a little  large on my 10-inch iPad. But that's okay. They might do it eventually. It's loading my library  now because I did this before and I have all my music on Google Play. You can do what is it? 25,000  songs for free? 20,000. 20. So the thing is if you've bought the All Access thing, what you want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do is just sync the ones that they haven't got and then it's pretty good. That means you've got to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sit there and work out which is which. Yeah. So I just let it run forever. It's always... It's a  little dongle. It always runs. So you have Listen Now which is my library. So this is stuff that I  either own or is on my hard drive. It's nice because it imports the iTunes playlists. So my  iTunes playlists got moved up which is really, really great. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. And then  if you have All Access, you also have... You do need All Access to do the radio, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or no? Yeah. Yes. No, it'll do something a bit like it which is which it'll do  a shuffle from the stuff you've got if you don't have All Access. And then as you see...  The radio icon requires All Access. Up to 10 devices and this is device 11. Wow. Yeah.  Wow, it's like shades of iTunes. Yeah. But it's actually... It's not too bad because you can...  It's not like the Apple one. You can actually delete ones that you've erased whereas the Apple  one you can't. So you have to bang your head against the wall with it. Right. No, I think...  With the Google one, I hit the same problem because it's like I've churned so many devices  and I was able to just go through and go, yeah, not that one, not that one, not that one,  and it just disappeared and then it was happy again. Yeah, that's nice. At least Google gives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you that facility. And I've tried Spotify, RDO, Mog, Xbox Music and really Google is as good as,  if not better. In fact, I like Google Radio better than Pandora. It seems to be a better  mix for me. Well, it doesn't play ads as well. Well, I pay for Pandora so I don't get... Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to pay for this but yeah. But the other... Does it have the pinning thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that work on this as well? Oh, let me see. Where you can say... Oh, that's a good question.  You take this offline. Yeah. So I'm going to... Because nothing is on this so let's say I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  take the... Yeah, Radio, Get Original. See, if you click on a song or an album, you should see  like a... Yeah, yeah. It's like a pinning. There's a download. Oh, the download. And then I get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  same image. Oh, then you get the... No, but I'll fix that. But yeah. So, you know, yeah, it's kind  of big if you use it on an iPad but it works great and the fact that you even have it is huge  because we've had to use a third party, not such great solution up to now. Right, for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you, Google. Cool. Cool. Yeah. Now just add it to Sonos and you will be perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. Google search... I'm sorry, Kevin. So that's what the Chromecast is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Google search for Android got an update this week and among other features,  biggest feature that it added is this Siri style sort of conversational voice commands. So the only  example that I've tried and seen of this is send me a text message. So if you go, okay, Google,  send a text message. Instead of just launching your text message app, it'll say who do you want  to send it to? And then you say a name and you can choose the person. Have you tried this out yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo? Send a text message. I tried it. Send a text message to Leo. The problem is it's not completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hands-free because at the very end you still have to press the screen and say send it. It says what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the message? Yeah. Hello, Leo. This is my text message. That didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've been for a long time just saying the whole thing. Send a message to Kevin, title,  subject. This is my message. Body, this is my message. Send. And Siri, of course, has done  this for a long time too. So it is a nice feature. I like it. And I want it to be totally hands-free  because the final interaction should be, okay, I've got your message. Here's the message. Read  it back. Would you like me to send it? And I can say yes. Yes. Right. So in the end you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually tap okay or yes. Okay. I was also trying things like, okay, Google, how far is LA from here?  What's the weather there? And it would tell me the weather in LA. That conversational,  it knew that there meant Los Angeles. That is really cool. That's a badass demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I'm just checking because I have 17,558 songs out of the 20,000 Macs on my Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  library. Wow. You're getting there. I'm getting there. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the thing is if you've got all access, then all the obvious mainstream ones are in that anyway.  Right. So you can just use the library for your more obscure ones. But that, yeah, but it's a pain  behind. No, yeah, yeah, yeah. But once you hit the limit, then it's... But that's the thing.  That's, you know, it's like, oh, but the problem I have with it is it's still not very good at  classical, which none of these things are. So they don't seem to... Their display is based around  a song made by an artist in an album and doesn't have a notion of a performance. Oh, yeah. You can't  get a sense of that. Yeah. You'll get a movement. Yeah. And so they don't display properly on the  screen. And the Chromecast does get this wrong too. But then everyone gets that wrong. So I'm  not sure what the right answer to that is apart from like... Start listening to more ASAP Rocky  and less Baki Baki. I mean, it's like Google doesn't employ people who play classical music.  If there's a strong correlation between those engineers and... I have a large, as you probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do, large classical music collection in my music. And I just listen to... I make a playlist and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  listen to that. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what you have to do. But it's frustrating. And when you  try and search for it, if you say, okay, I want, you know, Beethoven's sixth symphony, then you get  really random stuff in the album because it's like 2000 best Beethoven tracks or something.  Exactly. It's like, no, I actually want the Von Karajan version. And it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's really quite hard. Good luck finding that. Yeah. Yeah. So I searched for Beethoven and I got...  Well, you know, you got some stuff. I get Camper Van Beethoven, but that's okay. I like them.  And top songs from Beethoven. Did you know this? The top songs are Moonlight Sonata,  Fury Lys, the fifth symphony, Moonlight Sonata and Fury Lys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And the other thing is it doesn't... When you search for an artist, it gives you the albums  and it doesn't put the dates in that display. You have to click through to find the dates.  It's very annoying when you try to remember... I remember which year that was, but I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which album it was on. Right. Right. I wonder what I'd get if I did Beethoven radio.  Okay. And unlimited rejects, right? I can move... A little bit of skips.  I got Takata and Fugue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unlike...  Mendel and Mendelssohn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you click on the little thing at the top, the note with the lines at the top.  Yeah. Oh, it'll show me what's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can...  If you didn't like Takata and Fugue the first time, you get it another time.  And you get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can reorder and delete those as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Takata and Fugue isn't actually Beethoven, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, but it's Beethoven radio. So it's...  Okay. Okay.  Yeah. Yeah. This is Mendelssohn right now. I don't know if this... Anybody really  thinks that this is classical music.  This is like music played at a recital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. And so I think if you tap and hold, you can reorder the cue.  That's neat.  Pretty far in the future. And you can remove things from the cue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you throw them sideways, they delete.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is Apple. Don't forget. This is Apple. We don't have that facility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May not have moving either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were showing the moving in the demo video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is radio, remember. This is not...  Oh, that's radio.  This is not my playlists.  Right.  This is another thing. I don't know... And this is an Apple issue.  I don't know how to get out of this screen. I don't...  Swipe the top down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can throw them sideways on Android and they go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that may just be because I was listening to radio. Let's listen to an album.  This is radio.  Here's the 99 most essential Beethoven masterpieces.  Swipe that out. Swipe that away. Swipe that away. Reorder this. Reorder this. Reorder this.  Play this faster than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So on Android, there's a little thing on the left that looks like a handle of phones that  you can drag them down by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is in the iOS app. That's definitely in the demo video. I'm just trying to remember.  I'm trying to see how you get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's... So it's actually really bad UX because on the right-hand side,  you've got the three dots menu. On the left-hand side, you've got the three little lines,  which is the the dragger forms.  So yeah, then you can drag them up and down.  You see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, everybody should... You can do this for free with your own collection,  up to 20,000 songs. If you want the all access, you have to pay 10 bucks a month.  But I think it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the all accesses, there's a free trial, so you can try it out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other thing I found with it is that if there's something I want to buy,  and it's on iTunes, but it's not on this,  if you have the Google sync thing running on whichever Mac you've got iTunes on,  then you buy it from iTunes, it syncs up to this, and you can play it on these.  So you don't have to deal with iTunes, like clicking on everything, downloading it.  So that works quite well.  So then there was some, whatever it was, some Caroline Penner on the voice that my wife really  liked. So it's like, oh, I'll buy her EP. And because I bought it on there, it synced across  all the Android devices because it was in the library. So that's what you need.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else is new at Google?  It's working as it's supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We got a new Android app from Google. It just came out today. It's called Newsstand.  This is a rumor for a couple of weeks now. It finally came to fruition.  It's in the Play Store right now, Google Play Newsstand.  What it does is basically combines Play Magazine and Currents. So it lets you read from news  sources, magazines, and also RSS feeds. And it learns what you're interested in as you read.  The app launches with full-length content from newspapers like The Times, The Wall Street Journal,  The Financial Times. And it actually supports payroll, paywalls. So with The New York Times,  for example, if you don't have a subscription, but you read a full article, you get an allocation of  15 articles per month. When you read it in Google Play Newsstand, it will count towards your  allocation. And yeah, it looks really nice. I literally just downloaded it and haven't had  a chance to play with it too much. But basically the more you use it, it learns what you're  interested in. And we'll show you. There's a Read Now section right at the top of the app.  And it'll present you with stories and things that you're interested in.  Start to see some of this happening in Google Now. I've searched for information about whatever,  some news story. And then later on, I'll see a Google Now card. I'm kind of hoping, I think,  that Google Play Newsstand will kind of be that, but just on crack. And it can import your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  subscriptions from Currents and Play Magazines as well. This is interesting. All right. So I  don't use Play Magazine, but I do use Currents. So is this going to replace both of those?  By the way, I noticed that I got it. I didn't have to install it. Yeah. Yeah. I got it automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as well. Yeah. Let's see. It brings the features of Play Magazines and Currents into a single  interface. Play Magazines was just a magazine store. And then Currents was more like a flip

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  board style app. So it really is a new, it's a new, I mean, I see Read Now. I see My News, which  allows you to add sources. So I bet this is replacing Currents. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not, it looks like it is. Yeah. It is going to replace those two. Yeah. So my magazines  come as I have that this free Men's Health magazine, I think from IO. Aren't you, aren't you lucky?  Aren't I lucky? That's always what I wanted. Fascinating.  It's like cologne ads and expensive watches. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we men like, you know,  cologne watches. So, I mean, this is kind of like, it's not quite, but kind of like the new Google  reader, right? I mean, but this is, but this is magazine content and RSS feeds in the same place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. So I've just added Science and Technology. There are paid magazines, but there's  also free news in here as well. And I can add sources like space.com, Popular Science, CNET's  already added Solve for X. That's the Google, those great Google lectures. This is interesting.  Yeah. Yeah. And Gadget, Gizmodo, Mashable, The Verge. All right. I guess I'll be using this more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not exactly Flipboard. It's not exactly Flipboard. It's got a very, it's got kind of  the standard Android design, like the most modern sort of jelly bean design, or I guess KitKat now.  Yeah. I'm adding Science and Technology now. It's a long scroll. I wonder, does it look different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on tablets or is this just, is this the look? It's just a long scroll. It's pretty though.  That's a good question. And I could see what category everything is. And you know, it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  little bit like Google Plus. It is. If you, if you turn your phone landscape, it does reorganize  itself. So it does look like on tablets, it'll be more like a tile. I think I turned that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  layout ability off. I don't like my screen to rotate spontaneously.  All right. Yeah. So if you have an up-to-date Android phone, Google Play Newsstand. And it shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up in your app drawer. It took me forever to find it. It's Play Newsstand in your app drawer.  Right. They hide the Play stuff. Not a huge fan of these, like these Play naming conventions.  Yeah. What else do we have? The Google Wallet card. It is official. So if you're a Google  Wallet user, you can sign up now to get a physical card. This is a physical plastic, pre-paid debit  card that allows you to access your wallet balance at real world, in the real world, at ATMs, at  banks, basically wherever MasterCard debit is accepted. So yeah, the card basically lets you  pay with whatever you have on your wallet balance. So it doesn't like replace all of your,  you know, other cards. But if you hook up, you know, your bank accounts and your cards into your  Google Wallet account, you can add to your balance and use that card. You can go to your Google  Wallet account right now and sign up for it. It's free. I just said, hey, send me one. And it said,  okay, plastic card. Yeah. Yeah. So kind of interesting that this news dropped this week,  especially right after the coin announcement. But this I went for it because I actually use  Google Wallet. And there are times when if there isn't Tap to Pay or, you know, if I'm at a retailer  that doesn't support Google Wallet, you know, the digital version, you just swipe this card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're okay. So I'm in my wallet. I can send money. I could save offers and loyalty programs,  latest transactions. But where do I order the card? Is it? Let's see. Didn't offer me. I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it earlier. Let me look this up. Learn about sending money. How this works. Adjust location.  So on the left side, there's transactions, payment methods, offers, loyalty programs. I have  wallet app and card. Do you see that? Maybe it just hasn't gotten around to it. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it may not have gotten. If you go to wallet and click the cog in the corner, then you can get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it from that. The hamburger. The cog. Of course, the cog in the corner. There's a cog in the corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I see is I see the three dot menus and I see the hamburger. My wallet send money transactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was on the web. Sorry. You're on the web. You're on the Android app. Yeah, on the web. On the left  side, there's a wallet app and card item. I think I have to do it there. And then you can just say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hey, order it. So up to now, I've had a single credit card associated with my Google  Wallet. I can have now many credit cards associated and have it all work with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You can attach a bank account or credit cards. So that has been available for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and my T-Mobile account is also hooked up. I've got mobile carrier billing. I've got a couple  of credit cards. And let's see, add a payment method. Yeah. And you can also add a bank account.  So in a lot of ways, yeah, you can hook up several of your cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a little bit like coin without the swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's like it's like coin, except it's not a crazy device that anyone's going to say,  what the heck is this? It actually looks like a card. And it's just a simple plastic card. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not a fancy device. Maybe someday. They must be rolling it out because it's nowhere in my wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't have a chip and pin, does it? No, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did chip and pin, chip and pin, which is used everywhere outside the US, is a smart card  technology. So you have an identifying chip in the credit card. And then instead of swiping it,  they tap it, right? Am I right, Kevin? And then you enter it, you're required to enter a four  digit pin to verify. And that's used widely outside the US. It's used everywhere. In fact,  when you're outside the US try to use one of the non-chip and pin credit cards, they look often

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  look a scant. So you get a chip like that on it. But also the other thing I've got this card,  which is one of my UK ones is it's also got a little Wi-Fi symbol. It looks like a Wi-Fi  symbol if you see that, which is the touch screen. We don't have video, your video.  I'm seeing a preview of it. Wallet, app and card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway, I see it. So you have to go to the web, Gina. I was using the app.  I was using the app. So I'm going to get my card now. Yeah. So right on the web, sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the web, wallet, app and card. Then you can order it from there. Good.  And then last little bit of newness, Nexus 5 bumper cases and the wireless charger launched  in the Google Play Store. So if you want a case, you want a wireless charger, the wireless charger  is a little strange looking. It's certainly not as nice as the like, you know, half the sliced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The puck didn't work though. My Nexus 4 slid off of it every time.  So apparently this is flat. So it's not, it's not going to happen. And there's magnets in both the  Nexus 5 and the charger. So it will just go in line up and lock in. Which is kind of key. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's 50 bucks and it works with the Nexus, the 2013 Nexus 7, the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 5.  Cool. Yeah. Yeah. And the bumper cases are just, you know, rubber. Baby buggy bumpers. Bumpers.  Yeah. And they're 35 bucks. And they come in a few different colors, red, yellow, gray, black.  And now I was surprised actually they call these bumper cases. I thought bumpers were just,  just the outside band, but this is a full back case as well. That's so Apple to think of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as a bumper. Anything that protects you against bumps is a bumper. Only, no, I agree with you.  I consider a bumper case to be a rim all the way around. Yeah. That's what I was expecting to see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but this is a full cover. It's just a case. Yeah. Right. Right. It's just a case. Exactly.  That's all I got for the changelog. And that's the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm more sorry. Ordering my credit card. Do it. I'm such a sucker. I'm trying to order a bumper  case, but I can't actually find it in the store. Oh. Oh. It's not yet available according to  somebody in the chat room. I've got the next, I wouldn't drop this Nexus five once and, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just asking the trouble. So I just dropped the link in there. They've changed the UI on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nexus site and they've, and they, they used to be a thing saying buy a bumper not available. Now  there isn't a thing saying it, I can find it. It is like, they've got strange squally crap happening  missions. I can't look out where it is. Oh, the pitter patter of the rain. Pitter patter of the rain.  I'm quite sure why I've lost video. I'm wondering if it is just because the rain is absorbing all  the wifi. Does really, is that how that works? The original wifi frequency is where water molecules  are. That's why we were able to use it in the first place because- Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying 2.4 gigahertz is where water molecules are? Yeah. It's just the same frequency  that microwaves use to excite things. That's why, because it resonates at that frequency.  Yeah. Water molecules resonate at that frequency. So- Which was, so the government was like, sure,  you can have that. Nobody else wants it. So if I were in a giant vat of water right now,  no wifi would penetrate it? Yep. And that's why we can't see him because he's in a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five gigahertz, because I'm in a rainstorm. But I've, you know, except that I'm not, the rain is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  behind me, so that seems wrong. I hear a lot of water around you. Are you taking a shower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in the garden under my canopy with rain pooling. No, I've still got 50 VB of wifi here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so I think it's just skyping. Change to five gigahertz. That's the first- I have-  I learn something every time I talk to Kevin Warks. Of course that's why it 2.4 gigahertz.  It's why it's the microwave frequency in microwave ovens because it excites water molecules,  because it resonates with them, because it's at the same, but it's at the same frequency as the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  water. Wow. How do I tell them that to use five gigahertz and not the other? If you have five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gigahertz on your access point, if that's turned on, you should see both the standard one and one-  Oh, unless you haven't named it separately. No, I see. I think you should see it. No, we name ours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  separately here because Apple has a problem- We do name it separately. Switching between five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gigahertz and access point. Yeah. I remember going into my airport extreme and saying,  yes, please name the five gigahertz dash five gigahertz. So maybe that's what you need to do.  So it's public because they thought 2.4 gigahertz, nobody'd want it because of the rain.  Wow. Apparently Andy in Germany says, as a ham, I should have known that.  If I change- I wasn't in the test. This is going to reboot my network, isn't it?  Yeah, no, maybe yes, but if it does, we'll call you right back. Okay. I will do this and see if  I can switch off five gigahertz. Even if the rain itself does not cause major propagation problems,  it will collect on the leaves of trees, says ScooterX, and produce attenuation until it  evaporates. You are now in the Wi-Fi free zone. Wow. And there he goes.  Cyanogen Mod has an app. We talked about this last week. Have you tried it yet, Gina? Because  apparently, and I didn't understand that, not only does it change your firmware, it roots the  phone for you. You just put it on there and you're done. Yeah, no, I haven't tried it because the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  desktop component was Windows only and I just don't have a good Windows machine to try it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with. But yeah, so it roots your device. I didn't realize it. It's a one-click, one-stop shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you still have to connect your thing to the computer and install the thing on the desktop.  I understand that it's a hard problem from a developer's perspective, but from a user  perspective, it's still pretty nerdy. But night, great that you can do it. I think Cyanogen Mod,  the company, I think that their greatest challenge is going to be making these types of things  consumer-friendly. And they're getting there. This is a big step, right? But it's still,  they got to do a little bit better. And yeah, I just didn't have access to a Windows machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it a try. We were talking before the show began about Coin, speaking of this Google Wallet  card. And I do have to think that the Google Wallet card is somewhat in response to Coin.  Coin is a Y Combinator startup that on November 14th managed to grab the imagination of every  tech blog, journal, magazine, and newspaper in the entire country with an amazingly well-orchestrated  PR campaign. The idea, if you watch the video on the Coin website, which I think is only coin.com,  is one card to rule them all. You get a little Coin Swiper, which is actually what the company  originally was in Y Combinator for, was this Arduinos low-energy Bluetooth swiper. You put  that on your phone. I think it doesn't say, but I would guess iOS only. That's what their original  product was for. You swipe all your credit cards, as many as you want. And then somehow, magically,  you get it into this black coin card, which has a little, there you go. There's the black coin card.  It has a little electro-luminescent display, or maybe it's a paper, E Ink display on the back of  it. You can swipe any of your, you can have up to eight cards on the front. Swipe any of your eight  cards. And then you can lose them all at once. You can lose them. It makes it easier to lose them,  which is good. It does seem to solve a problem, which isn't a big problem, but I guess if you have  lots of loyalty cards and so forth, because it does work with loyalty cards, that's good. I would  be a little slow to run to their website and give them $55. That's what they're asking me, saying.  But that's only half what it's going to cost sometime next year when we offer this product.  If it really is that good and you really do need it, I would say, let's just wait until it comes  out and pay the 100 bucks. Who's to say it won't come out? But there are lots of questions. Coin has  responded to some criticism. Among other things, people were worried about how secure the data was  stored in the card and the app. Can a coin owner use the device as a card skimmer and secretly  swipe other people's cards? Hey, Kevin, let me just take a look at your wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Father Robin said that as soon as he gets his coin, everybody at Twitter, their cards will be in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  his coin. It's like the ultimate card skimmer. And also the issue is, well, what happens if your  phone runs out of battery? It doesn't work anymore. And will merchants look at this strange device and  say, oh yeah, no problem. Take that thousand dollars worth of merchandise. I'm sure whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're doing to my card machine is normal. It doesn't have chip and pin. It doesn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  terms of pay. Right. So it will only work in the US where we don't yet have chipped cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chips don't work. I issued a chip card by Wells Fargo and I took it to the UK and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to get you used to the idea of having a chip. It doesn't actually do anything. It's a pretend chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a pretend chip. This is my UK card, which I'm holding upside down. Yeah. And you see there's  a little IC on the front of it. Yeah. There's also a little thing that looks like a wifi symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that? Is that tap and pay? This is tap and pay. Oh, that's nice. So tap and pay is more  widespread in the UK. Yeah. See, I love tap and pay. And in theory, we can do that with NFC on our

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  phones, right? That works now. I mean, I've used the Google Wallet for that. And a lot of retailers  in the US have tap and pay already. Starbucks, Pete's, Macy's. You just look for the little  wifi symbol on the thing by the desk and then you can tap it. It often confuses the person trying  to sell you things when you do that. Macy's, they were like, what just happened? You just tapped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? What? So maybe this card, maybe the fact that this black  cacker looking card, maybe nobody's going to even look at it. You just, oh, it worked. My machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  liked it. So I'm happy. Go take, enjoy. The other trouble with these things is that they  don't always get the affordance right. And this is, so the problem with tap and pay is it's actually  very hard to tip. This is something that Swipe got right on the merchant side. So you swipe your  card into the swipe machine and then they give you the iPad and you can click to tip and decide  what the tip is. Whereas if you've got tap and pay, you can't do that. So you have to tip using cash,  which is kind of weird. And it's no different from you give them the credit card and they swipe it  and don't give anything to sign. So you can't put the tip in. I loved pay with Square. I wish more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people used it because that solves it. Cause they actually show you what the cost was. And they say  add a tip and there's even a button, a convenient dollar tip button. And you just go, yeah, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's something Google could fix in the wallet app when you're using the phone.  Right. But at the moment it doesn't do that. So if I buy coffee with it, I then still got to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cash to tip them, which is kind of a... Or not tip them at all. Cause really after all, how much have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they done for you? Well, I liked, I liked the people who make coffee for me at the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But honestly, you just paid $7 for that Frappuccino latte, mate, what day. And the guy, all he did was  he went over and said cappuccino please. And then he gave you a, he didn't even give you the mug.  Some other guy did that. So really, come on, stop tipping. I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.  As somebody who works in the food service industry for most of my young adult life,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  please tip. I tip very well. It's also funny when I go in the UK and try and tip people and they're  very surprised and confused by it. Cause I'm in the habit of it now. It surprises and confuses us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Americans when we travel and people say, what tip? What's that? You gave me too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had, I had that in a pub. Oh, you left a change on the bar. They come running after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excuse me, sir. That's so weird. So coin today announced some changes in response to these  criticisms. The company is going to add a button to the coin card so users can reactivate it. Even  if their phone is dead, you will be able to tap a button in a Morse code like fashion. I don't know  what that means. I have no, what does that even coin will also feature a system that shows you  how many times your card is being swiped and tell you if someone is using it when it isn't near you  does not address any of the concerns. I think I've mentioned finally, the device will also lock  on a single card. Then this is good. So the waiter can't just switch your payment method.  This was a concern. People would hear, here's my coin card. And she'd go, she could scroll through  I'm going to have an MX pay today. So they're going to apparently give you a lock.  Coin CEO and founder, Konosik Parashar said these changes will come down the road  in a future prototype of the product. Coin, you can pay them now and they'll take your money gladly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but don't expect it till summer 2014. It's a crowdfunding campaign. Even though it doesn't  look like it, it's a crowdfunding campaign. They're asking people to preorder to help.  They're trying to raise money to get this into production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Parashar did say one of the things we wanted from our launch was feedback, but we didn't  expect to get so much. While Parashar said he doesn't find the criticism unfair. I'm reading  this from CNN money. He doesn't find the criticism unfair, but he did complain about the vehemence of  some of the critiques. Everyone forgets this thing is six months old. It takes time to put  it together fully. Of course, of course. And my suggestion is no one give him any money  until he has something to give you in return. They don't even ask for your address. They just  take your money and say, thank you. Goodbye. Parashar said he hasn't slept since Coin launched  its campaign last week. Was mostly surprised by the concerns about security and fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That does not encourage me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not good. And the FAQ, they say that they don't take addresses because they're  shipping in the summer and you could move between now and then. So, okay. Okay. And that's common

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in Kickstarter, right? When you back something. But I have to say, this is not a Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My credit card does take my address because they use it for verification. So there's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really odd. And this is not a Kickstarter. They chose to do this on their own website,  which eliminates a lot of the protections Kickstarter has implemented over the last  few months in response to some of the problems on Kickstarter. For instance, they don't let you show  a video that is a non-existing prototype, which apparently is what we're seeing on the  Coin video. They require that you talk about what could go wrong in the posting. There's none of  that on the Coin site. And they tell you how much money they've raised to date and they don't  generally fund. They don't take money out of your card until they've met their funding goal.  There is no funding goal on the Coin site. They don't tell you how much money they've raised and  they take your card immediately, take your cash immediately. Now, the last issue, which is to me,  a big issue is how are you going to use this? What are merchants going to do? Parashar told CNN  Money that Coin wasn't planning to go out of their way to educate the merchant world about it  because we're focused on the consumer side. But he says now he'll talk with credit card  companies and merchants much faster than I anticipated. Coin doesn't currently support  Chip and Pin, which is known as EMV, but the company plans to add that capability in future  versions. It might just be the prudent, the intelligent thing to do unless you just really  love the idea so much you just want to give them money. It would be to wait and see. Maybe  there'll be even a better one, Coin 2.0. Also, is it really that much of a trouble to carry all those  credit cards? I don't find it that difficult. But I have to admit, I have a little Target loyalty  card. I don't carry that around. I have a lot of loyalty cards I don't carry around. And every time  I go to the movie theater, the movie theater now has a loyalty card. I never remember to bring my  loyalty card and get my points. So maybe this would be good. But I did order right away,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sight unseen, the Google card. Yeah, well, but that was free. And that's an account that you're  using, right? You use Google Wallet to buy from the Play Store, at least. Right. And I have my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  two main credit cards in the wallet. So it'll be nice. And there's no concern that the retailer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is going to say like, what is this thing? Right? It's going to look like a plastic credit card.  Right. That's a Google on it, which you know, it's Google's a thing. Yeah. And I like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said we're raining on coins, brain, quite literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, coin coin had a big parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Motorola is shipping Android 4.4 Kit Kat for its Moto X, but only if you're on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Weird, weird, weird. But okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got to be the carriers are holding it back, right? Do you have any insight on that,  Kevin? What does it take to push an update? If you're the hardware manufacturer and you  have an update, or you're the Android, you know, you have an Android update, Google's pushed to you  or something. The ultimate gatekeeper is, of course, the carrier. Yeah, it's going to go over  their network in most cases. I guess that's why Samsung uses keys. This is why this, you know,  home network based connected to your computer version, because at least they can bypass the  carrier or maybe that's because they're so global. It sounds if only Verizon has it, it sounds like  the other carriers in the US have yet to approve it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a combination of things. It depends on what they're changing, who needs to approve  what. But yet, they're doing over the air that needs to go through the carrier as well as  the manufacturers. There's a lot of coordination problems going on there. It's one of the things  that Apple bypassed with their stuff by saying, no, we'll just ruin it straight from us to the  device. And that's that's we'll make it our problem, not yours. And that's the condition of  us giving you iPhone is that that's all the same. And the other piece is the reason this takes time  is that all the carriers mess with the Android versions as well. So they've got to go to their  own binary too. Yeah, so you've got to, so you've got to, you know, they'll reach the AOSP, then  you've got to port it to the particular device. And the carriers going to pull it for their  set of whatever else they install to. So you've basically got three QA departments to go through,  one of which is a telco, and they have very big and slow QA departments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of iOS, I haven't had an update for the Nexus 7 yet, which is what's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's weird about it, right? This is happening on the Moto X of Verizon before  Nexus devices and before my Google Play Edition device, which is just strange. And apparently,  apparently the updates been pushed to Google and Google just hasn't rolled it out yet. They said  it was supposed to be November 15th for the Google Play Edition HTC One and I have not gotten it yet.  My system is up to date. Android lies to me. Not up to date. Not up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you one of those people that presses refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm busy. I mean, I just did it just now. Since I had the baby, I do that less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once in a while. Yeah. You've got other things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I used to have more time to refresh my system update panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android powers, according to Engadget, four out of every five smartphones in the world. 80% market  share is just mind boggling. But remember, that's not in the US. That's globally. And actually,  this comes from Gartner Group. And it's global because of China, where you can't, I still don't  think you can legally buy an iPhone. I think that, is that right or no? No, you can, but it's not on  the big carrier. It's on some of the little carriers. So by the way, if you want to get  KitKat on a Moto X, apparently ScooterX is saying you can get one on Amazon, a Verizon Moto X for  one penny right now for upgrades. Yeah, well, oh, hey, come on. This is America.  One penny and we own you for the next two years of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One penny and two years of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like be Jeff and channel Jeff and say, I wouldn't trust Verizon to get it right in the  first place. He's still sitting there trying to get them to connect. But yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, one thing I have noticed over the Nexus 5 is that it has trouble getting  onto Wi-Fi. Really? Yeah. If it's on Wi-Fi, I go out and come back, it won't get to Wi-Fi again.  And you have to airplane mode it off and on again, then it finds it. I haven't noticed that. But I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mean, it may, I rarely leave home with it. Right. So it's always on the same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just something I noticed. I looked up in the forums and there were various people saying,  oh, trying to debug it. So there may be something like that going on that may be explained by Google  sitting on the update for the other devices. Right. Because, you know, if you break the Wi-Fi  on the Nexus 7, you're kind of in trouble. Yeah. You've got nothing. I got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can always connect the variety. Oh, no, nevermind.  Google, this will be of interest to the glass holes in the audience. And I know, Gina,  you're interested as both a glass hole and a developer. There is a glass SDK and an app  development kit. Google has showed a little bit of this. Was it today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a couple of days ago. They did their hackathon, a hack event, a glassware hack event.  Yeah, this is like the GDK is an actual development kit as opposed to the mirror  API, which is sort of a rest API. The GDK exposes things like voice commands and location data and  gestures on the glass touchpad. So in theory, and I think this will happen,  developers will be able to make sort of more native apps for glass, which is exciting. It  makes a lot of sense that they're releasing this now before glass comes out for consumers.  Yeah, glassware, which is what apps for glass are called, are kind of getting a big push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's really pushing on them right now. Did you get your glass 2.0 or something? Isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there a kit that you're supposed to get? Yeah, we're supposed to get the opportunity to swap  in our current glass for a new glass, right? I haven't gotten it. I should really make sure  that it didn't get shuttled away into notifications or one of the other labels. Yeah, because it has  a new earpiece and all that. Yeah, no, I haven't gotten that yet. In fact, I'm going to check on  that because I would like to get the new hardware. Apparently, if this then that has added a Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glass channel. That's intriguing. I must be using the GDK. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know what kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  events you would want to trigger, but like, show me a card when right. Would you set up for IFTTT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Twitter IPO notifications. Yeah, but it would be cool. No, no, Nexus 5 ordering or something.  I would like to see the next order. Wouldn't it be cool if you set it up with Google Keep?  Show me my shopping list when I enter the grocery store. Yeah, now you're talking. That'd be kind of  neat. Yeah. So what can we do? What are the actions? Send a notification to your Google Glass timeline.  Message, image, URL and URL. Oh, but there's no triggers. So that's meaningless.  Yeah. Okay. So thank you. Well, wait a minute. Oh, okay. So you can't. You just haven't set it up.  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that was Chad's. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Glass can't trigger anything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but other things can. There are other things that have glass triggers, right? Right. So anything in  if this and that pocket can trigger glass, you know, the action can trigger it. All you can send

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is a notification. So if there's one, if you're mentioned on Reddit,  find out right away via Glass. That's good. I like it. These are recipes. This is probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  using the Mirror API. The GDK will enable Glass having its own triggers. So you can imagine  like because the GDK lets you do things like access location and that kind of thing,  a trigger might be, you know, when I'm in Ralph's, show me my grocery list. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neat rain monitor. That's what you need. A rain monitor. Is it raining?  I have TTT channels for Glass. Right. I love it. Really awesome. We I love if this than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  IFTTT put the internet to work for you.com. So is that like cooling weather underground or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to see if it's raining locally? Yeah. Hello. Am I wet? Your glass could be wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, one of the example, uh, Glassware apps with the new using the new GDK is Word Lens.  So if you're reading a sign in another language, as you're looking at it, it'll translate, you know,  on Glass for you. And a live translation does you read. So, uh, I'm sure you all saw this. Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wins in court after seven years. The Authors Guild sued Google over its book scanning.  And, uh, the judge said, you know what? It is fair use. It's transformed. It fits all the  fair use defenses. It's transformational. There's no monetary harm to the Authors Guild. Uh, and it  has a great benefit to mankind. So thank you, Judge Chin. Unfortunately, uh, the Authors Guild  says, even though we've spent millions of dollars to stop this, we're going to the Supreme Court.  So they will appeal and we shall see what happens on appeal. Preserve the knowledge. Preserve the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  knowledge. That was, that was actually a lot better than the settlement that was there before,  which only, only favored Google. Whereas this is, it's settling it in a generic way saying this,  this act is fair use, which means that other people that scan books, like, um, the internet  archive and libraries that do this too, can benefit from this ruling too. Whereas the settlement  they had before was basically a carve out just for Google. So this is, this is, this is definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good progress for this kind of thing. So, okay. Cause I had read somewhere that, uh, the thought  was that this is so, uh, uh, constraint of a decision. It wasn't valuable, uh, past this. So  you, you, you think this is a good fair use victory? Yeah. Yeah. In fact, that's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before there was a settlement that was written between the, um, that there was, that Google  offered a settlement, right? Yeah. And it was, and it was, we can sell these and give them,  but it basically gave them a right to scan things that other people didn't have, which was, um,  problematic. Um, and you know, basically a carve out between the authors and also it, it meant that,  it was restricted to certain countries, things as well. And one of the huge advantages of the  Google books thing is that it's globally accessible and it's massively used in the developing world  where you can't even buy some of these books. Well, and that's an interesting question. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know, I think this is great and I love, I mean, this is what Google's mission is to put the  knowledge of all the knowledge, search all the knowledge of the world and make it available at  your fingertips. And this is exactly what Google's mission is. And it's right. Um, and, but a lot of  people said, Oh Leo, you're, you know, Google's ripping off authors because what's to stop me  from using this search to, you know, print out a book. Have you met Bittor? If you want to do that,  you can do that in a lot easier than searching page by page, printing it out bit by bit. It  would cost you more just by the darn book. If that's really the issue. Um, Google books,  according to the court does not supersede or supplant books because it is not a tool to be  used to read books. Instead, the court held it adds value to the original and allows for the  creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings. It is transformational  is transformative. And, um, that's huge. And I think the judge, I think judge Shin deserves  a pat in the back that got it exactly right. Um, yeah. And that'd be, yeah, right. Very supportive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  brief on it. Yeah. Yeah. Tremendous victory for fair use and public interest. Yeah. And, um, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know, most of these books, by the way, uh, aren't are, uh, out of print. They wouldn't be  accessible at all. The vast majority of these books, but let's say, uh, your, um, who was it  was really, uh, what it was one of the, uh, thriller writers who was really dead set against this.  Um, no, it wasn't Stephen King. It was, uh, Metallica. No, Metallica. Yeah. It was ours.  Lars Ulrich. Um, one of these, one of these people, um, uh, really felt like there's taking  money out of my pocket. I just have a hard time. Really. I think this makes perfect sense. They  want you to be able to search for it in the long run. I think you're going to sell more books,  not less discovery. It's a discovery tool, but this is always the argument that all of, uh,  that always happens with content creators when the internet gets, uh, gets involved.  Ah, they're going to steal, rob me blind. It was, it was Scott Turow. That's who it was. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dendrite the Charter. Who is, who writes the legal for him as well. Yeah, he writes legal. So,  but I think he could actually understand law. I doubt, right. No, he was a lawyer. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about understanding the law. It's about understanding the internet, right? It's about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  understanding the web. I think that's what it really is. He was a lawyer, uh, but when he  started writing and I, I, they say, uh, uh, he's still a practicing lawyer. Um, but I just think  he misses the, I don't, well, it remains to be seen. And I understand he's afraid that he's,  he's going to lose revenue. Um, but I just can't imagine that that will be the result of this.  Nobody's going to go page by page, print it out and then say, I didn't have to read it. Was it  John Grisham? Oh, it's one of them. I thought it was to row. Uh, anyway, good news. We, but not done.  Uh, the author's guild's appealing. Um, and I love what EFF says in the, at the end of the,  their article by, uh, Corinne McSherry. Uh, she says, well said judge chin. Let's hope other  courts take heed. The author's guild has already declared it will appeal the ruling. Its membership  might want to consider whether they really want to spend more of their dues on this misguided  litigation. So good news. Um, and, and I, and really, I, you just not going to cost you anything.  It's not going to cost you. Reads. It's going to help you. New Yorker doing it again. I think the  New Yorker is really, really starting to do a lot of technology coverage and do a really good job  of it. They have an article, uh, in this week's New Yorker, uh, by a Burkhart Bilger, a reporter  at large called auto correct. Has the self driving car at last arrived? Yeah. Burkhart says  human beings make terrible drivers of the 10 million accidents Americans are in every year,  nine and a half million are their own damn fault. Well, there's, there's been a huge round in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  UK this week about, um, basically several cyclists have been killed. Um, in a row, cyclists get killed  on the streets of London with fairly regularly, but they, you know, six got killed in two weeks  or something. So suddenly there's an outcry about, um, lorries killing cyclists in London, but half  the outcry is why lorries killing cyclists. The other half outcry is why a cyclist so careless  that they get killed. And the mayor of London said, let's say it's going around with headphones  on, we should ban that. No, if I've got head and I've done this, if I've got headphones on in London,  it's because I'm listening to Google turn by turn cycling directions so I can watch the traffic at  the same time as working out where the hell I'm going. Yeah. I've, you know, I'm not sitting,  you know, and it's these little white things. It's not, you know, I can still hear the outside  world through that. Well, massive misunderstanding. What's going on here? We're out here. We're up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  here in the wine country where there's lots of cyclists on the road and they are with great  regularity plowed into by drivers who are messing with the radio, you know, bending over,  trying to find something on the floor and the driver just doesn't pay attention. Their car veers  right into the plows and a cyclist. It happens a lot, at least every summer, uh, one or two times.  So I am a big proponent of, I think auto driving cars are a great idea. I wonder though, does it,  and I think the thing that's going to put it over the top is we're getting used to it.  I really believe that the conversation has shifted a lot in the last few years, thanks to Google.  But secondly, I also think that insurance companies are going to end up putting it over the top  by offering great discounts for cars that drive themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is, we're starting to see this anyway with other features and that was me,  but the connection between the two stories for me was that the new cars you buy now have blind  spot radar. Right. So if there's something moving in your blind spot and you signal a turn, it beeps  at you and says, uh, no, don't do that yet. Um, and that is, you know, that's enormously useful.  I mean, we just got one new car that has that, and then I'm driving the other car and I'm thinking,  it's not beeping. Oh, right. I better check the mirrors even more. Um, but the lorries need that.  This is the, the, the big trucks that are killing the cyclists. Um, they have a, there's a, there's  a video from Transport for London that shows this where when you're turning the cab, turning the car  that's a semi, so the cab turns separately. Um, your left hand, your, your, um, inside mirror  is useless because it's then pointing at the side of the, of the, of the truck and the entirety of  that side of the, of, you know, what's, what's one vehicle length, the side of you is completely  invisible. And so you, you know, 20 cyclists can be invisible to a driver. Yeah. So, you know,  my, my take on this is they should make, um, blind spot radar mandatory for trucks and lorries and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  buses. The, um, um, trucks in the U S often have bumper stickers that say, and I think this is  good. If I can't, if you can't see me, I can't see you. And I think that's an important message  that if you don't see the driver in his mirrors, he's not seeing you. So this video that you sent  us in the chat room is really quite stunning because look at this, look at the mirrors on  this truck. You look in the mirrors, there's no cyclists. There's nobody out there. You know,  this would be a good time to turn left. If you're this truck driver. Uh, now this is a British truck  with the wheel on the right. So that's important. It would be opposite obviously in the United  States. Uh, but watch, he gets out of the truck and walks around and there is a fleet of bicyclists  right there, right there. And it's, it's, it's along the entire length of the truck. It's not  like one bicyclist in a blind spot. It is 20 bicyclists when you're turning because the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mirror is then pointing at the side of the truck. Right. So this is why you need radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, unbelievable. You could be wearing headphones or not. This truck will squish you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This makes me think like, okay, I'm not going near trucks while I'm cycling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, that's probably the another message. Um, anyway, I'm a big, I mean, I think so many  reasons to distracted driving, teens texting. Um, I got a question though, because I think that  ideally this would happen like with the flip flick of a finger and everybody would ought  to be autonomous. Um, and every then we would never have any accidents. But I think if you have  half or more of the drivers, humans making stupid errors, you're still going to have accidents with  autonomous vehicles because there's some accidents you can't avoid if somebody does something stupid.  And I think that's going to be a problem. Well, but that's the thing, the way they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  turning this. So a this happens is going to happen incrementally. There's, there's, um,  it's not going to happen with a flip of a click. Right. Because what we get is the car to get better,  get better automation and more tools like the, like the blind spot radar and light lane following,  like, um, front radar. That's the ones you, you're about to hit and shout to you to put the brakes on  and, and things like that incrementally, the cars, the cars running more of this,  several cars have automatic parking, which is a self driving, you know, self driving backwards  at low speeds into a parking space. So this is not going to, we're not going to suddenly have a  button on the thing that does this, but it's, it's incremental features that move into the cars.  And all the other thing is that they're all, they're all assuming that they've got to deal  with human drivers as well, which is, you know, if you said, oh, the driver's going to be robots,  we can, you can do completely different things, but then you can't assume that you can have to  assume human drivers for a long time. But as, as, I think, as you say, it'll happen over time that  you'll get insurance discounts for the cars that have these features, um, because they will have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fewer accidents. Yeah. I mean, these cars have to be programmed to assume, you know, unpredictable  behavior. And it's not just human, human drivers, right? It's animals running out into the road.  It's trees that have fallen into the road. It's, it's, I mean, you know, unpredictable things  happen on the road all the time. And it just, it isn't just about human drivers. And obviously this  is definitely going to happen. There'll still be accidents. You're right. Yeah. And there's still  going to be accidents, right? I mean, we're just talking about reducing, reducing accidents. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  always going to be accidents. Avoiding avoidable accidents, I guess, is the, is the key on this.  And a car can do that. It can drive better than any human ever could. Um, this article in the  New Yorker is great. And they're interviewing Sebastian Thrun, who's the head of the, uh,  the Google, uh, huh? He left. He's doing Udacity. He was. That's right. Yeah. He's doing Udacity.  Um, but he does interview him. I, I don't know if this is, it's not an old article. It's a brand  new article. So I wonder, well, anyway, one of the things they point out is the Google car has driven  now than more than half a million miles without causing an accident. And this is the stat you hear  all the time, twice as far as the average American driver goes before crashing. But, and this is  something you don't hear in the PR for this. Left to its own devices Thrun says it can only go about  50,000 miles on freeways without a major mistake. Google it's not there yet. I, you know, this kind  of was a surprise to me. Google calls this the dog food stage, not quite fit for human consumption.  They always have a human driver there with his hands over it over the wheel. Thrun says the risk  is too high. You would never accept it. The car has trouble in the rain. For instance, when it's  lasers bounce off shiny surfaces. Yeah. The first drops call forth a small icon of a cloud  on screen and a voice warning auto drive will soon engage, disengage. It can't tell wet concrete  from dry or fresh asphalt from firm. And of course, you can't hear a traffic cops whistle or follow  hand signals. So there, you know, you're not going to be able to sit in the back seat for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to come. But you know, but it's the rain since in San Francisco, San Jose, the Bay area for the first  time in eight months yesterday and loads of accidents. None of those drivers remember just  to be able to tell wet from dry and what breaking was like. So I think part of the problem is that  they're developing it here where it doesn't rain that often. And so they haven't hit those test  conditions. If they were developing it in New England, they'd say, oh yeah, there's this like  frozen stuff on the ground. We might need to deal with that. Thrun did say that within a year,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it should be safe for twice, twice the amount of a hundred thousand miles. I mean, there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  definitely improving rapidly. The other thing that how they work at the moment is they're based  on already having LIDAR scans of that road. So they have to have driven the road at least,  at least twice. Oh, that's oh, interesting. With the scanning thing so that they know  at high resolution what's what's road and what isn't before they can reliably drive it. So the  other point of having humans there was they had to drive lots and lots of roads first before they  could actually have enough data for the machines to make sensible decisions because they need to  understand what's actually street furniture and what's movable. So they can tell moving things.  They can say, oh, there's a bicyclist, there's a person walking, there's something moving there,  but they can't tell a person standing on the corner of the street from the lamppost unless they have  an idea of what's what. So they have to, so they can't tell if something might move.  So there's a certain, just building that resolution detail and information about the streets  is a big part of what makes the Google ones more reliable than the previous ones because they have  that, both because they've driven it with Street View cars, which now have the same scanners in,  but also originally because they were driving it with those particular cars. So they talk in the  article about his car driving him to work every day because it's following the same route. And so  that's a route they know really well, but when they go through the diversion,  it can get a bit confused and you have to pay more attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting very used to the automated features in my new car and I have some very,  I have that blindside awareness system. So a light goes on when some car is in my blindside  or something's in my blindside. That's great. And it's a big bright light on the rear view mirror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I know immediately. But also my one is if I indicate and there's something that it actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  makes a noise to warn me. Yeah, yeah. I have lane guidance too. So it sees this, it has cameras all  over the car, it sees the stripes in the road. If I veer into it, it's as if they're bots dots.  There's the wheel vibrates and the seatbelt goes and that really does kind of, okay, I'm sorry,  I'm veering out of my lane. That works quite well. I have. So a big chunk of this is getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those affordances right. Yeah. Making sure that the feedback you're getting from the car is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  contextual and user user interface is always a challenge, isn't it? And I got to get a new car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have my favorite driving in because I use this all the time is the cruise control. It has adaptive  cruise control. So sees the car in front of me and I can actually see an image of the car. I can see  a safe distance and there's like a red thing and a green thing and as soon as I get into the  start getting too close to the car, it slows me down and it maintains a safe distance at all times.  So I actually use cruise control much more than I would normally because it enforces a safe distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so the cruise control I see adjusts itself. Yeah, it'll actually stop the car. The car in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  front of me stops. I can just sit here and I will slow down, slow down and then I will stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's awesome. Yeah, I mean that's that makes a ton of sense, right? Like that's awesome. So you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do you really do get used to this stuff. I also have night vision. It's got infrared sensors. So  when I when you can see it's really kind of interesting because you see the hot spots on cars,  the engine and the exhaust and then if there's a human it outlines it in green. It sees a human  shape and so at night when I'm driving I can see live things kind of highlighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, can you see if like there are babies or dogs or like pets in the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One I have doesn't do that. Next year's edition will do it with any live creature.  Babies or pets. That's generally not in cars. It's walking, right? To avoid pedestrians or cyclists

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and that kind of thing. Okay, I see. Yeah. Oh, I thought you could see like inside the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, you can when you see a car go by and I was showing John this morning there was a mailbox  with a crow on it. The crow was really bright white because it was hot. Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those crows and their body temperature. They're hot. That's crazy. So you would see the deer but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it doesn't outline it yet in green. That's next year. It does outline humans in green and babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was one of the things in the in the Google driving driving car story he said oh there must  be a bug in it and then he then it realized it was slowing down because they were deer walking  on the side of the road. Wow. See that's so great. He hadn't seen. Yeah. The car was like  yeah something's moving there. I'm going down so they don't jump out in front of me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good article. Auto correct. Her cart, Bill Gurr. It's in this week's New Yorker. Oh, I'm sorry. I  just closed it. Sorry. Jed pulled it up and I just closed it. Maybe this is related to the Google  barge. I don't know. Google has opened the winter wonder lab pop-up shop showcasing the latest  gadgets. These will be in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Sacramento, Washington DC and for reasons  no one understands Paramus, New Jersey. Oh, poor New Jersey. But really I mean I understand New York,  Los Angeles, Chicago, Sacramento, okay, Washington DC, no San Francisco but they do have Paramus,  New Jersey. These are little pop-up stores. There's a giant snow globe inside. It'll shoot  slow motion video of you jumping around. No Google Glass there though which is odd. But and Google,  I mean what is, I mean I guess play, create, chill. That's, this is the slogan. This holiday  season you're invited to the winter wonder lab presented by Google. Google's getting weirder and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  weirder. Companies do this a lot. Like I see this on campus at UCSD. You know they're like Samsung  pop-up things that they set out like in the middle of campus in the square. I've seen Nokia  where you just go and you play with the gadgets. I think this is just Google, you know, selling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their stuff. They're stepping up to this. Apple's been doing this for 25 years. Yeah, I mean Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does it really well. And they'll show Nexus 5s. They'll show Nexus 7s. And then these are people  playing in the snow globe and the little slow motion videos. That snow is not real. It's super  imposed on you so you don't have to worry about getting wet. I just wanted to do some sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  partnership with Zipcar or something or some sort of rental car and have it so that people can try  out one of the driest driverless cars for a day. I like to drive this car for a day just to try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out. Now you're talking. I like it. Anything else here? Google Plus and YouTube integration?  Yeah, we have talked about that but let's talk about it some more. It really annoys some people.  It really upsets a lot of people. You have to now have a Google Plus account to comment on a Google,  on a YouTube video. To post on YouTube video it has to be tied to your Google Plus account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a collision of things going on here. So one is it is actually impressive to make YouTube  comments worse. That's a step. But are they worse really? So what I've seen, I've seen different  complaints from different people. I've watched a lot of these as well as very funny, sweary videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about it. Right. Yeah, the videos have gotten worse but the comments have gotten better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think my sense is there are three separate complaints here. There may be four but I'll give  you three that I've seen. One is you're now requiring me to use Google Plus and therefore  you're hitting the fake names Ellis Island policy which means that you have to have a name that  looks like a name to some robot at Google which if you're a YouTube person who works on a pseudonym  it is a pain in the neck. So the publishers that's painful for them but it's also painful  for someone who doesn't want to comment especially when it sometimes logs you in without you  realizing and I've seen that people complain about that because they're already logged into Google  suddenly YouTube and their Google Plus accounts are linked and they weren't expecting it.  So there's that issue which is the Google now names issue that I think is misguided but we're  not going to convince them. So there's that piece of it. There's also, it is now, it is trying to  sensibly sort the response, the comment responses so that you see comments from people you know first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and does other prioritization stuff. That's a little weird, I agree. That should probably be  chronological. Well no, I think that stuff's sensible but it- There is a setting by the way,  top comments or newest first. So you can say just give me the newest comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. But part, I want, I said this to the YouTube guys four years ago when I was working  there, your comments are toxic and you need to start sorting the chronologically and show  different things to different people and they're starting to do that but they haven't quite got it  right yet because part of the problem is they are overweighting comments that draw reaction  which means they're amplifying the trolls. So some of the troll and they're amplifying the trolls  who have built up a following on Google Plus independent of the following on YouTube. So  that means that if there's a set of people who you know have their own little chat group on Google  Plus and therefore have built whatever they use for karma over there and then they comment on  on a YouTube video then that will pop up to the top and that makes it problematic for the YouTube  types. But I think the bigger complaint from the YouTube publishers is that they don't feel they've  got enough control over the comments and that's a more structural problem. So I think you know  the way for Google to really improve YouTube comment quality would be to encourage the  people who are posting videos to help them police it and give them tools to do that better and I  haven't got the sense that that's been part of this race at all and hopefully they'll improve  that in future. But you know Google's first default response is we will sort these with  an algorithm we won't help humans do it. I think those are the three bits, the three different  strands of things going on there and you get different complaints about it. There's 112,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  signatures on the petition. 201,000 now since that was written. Oh wow. Yeah if you go to the change

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oddly enough this is at change.org which is normally a political change. Yeah.  They uh I don't know what this does uh it did surpass the uh or no it hasn't yet surpassed  the 300,000 mark. What happens at 300,000? It says 9,000 yeah I don't know what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean ironically this petition collects your name and email address and street address when you sign it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you scroll back up you can point out how many typos there are in there. How many times do they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  spell petition wrong? Petinion. Petinion. Here's a petinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you know I have sympathy for both sides of this because um YouTube comments have been  hideous for years um and they do you know they do need to improve and what they've learned Google  Plus could do that but um at the same time it's it's very hard for people who've built up an  understanding of how things work. I think the other the other oh the fourth complaint I think is that  um the subscription model of which videos you see next has gone all fuzzy and is using Google Plus  algorithm and the YouTubers who were used to how that worked are now grumpy because all the  SEOs changed which is you know that's like working working working with Google but um also you know  one of their fair points is is that the subscription model on YouTube was would at least  you know be like Google reader was in that if I subscribe to a channel on YouTube when I next  log into YouTube and you've posted something it'll be at the top and that there's no longer any idea  where that might show up at all and you'll be showing other random things instead and that  that is for someone who's posting videos regularly or worse if they're posting irregularly they  suddenly find that um people don't know they posted a new one and they have to find other  ways to tell them which is which is kind of kind of productive from from their point of view and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  possibly not helpful from Google's point of view. I'm sorry I was watching the Bat Kid video I got  distracted only in San Francisco I love this um a five-year-old uh who has been battling leukemia  much of his life Miles Scott um said his dream was to be Bat Kid for a day make a wish made it  come true in San Francisco tens of thousands of people showed up on the streets of San Francisco  to watch him uh save a woman from a trolley car track and I mean look at all these people  and uh there's the little Bat Kid in his little bat outfit um there she is the this damsel in  distress he saves her on the trolley car track and uh what a cute story that is I don't know I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if it wasn't for the damsel in distress thing that would be really cute okay the damsel is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all right I admit you know it's Batman it's got to be here they are at Packville Park women in  trouble on trolley tracks somewhere it happens when it's 1960s Batman that's what it is Snidely  whiplash ties them up puts them on the railroad track it happens there was even a special San  Francisco Chronicle edition Bat Kid Saves City it said the Gotham City Chronicle they transformed  the city of San Francisco for the day oh and social media went crazy and uh there's the Joker

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they got he got him too this is interesting for me is this is like 1960s tv Batman oh yeah it's not  maybe the like the dark night 80s movies yeah the dark night and somebody did um I think I just put  the link in the chat room um which is which is meanwhile a Bane Kid lurks in the shadows biding  his time I want to be Bane Kid and picture of a little bit of a like a toddler in a Bane costume

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  according to the Chronicle the costs to San Francisco for the Bat Kid shenanigans $105,000  however don't don't be a Scrooge they made much more than that in goodwill

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right you know of all the things San Francisco waste money on that that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a minor minor detail that was very cute yeah it was uh it's one of the strangest stories I've ever  seen um anything else that we want to talk about before we get to our tool and tip and number and  all of that stuff I think we've got most of the most of the big stories it's just now the uh the  little crunchy uh pieces at the bottom of the Pringles can yeah the Wolfram programming language  I'm okay I want to ask you about that because you're a programmer this this seemed actually  you both programmers this seemed very interesting Stephen Wolfram who is definitely an iconoclast  and created Mathematica and more recently Wolfram Alpha announced that they're going to have a  special uh high very high level programming language much like the language in Mathematica  that will allow people to create kind of real world models uh with information from Wolfram  Alpha I guess this is what they've been using internally um tell me what what you know about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this this is intriguing yeah this is pretty intriguing so it looks like the the the point  of the language is to make it really easy to do like very complex tasks kind of what you see at  the Wolfram Alpha uh you know the search engine uh you can do very easy image processing making  graphs understanding natural language uh and so Wolfram said it becomes trivial to write a program  that makes use the latest stock price computes the next high tide generates a street map shows  an image of a type of airplane or a zillion other things that sounds really really really interesting  I mean this is this is the kind of thing that platforms like Android or iOS like try to provide  these tools to programmers but this is very high level stuff that we're talking about here  so um I mean you know of course my first questions are like what you know where is this gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where's this gonna run is this well they say they say you can build standalone apps desktop apps so  you can't compile it but they also are going to do a cloud engine a good you know an app engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  style cloud um so you can deploy over the web see I mean the the challenge is that it's you know  it's going to be locked up inside mathematical land because mathematics is a very powerful language  but you have to buy licenses to it from Wolfram to use it and so there's been a parallel set of  infrastructure being built with MATLAB and R and things that that are actually open source that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people are using using well that's interesting so MATLAB is open source and free right and R

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is like another toolkit there that's you know mathematical there's a bunch of you know there's  been a sort of renaissance over the last few years as all the graduate students have discovered open  source in using those tools rather than using the the the the proprietary stats packages and  and the proprietary language like Mathematica now Mathematica is enormously powerful it's wonderful  if you're doing higher maths um you know hard maths at all because it it lets you let you do things  that are um very very complex um and express them in a in a pure mathematical form but there  are there are sort of open source things coming alongside it so I think the challenge for  Wolfram is and you know he gets this he's a smart guy so he's they've already got their what do they  call it cdf or something um they've got their own format for publishing Mathematica notebooks  that you can then render in other places and things like that um but what they're sort of  running against is the sort of open source cluster of tools that people are starting to put together  and there's there's some you know fairly mature tool sets in python that a lot of the there's a  python notebooks thing that people now use to interchange these things so they've got some  competition but you know it's good to see and I'm yeah there's you can if you use Wolfram Alpha it  is extremely powerful and useful um I found I love Wolfram Alpha it's it's also like you know for my  kids it's like hi I have some homework right how do I solve this it's like well that's a  more closed form solution than I was expecting for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  could you integrate this quadratic equation for me solve solve for x please okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never used Mathematica have you used it Kevin I've used it a little and it was it had a high  learning curve because it's a it's an expressive language that you had to it's basically a  a language for typing maths in right means you need to understand its notation a map that's a  real notation it'll display the real notation you have to express it he says that this language

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will be more like Java or C++ so a much more traditional programming but also it also the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  other thing that's interesting about this is that the stuff they've learned from Wolfram Alpha is  how to integrate um existing data sets things like that a big chunk of what they do there is  curate large data sets of information and then make that accessible to the other pieces  so that's it it's it's very in some ways it's like you know the um the google mission of making  sense of the world but they've they've got a different take on it which is make sense  the world's and plug it into something programmable they're trying to build a model almost yeah so  that's yeah um if you've I mean it's worth going to walk from alpha and looking at some of the  example queries they have down the side because if you just type random things I know I love that  yeah it never quite understands you but if you um if you've if you like think in the way it  expects you to think which is in a very sort of physicist way because that's that's what he is  um it will it will come back with with useful things for you so if you want you know if you  want to understand the pension equation and you search for that in there it'll give you the the  sort of the first approximation you use in high school and then the the the um the second solution  that's it's triangular and they say oh and it's actually a two-dimensional object and this this  happens too and it'll take you into the in depth of of the math that's that's you know underpinning  all this so it is um it is it's a it's a very sort of powerful tool for drawing you in so yeah  I'm excited by this but I'm also as excited by the sort of parallel thing that's going on in the  in the open source world that that plugs into some of this that plugs into some of the same  ideas and having stuff move back and forth between them there's also and we talked about this too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um a new programming environment called live code I might as well throw this in as long as we're  talking about it the idea is it's a cross-platform programming language is that right?  Live code.com. This was I think a kickstarter and  and um it's designed to do completely cross-platform app which there's a lot of those out there  um and I'm trying to remember what was unique about this um it's a Scottish company and it  uses a visual workflow it's not free it's not open source so maybe it's not even worth talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it some variant of um I don't know is it that kind of style? um it's a visual workflow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um it's used the company's committed to promoting digital literacy schools using  the platform have seen a doubling of uptake for their CS courses  why do we talked about it on uh security now I think it was or I mean on uh twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um you create an iOS Android app in three hours and 16 minutes they've got a speed a sped up demo video

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anyway what and since you guys are programmers I thought by now we were supposed to not have to  worry about programming languages anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  guess not guess not yes yes not oh this was going to be a hypercard replacement that's why we talked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about it the uh it looks you know we've had different variations of these um you know  hypercard was it was a very good example of this so hypercard let you construct um forms effectively  buttons fields um and images one bit images originally um and plug them together and had a  scripting language underneath that was actually fairly well put together and we've seen iterations  of things like that over time scratch is another good example scratch is a project from  MIT I think um that lets you build programs by plugging things that are like jigsaw pieces  together to make loops and so on and attach them to sprites on the screen and move them out um and  it would it would generate a java program which was a good idea at the time and they've now done  an iteration of it it generates a web web app um so so they've raised they raised nearly half a  million pounds on kickstarter to do this um there are lots of these app generator things around  there and you you find domain specific ones for doing certain things to some extent you can do  you know the original interface builder on on next step was like this um and that's still there in  xcode if you yeah the the quartz composer and the xcode interface designer yeah i love all that  yeah if you had a program then you have to go and write the code that joins together and then when  you want to change it you're like oh now what do i do and and there's the google one that i  forgot the name of that does something that did something similar that would build an android one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  except that it was some app or app what was it app app inventor app inventor but it was some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really strange mixture of um web-based authoring and client-side app that meant you had to take  it through two processes to get it done so there's lots of things like this and and we you know we  see more of them over time um and part of this is you know programmers trying to build tools to make  their lives easier the other examples of these are things like you know rails and um the the app  generators like that where you say well if you make a database we'll generate you a web page that  reflects that database and then it give you the framework to to make some of this this stuff easier  and using reflection yeah there's there's a lot of these scaffolding bits and pieces  that's that's very pretty but it's also um creating transducers between things and and part of this is  we've got better at actually decoupling some of these components from each other and making it  we've got better patterns for moving stuff back and forth between different programming languages  and different data stores and things like that that's enabling a lot of these things so you know  if this then that is an example of that where they're saying okay we've built transducers  between these sets of things but they can do that because those those api's exist and the the  challenge is always at some point you've got to you've got to actually think about logic and you  got to think about layout and user experience um and that that's that's still harder to you know  automate and and and simplify away but you know these it's all to the good from my point of view  as long as long as you're not you know the the challenge with all of these things is um  if you build something that is completely in its own world then you're kind of stuck in that world  um and like any framework once you've adopted that framework it's bringing all of it with it  and if it's built that way then you will suddenly find um leaky abstractions in there and something  really weird will happen and then you have no idea what to do except either you know call the guy who  wrote it or sit there and debug yourself all the way down to the metal and get it fixed and that's  you know that's the tension with this so the the challenge with getting these things right is getting  the um the surface area between them the place where they overlap smooth enough that you can  plug them together well and that's that's the you know that's the interesting hard part of of of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  programming design these days are we still uh god you know agile programming test-driven design  object model controller all of that stuff is that still i think i mean with all those things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you just mentioned well mvc model view controller that's a design pattern agile is a way to manage  your project i mean those are sort of more abstract theories about the best way to approach  software development and those i think those are all really useful in fact npr just did a thing  about health their healthcare.gov and how the waterfall approach versus the agile approach  which is a really a really good article i think that makes a lot of sense they use the waterfall  approach or yeah they use the waterfall approach which is you know the sort of traditional here's  this giant set of requirements programmers go away somewhere and three months from now they  you know present you a complete and fully built system whereas agile is more of an iterative  uh you know mini sprint with deliverables and requirements that change throughout kind of  approach that's all really that's all really useful and you know design patterns like model  model view controller which is what you know what rails is i mean you have frameworks that are built  sort of around those uh around those design patterns those are all really you know useful  to know uh and just different approaches to structuring your app um but yeah i mean kevin's  point about frameworks you know it's like i wrote my own mvc framework and and which which is you  know not something that a lot of programmers want to think up yeah i mean conventional advice is  that you don't re you know reinvent the wheel or rewrite you know a thing that exists i mean there's  plenty of you know rails is mvc code igniter for php is mvc but i wrote my own because like like  kevin said you know when you adopt someone else's framework you get all the stuff that they built  and you know there might be a point where it doesn't do the thing that you want it to do or  there's a leaky abstraction or there's a bug and then you have to you know you're kind of stuck  having to debug you know this other set of code uh so there's you know the disadvantages advantages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and disadvantages to both it's really frustrating to have a bug and not know if it's your code

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yes or the or the framework code right you know my car also runs a whole stack of open source  software you know there could be bugs anywhere right but at least when it's open source you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  debug it and that that's you know that's the piece that's making me a little nervous about the  you know the mathematical thing um because i've been in that you know been both sides of that  problem i've been in the place where i've written code against an operating system or a framework  that is closed source and then you hit a bug and you're like i've i can send a bug report to apple  or microsoft but then i've got to wait for them to do a shipper release and in the meantime i've  got to write a workaround for this and i don't know when they're going to when they're going to  deal with that and that's a structural problem whereas at least if it's open source a you can  debug your way into it and go oh they're doing this thing i can patch that myself and i can send a  pull request to them to try and fix it so that's that is one of the reasons that open source wins  over time is that it's much more resilient because you can you can do that stuff and  propagate the variations on a theme to it so that's the um you know that that's kind of what i was  getting at with talking about the mathematical stuff but it's true of the frameworks as well and  one of the you know one of the metrics people use is how active is this framework of people  actually changing it um and that you know that can mean two things that either mean it's is very new  and um it's not fresh yet it's not ready yet or it can mean at least people are patching it and  paying attention to it it isn't frozen in some you know old model of the world that hasn't changed  and that's it's a continuous challenge for programmers you either side of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um leo speaking of coding i'm really happy to hear that twit is going to have a coding show in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2014 yeah i'm excited about that it will not be at this level so relax everybody's going what  um yeah father robert balancer we're going to take uh do little uh i think eight week modules  with different languages in each module so people can uh find out a little bit about each different  kind of language and basic fundamental concepts it's not for it's for beginners but i think it's  be a lot of fun and we do have some stuff for experts in there too i really lobbied for the  language of the week so that we could talk about things like erlang and haskell and forth and  fortran and whatever yeah it'll be fun that's coming i think i think programming is for me it  was always a wonderful hobby i just enjoyed it i'm never very good at it um but it's also a very  empowering and uh it's not hard and it's a good thing to know and that's why i was interested in  this wolfram alfa because i i love the idea of a higher level uh language that i could use to do  one-off things analytics and the like modeling and so forth uh enough let's uh let's find out what  we've got for our tool and our tip and we're not going to do a number although i'll tell you what  i'll channel jeff and do a number okay let's start with jean's tip of the week my tip of the week is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  actually kind of a set of tips that lifehacker published um how to train google now to give you  better suggestions and i actually really wish that jeff was here for this i'm gonna have to email  this to him um but really really good article just a couple of things on how to make google now better  one is some simple stuff that's maybe not as obvious but you can you know if you add an  address to an event on your google calendar for example you're going to get more info you know  informational cards about how far away your next event is um if you search for something online  there's a little remind me button we've talked about before i was really excited about the new  hunger games movie coming out and i had searched for it a few months back and said hey remind me  when this comes out and i just got a google now card saying hey you know that's awesome fire is  coming out yeah in a week and i got my tickets i'm so excited um yeah and there's also a magic  wand this was new to me a magic wand icon at the bottom of google now settings and if you tap on it  you can say here are the sports teams that i care about here are the shows that i care about uh  here are the stock symbols i care about and it'll kind of you know it'll trigger google now to give  you more information about about that stuff uh that was just added that's part of the google now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  update they just did yeah okay so that is just added yeah yeah so you can actually kind of tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it hey yeah so you tap on that google wand or the magic wand and uh yeah customize google now sports  team stocks places and everything else so you can say hey this is home this is work and google now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  will uh give you give you more this you kind of had to do piece mail so having it all in one um  page uh really is handy i i love google now i keep waiting for more to happen with it so right now  it's team stocks places everything else is are you interested in commute updates for denis appleton  neilson no i don't even know who that is continuing that by the way that is a feature i don't like you  apparently people in your circles somehow can make them their commute updates public and  i get every once in a while i get somebody's commute update and i just i don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you have a lot more questions there than i do mine are just how do you usually get around walking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  biking are you interested in weather updates for work for home well you gotta tell it where your  home is it's really important i probably shouldn't show this card where your home is and where your  work is um this is i love this stuff i think this is really great i love it google now divine that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my work is uh this this coffee shop nearby that i go to wow it's smart it's smart good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so this is good i have to go through these uh these tips um but it does seem to be getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  smarter as time goes by it does it does uh but yeah if you if you want this this lifehacker  article it's just how to train google now to give you better suggestions you just google that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good stuff my number of the week three billion dollars that's reportedly what facebook oh uh  offered snapchats founders to buy snapchat and they turned down although there's a little  code into that because apparently uh it said that google perhaps has been in the bidding for this  it might have even offered them four billion dollars for snapchat something that teenagers  could abandon in seconds if they chose it reminded me of of omg pop and their draw something remember  they were acquired by zynga at the peak of their perfection and they and and you know i was thinking  wow how much does zynga because they of course went a year or two later omg pop went out of  business and was sold uh uh zynga gave them up it it's funny because it was only 200 million  that's all that's all now billions a billion seems low for anything  take at least three billion against snapchat uh and apparently ten cent the what is that that  the japanese social chinese social network is also in the uh in the marketing that's probably why  the numbers got so high but gosh i just can't imagine it's really worth anything well the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing is that it has you know that on some metrics it has as many photos uploaded per day as facebook  itself does and that that's a you know that's a marker of of you know of being the the cultural  thing of the moment so that's but that's the point is of the moment sure but that's that's why facebook  would would like to you know buy it and roll it in and buy it and shut it down either way will be  they'd be happy about that um because they they tried competing with it and it didn't work right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they did whatever that they made poke whatever it was called mark zuckerberg famously coded it  himself right using uh mwc precepts and agile no i don't know what he did agile mvc agile uh yeah  and so uh time for kevin mark's thing and i am this first one i'm really uh it's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  did you go to that event it's tonight um so tonight in san francisco um we're having the  homebrew website club so so last week was the there was the 40th 35th anniversary 38th anniversary  38th anniversary of the homebrew computer club at the computer museum and my friend tantec went  to that and was inspired to say okay i see some parallels with what things are like now um back  then the problem was you didn't have your own computer they were all locked up in big companies  and you had to timeshare to use them everyone of their own computer um whereas now it's kind of  like that with the web suddenly all our all our websites are locked up in big companies um and  we we used to have our you know we used to be able to build things ourselves now that now everything  you make is inside facebook or whatever like or inside google so how about we use the you know  and this is this is the indy web stuff we've been talking about for a while how about we use the  same model that they did at the homebrew computer club and have um a home homebrew website club so  it starts tonight um it's at mozilla san francisco which is um on the embarkadero uh you know like  blocked down from the ferry building uh and it's um and we plan to do this every couple of weeks so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i think this should be fun oh i want to go and what are we gonna get  what's the prize we're gonna get our own webs we're gonna get our own web server running in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  closet or we're going to talk about you know what what what this stuff is you know the indie webs  thing is um what what does it mean to own your own website now and how does that different from  what it meant 10 years ago when we were building blogs and things and a big chunk of that is well  now in order for it to be useful it has to plug into the ecosystem of facebook and twitter and  google plus and snapchat well you're not snapchat but but the point is control but you control it  but you still control it and um you've got to make sure that the stuff you publish is  somewhere that you have control of and that's the debate is the debate you get like purist debates  like well does it count if it's not your own domain if it's just a sub domain of something else and  you know you're in circles like that but it's the the spirit of it i think is really important  because it's it's a it's in a sense it's a marker of you know one of these tech pangelin swinging  back and forth there was an explosion in you know 2000 to 2005 of everyone building their  own websites and then we had a a consolidation wave for you know 10 years or so and now it's  we think there's time for another one of these like everyone can do their own thing  waves again so i'm i'm i'm looking forward to something over there tonight and um you know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you think it's interesting come along i think this is something that's been occurring in my  thinking since day one in fact i remember for a while using a blogging platform i think it was  rail dorn fest who wrote it is now at twitter and um you would just blog to your hard drive  you would create files and structures on your hard drive and then he had a little demon that would  upload it to a website but really lived on your hard drive right um and just i it i've always  thought about this kind of thing um that's why i was really interested in um what was that twitter  clone that we all used for a day um not app net but the but the one that evan prodromo identica

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  identica status net status net yeah and he's now got a new one called pump i o that he's he's written  another one from scratch because he's kind of like that um yeah no that that's all part of it and the  the indie web indie web thing is about that side saying what does it mean to do this and it is it  is you know it's a hobbyist thing at the moment you you're running your own code and um indie  webcam is a sort of series of us saying yeah this ui kind of still sucks but look i can plug it into  this site um but the the hope is that we get to the point where we can actually come up with  interrupt principles and plug these things in and make it more straightforward for people to be able  to build build these things themselves without handing over everything and you know handing over  control effectively to um what becomes the large corporation ah damn you have to install image

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  magic why is everything require image magic i ask you  same thing would think up i'm going along just fine i got i got a server i got a bad i got it  oh i need image what was it edio edio yeah so what is pump i o this is actually intriguing now i see  i get sucked in by all of these things every one of them so pump i o is another iteration of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  same idea is identical except that this time he's put it on our node um rather than on php  and his his is good and it has a you know it has the same activity streams model and can plug into

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that so you have to install node js npm a database server and the graphics magic there's still a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bunch of yeah you know i i thought oh maybe i can run this on roku and i like three hours and i was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like wow oh man yeah so this is this is why we use other people's hosted solutions and managed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  solutions so as i say this this is still like um you know we're still working on this and getting  this stuff smooth enough for humans as opposed to programmers yeah but it's fun hey good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it works with couch base all right that's enough of that so  ah what fun it is kevin marks thank you so much for joining us how's the  are you on a job hunter you're just enjoying life i'm i'm fascinated by this set of stuff and i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  working out what the the job i can make out of this is so this is power the user this indyweb  thing i think you know i think the time is right for this stuff and i don't know what the job is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yet but it'll involve this in some way i agree it's what is the zines what is the zine for 2013

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now it's like you know like 10 years ago i left apple and went to tecna rati because that was the  thing that was the startup there that made sense around that movement and it's that it's that  for me this is this feels like that again it's like okay i've left salesforce um i'm i think  this stuff is really important i'm not sure what what what i get to make here yet but i'm going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be doing something with this good cool i find this stuff uh very exciting and and supremely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is inspiring here because jita has done this and yeah absolutely absolutely jina trapani

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  smarterware.org is her blog site but you gotta go to thinkup.com not too late to participate is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no it isn't well we wrapped up the crowdfunding campaign uh but you can still yeah yeah we we  wrapped it up and we did really well thank you to everybody who listens to twig who who supported  us um and you can still join uh we don't have some of the we don't have some of the rewards  that we had during the crowdfunding campaign but we're yeah we're kind of just going into a quiet  period heads down just building uh the system that'll help us launch on january 15th so i'm  pretty yeah i'm pretty excited about that it's really coming along and what do you call your  custom framework you call it edda my uh my mvc framework is called isosceles actually which is  really really geeky name because it's an equilateral triangle yeah yeah i was actually  inspired by the yeah that the the freedom tower um has those isosceles triangles on the side so i  so i called it that it's on my github account it's free and open source it's php of course  it's very very simple uh but think up is built on it and all of our internal systems are built on  it so anyone's free to free to use it and uh yeah that's that's basically it you know you're a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  programmer when the first six months are spent writing your own tools actually i had built think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up um and i want to use nvc and i built it inside think but i abstracted out the framework because  i wanted to build a couple of other web apps and i was like i want this to be just like think up so  i abstracted out the framework from the think of uh yeah which which i always like to sort of do  that way you know like build the software that actually you know an actual bit of software that  runs versus designing the framework and assuming or thinking or you know thinking of the things i  might want uh so that that was good i was able to abstract out that's a good way to yeah to to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  refactor and say okay this stuff i now need to use more than once this stuff was was specific yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's exactly exactly yeah yeah because you know how programmers yagny ain't gonna need it you  always think you're gonna need stuff that you don't need yeah i need it all but we also get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  run into these abstraction things like what if i have two of those it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
