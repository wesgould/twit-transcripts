Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hi, from our singing and dancing session.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're just fortunate that Jeff and I happen to share your passion.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am very fortunate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because otherwise we'd just be going, oh, come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.  I know.  I'm so I love being with men who are not eye-rolly about my show.  Your passions.  I love your show tunes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I love the view.  So there Jeff Chavis is also here.  He is at buzzmachine.com a blogger and the author.  It's cold.  It's cold.  We, you and I should do a duet.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe it's cold outside.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like a tab versus iPad duet, you know, like the unboxing, the musical version of the unboxing  or the re-boxing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, we need to hire, I want Twitter to hire a promo director that would do this kind of  stuff and say, okay, we're going to get Jeff, we're going to get you and then does all the  work because I don't want to do the work.  Jeff's book.  What would Google do?  Finish sheen the tab.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Huh?  Finish sheen the tab.  Have I sheen the tab?  Finish sheen the tab.  Never mind.  It was a Sondheim joke.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Never mind.  Oh, jeez.  Or too far.  You live in New York.  I don't have any culture out here.  I have, I thought you were talking about the Galaxy tab, which I have seen and I like a  lot.  In fact, you know, I was really prepared to think that the Android tablets were going  to, because Google kind of lowered the expectation, didn't they?  When they said, oh no, 2.2 is not a tablet OS, wait till 2.3, gingerbread.  And now actually they're saying now wait till honeycomb 3.0.  I would disagree heartily.  The tab, which is a seven inch display and Steve Jobs said nobody wants seven is great  because it's smaller than the iPad, a little more portable and great.  Boy, Galaxy tab.  The Samsung screen is not an AMOLED screen, but it's the best LCD I've ever seen, much  better than the iPad.  I'm sure it's similar technology, but I really think they did a nice job.  Very bright, very crisp.  And this was the issue.  I think a lot of people said, oh no, the apps don't scale properly.  I've run into very few apps that don't scale.  Angry Birds looks great on it.  It's just the right size for Angry Birds.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It must be a really good Angry Birds player.  That's for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's all we need.  I don't know what else you would want.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do buttons and tabs and things just sort of expand to fill and it looks exactly and do  they lose, you know, are the designers in the room going to say they lose clarity or  crispness in the expansion?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Those guys already hate the way they're not even looking at it.  We've lost the Grubers of the world a long time ago.  Andy and Natco said, he said on the Mac Break Weekly yesterday, Android looks like they  just threw all the elements out onto the table and they just are kind of any.  I disagree.  I think it's very intuitive.  I don't think it's ugly.  Oh.  It's the same thing Mac people used to say about Windows, you know.  It's not as precious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  I like it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll say that to Andy next time.  A good glee word, yes.  It's not as precious.  It's functional.  It comes with a swipe keyboard and I think a little more space.  It's a lot easier.  It's not as easy.  It's not like the iPad where you have like almost a full size keyboard.  You can't do touch typing.  No, but you can because it's narrow enough.  You can do thumb typing, you know, I mean, you can and you can even hold it in one hand  almost.  This is not the, this is another one.  This is a Arcos.  This is the 70 internet tablet.  This has Android 2.1 on it, I think, but I imagine they'll push 2.2 soon.  It's not as good a screen in my opinion as the Samsung.  It is, which is new for Arcos, it is a capacitance screen.  They do a lot of resistive screens.  I think Arcos has done a very nice job as well though and this is cheap, $2.75 list  for a Wi-Fi and this is one of the things, Jeff, I know you really wanted Wi-Fi only  because you don't want to pay this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to get Wi-Fi only and then I get a Mi-Fi, get the Virgin $40 unlimited Mi-Fi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why pay for the carrier penalty?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, the one thing I was thinking about though is the T-Mobile one does give you  Wi-Fi capability.  Yes.  As does the Sprint.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have the Sprint one.  It also has tethering.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I can get that, but then am I really going to haul it around, if I need my laptop on,  am I going to haul out the tab to turn on the Wi-Fi for my laptop versus just having  that little tiny Wi-Fi thing?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I mean at $2.75, this is a Wi-Fi only device.  It's almost half what the Wi-Fi only iPad is and I think that while I was initially  skeptical about the size of the screen, I think it's actually very usable.  I think you could do a lot of the things you do with the iPad with this.  Now some of the widgets are, as you can see, like the Google widget is weird because it's  so small.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it doesn't stretch the screen.  It doesn't stretch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's possible and really that's an issue.  In my opinion, that's an issue with the desktop, the presentation manager, because I know I  use a third party one that allows me to stretch widgets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now is this the pure Android experience?  You said the swipe is installed.  Is there a scan?  That looks very much like my Nexus One.  This is not the Samsung.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the Arcos.  And I think the Arcos is.  I don't think Arcos has done any customization.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it doesn't have the buy Google or the Google stamp, right?  Because Google hasn't blessed any tablets yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No buy Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No buy Google.  It also has the buttons down here.  Look at that.  It's just the right size for Angry Birds.  I have to say.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a Glee app, damn it.  Where's the Glee app?  Well, there's a Glee app on the iPad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There's a Glee app on the iPhone.  Those bastards.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that, again, this is not the Samsung.  This is the cheaper Arcos that doesn't require a 3G.  So this is really...  Arcos is doing some interesting things.  But I love the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  I have the Sprint one.  The Sprint speed is great.  It's just weird because it feels like you should be able to make phone calls.  I know it's big.  Why didn't you get Sprint?  That's just what...  I got a loaner.  Okay.  So these are all, I should say, these are all loaners.  I know people don't like it when I take loaners.  But I was frankly skeptical.  I didn't want to buy an Android tablet.  And now I'm absolutely convinced.  Now, by the way, the Arcos comes in a lot of form factors.  There is a 10-inch.  That was the 7-inch.  This one is a 4.3-inch.  This is the same as the Evo or the Droid X.  I don't know.  There it is.  This one doesn't seem...  These are cheaper screens.  I think that's where they save money.  But boy, if you want a Wi-Fi Android device, this is the 4-inch screen.  Now, get ready for this.  This is basically iPod touch size.  This is a three, I think a three and a half.  There's even a smaller one than this.  Where's the on button?  I can...  This is one problem with these is I never know where to turn them on.  Maybe there isn't an on button.  Oh, there it is.  This is a resistive screen.  By the way, camera looks almost as good as the capacitance screen.  I'll tell you, when I started using it, I felt like, oh boy, that's a capacitive screen.  I said, no, no, that's a resistive screen.  Thanks to Charbax, by the way, for bringing these all by.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Does that look so tiny because you just had the 7-inch on your hand?  It's tiny.  It's small.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll put the Droid X next to it.  It's small.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an iPod touch competitor, basically, but with a full OS on it and a full browser on it and get ready for this, $99.  No phone, though.  No phone.  This is like a touch.  Touch, okay.  But pretty capable.  These are all ARM-based processors.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm working with somebody on a project that might require handing out devices to somebody when they come into an environment.  You could buy those things in bulk.  Sure.  It's an amazing thing.  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to rewind this video.  See, when it gets this small, you can't...  I can't quite...  I can't rewind it.  Oh, well.  Yeah, for $99.  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  I don't know.  What is that?  Is that GPS?  Oh, tethering.  Tethering.  Look at that.  I don't know if it's USB or Bluetooth tethering because it doesn't...  It would need the tether to get the connectivity.  So anyway, the point is that all these form factors are made possible because it's an open source OS.  And I think choice is great, and I think these are all surprisingly capable.  I like the Galaxy Tab a lot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, those look really interesting.  It's interesting that they came out so soon.  I'm being a little bit of a purist.  I don't have an Android tablet until I have Google's blessing of like, yes, this is what the tablet should be.  I guess that's why I kind of stuck with the Nexus One too, is I like to see Google's prescription of what it should be.  But that's really cool, and it's tempting.  That shot of you playing Angry Birds on that big screen is definitely tempting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is better for Angry Birds even than an iPad.  I think it's just the right size.  The iPad might be a little too big.  It's also 16.9, notice, which means it's appropriate for video in a way that the iPad really isn't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Didn't you travel to New York with the iPad only, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not I. Andy might have. Somebody did.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm trying to imagine where this fits in.  Is this going to go in my briefcase, in your pocket?  It's a little too big for a pocket, right?  This is the size of a Kindle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly the size of a Kindle.  So if you put the Kindle software on here, in some ways it kind of is a Kindle.  I would buy this on a Kindle in a second.  Yeah, it's a little more expensive obviously, but it's a lot more capable. It's color.  It's touch.  I would say the tab, if you didn't mind the 3G cost or you could find a Wi-Fi tab, would be a very good alternative to a Kindle.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, mine just broke so I gave you an excuse.  Yeah, honey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now you know why, by the way, Amazon dropped Kindle prices $230.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It didn't help me in my cause, I know.  Given the choice, you can only buy one iPad Galaxy Tab, which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy, that's tough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think because of the range of software, you're still going to want the iPad.  Oh, okay.  I don't know. It depends what you're doing with it.  I'm an Android fanboy, as you know. I really like the Android OS.  And I'm baffled by all my Mac and iPhone friends who say, oh, it's just not as elegant. It's not as the fit and finish. It's not as good.  It just doesn't, to me, maybe it is kind of the Windows versus Mac.  It's the same thing I said as a Mac user to the Windows people. Oh, you just wouldn't understand.  You don't have any taste.  But to me, this is amazing. Look, if we'd seen this product two years ago, we'd be falling all over ourselves. At $275, falling all over ourselves.  I'm talking about the Art Coast now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that and the fact that you can now get a tiny computer for what now? What's the lowest?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The $99 box on that little one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. That's just incredible, the computing power that is now in hands.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think that because these are multi-touch OSes from the get-go, I think that there is a difference between this and a tablet PC or a laptop.  I mean, these actually, I think this is a mature product at this point, and it works pretty well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is the case, and I know there's other products trying to do this for, I forget the name of it, for education.  But every student in this country should have a device like that.  Yeah, I'm wondering.  They should be studying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm actually wondering if, I mean, I wouldn't want to do a lot of word processing, but then I don't want to do word processing on my iPad either.  I mean, to be honest with you, I'm happier with the MacBook Air because it's got a real keyboard and it's about, you know, it's light and it's portable.  And so that's what I want if I want to do that. I don't want an iPad. An iPad is way too much of a compromise for me. So maybe an Air and a Tab.  Ooh, yeah.  It does feel like, I got to say, it ought to have a phone in it because then I can eliminate the phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, let me just ask. So you can't use a headset and Skype?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can use Skype. And presumably, Charbax is in our chat room, by the way, so if you have other questions for him, he's a guy.  He's from Denmark. He was here for the ARM conference and brought all of these Arcos devices. Thank you, Charbax.  If you were content with Skype or Fring or Google Voice to make your calls, I think it'll work. I think it'll work fine.  I think that that's not, well, I guess, would it be an adequate, I guess it would. I mean, Google Voice is what rings on all my devices.  Yeah. You have the headset.  Yeah, I guess you're right. And the thing is, why carry a phone?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can you turn on the call with Google Voice and headset?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, one of the reasons, yeah. One of the reasons I carry the DroidX is because it's as big as I can get and still have a, we talked about it, a rest pocket phone.  But I might be willing to. Yeah, you wear a blazer, right, Jeff?  Usually, yeah.  Yeah, if you wear a blazer, this is fine. This is a pocket, perfect pocket size. If you don't wear a blazer, I guess you have to carry a man purse or something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wait, now, you can't receive Google Voice calls just over Wi-Fi yet through the app, right?  No, you cannot. I don't think so. Okay. Yeah, that's the only issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Incoming.  By the way, in Europe, they have hacked, or they actually can get the tab with phone support in Europe.  Some of the European carriers do it. And somebody in the chat room is saying you can't hack the tab in the US to make it phone, do phones.  Because you have a phone number, you know, it's 3G. Yeah, it's a little big, but you don't do that. You put a headset in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you put a headset in. Okay. That makes sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, part of the problem is you're buying a $40, I think what's the $40 maximum account for the tab. You're not putting in the $80 a month SIM for a voice account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right. How long before we don't need, we do everything over VoIP, we don't need a carrier, we don't need a cell carrier, we just need bandwidth,  then these devices, take your pick of the size you happen to like, are kind of everything you need, right?  We're there now. And then we're very close.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the next thing you want, I spoke to a bunch of phone executives and I begged them to have an account with multiple SIMs, one account, multiple SIMs.  So when I go into my car, there's a SIM in the car, that's my phone. When I'm home, there may be a SIM in the network, that's my phone.  When I'm out with a phone, and I don't care, that's how Google Voice is meant to operate. The problem now, of course, is that they're forcing us to buy five accounts.  And that's, you know, like I can see them saying that's nice while it lasts, but it makes no sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eventually, they've got to, maybe not, who knows? I mean, who knows with these guys? But you would think eventually they'd have to, you know, give in to consumer demand.  Yeah.  We're talking about Google, The Google, with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis. We thank our sponsors who make this show possible, including the folks at Carmonite.  And Carmonite, if you're going to go to the cloud, you should consider backup in the cloud too.  I know a lot of people use Google Docs kind of for backup because you can upload files, but it's one-sy-two-sy, it's not automatic.  Think of Carmonite as doing that automatically, $55 a year for unlimited data, all the personal data on your internal drive, and the ability to restore it anywhere you can log in, including a free iPhone app, a free BlackBerry app.  Now you're getting an idea what Carmonite is. Carmonite is backup done right. It's just awesome.  I want to encourage everybody who listens to this show to give it a try. You're already kind of in the cloud, I'm sure. So Carmonite just makes a lot of sense.  It's perfect for something like this MacBook Air. Immediately put Carmonite on it. So now anytime I'm online, even if it's at an insecure hotspot at the local cafe, because it's using 128-bit SSL, it's completely secure, backing up all the time, doesn't tie up my computer or my bandwidth only when I'm not using it.  And boom, everything is safe and secure and available for restore or download anywhere I can get online.  Just a few clicks of the mouse. Mac or PC, $55 a year, but I can tell you how you can get it cheaper. You can try it for two weeks free. If you go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG.  And I do like you to try the free trial of all our products. It's one of the reasons we make a big point of it. All our sponsors have free trials.  Well, except Ford. Actually, Ford does. You can test drive, right? So even Ford, they don't give you a free a month, but you know, you can test.  So and the reason is, I think it really this is our advertisers and our way of recognizing you're smart. We don't have to trick you into this. Just try it. See what you think. If you don't like it, no problem.  No harm, no foul. But if you do, now you know this is what it does. This is how it works. So try it free, please. Carbonite.com offer code TWIG.  If you have no credit card needed or anything, if you decide to sign up, do use the offer code TWIG when you sign up for two months off the already low $55 a year.  Carbonite.com. You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right with carbonite. So Google got through. Did you see this? The iTunes store Google Voice for the iPhone.  Speaking of Google Voice, they did it and it's great. I used it. It does everything. When you make a call with it, it calls a Google number like a weird 916. First I thought, wait, no, that's not my freaked out.  So what are you calling? Stop. I don't know them. And then I realized it called the 916 number using routes you and then routes you to the other call using your cell phone minutes. Yes. So this is probably why it's OK. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, the Google Voice app uses your minutes on Android devices too. But the voice app on Android devices kind of masks that intermediary number right now. It didn't used to. But in the beginning, it is a little confusing.  And for a while I was using Google Voice and I had two numbers. I had like people's Google Voice number, which is that unknown 916 and then their actual number. And that gets a little confusing. So it sounds like I haven't tried the iPhone app, but it sounds like it's pretty good.  It's complete. Feature complete. But I heard that it doesn't synchronize the inbox and that it doesn't quite integrate with the dialer exactly the same way it does in Android. But it sounds besides that. It sounds really good. I didn't know what that meant.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Synchronize the inbox. Well, the inbox gets updated and downloaded. Maybe. Well, you know, I have that problem on Android too. I'll delete something from the inbox on Android. And then it comes back and gets it again and puts it back. Have you read that happen?  Interesting. That might just be a bug in Google Voice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I'm looking at, I think it was Google operating system said Google Voice for iPhone doesn't beat the Android app because it doesn't integrate with the standard phone app. It doesn't synchronize the inbox and doesn't offer advanced options for notifications.  Right. That's true. But that's a limitation of the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And that's an iPhone limitation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's an iPhone limitation. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sucky notifications on the iPhone. And it doesn't integrate. Of course, Apple would never let it replace the visual voicemail that AT&T provides. But that's one of the reasons I use an Android phone is the tight integration. I thought there was something interesting here. This is the Google Voice.  And Google made, you know, the screenshots that Google included. I think this is a little slap to Apple. The date of them, July 6, 2009. That's how long we've been waiting for acceptance. They didn't update those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They thought, well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  John Lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't notice that. Johnny, come lately.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That may have been a problem for your coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. I bet there's other stuff in here too. That's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, there's one thing Google has is a sense of humor. So wouldn't put it past them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, not at all. Anyway, that's good news. There may be some features. Apparently notifications are supported in some of the third party Google Voice apps. So maybe there are some reasons to take a look at those. But the Google Voice, the official Google Voice is out free for the iPhone. Hallelujah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I Google Voice is awesome. I love it. I use it all the time. I really love it. I text from my computer a lot more now. Like it's trained me. Like I text with people while I'm at my desk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I live in Gmail now because my phone's there. My SMS. I use the SMS extension. My chats there. It's like every it's like your.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Zuckerberg going to lure you away.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's the question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do you guys think the new Facebook messaging and they're very clear not to say email messaging system.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got a question first. Does this mean that it's another place that people I don't want to hear from can bother me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. No, but in theory, I guess it's kind of like priority inbox in the sense that there will be an inbox that's just your friends and then there's everybody else.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like. It sounds like the people who are super active on Facebook and who and who have a lot of interactions so Facebook can figure out who's most important to you will have the best experience with this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The negative of it is that it's going to mix every there's no subject. So it threads everything from one person as if it all came the same way.  So there's I am mixed in with messages mixed in with chat. It's all or whatever it is that you know it's all mixed together.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Communication around people not topics. Right. Which is the Facebook way to look at it. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think Facebook wants to replace email or thinks this is an ad job.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know I think let's go back to oh dare I say it wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh I knew this was going to happen. I'm sad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think all these guys see is that email is is broken horribly and not fixable.  And so they're trying to figure out what's next. So wave was one effort to do that on a collaborative basis.  This is a way to do it on a social basis as communication.  Why is it so broken and forget spam for a minute. You know even with this is what I think I said this on the show last week.  I die for the busy signal. Right. I die for something that says Jeff's busy you can't talk to him now. Right.  And instead everybody thinks that all I need is three minutes. Why the hell didn't you respond to me you bozo.  I just need three minutes. It's OK. Right.  And that's what our world is now is everybody's getting a piece of you and you can't escape.  You sound like an old man more and more. I do.  You got a piece of me. Did you ever wonder why.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Andy Rooney.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm right there with you though. I really wish that I could have just sort of a global do not disturb sign every once in a while.  Especially when I'm like coding or writing. But now I'm with Jeff. I have a full rant about this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just ignore him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I'm at that point to it. Fred Wilson put a post up and said that he only responds to you if you end up in the priority inbox.  And I realize that's a bad thing to say. I don't know. It is.  And at first I sent an email inviting him to come as he comes once a year to my class.  But I don't bother Fred because I know Fred doesn't like it. Right. That means that I'm now under prioritized.  If I'd been bugging Fred and he sent me email back saying bug off I'd be higher up in his email. Right.  I get disincented from leaving him alone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. But all he has to do is mark his important ones.  Like I have those people who know that I just get in data with email and send me a one good important email every once in a while.  And you just have to be like OK that's important. You know so he's still got to be he's got to be training and a little more.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I agree. I mean he can't stand me and hates me and doesn't want to talk to me. And that's OK Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because we've been trying to get Fred on to I guess we're probably in that box.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're not in priority inbox either.  You know the thing that we've tried to solve was group emails. Right.  It was like that horrible thing that happens when you have 10 people replying to all and branching off into different threads.  Right. Facebook messaging is about I want to see the first message when I asked my significant other out on a date all the way up to the point where I'm telling her I got to go pick up the kids at soccer today.  Right. This this idea of like having this entire record of history between between two people which is interesting.  It's interesting. And you know I kind of feel mad about it.  I'm probably not going to use it. My family members who still use their email addresses and who are very active on Facebook probably will use it.  It makes a lot of sense for the platform I think.  But you know I just don't trust Facebook to respect that archive of communications for me to put you know to give give it all up to them.  But you do trust Google. I guess in some way.  Yeah I mean I guess in some ways I you know I feel a little suspicious of Google the more that they know about me and we'll talk about later with one of their launches this week.  But but yeah the products are so compelling and so good that that that yeah I guess I have sort of decided to trust Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You started buying dresses on on boutique dot com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I don't want to take away. I don't want to take away Leo's tool all the week boutique dot com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that a new Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh you haven't. Oh yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Deal. Google started boutique dot com.  There's no Google branding on it anywhere.  It's basically a search around fashion celebrity and taste.  And so you go on and you go to Anna Paquin's.  Is this it. Is this it. This looks like a farm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No that's not it. No no no that's not it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Did I spell boutique wrong.  It's plural.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Boutiques. Boutiques.  Oh sorry boutiques.  So so Anna Paquin tells them if you scroll down a little bit you'll see Anna's page.  I like Anna because I like I don't know if you're on the.  Suki.  Suki.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Suki. No true blood and glee.  Different ends of the same spectrum.  Indeed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  One blood and death.  The other show too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where does walking dead fit in that. I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Anna tells them what she likes and then Google comes back and says well if she likes this and you like that you'll like this and it recommends all kinds of things.  And it it it abstracts the her what forms she like what's what color she likes.  She likes.  So I can follow her.  You can follow her.  I can follow her.  Like a Twitter.  This is entirely I smell Marissa Meyer on this.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But now when I log in it's because it's not a quote Google property it's not going to I'm going to create a new account.  There's not a Google account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's no Google account on it anywhere. You can't find it.  I mean they did take credit for it on the blog.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting. Why wouldn't they use the Google login.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's it's very weird.  I mean you feel like you're shopping at Macy's.  You know like this is what it looks like the Macy's website.  There's no Google brand anywhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are they really.  Do they have guy stuff.  Oh yeah.  No.  Just women.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah this is for the ladies who are into fashion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well I'm into fashion.  Wait a minute let me see.  I can tell Leo I can tell.  I think I'm going to follow Jennifer and Debbie Mazor I don't know.  This is interesting.  It's all movie stars.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Nobody on there from Glee.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not that I can see.  Jennifer Goodwin is on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I like her.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I like her a lot too.  Yeah.  Caramel again.  So this is kind of weird launch but these this this came out of the I like acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like like like dot com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  Which helps you kind of algorithmically associate patterns and colors and things.  I am a fashion idiot so I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Three of us use Geranimals to match our wardrobes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was like what t-shirt should I wear today before the show.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I used to work at Condé Nast.  I keep the suits.  There you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This I would guess is what we're seeing here is in fact I think Eric Schmidt alluded to  this at Web 2.0 or somewhere recently.  We're not really doing Google Me like an all in one Facebook site.  We're just going to put social everywhere.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what they're doing.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So here by the way you can have your own book.  Gina you can go on make your boutique.  Yeah.  It's social shopping.  T-shirts that you'll like because they found what you like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I will fill it with Pink Geek t-shirts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But this is brilliant because but what really I find most interesting is that Google did  not attach to it and I can only think that's because they think would scare people off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's also inappropriate for the brand.  Right.  It's just not a brand inappropriate.  It's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to buy.  I'm not going to go go you know boutique shopping with geeks.  Right.  And it shows you that Google knows how they're perceived I guess.  They're not perceived as a fashion like brand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean look at it the other way.  Shouldn't Apple have done this?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But would Apple.  But you know I think Apple have the same problem.  I don't think Apple would want to brand it either.  No.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No I get what makes this work is number one search and understanding how to abstract concepts  to make search work.  And then number two you're right Leo.  It's it's it's they're adding in the dash the soup soul of social.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah following and you can create your own thing.  They've got popular.  So these are the popular ones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And here's the other interesting thing to me.  I was at this meeting a week ago about the US Postal Service I mentioned and there was  an expert there from the catalog world.  And as we were talking she asked me well what does this mean for catalogs.  And I realized that the that the function that a catalog provides of curation is no  longer necessary in that form where they have a warehouse filled with stuff and they go  buy it and merchandise it because I can now use Best Buy has an API.  Do you know this Leo?  No.  You could create tomorrow.  I could see.  The Twitch store on top of Best Buy's back end and fulfillment.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's interesting.  Isn't that cool.  So Amazon lets you do that too.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just sharing these boots with my wife because.  Oh you have to log in to share.  I got to create an account.  Well she wanted boots like this.  She's been looking for a good husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh honey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well actually awesome.  Curious.  She won't know the Google Connect or anything.  I'm going to watch carefully her reaction to this.  Like does she like this?  Does she get it?  Would she for instance get her friends and create followers and do all of that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you can imagine the exact same thing with home decoration.  Window treatments.  You know tile and other home building stuff furniture anything with taste.  So what this means is can Google get into taste and is social and search the path there.  And then on the on the economic side what it means is that it's exactly like media.  Is that the and then it's an eventually entertainment as you skip by the old curators the old channels the store.  And now Anna Pacquen has a store and a store from a hundred different brands and designers that can be fulfilled.  The only thing that can be used to this I don't know I didn't look at it enough.  I don't I doubt you can probably do one checkout.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh you know that would that be nice if you could do that.  Of course there's revenue opportunity but maybe they don't want to even bother with that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because it's I know what I helped start believe it or not style dot com.  You did.  Yes.  That's good.  My wife doesn't know that.  Of course I would have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's somebody in the chat room pointed this out.  It's kind of interesting.  The only way you can figure out there's Google in this anywhere.  It doesn't say at the bottom or anything.  You could I bet if you went to about let's see if about us.  No Google there.  But if you go to the help it pulls you to help pages as copyright 2010 Python file.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You get a Python help file.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Help dot pie.  That is a static whiplash.  Shouldn't it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh don't ask us for help man.  There goes the soups all style.  Yeah.  This is it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Topic top pie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is really bad.  OK.  Well Marissa you could work on that.  I'm sure you'll be very busy.  It's interesting though.  I mean they really even in the about us it doesn't show Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Honestly Marissa would be a perfect kind of spokesperson for this.  That's not her thing.  Terms and terms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No no no.  She is in the fashion.  Oh is she ever.  She dresses beautifully and expensively.  Boutiques dot com is operated by Google incorporated.  So you can but you got to dig.  I don't think that's obvious at all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know it's all kinds of interesting things.  Not just jump around here but Amazon did a thing today where they basically become kind of a movie packager.  Where you can submit your movies to Amazon.  Amazon will have kind of a contest and Amazon has a year and a half first refusal rights to take it to Warner Brothers.  Really.  Yeah.  So you just see all these opportunities now where you cut out all the old little and you know what would happen in newspapers is going to happen to every other middleman out there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you think everyone's going to have our kind of personal stores like I like you know Leo and I think one of the most popular people on app brain dot com which is an Android you know Android app kind of curation I think just because we mentioned on the show kind of when it was early.  And Mozilla is building into their building kind of an app store web app store where people can kind of set up like life hacker could set up like a list of recommended web apps.  And it sounds like this is this is kind of the same thing but just here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's the best storage unit that I can give you.  I talked to Philip Kaplan from Blippi.  Pud.  Pud.  And he told the story and I maybe told on the show before so I apologize but Pud said that Matt Cutts came in and bought the app store.  And he told the story and I maybe told on the show before so I apologize but Pud said that Matt Cutts came in and bought that scale that you have Leo that Matt bought it first he gets he gets credit he gave but he gave he gave Matt credit for the takeoff the hockey stick.  Oh yeah.  And so that within a very short amount of time after Matt bought it sorry he did mention you Leo and said you didn't didn't cause the virality.  A hundred people bought the scale.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I sold a few of them.  Maybe not maybe he didn't know through Blippi.  You'd be bitter.  And if you look on Twitter there's a few scales that I might have inspired.  That's fine.  I don't need I don't need credit for some weight loss fad.  I think Blippi is not going to take off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's something that whether Blippi takes off or not I think that Pud is on to something really important and he he went to the next level of what Beacon wanted to be and what in a sense Google's trying to do now there is truly social shopping.  So for people who don't know it's kind of a Twitter it's a Twitter where your credit card is doing the tweeting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or your Amazon your Apple iTunes account your eBay so you sign up and you would attach your accounts and I've been posting here without even knowing.  Frankly because it's all automatic.  Really you.  Yeah.  Well see I just bought Google Voice so I could say yes I recommend that.  And and there you go and I could publish.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you tie you tie Blippi into you know the the the Best Buy API say and you you could have a store going without even having to merchandise it.  What you buy you are recommending to others and others will say oh I'll buy that too and you get a cut of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah that would be nice.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a company I invested in called Covestor by a guy named the wonderfully named Ricky Tata.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's so Ricky you know Ricky Tata and his nickname is Tots.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No I just said Tots because of Glee.  Oh OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Glee connection to everything.  We're going to have to have a Glee.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact our next story there's a Glee connection but go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So so what this does is that is that I can if you're a good investor Gina you can go on to Covestor and again full disclosure as I invested but it's a friend of mine.  And you'll do whatever you want to do.  He set up the structure so that I can put my money at my broker and it just follows you.  It does whatever you do.  And because of that you make a cut.  Now my money never you never touch my money actually but you make money from basically becoming a one woman mutual fund.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well that's just a that's just a pyramid that's a pyramid marketing right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No it's not. No it's not because because what's happening there is that Gina never gets touches any of my my actual funds.  They stay in Schwab or whatever.  I'm following her. I'm literally following her.  So when she buys Google I buy Google when she sells Google I sell Google.  I don't do a thing because she publicized herself as really good.  Is somebody doing this because this is brilliant.  Covestor.com.  Shoot.  Ricky Tata.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah that's interesting.  Very interesting.  And so now now take that to that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now there's money to be made.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now I can I mean for the follower there's a reason to do this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now you do the same thing with with Leo's electronics store.  Yep.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And Leo's app store every time Leo installs an app on Android I would love to just get a push get a push down to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I'd love to get 10 cents.  Right.  Well and we've done this and this is that Mark Zuckerberg no one wants to make lists.  We've done this kind of we have to it recommendations and it uses our Amazon affiliate code is too much work.  And that's why Blippi and I would guess Covestor and all these are smart because they're automatic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So so you can start to follow the whole idea of following that was so important right really takes off.  So that's where Pud is on to something I think.  So whether it's done at Blippi or not.  Well what should happen here is it's fairly obvious is that Zuckerberg should buy Blippi.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And does he need Blippi.  He doesn't really need Blippi.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No he doesn't.  The problem is with his with his privacy headaches of the past that's going to be a really touchy thing.  Oh yeah.  You're going to try to talk about with your credit card man.  Yeah.  Somebody is going to get that.  And he has Beacon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're right.  This was the whole idea of Beacon.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And when I interviewed him you know he said I said Beacon was just really said no because it was a mistake.  We did wrong with it.  And he said that Blippi you know you're choosing to do it there.  I think that's the big lesson he learned.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well but I think that's also why Blippi is not going to catch because I think it no people are too many people say no I ain't doing that even with Blippi.  Who would you trust that data with.  No one not Google not Apple not Facebook not any big player.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well I trusted to a stupid credit card company and bank and the banks are all corrupt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's why Gina and I ended up saying OK Mint's OK because we know that it's the same intermediary that the banks use though they already know all that.  But all right so Mint that's smart.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Mint should buy Blippi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mint should buy Blippi.  There you go because they already have all the information.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then I can export my recommendations from Blippi to Blippi Twitter or Facebook or wherever I want because it's in my interest now because I'm going to make 10 cents every time you buy this wonderful shirt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the key is you got to make money for people because they're not going to give you that information unless they see a real value to it.  Right.  Sure takes a lot of work.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Giving over your information to get free content to hell with that.  Give over your information.  Give me some money.  Give me some money.  The problem is it then makes you suspect.  All Leo keeps shilling for blank and all across the street buys blank.  That's a good point.  But then I'll stop buying.  I'll stop following you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah I also want some degree of creation like I just because I bought something doesn't necessarily mean that it's proven like I would like kind of a list of stuff that I bought and be like yes I did like this.  No I wouldn't have bought you know that kind of thing.  Well that's what Blippi is asking for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say they're very big on getting reviews of everything you buy.  Reviews later.  They bug you until you review it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other thing about Blippi is that it creates a transparent pricing marketplace.  The opacity of pricing is over.  Right.  You just can't do that anymore.  So so that you're going to have to companies are going to compete on quality and service.  This I like.  And so on.  So but Blippi definitely tells you at a minimum this is what a hundred people paid for this item and where I can go get it.  So so you know when that happens that has a drastic impact on commerce and the economy.  Right.  But Gene I think I think the other thing you could do is you could have queries back.  It's kind of like Quora.  Right.  Gene about these 10 things.  I'm about to book you know Gene about this expensive thing.  I then get to query you and say did you like it.  And if you've got enough people querying you you'll you'll go the trouble maybe of answering.  And then that ups the credibility of that recommendation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  I mean that happens manually all the time.  People say oh you bought this phone.  What do you think.  Do you got the tab.  What do you think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep yep.  Well Google buys everything.  Yeah I do.  So I'm not as good as a for.  In fact that's very careful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  So when Gina buys this when Gina buys the tab I'm buying that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want somebody who's very frugal.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cheap I think is really.  Cheap that's the word I was looking for.  Hey look at this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google goggles is trying out ads.  Here's another way Google's looking at making money.  What's the story here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can take a picture of an ad for certain advertisers that they made a deal with and  it brings up the web stuff which is kind of funny in two ways.  One is you all over the QCAT.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  QCAT was this incredibly stupid thing was a barcode radio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Radio Shack gave them away because they wanted people to use them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're supposed to read your newspaper next to the computer wired in your computer and  scan.  Why were you doing all this trouble because URLs were just too broad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon dot com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the other thing is so that's why it reminds me of QCAT.  That's why I got to get that on my head.  But the second thing is I wonder whether this corrupt search in a way because if I use Google  goggles purely I could take a picture of a Buick ad and say I want to make a search of  Google for that.  I don't want to go to the ad.  I want to say Internet what do you know about the Buick.  And that's how Google goggles is.  It's a pathway to search.  And now if somebody can kind of what you're doing is you're buying the search result.  Buick is buying a search result and I don't know if I like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  It's not quite the same as a page of search results with our sponsored links at the top  which are clearly clearly marked.  Isn't this just like a less geeky QR QR code.  Right.  I mean this is just recognizing something that doesn't look like a box full of static.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm trying to understand how it works.  It's a marketing experiment.  Let's listen in.  I want to tell you about an interesting experiment.  Let's not listen in.  OK.  I have a very short attention span.  So you take a picture of a book.  This is goggles and then goggles would say oh here's the book.  Here's where you can buy it.  Amazon and so forth.  So that's traditional.  That's the odds that goggles has worked all along.  Now you take a picture of an ad.  It says oh and finds all the things in the ad including the T-Mobile G2.  Well that's interesting.  That's OK.  All right.  OK.  And then oh look I found a G2.  And then what.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it is just like sponsored links.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's pulling you.  I thought you went to the ad.  OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are wrong.  It pulls you to a sponsored link for T-Mobile.  T-Mobile is going to pay you.  Pay you.  All right.  So that when you take a picture and you see a G2 the first hit is an ad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw some promotion for it that looked like it went straight to the ad.  OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It skips a step.  OK.  So he just took a picture of a Buick and is searching and takes you to Buick.com.  Oh that's the problem.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OK.  It looked like you had a choice there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the director of advertising promotion at Buick says we like this a lot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What if what I want to see is the recall on the Buick and all the accidents.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an interesting use of Google Goggles.  I mean that's not like that's a little bit different right.  It's not perverting search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well but isn't it Leo if Google Goggles is just a visual search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's not now.  We're saying well what if it's not.  What if I take a picture of Tron Legacy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  More and more users are conducting visual searches to explore the world around them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They just call it a visual search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're looking forward to learning how to deliver the most meaningful and relevant visual search results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the most valuable to us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want your algorithm not your sales guide to tell me what's being told.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No I agree with you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Interesting.  Watch it Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well they do say it's an experiment.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Why am I going to take a picture of an ad.  I guess.  I mean I guess I guess people are doing that.  I don't know.  Do you either of you use goggles very often.  Silence shaking the head negative.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No use for it.  I have it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean if I saw a QR code I'd pull it out.  But but we're nerds.  So and we know what a QR code is and we know what to do with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So but OK Google by the way I want to clarify this says you can enable push notifications in the Google Voice app on the iPhone for voicemail and text messages.  So I'm not sure what it what that review that you're reading was meant when it said you couldn't.  So just to clarify we're going to move along here.  Oh my God.  Gina just fell off the face of the earth.  Well while I come back.  Come back.  Well Gina.  Well we we attempt to recover Gina the black hole into which she has tumbled.  I would like to talk a little bit about our friends at Ford and the incredible Ford Edge which is the most technologically sophisticated Ford on the lot.  And I mean it.  I drove it to a blog world.  It was so much fun.  Great design.  Beautiful aerodynamic exterior but a very slick interior.  In fact it reminded me a little my Mustang.  I could see that the same designers had worked on it.  It was very clean sleek spare.  It has the Ford my Ford touch which means there are two screens behind the steering wheel on the on the dash that can be changed.  So it was a tachometer and like the music application but you could change them.  And then it's got a great big screen.  I think it was a seven or eight inch screen in the center console that your GPS and your other your other controls the eight inch touch screen in the center stack which is just fantastic.  We should not ignore the engine and the fuel efficiency.  It's got that great three point five liter T.I. V.C. TV six engine two hundred eighty five horses under the hood.  And yet twenty seven miles highway miles to the gallon according to the EPA.  You could also get the sport with more horsepower three hundred five and two hundred eighty foot pounds of torque.  I love my Ford touch. It's kind of Ford sync on steroids.  It's just really so great.  Take a look at the edge. If you're in the market for a larger car we have good friends who are a self-admitted Ford family which I love.  I didn't even know it.  It's funny until we started talking cars.  I had no idea.  And I said oh you're right.  All you ever drive is a Ford.  That's all I ever see you.  And yeah we just got the edge.  We were looking for a car with great second row legroom and there is no car in its class with better second row legroom.  It's just very comfortable for the people in the back.  The panoramic Vista roof is an option.  You can have it both in the front and then the fixed rear skylight.  So the backseat folks get a little bit of light too.  I love the edge.  Take a look at it.  If you're in the market for what do you call it?  Is it a sport utility vehicle?  I guess it is.  Yeah.  Take a look at the Ford Edge.  Unfortunately now my wife took a look at it and now that's what I have to get for her.  Already.  She's amazing.  All right.  Gina's back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  Not at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I scared you away.  Internet.  Internet.  Doesn't like me.  Internet.  So you won't like this.  Here's the glee story.  So we've got a complete set now of networks that won't appear on Google TV including Fox.  Bummer.  Bummer.  Now Schmidt has a rationale or as a, I don't know if rationale is the right word.  He has something to say about the fact that a lot of networks now, in fact all the major  networks are blocking Google TV.  He says, guys, you're cutting yourselves off from greater revenue potential.  With Google TV consumers would watch more of your programming.  I guess that's true, right?  He says the way to get more revenue is to create more revenue sources.  The way to do that is through things like Google TV.  He says we don't want to drive television revenue to zero.  We want to make the revenues larger.  So why is it the networks are so afraid of putting their internet content on the television?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's what we talked about last week.  We're disintermediating the networks.  We're going to get to our shows around networks.  The networks right now still have the clutch on it.  But it's not a big leap at all to see somebody of note.  Can the internet support Lee right now?  No.  Could it support Howard Stern?  Yes.  Could it support an inexpensive sitcom?  Yes.  And so they can go directly to viewers around the networks, giving the networks not a cut  of it at all.  And the more in the habit we get of that, the better off the producers are and the worse  off the networks are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I don't know if these are numbers of yours, but the US consumers pay $70 billion a year  in cable and satellite fees.  $70 billion.  So that's what's kind of at stake because I guess you could just buy cheap internet  instead of buying the expensive cable and satellite.  He says Google's talking with the industry.  They're sharing data to help persuade broadcasters, ABC, CBS, NBC, and now Fox to unblock the  network.  Hulu is also blocking.  Hulu Plus doesn't work on Google TV.  I got a boxy box because I wanted to compare it.  It doesn't have anything either.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do you think this is YouTube blowback?  Do you think this is the networks being like, oh, well, you don't help us pull down pirated  content from YouTube fast enough?  They do.  And they do.  They do.  Too much, right?  Well, yeah, they pull us down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they'll pull us down already for some of the things we've done on this show.  I still don't know how they're doing it technically.  It's pretty amazing, isn't it, that they can...  I mean, what is it?  It's now...  I saw the new number, something like 34 hours a minute of videos being uploaded to YouTube.  It's another huge number again.  And somehow they mechanically go through everything looking for some sort of watermark.  I would guess...  I don't know, Gina, you're a programmer.  You might know better than I, but I would guess that the networks provide signatures  of some kind.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, for them to figure out how to...  No, no, I was saying how are the networks blocking?  I mean, they're not using the user agents.  Well, how do they block it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  Yeah, they're not using the user agents because you can change it and it still doesn't go...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  I'm curious about that.  I mean, they're just...  They're differentiating between screens.  The screen in your living room isn't okay, but the one in your office is okay.  It's strange.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, it's just Chrome and then you could tell it...  I'm Chrome running on Windows XP.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'm just curious about that.  There must be something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There must be something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anybody in the chat room?  They say it's based on the version number of the Flash plugin.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, well, that seems like something that would be easy to spoof.  I know that this isn't the point, but...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That can't be right.  They say it's the Flash plugin.  The Flash plugins have user agents.  So the same thing happened in Android and you just hack it.  It's just not as easy to hack Flash, right?  It's easy to change the user agent in Chrome.  It's a menu command, but you can't do it quite so easily.  However...  Well, see Adobe is going to continue to do that.  They don't mind this, or do they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other thing is that the publishers complain that when Google sends them audience,  Rupert Murdoch says it's worthless audience because it's out of market or it's one stop wonder or whatever.  When Google TV sends a viewer to a show, it's great audience.  Schmidt is right. It's exactly targeted.  This is somebody who wants to watch the show and nope, can't.  Sorry, not because you came from there. Your friend Google recommended you.  Oh, I don't trust you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Also, they get so much more information about the viewer when you view it through the web browser.  Yeah, that's what I think Eric is trying to say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He said we're sharing the information we know about our audience with them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, location, IP address.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  One word, antitrust.  Oh boy.  I mean, this is the network's acting as one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. It is colluding, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is and Google's the victim.  Everybody's scared of being old bad Google, but Google's the victim in this case and thus are we.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We also showed off the new Nexus S.  This is a replacement for the Nexus One, which is an HTC device.  This one is from Samsung, right?  I think so.  Yeah, it kind of has that Galaxy S feel to it.  It will be a true Google phone.  It'll be running on or he was running it on T-Mobile.  It has NFC features, which is kind of interesting.  In fact, Schmidt says he thinks these phones will eventually replace credit cards.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So tell me what's the difference between NFC and Bluetooth or any sort of it's just a short range kind of wireless.  We're like RFID, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like an active RFID that can actually send data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They were saying that you could like you could tap the phone and you could pay for something that way.  And it is sort of like RFID.  I guess with Bluetooth you have pairing.  But that's basically this.  You know, that's the idea.  Right.  Yeah, but I guess it's shorter shorter range.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bluetooth 30 feet.  NFC stands for near field communication.  Let me look on Wikipedia.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They say it's like those those cards on the subways.  You guys wouldn't know what subways are here in California.  But on the subways, I'm man of the people.  You can just tap now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I've heard the people ride around in a hole in the ground.  Yeah, yeah.  And Brooklyn, Brooklyn.  Come on.  The Bronx is up and the battery is down.  Ten centimeters is only four inches.  That's that's the big difference.  So and that's important because if you don't have something, if you have something with Bluetooth, that means everybody within 30 feet can receive your signal.  This you have to actually tap it or get it within four inches.  So let's do things like bump, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is in fact related to RFID.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now go back.  Pardon me to Blippi.  Right now, your phone is your credit card.  It's how you're buying everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it has an Internet connection.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it has an Internet connection.  And it has this kind of connection so that you can kind of say, I want to tell the world about that.  I want this delivered there.  I want that.  You know, forget the stores.  Yeah, stores are calling.  Toys are toast.  I went to Des Moines some time ago and was just amazed downtown.  There were no stores.  It wasn't a depressed downtown.  Just there weren't any stores.  And it goes back to this idea.  What was there?  A lot of restaurants?  No, not even that.  Just kind of boring office buildings and a few drugstores.  It was it.  It was weird.  But that's the future, I think.  And because you can't, the risk you have to go through to hold on to inventory in many, many locations is going to be very, very high.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to turn to those fat slobs in Wally.  Riding around our little hover carriages.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  With virtual reality glasses on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now you see the ad.  You tap the billboard and say, I want.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't even have to get out of your hover chair.  No.  Schmidt also said, clarified anyway, I guess we knew this.  Android is for touch devices.  Chrome OS will be for keyboard devices.  So that's why it's netbooks.  That makes sense now.  I get it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that's good that he articulated that difference.  You think they always saw that difference so they just made it up.  You know, when Job said that you don't interact, you know, touch devices, you can't interact with them kind of standing up.  And that's why the airs are OS X.  That makes sense.  That was the difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apparently, Apple's made the same distinction.  That's what iOS is versus OS X.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess you got somebody here on Twitter for ninety nine ninety nine said Jeff Fox held out for one hundred fifty million dollars.  Oh, he will.  Why would they let Google have their content for free?  Did Fox get one hundred fifty million dollars?  We have this is the whole retransmission.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, cable vision.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  And cable vision tried to hold out.  They couldn't forever, but they tried to.  And there's a difference.  I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, there is a difference because that was the only way those people in Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey could get.  Fox five.  But Google TV is just one of a lot of choices, right?  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so who has the other hand?  If if if if cable vision had held out, they never came to an agreement, wouldn't it be in Fox's interest to then be on Google TV or choices?  Yeah, it's it's it's against cable vision should be the one who's fighting.  That's a good point.  That works.  That's what gets disintermediated is the cable companies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not.  Yeah.  Why is why are the content creators get worried about it?  Because they're not content creators.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're just they're another middleman.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're another middleman.  OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The studio is eventually going to go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they say, OK, well, it's Domino's.  So cable vision or Comcast falls, becomes an Internet service provider.  At least they still have a business.  What do we do?  It's taking a thread out of the sweater and starting to pull.  Yeah.  Matthew Weiner doesn't go to go to AMC to make Mad Men.  Mad Men.  He goes to you know, he goes directly to I don't know.  Well, some what?  Well, here's here's the other big deal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The fact that I think I don't know if this is last week or not, but on the quadrangle  conference, you had Michael Eisner doing a deal with AOL.  So this is the start of this.  This is the unraveling the sweater where Eisner is making shows and AOL is going to have an  exclusive on it rather than him going to AMC.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Come back pretty soon.  We got to get to our tips, our tools and our number of the week.  Gina Trabani, Jeff Jarvis is here.  Just a quick mention of our domain name service that we use and we recommend you use.  You know, I don't like the other guys.  I don't like their ads.  I don't like their attitude.  I don't like the crappy website.  In fact, they're all horrible.  Just go just for just get a breath of fresh air.  Go to twig.hover.com.  It's clean.  It's simple.  They don't upsell you with a bunch of stuff.  It's not 90 clicks before you check out twig.hover is as in cover, H-O-V-E-R.com.  I guess you could pronounce that Hoover, couldn't you?  But it's not.  It's hover.  Very clean, very simple, very easy.  You can use it for a domain.  They've got all the biggies.net.com.org.biz.info.ca.us.cc.tv.bz.me.t.  I never heard of some of these.  Look at these, all the UK ones.  You can have it.  They don't do hosting.  So don't look for them to upsell your hosting.  They do mail forwarding and they do DNS forwarding.  And for $25, they'll transfer all your domains, make it very easy.  I wish I had done that because those other guys locked my domain.  They saw that I wanted to move it off of theirs.  They support webmail, if you like.  It's so great.  H-O-V-E-R.  And by the way, if you use the offer code twig, you'll save 10% off your domains.  And they build in things too, which is nice, like the privacy, domain privacy.  Because the other guys charge you for that.  No, that's just, you get ho-viz privacy for free with hover.  Hover.com.  Domain transfers are free.  But they will charge $10 and give you another year past the current expiration date at the time of transfer.  So that was nice.  I thought that was a good deal.  So go to twig.hover.com and use the offer code twig when you buy to get 10% off.  Look at, I don't have to upsell you on this.  Just go there.  There's the no-hold policy for calls made during business hours.  It's from two cows.  Used to be domains direct.  Maybe you're used to them.  H-O-V-E-R.  H-O-V-E-R.  That's what we're transferring all of our stuff over.  As soon as that paternalistic other company lets me.  We shall remain nameless.  They've got a new cute girl instead of the old cute girl, I noticed.  I don't understand the connection between that and domain registration.  I really don't.  I'll never understand that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room is saying you should do an ad in a shower with a blonde and you can sell a lot more domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the rest of this hot commercial, go to my website.  Steamy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just resented that I go there and there's nothing more hot.  So it's like, come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I want Leo in a towel in a bathroom doing an Old Spice style commercial for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Odakta could do it, I could do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually did.  I was down at the radio station in Los Angeles that I started at, KFI.  The Citrix, the GoToMeeting people were there and they said, would you do a GoToMeeting ad for us?  I said, sure.  They said, we need you to take off your clothes.  I said, what?  But it was Hollywood and I was young.  I'll do it.  Yeah, I thought of Jeff, actually.  So they said, well, don't worry.  We'll block.  We'll go from here down to your knees with the thing.  And then the ad copy something like, I'm meeting right now with GoToMeeting.  I don't even have to get dressed for work or whatever.  Oh my God.  Did they have it?  I did this.  And then they sent me the sample.  And the banner, instead of being here to here, started, I mean, it was kind of narrow.  It was a thong.  It was practically a thong.  GoToMeeting.  Thank God it's a long name.  Wow.  No, they really could have just called it.  I'm Google Imaging this right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, it's gone.  No, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I freaked out.  I said, you can't use that.  So they made the banner bigger.  So now it's just neck down.  But apparently there are bootleg copies floating around.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody out there on the Internet, you know you have that photo.  It was on YouTube.  Copy it.  Send it on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was on YouTube for like three seconds.  There were only like 10 views before I got it pulled down.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, Gina, your tip of the week, my friend.  Tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This week, really simple one, but useful, especially for those of you who are getting the tab or have an iPad.  Mobile editing and Google Docs.  Yay.  Yeah, yeah.  If you go to docs.google.com on iOS or Android, I think it's Froyo or better, you can hit an edit button and you can edit regular Google Docs.  So they have already supported spreadsheets, editing spreadsheets, but now you can edit regular.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what fooled me because I've been able to edit spreadsheets for a while because I have, you know, my We Rule spreadsheet, which I tell you which crop is the best to raise on your medieval farm on the iPad.  But now I should.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is rolling out of the next couple of days.  So hopefully by the time people hear this, it will work for them.  I do not have the edit button yet, but it is coming out.  That's how you'll know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There'll be a button that says edit on your Google Docs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can edit button in your in your docs and it's kind of as you type.  So if you're typing on your phone, your collaborators will actually see your changes as you type.  Well, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. That's really neat.  Hallelujah.  And that's on all mobile.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's Android Froyo or better and iOS.  So it sounds like, you know, they're getting ready to release an Android tablet because on a tablet being able to edit Google Docs.  Big deal.  And isn't it a pain to get docs up in the cloud from iPad?  Right.  You can't get a third party app really is what you have to get.  So now you can edit docs from your iPad and Google Docs and have them just kind of sync to the cloud.  That's great.  Or just be in the cloud.  They're not syncing you.  They just live there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  We'll look for our edit button.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Look for that edit button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's how many pounds Bob use lost after he saw himself with a profile view in Google Street View.  Take that, Germany.  And he was so proud at his weight that according to the Telegraph, he had weighed 21 stone, three pounds.  Chat room, how much is that?  Everybody know what a stone is?  That's better than a Google calculator.  How much is a stone?  And then he went down to 14 stone, otherwise known as 89 kilograms.  Give me pounds.  So that's amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  What a stone.  I mean, really, come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Come on.  Ninety four pounds.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How medieval can you get?  So this is the picture that we saw on Google Street View or he saw.  So he horrified him.  And it inspired him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, I'm fat.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So he really.  It's funny though that they pixelated his face, but he knew that was his belly.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, every mother would recommend that actually used to be the rule when I worked at NBC.  The rule was if your mother could recognize you in the picture, then you were not sufficiently obscured.  And obviously, Google needs to follow that rule because his mother could tell that was him, even though his face is blurred.  But he's not German.  No, no, this is English.  That is actually fairly horrifying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.  But it's not a Greek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of understand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But when I applaud that he.  Yeah, it's like owning that scale you bought Leo.  You know, it's kind of same idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't help me at all.  Only more people know how fat I am.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there an after-picture?  It works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't see that.  He joined a gym, started to exercise with a personal trainer, ate right.  He'd lost 100 pounds.  Wow.  That's really a nice story.  My tool of the week is something brand new from hotspot.  Sorry, from Google.  If you go to Google.com.  And this is confusing.  It is not hotspot.  It's hot pot, which is a Mongolian dish.  Yeah, I don't understand.  But it is actually pretty cool.  And it's clearly Google's response to Yelp.  Google already has Google Places and lots of businesses are in there.  My business is in there.  The first thing you should do if you have a business is make sure that your directory,  it's free, is correct and all that.  So these are all from places.  And then you can very easily rate them.  So I happen to like Lagunitas Brewing Company quite a bit.  So I'm going to give it five stars.  And then it says, I'm going to say in my tip, just like Yelp, try the beer garden.  And then you get to, now the food is very simple.  It's not Zagat quality ratings here.  It's either a happy face or a sputter.  Yeah.  And the value is good.  Okay.  And then you publish this and now there's a review and you can see other people's reviews.  You can follow friends, kind of like Latitude.  You can see what your friends review.  You can get recommendations.  This is more of their social and everything.  This is exactly it.  And when I go to Paris, you can be sure I'll be using this.  This is a clever Google hot pot.  It is.  It's there.  And I see now what they're doing.  They don't have to do Facebook.  They have to just do a lot of little Facebooks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what's more?  I mean, right now, this, Yelp, Facebook Places, and Foursquare.  What else?  And what's the travel one, Nike?  I keep forgetting the name of it.  Travel one.  Tripit?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, TripAdvisor maybe.  TripAdvisor.  Yeah.  Well, look at In-N-Out Burger.  Everybody loves it.  Twenty fabulous reviews.  Great wine list.  Amazingly knowledgeable.  Helpful service.  It's a hamburger joint.  I don't think they got wine there.  I could be wrong, but I don't think so.  Google.com.  Not hotspot hot pot.  Sorry.  Have I been where?  Chipotle.  No.  I just gave Twig Cottage and Petaluma six stars.  I think you should too.  Thank you.  You know, this launch is an interesting hot pot.  You know, you kind of could tell the difference.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.  It's a hot pot.  You know, this launch is an interesting hot pot.  You know, you kind of could tell they learned something from Buzz.  Like you have to build your whole friends list again.  And it tells you that you've got a public, all your reviews are public and you have to,  you can set a different nickname.  Like it seemed like they were super careful about the privacy settings, which I think  was interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not the same.  Yeah.  But is that in the long run really the best thing to do?  I mean, don't we not want to have to make this list over and over and over again?  We don't.  I hate, I hate being friends with.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why Google especially wanted you to be able to export your friends?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just, you think that you would want the same friends.  Right, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You think that you would.  It was also really, really good.  I Google places on the go all the time.  It was really good at showing me places that I've been or have been interested in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it uses, that's an interesting thing.  It uses your web history.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it uses your web history.  So I had this moment of like, oh, Google knows so much about me.  Look, it knows all these places around me that I like.  So I had a moment of, you know, when you go to a therapist, you kind of confess all these  secrets and then the therapist repeats them back to you and you're surprised.  Like that's kind of how I felt.  Like, oh yes, I have given you all this information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't know there were that many dungeons in San Diego.  I'm just teasing.  So I got a gift from Google because I did register Google places.  You know, the way they register it, you can do it by phone, but if you don't have a phone  number registered, they will send you a postcard, which you then enter the code in.  And then it says, oh yeah, you must really be at 8 Keller Street.  So I guess that's how they, that's how they're rewarding me.  Here it is.  It says Google places user at 8 Keller Street inside a thank you gift from Google.  I can only imagine what wonderful, I thought I saved it for the show.  What wonderful gift.  Thanks for helping keep Google places up to date.  A $100 gift card for Google ads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's nice.  Don't use my gift card.  Oh, go ahead.  Y'all can use it.  There you go.  The first person to use the $100 wins.  All right.  Did you get the screen grab?  Wonder what happens now if a thousand people all try to use that gift card.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're going to be on a do not fly list.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, if you want to, if you, we didn't talk about it here.  I suppose you probably both as a frequent flyers as I am as upset about the TSA  regulations as everybody else seems to be.  There is a great conversation that we had on Twitter this week with O Doctor and  Brian Brushwood and O Doctor talking about the friendly search that he got  according to the new rules coming out here.  And apparently that's made it everywhere.  It was on the Drudge Report.  Hannity mentioned it.  It's been on radio stations all over the country.  Of course we get no traffic from it because everybody links their own copy of it.  But I, um, it's brand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I disagree with you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's brand building.  I'm okay with it.  You think it's okay for them to stick their hand down your pants?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We are going to Europe and they've done the round the belt thing.  It ain't round the belt, dude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you understand it's not round the belt.  They will.  They squeeze your genitals.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
