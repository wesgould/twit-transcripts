Look forward to that  Yeah, me too. You're still in New York though. You haven't left. I am in New York City at the moment yet  All right, also here from Austin, Texas  It's Stacy Higginbotham of the iot podcast dot com  Fame and Stacy on iot. Hi Stacy  Hello feels like you were just here. You were on Twitter Sunday, which was great. Thank you. Oh  Super fun. Yeah, love having you on to on the on Twitter because it's a  Introduce you're gonna call it the big show  Busted I pity your husband man. Oh, I just said I'm sorry  And then that was all you had to hear to know exactly where I was going  Anyway, we're glad to have you on the little I mean the twig  And of course right now nobody's talking about anything but Apple and that'll that'll be for the next few days  Anyway, Apple's big event was this morning. They announced a new iPhone  Seven and I've I've thought for a while this might be an opportunity for Android devices  Because the rumor was Apple was gonna drop the headphone jack and then deed they did in a move that Phil Schiller called courageous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Okay, I've got kind of a counterintuitive take here if we want to learn about the Internet of Things some more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to learn about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think it is courageous in the sense that they're making a bet on the future that's gonna alienate a lot of people today  So, I don't know is that courageous it is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a phone if they're making a bet  I mean if you really think there's a that's what I'd like to hear. Is there a  Coherent reason to drop something that works so darn well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here is my thought  Imagine that you today you want to control home kit  You have to talk into the Apple TV remote or you have to talk into your phone. You have to say hey Siri lalalala  Imagine now you have something just on your ear and then it has paired with all of your devices from the iCloud  Once you get contextual clues and you can see Apple building this you could basically walk from your you know phone  Where your wherever your phone is into a different area and start talking to that device in your home in a sense  They've kind of one up the Amazon echo which is room dependent. This is you dependent now. That's a little crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait a minute why does taking the headphone jack enable that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you don't have that you don't have wires in your phone on you  I can walk around with some stupid it like I don't know  I used to have way back in the day like a Plantronics earbud thing that I would disconnect from my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were you one of those dorks that would walk around with you? Yes. Yes, I was I was a journalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you're just like you have to stay on the phone. You're living on the phone. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're like Ari Gold on  Entourage you just you never take that out. You just always yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you imagine that or just picture picture the movie her  You didn't see him like taking out his headphones as he moved from locale to locale. He just I don't know what he has

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point because what he had was somewhat like the air pods that Apple announced which was a device  That was at earbud, but also had a now his didn't have a little microphone, but Apple has a little tube  That's a microphone and some apparently sophisticated technology in the air pod to beam form so that it knows what the ambient noise is  It can aim, you know, it can it can in some way be better  That's kind of isn't that what the Alexa does with its array microphone is it's a far-field mix far-field mics  It's able to pick you up at a distance and figure out what you're saying  Even if there's background noise, so maybe maybe in that sense, you're right the the air pods would help with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, so that's my take and it's courageous only in the sense that people are gonna be like  These are a really expensive B easily lost right see I have to charge them all the stuff people are already complaining

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So their move is really not I mean in other words the wired headphones  They're including in the box with the with a lightning port and the adapter that they're including the box is really just an interim  Stopgap towards moving towards the wireless future that we all  Will exactly that actually you know what you that does kind of make sense I hate to admit it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, and I agree that that was the thing that jumped out at me was that the the pairing of the earbuds the phone was so  seamless and  Supposedly on the air supposedly right? Yeah  And and now now I think about my experience with my many Android phones and my many Bluetooth speakers and other things like that  Where pairing is a nightmare, you know, so so is it courageous that they're taking this risk?  You know to charge you $160 for something you're gonna lose in about a week  I don't know about that but the the the commitment to a wireless device  So why you know wireless earbud and working on the protocols behind that to do that could open the door for so much more  And so I agree to say I agree with you Stacey  That was the that was the one thing that caught my eye in the in the very long presentation if you want courage get rid of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the lightning adapter, which is non-standard and  Proprietary and very expensive to license if they'll even let you manufacture something at all with it  You have there's some fairly hefty requirements and go to the type-c connector that everybody else  Except Apple is going to it has all of the benefits of lightning. It's reversible. It's high-speed it supports data  In fact in many respects, I think it's probably superior to the lightning  connector  Chiefly because it's universal and so eventually we'll all have type-c connectors and type-c cables that would be courage. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agree, I loathe how Apple both changes its interface every two years and is constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Different well, and they'll never go to type-c now. I mean they're going all in on lightning, right?  This is this is Apple saying. Okay good. We're doubling down on lightning. This is gonna be around for years  So I am you know, I  understand what you're saying and  To the degree that what Apple's doing is saying the future is wireless  I wouldn't disagree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wireless and seamless so  Moving from compute if you imagine computing isn't everything you have to figure out a way in Apple's  Maybe and I need a lot more information to like really say this is it for true  but the  Integration with iCloud in this particular in having the intelligence in the earbuds to recognize things and switch you between places is  A way to deliver that wireless future across computing everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you anticipate a future where we're all walking around like you used to with that little earbud in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think some people will I  Mean, I think I think it will be  Situational so in your home where you have you just talk to your stuff  Yeah, yeah, but if you're out and about in the street or in your car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe maybe it makes more sense to have a little earbud in I do I do I mean look that's what we love about the echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that it's ambient in the in right now?  Home kit is not right and that's a that's a big challenge for them. So I I don't know. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The the scenario you you kind of lay out there reminds me of I remember back in I want to say the mid  2000s I went up to Redmond and saw Microsoft presented this whole they had built this whole home on the campus and the whole idea was  that you just have a pin or something on your lapel and  It follows you from room to room  and if you're watching TV the the video will go from monitor to monitor or that sort of thing and the idea of  providing the  Context based on your location and your device serving you the services that you want based on wherever you are  And so, you know plugging that into the earbud could be a way to do that  That's really interesting. But I like the idea of this, you know frictionless it follows you  Which is almost what you know, the phones are doing at this point, you know  You've got phones that are listening, you know  Google now is listening, you know to to how you're interacting with the phone and using that to cater your the responses when you use the  assistant  Maybe you know could be a step in that direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1967 James Coburn the president's analyst  watch oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can't hear the looking at a miracle in modern communications, would you well sir, let's take a closer look  Thanks to the science of microelectronics  You are looking at a complete telephonic receiver and transmitter  We call it the cerebrum communicator or the CC for short  This dandy little device can actually perform every function of the old-fashioned telephone and more and it does it without any  Costly maintenance without telephone poles without wires without exchanges without anything in fact except another  CC in another location  Now you're probably wondering why have we made it so small?  Because it will be in and powered by your own brain now  Well not quite no  Inject the  Bloodstream which leads directly to the brain technically speaking for you doctors. We inject the CC into the internal carotid artery  Bloodstream carries it directly to the cerebrum where it lodges. Okay, maybe we haven't gotten to that point yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not courageous. That's Coburn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're researching ways to embed electronics in  BioSafe materials for those exact type of purpose exactly what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I want to be jacked in man

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My sister is first in line for when Disney is able to take that magic band technology and make it into an injectable  So you just walk around the park and it does whatever you want. She's openly said that she would she would take that surgery

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about you Ron, I don't know you let your sister scoop you I don't go to Disney that much  Anyway Apple I think  As skeptical as I was about whatever they did with the iPhone 7  I think that they showed enough good stuff including a camera that looks pretty impressive  to to to show that they still have a shot in a world where Android is  Lapping them every few months. There's a new Android phone with new features  In fact, many have pointed out the LG G5 had dual cameras and many of the features that Apple is now touting in the iPhone 7  Did you use a G5 Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've played with the G5. I haven't used it. I didn't reviewed it briefly and I was underwhelmed actually by the photography the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't the laser focusing and all that just didn't wow me  I still prefer a  7 or an or the note 7  To the G5 and and I'm but I will get the iPhone 7 just to see what the camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's assuming your note your your note 7 doesn't explode in your okay. Now. I want to talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break because I did not  Turn mine in and I'll tell you why I didn't in just a second the first word from ring the video doorbell  That's changing the world. I see rings all over Petaluma now and it's not a surprise  I I might have been the first to get one though  I we put our ring in months ago and I love it because I can see it anytime when somebody's coming or going at  My house and when I'm expecting a part by the way an important package  I may interrupt this show to speak to the delivery guy because I'm not home and it's they said  You're gonna need to sign for it and I really want it so I'm gonna try to talk to the delivery guy  He'll ring the doorbell and I go. Yeah  No, I'm not gonna tell him I'm at work. I'm gonna say I'm in the bathtub  Can you just leave it there and I'll sign for it later?  We'll see if that'll work the ring doorbell has a high-def camera. It has a speaker  It has a microphone and it's it replaces your existing wired  Doorbell a year if you don't have a wired doorbell still work  It has a year-long lithium ion battery in there that you could recharge  It comes with all the tools you need including a level to install it just right in a variety of finishes to match your home  It rings your ding-dong are in the hall just like always but it also rings your phone or your tablet  Anywhere in the world over the Internet because it's it's it signs up to your Wi-Fi  I love the ring video doorbell because even if somebody's just walking up my stoop or walking by  The motion detector inside will let me know now if you don't hear the ding-dong are in the hall  Don't worry  You can get the ring chime plugs in any outlet also joins the Wi-Fi and that'll ring in your workshop  Or you know the basement or the attic wherever you can't hear the doorbell. That's a nice feature  They have actually a variety of new things to stick up cam  Which is a ring video doorbell without the doorbell part  So a camera plus speaker and microphone that lets you monitor other parts of your home the backyard the side yard  And it's it's wireless because it also comes with a fantastic solar panel that will keep it charged  Day in day out what a great idea  And then they've just added this and I've ordered this for my house if you use the rings systems  They have now a ring sign. You know how you have a security sign you put these are very effective by the way  But frankly, this is the biggest deterrent of all and this is solar so it lights up even at night  The bad guys can see that you are protected by the ring of security take a look at the security bundles  They offer at ring.com  Twig up to a hundred fifty dollars off a ring of security bundle  Depending on what you need in there at ring  dot-com  slash  Twig I'm a big fan of the ring video door. I love our ring video doorbell. I know you will to ring.com slash  Twig it was really handy when I Abby was my daughter was living with us because I could  Say how come you came home so late last night?  They're crazy. Wait, you wait Stacy. You'll be using that in a couple of years. You'll be I believe it  You'll be needing that you'll be needing that  So  recall  recall  Poor I  Almost feel for Samsung because they they rush the note 7 out hoping to scoop Apple right get this out the door  Get people talking about the note 7 before the iPhone 7 steals all the thunder  But one little problem Apple second sourced their batteries. They used to use a Chinese company  They're still using that but they're also making their own batteries in Samsung's own  Factories and apparently it's this. This is really embarrassing. It's the Samsung batteries  That are overheating and exploding  I think I mentioned this last week. Maybe not because I got it on I think on Friday the email  From T-Mobile where I got my phone  Saying you can turn it in and either wait for a new note 7  We'll have it in a week or two or you can get a refund and I thought well, I've already reviewed  I'm gonna get a refund then and then I thought but I kind of like it and  Then I read something now. Tell me if I'm nuts and I'm not recommending this  But the Wall Street Journal and others reported that because  The phones made in China couldn't use the Korean Samsung batteries  Those were not being recalled because all the Chinese batteries were okay  It was the Samsung batteries that were causing problems  Interestingly T-Mobile of all the US carriers is the only one that was offering phones made in China  Everybody else was getting the phones made in Korea  or elsewhere  So they this article I don't know  I don't know how reliable it is said check the back of your phone if it says made in China  Which this does you don't have to worry you have the Chinese battery in it and I have to say I've never felt it  Overheat I've quick charged it many times never seen a problem. It doesn't get I feel it doesn't get too hot gets warm  But doesn't get too hot and most of the time I'm wirelessly charging it at a slower pace. Anyway, I thought I'd take a chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crazy you crazy crazy man crazy. Is it I don't know  Do you talk with it in your pocket or up to your ear? Which which do you want to explode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it only explodes when you're charging it. Oh  Yeah, it doesn't just randomly blow up it's from overcharging  Okay, it's like the hoverboards and I still by the way have a hover an exploding hoverboard at home  And the only rule we have is you have to be home when you charge it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if it's close, it'll hit you. Are you just you just waiting for it to explode? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I feel like now and I'm and by the way, I'm not advocating this but I feel like that was enough evidence  I couldn't understand why they weren't recalling it in China and that that seemed like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Credible story to me and this is made in China if it does overheat. Can you return it then for a reason?  Yeah, I'm sure I could oh so it's a win-win

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well as long as it doesn't blow up and melt my face or burn the house down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a one or cause two thousand dollars with a damage hotel room like that one poor staff who in Australia not poor sat poor guy  But yeah, he that's he plugged it in his hotel. Oh  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See I see this is why I didn't want to do it because I want to have the phone with me when I take go on  Vacation in a week from Sunday and I didn't think I'd have a new phone replacement by then  But now I know I'm gonna be able to get an iPhone 7. So maybe I really like the note 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's it's really a bummer because I don't think I have seen a launch of a phone with so much goodwill  Behind it than this  I mean, I mean every every Samsung launch has been strong to date  You know, you've seen a lot of great stuff with the Galaxy line and things like that  But this note 7 it just seems universally praised and now this is just like it's a snap back to just completely rejected and like  Oh, it's you know, like careful  It's gonna blow up because once you hear that some phones are being recalled and blown up that just damages the entire line, right?  And it's it's hard to recover from that  It clearly Samsung stock has taken a hit and they're gonna see declined sales a billion and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charge against earnings on this it's gonna cost them a lot of money. They'd sold  Well now somebody saying two and a half million of them only third only 35 explosions  I mean those are good odds

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing is is that I mentioned this last night all about Android and then I saw it earlier today  But the FAA is cracking down on lithium-ion right?  You can't carry lithium-ion batteries and check luggage, right?  And now they're looking at this phone and they might ban this phone completely. Oh that would be bad if I couldn't get on the plane

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With it. Yeah, what if I promise not to charge it? I'll turn it off and just leave it sitting  It's not gonna explode. That's the thing and I think that some of this is overblown  I mean, it's not gonna explode just sitting in your pocket. It's you have it's not a ticking time bomb. Yeah, exactly  I  Don't know somebody in the chat room says I have my my note 7 came from  Sprint it also says made in China and I use fast charging it never gets hot  Look on the back. That's the one that's where you want to look is it'll say in the fine print  It'll say whether it was made in Singapore made in China made in Korea

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Suppose Samsung's not telling us this and in fact the Consumer Reports said Samsung should do an official recall  They are not doing that through the CPSC the Consumer Product Safety Commission  if you do an official recall it becomes illegal to sell these and  And and the speculation is Samsung doesn't want to do that because there are people still selling note 7s  In fact Samsung one of the options that T-mobile gives me is hang on to the phone till we have a replacement then you can bring it  Doesn't sound like they're really concerned

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean it's such a the percentage it's it's interesting because we were again  We were talking about this last night all about Android  We were wondering how much of this because Jason howl brought the question did Samsung know about this, right?  Is that why we have this recall program in place so quickly and my argument was that they have they they have a you know in  Emergency break glass plan for when something like this goes wrong with other probably I'm assuming this that you know  God forbid something goes wrong that they don't they don't know about this is what we need to do in order to stay on the  side of consumer safety and pro consumer values and all that sort of thing  But I wonder if they have any way of estimating you know yes, we've only heard this only been 35  But is there some percentage of the ones that have been sold like is there something?  What is their risk assessment of what this risk is and that could be driving how dramatically they're pushing for the the exchange or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and I think consumer reports isn't far off when they say Samsung should be more  Forthcoming about this and more aggressive. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and the thing is that now if someone's walking up to a store to go by a note  7 if they've heard about this five bucks as they're walking away there reconsidering that that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and of course the whole point of rushing this out, and I think they did rush it a little bit was  Was to get it  Into the market before Apple got theirs into the market and now that apples is coming in the market soon by the way sooner than normal  It's coming out a week from Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pre-order this Friday, which I'm very happy to see I've been I've been long time railing that I can't stand the and this here's the presentation  And this is gonna be available in a month or in whatever like I want to see day of like you can buy it now  Like I'm waiting till we get to that point  And it seems like we're getting closer and closer  I understand why because the supply chain and all those sort of things but like this also seemed to be one of the leakiest  Don't go back to Apple, but one of the leakiest launches and that you know their stuff was up on Amazon an hour before the presentation  You know so it looks like they're trying to move closer to that simultaneous release you know  opportunity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Given those leaks maybe they'll rethink that strategy. Yeah, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, they made an illusion of the leaks. It's funny James Corden  They did a phony carpool karaoke at the very beginning video and one of the first things James Corden says to Tim Cook as well  I kind of know all about it because I read all the rumors  So even Apple can laugh at itself in in that respect I guess  So  Anyway, um there there are gonna be other choices in fact according to the rumor mill once again  The new Google phones are coming and those I was hoping we talked about that. Yeah October 4th  Are you excited Stacey use of 5x or 6p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd use a 5x because the 6p is too big right and I I would love to get a new phone. That's not  this feels  It's perfectly good phone, but it feels a little chintzy like many of Google's hardware efforts  Yeah, and I'm not sure if the is it the pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna  Yeah  The rumor is that they're dropping the Nexus brand and they're gonna be the pixel and the pixel XL which when you say pixel XL  Selects X pixel pixel pixel pixel. Yeah, it's difficult. Sounds like a Mayan King pixel coddle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm that I'm I want to see these I okay this is the problem I have on the one hand  I think it's fair to say if you're gonna buy an Android phone the safest phone to buy is one from Google a it's gonna  Continue to get updates  Longer than any other phone and be Google's gonna push out those monthly security updates  So it'll be the safest phone with the best future ahead of it and yet  hardware wise these phones never seem to be quite as good as  Other companies phones. I mean I really then I would love to put  You know  vanilla  Nougat on my note seven get that get all the note hardware  But the the purity of the Google experience, do you think we're on that the pixel phones will be  Finally true flagship phones or just a notch below

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're always they're always just a notch below and I'm not quite sure why I mean like some of the rumors going into this were  That Google was gonna embrace their own manufacturing chain, you know similar to how they did with the pixel C  but these  At least the rumors for these phones that that's not gonna be the case and they're actually gonna be HTC  Kind of based off of the HTC 1a9 line of phones that's similar kind of you know  Aluminum metal kind of casing just with the two different sizes  So if you believe that then you know my guess and based off what HTC has been doing  They will still not be as good as the Samsung  You know note seven from a camera standpoint or just from a total phone standpoint  But for whatever reason Google feels that these are the best foot forward  I agree with you the next the Nexus phones have been in my opinion  You know, the Nexus 5 I use I use that phone for and a year and a half  I think that was a great phone, but the camera was secondary

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that battery life was secondary and I just want to see them be as good as yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think and I'm not sure what the Venn diagram is on this but I  Know that when I was buying my phone  I looked at all the reviews and man reviewers were killing the 5x because it had like a plastic e exterior and blah blah  And I was kind of like, you know what?  I'm okay with that and you know, I don't know how many normal people  Really like spend a lot of time worrying about like megapixels on your cameras and having things be the optimal thing  I but I also don't know of those normal people how many actually care about having base Android  So right that's that's my curiosity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's this I think you're right  I think I think we overestimate the audience for the Nexus line also because it's just a challenge to get I mean  You know, it's it's you got to go to Google's website to buy it  You know, they've had a couple of in-store opportunities, but they haven't really embraced getting the carriers never pushed these phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carriers would much rather you bought something else. I didn't have a hard time getting  Mine hooked up with Verizon at all. No, but once you get it, it's just you have to go to Google to get it  That's a different process than most people are used to I also think some people really embrace the additional features  That other companies put on I means there's a reason why Samsung has all these weird  quirky touch wiz type features  Their cameras have a lot more going on than the Google vanilla cameras  You know, they have a lot of interesting, you know features with the touch the edge and so forth  I think I think those are eyes those I don't know if they prize them Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think that's Samsung trying to differentiate themselves and show independence in the marketplace  But I don't I'm not sure if they are the kind of thing where people like oh I get Samsung because I love touch  Wiz in fact, you know the majority people I thought talked to either don't even know that there's a difference  It just looks different than my phone or the people who do know what they're talking about don't like touch with right?  So, you know, I think it's really just an identity thing and a branding thing to say that hey, we're doing something different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Stacey, I know the reason you're excited about this announcement is not the phones per se  But everything else that Google be talking about  Although you have to think just as you mentioned in a way that some of the what Apple's long-term strategy with the iPhone has to  Do with home kit that Google's strategy with these pixel phones should somehow integrate with Google Home and other other things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes  Okay, so this ties into Google Home, which is why I'm bringing it up now last week on this week in Google  We talked about nest and the software developers moving over to Google from nest  So I talked to nest this week and one of the things they told me was that story  Was a little exaggerated what's happening is the works with nest engineers  Some of those software folks are moving over to Google to help create a more integrated experience around works with nest and presumably  They didn't go this far Google Home. So  If you look at actually we shouldn't even say Google Home  We should probably say Google products because if you look at the on hub router that just got Phillips light support  Yeah, I think what you're gonna see is Google bringing all of its smart home stuff into  The on hub this this home device that we're gonna learn more about on October 4th  Maybe we'll even get some cool stuff with Chromecast. I have no idea  So that that's kind of what that  Nest news was about so that's that okay a realignment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not a reorganization

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, cuz they still got lovely software people  It's just not everybody's going over  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was kind of what people were thinking but they wanted they wanted a group of smart people coming over to work on this  overall strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it it could be that Google is saying, you know guys  Y'all are not y'all are not making it here. Let's let's bring more stuff in house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well or it would make sense that we want everything to work together  And so we want the nest stuff to work with whatever Google stuff  We you know is going on too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the original that was the original hope when they acquired nest was that because at the time if you remember when they  acquired nest  Google was dangling the idea of Google Home and I remember seeing some  Animations of you drive up to your the house and the lights turn on all this sort of stuff and we all thought oh nest  We'll integrate, you know brilliantly with that and then there was just no integration  So, you know, hopefully that this is the step in that direction because honestly, I think that's the power  I mean like the the Google Home device that hopefully we're gonna see more on October 4th of the little air freshener that they showed at  Google I Oh, I can't wait for it because if you ask me, that's the that's the Alexa killer  That's the you know, like that's that's they're gonna be their opportunity to really, you know  Kind of finally dive into the home and provide a product that people can't live without similar to how people can't live without the echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will it work better with the pixel will this stuff I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think I think if you have if you're using Google now and the Google now assistant and you're fully baked in to the Google ecosystem  This is just gonna it's gonna supercharge. So they're gonna pull an Apple. I mean essentially what Apple's done

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even especially now with the headphones is say look all Apple just you have to use everything has to be Apple  If you want it to work, you got to be using Apple gear and Google hasn't done this  I mean it but could do this right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could they haven't I think they'll still keep  Google calendar. I mean because you can work with Google on the echo right now. I get my calendar on that  I think they're gonna keep a lot of that open and keep their apps. Basically, I guess is what it would be  With iOS and with  Amazon's ecosystem, so  Maybe maybe they'll go that's like that's the Microsoft strategy, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reach out to other platforms and make ourselves available to it  But Microsoft's always been clear the best experience will be if you're in an all Microsoft world  That's what Google's saying is oh, no, we'll make calendar available. It would be better if you were to use  Google branded devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think I mean like again when I see it, I'm gonna feel very torn on. Yeah home  Versus the echo. No, you have to give up one or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I and I I've I've always thought that it's it basically comes down to whose services you use the most  You know, I am an Amazon Prime member, but I'm not you know  I'm not really I don't dive into the Amazon offering so I haven't pulled the trigger on an echo  I haven't pulled the trigger on a fire TV  Oh, you know  That is you should yeah, you really are  Yeah, I know I've heard but but the promise of you know  The Google Air freshener to bring me that, you know echo experience  But times 10 with all of my calendaring and all my mail and all my everything that I already do within Google to me  Like that's that's what I feel like I'd be frustrated with with the echo and that it stops at shopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's the same thing with it with Apple TV  Like if you do iTunes you need an Apple TV  But on the other hand if you do Amazon you want a Roku or some other similar device or an Android TV device  Or you just get both  And I think a lot of people do that  I think a lot of people will have an echo and a so knows and a and a Google Home and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then you just leave the house and let them fight it out. Well, they have different trigger words

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you just you know, you'll use  You know, you're not gonna do that. Stacey. You're gonna pick one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're overestimating a the budget of the mainstream American consumer  Only a man made your gadget how would go like yes people like us will probably have yeah a lot of those things but  most people are gonna choose and  You know, maybe they'll choose poorly and I would say Ron. I can't believe you don't have an echo  I mean god Ron what's wrong with you? I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't say how I've spent minutes hovering over that buy button just like and I for whatever reason it's cheaper now though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's getting cheaper and cheaper. You were smart to wait  Yeah  Get a refurbished who cares if it's refurbished

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what 179 99 and then the refurbished one is usually $30 less. I think get a refurb

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just to play with it just like at least compare the two. I mean, I've seen it, you know  I've played with it  We you know, like I have friends who have it and I get it  But to me as soon as they announced that Google IO there I keep calling it the air freshener  But as soon as they announced the air freshener, I was just like alright, I'm gonna wait on the echo until well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. That actually isn't okay. Yeah, cuz I've had mine since yeah, we got it before the air freshener

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah way before the air freshener. Yeah, and I'm all in on Google. So I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well you see you say that it's more than just shopping and I get that it's got access to music and and is it just the  User experience that is so delightful about it. Like what Stacy? What is it that then that has you thinking I should get one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I use it to control my my home  So if I talk to the echo right now like when I go to bed I'm like echo turn off downstairs turn off  Afro circus, which is a light

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That my daughter named wait a minute your lights called the Afro circus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah so  The Afro circus song so my daughter named my we both switch Afro circus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ergo, I love your daughter. She is so great. She's so cool  Strange and she is so strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you talk to it all the time you can have it program your commutes  I mean, I don't know we play bingo with it. I mean, they're great. You play bingo  Yeah, there's a big go. There's a bingo skill. So, you know, if you ever want to have bingo night at our house are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  53 are 53  Wow, I want you know of all the things that will be announced probably on this October 4 thing  I'm most excited about aloe of all things. I want to use aloe everywhere. I I feel like that is the embodiment of  Home or echo in my phone where it really should be so I have it with me at all times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting worried about aloe though. Why worried as well?  Because we because duo came out and it was really simple. Do I was not bad  But it was just really just did that one thing and you couldn't even you know  If you if someone called you and you didn't miss the call they can't there was no messaging, you know, like yeah  So and then aloe  The reports that it's gonna need an Android  7.0 update to 701 to support API's to drive aloe has got me worried  And the fact that we haven't seen anything and they were supposed to launch around the same time  Yeah  I'm excited for aloe too because I want I want the combination of a cross-platform  Unified messaging platform that I can use with my iPhone friends  But also having the Google assistant baked into it looks super cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the silence has got me concerned. Is this stuff harder to do than we I mean arguably Google has the lead in this kind of  virtual assistant world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think what we're seeing. Oh, go ahead. No, no after you Stacy  I was gonna say Google's betting its whole future on machine learning, right?  Yeah, so what you're seeing is the Google assistant stuff. If you look at what Apple's launched its betting on  Easy to use hardware and integration. Yes, they have a machine learning component, but it's not anywhere near Google's  And so it's kind of these two versions of the future battling out  and I think they're  pre-announcing things or putting things out before they're fully ready because they're trying to drive towards these respective visions and  Maybe that's just what we're seeing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if anything we I always use my baseball analogy  We're in the first inning maybe the second inning and you go back to the her analogy of you know  The little earbud and the operating system that is aware  I think if anybody has the opportunity to make that concept the reality  It's Google because they have how many years of all this machine learning data that I put together and how people search and you know  Do all these things I realized a little while ago that at some point  I don't know what don't know when I stopped searching  Via Boolean  Keyword based searches on Google and moved back to the old ash geez where I just asked Google questions now  And I don't know when that happened, but that behavior is being  rewarded with really great search results  You know, I feel like it's good Google has the edge there absolutely also very good news for people who love the Nexus 7 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are not a few of them  There will apparently be announced at this event at least according to nine to five Google Google a  Seven inch tablet built by Huawei who builds by the way the 6p and does a very nice job  with four gigs of RAM  Pixel C I think we can safely write off as an aberration. I think it's over  But I would love to see a seven inch the Nexus 7s are so great and so affordable  It'd be very interesting to see what this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although seven has been confused because a seven isn't that much bigger than the 6p or what will be the  Pixel XL

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, you don't want a seven inch phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but but would you rather have an eight inch tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know but I mean some people would and there are plenty god knows there's plenty of  Tablets in a variety of sizes Android tablets Samsung's making some pretty good tablets  But but what's missing is that seven inch I think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also wonder how viable the tablet market is these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe maybe not new new watches. Although I have to say we saw this  I'm a little torn because the ties in based Samsung gear 3 that we saw at IFA at IFA was very  Impressive looked very good. Of course, it'll require a Samsung phone. I'm sure  Google will do this time according to again 95 Google some Android wear watches that are branded by Google  Which would be interesting to see I  Think I feel like  I'm waiting for Android wear to make a breakthrough  Just as I was waiting and still am frankly, I think for the Apple watch to make a breakthrough. Yeah. Well, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aside from just having new watches that are thinner or do you know have more buttons or don't have buttons or whatnot?  I don't really know where the Android where platform can go from here  I mean we're due for a you know, like what can the latest version of Android bring to Android wear which we really haven't heard yet  But I just feel like the wearable market is still a market. That's that's a solution still looking for a problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Forking watches are good. Oh, no, I was just gonna say I think watches are there. They're just I  Don't know. They're they're not something I feel like a lot of people. I don't think people really want full-on computing on their wrist. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know well you actually are very mainstream on that the latest the latest  From IDC and of course IDC is guessing somewhat. They don't know  No, Apple doesn't release watch sales. And so we don't know exactly  What those sales are but according to IDC Apple watch is losing ground as  Basics boom and you're wearing a Fitbit. You're wearing one more basic. I'm actually or is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under armor, okay  But I did just get tada. Let's see if I can show it to you. Nope. Come out. I'm charging it  This is a Phillips smartwatch that is supposed to be a dedicated true health wearable  So I'm gonna play with this and see how that works  Well those seem to be doing better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact the simpler ones do better because I think people realize there's only a couple of things a health watch  Health band can do but footsteps and heartbeat  the Fitbit showed growth of  28 percent year over year and a 25 percent market share compared to the number three product  Apple's watch which only has a 20 percent market share and fell  56.7 percent year over year in sales. That's again a guess from IDC  And those are global sales and global market share, but I think that sounds about right  It does seem to me that people have chosen the simpler more, you know  It less expensive fit bits over the expensive and more complicated Apple watches and and by the way Android is not  It's not any anywhere. It's not anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm close because that's because they're anything but basic and I think that's the real  I think that's the real issue is that people, you know got the opportunity to  Sample what a smartwatch can do and realize that in a postage stamp size watch  Navigating things and you know is really a pain in the butt  So go with something that just you know tracks your pedometer and tracks your heart rate and that does one thing and it works with  A companion app or a website and that's great. Yeah, so I'm not surprised by this at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  4k chromecast I would like to see that for everything should go 4k now that I have a 4k TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just how does how does that work on a cuz I know my chromecast like if you open the door wrong in my house  My chromecast stops, you know broadcasting so there's really it feels my chromecast is very tenuous and I have really great Wi-Fi  And you have an ear right you have the ear. I have I have several euros. Yeah  So I'm not I'm not in my TV is actually hardwired. So I wonder if your chromecast is funky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have that problem with my chromecast. Is that an official official?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One get chromecast so maybe I'll try the 4k, but I'm kind of like guys you want to shove more data that thing  I don't know if it can handle it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you'd have to redesign it it'd have to have a faster chip and  So forth and yeah, I guess the broadband would have to work because you're gonna need a lot of throughput to make 4k work  That is true. Yeah, and finally remember Google announced the its VR initiative. What was that daydream daydream?  Correct there apparently maybe we'll announce a daydream headset not that anybody's clamoring for one  This is gonna be a big event. We'll we'll do live coverage  I'm sure if they if they send out invites and and we get a confirmation  But this is all rumor from nine to five Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a pretty good track record in this regard and they've also historically shied away from doing events other than Google I Oh  Haven't they like didn't didn't one year they just that dropped it all on their blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like I feel like did they lunch that remember that weird octopus looking thing  What was that? That was like a TV thing  Didn't they launch that in its own event the queue queue queue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have my next right that I got right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm banking on that being worth a pretty penny in about 20 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dedicated thing for the Nexus the original Nexus phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember now. I'm trying to remember too. You're right. I think that's right. They don't normally do that, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have yeah, they haven't done big dog-and-pony shows other than Google I Oh, which makes sense  But yeah, but this is this is gonna be their big consumer push  I mean going into the holidays, so we're getting a lot of stuff dumped on us  I'll be very surprised if there is a daydream headset though  Just because I feel like the days of daydream are so early in fact, you know, very few phones can support it  We haven't seen any real development unless they have some big partnership there announcing  I'd be surprised that actually happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you ever buy clothes from the search results? I buy a lot of things from the search results  Google now wants you to buy clothes. This is a  An initiative they call shop the look it's an advertising program you search for specific outfits  You'll get photos and purchase links in the results page

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am so I am so excited about this really  Well, I already shop from Google. Remember I've been so excited about my Google now  Show me what's going on and I'm a huge fashion week kind of consumer just of like what new clothes are out  so I would totally buy pretty stuff from I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Find this is that these this is the most effective kind of advertising for me buy it right there  It just it's just somehow I it's you know, if something catches my this Instagram works  I've bought stuff from Instagram ads because you're going through your feed and you see a cool picture and  It's not so hard just to click it and buy it  Facebook I guess and this is even more immediate right search for something buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is what made Amazon billions, isn't it?  Right just that that one button that one click purchase which they fought so hard to protect in the courts  But yeah, no, it's it's preying on our impulse and then you know, the click of the mouse is faster than our regret. So  But yeah, it's neat I don't know about shopping clothes that's just me because I'm a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speed of regret is that close to the speed of light or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just slower than clicking your mouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like slightly behind the speed of a click with them announcing this it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This kind of relates to Pinterest hiring. Is it Lee fan? Oh, yeah  We found over there. Yeah as the new head of engineering and she was she was head of image search at Google  If you look at Pinterest business model, which is basically buying on pictures, right?  That becomes a really interesting higher kind of related to this  Interesting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, very interesting image recognition. Well, what is what is Pinterest full of pictures of stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's always been the promise of Pinterest was that you can you know that you would have all these things on your boards and you  Just click on them you can buy them from there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was always the disappointment of Pinterest for me is I couldn't do that exactly  It's like I want to buy that they're moving very much in that direction that's an obvious thing  Well while Apple was having its event. So was Sony poor Sony  We won't even mention that Dell also had an  Just got to avoid those Apple event days  That's you don't want to be making news on those days or conversely if you've got an embarrassing announcement like say an exploding phone  Do that on the days Apple announces its phone. That's when you can bury stories  We'll talk about what Sony announced in just a second Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT the great podcast  You do with Kevin Toffle  Talking about IOT. What are you? What are you talking about these days? Did you just did what this one this morning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you about to do one later today? No, we do it would you do it in the morning and it comes out tomorrow  So we talked about Kevin really really reviewed the wink relay  And then we also talked about rumors of a new wink hub second gen wink hub. So it's exciting  Wink wink

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's wink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wink is the company that was bought by flex  They used to be part of quirky their home. That's right. They were a quirky

Transcript:  They were a quirky. They were a quirky product. Okay, I know I knew it  All right, wink. Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does he like him? He loves him. I love it. It's my favorite smart home hub. Oh  Yes, people always ask me this they're like Stacey. What's your favorite smart home hub?  The wink are you a wink wonk? I'm a wink wonk over smart things because smart things isn't as reliable  So if you're out there choosing your hub, what protocol does wink use?  It actually speaks a bunch of different radios  So it's not just Zigbee or it's Zigbee Z wave Lutron kiddies. Oh, that's what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess that's what the smart things did to the whole idea of it was it integrated all of these protocols and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart things doesn't have the Lutron and it doesn't have kitty it has Zigbee Z wave Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you could get a wink instead of getting the Phillips Hue hub for instance and use that instead  No, no, it talks to the hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that in that because of the type of integration they have with Phillips it talks to the hub  It actually talks to the cloud. I think talk to the hub  It know it talks to the cloud the Phil talk to the cloud the cloud will talk to the hub  Yes, it's a bit latent but the next gen is supposed to have more power so they used to call me latent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what about jittery yeah depends on the amount of coffee latent and latent latent and jittery  Interesting. All right wink.

I've played with it and it was really impressed  Sony had an event it started at noon which was technically right after apple's event  But I imagine that even the news coverage will be a little limited  They uh, they announced two new xbox. I'm sorry  And only in my dreams two new playstation 4s a slimmed down playstation 4  Uh that will be available very soon  uh september 15th  At $299 but it's essentially the same as the existing ps4  Just a little bit smaller and like a redesigned light bar and things like that and then coming november 10th  What was uh called or code named the neo?  a playstation pro  Which is in fact improved $399 support for 4k faster processor better graphics  Uh, this is not a new generation. This is just you know, kind of a  slipstream upgrade for the playstation 4  Upgraded gpu and a terabyte hard drive, but an upgraded price to 399

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  399 so they went from having one console to having three  Yes, basically. Yeah, or no the slow or two the slimmer cheaper playstation 4  It's just it just replaces the original model and then this this is for the hardcore gamers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so well and I want it because i'm very interested in the  playstation vr  Now, I don't know if that will come out at the same time  It should because they I know they wanted to get about by the end of the year  So i'm thinking this neo this playstation pro  Will also be offered in a vr bundle at another price probably a couple hundred bucks more  Um, and they're also adding hdr in software to every playstation 4  Um, so that's for gaming and I guess streaming video playback  Not blu-rays though not blu-rays. I the new xbox supports the uhd hdr blu-rays and i've been watching them on my new xbox  I really really like them. You have to have a tv that supports it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really wonder I mean it's I think it's interesting that the playstation pro won't play 4k blu-rays after  Sony helped usher in the era with the playstation  And so that really makes me wonder is is sony betting on the fact that we're going to consume all of our content  Streaming and not the discs anymore. Is it no more physical media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It feels even a little retro today when I go to amazon and I buy, you know the martian  On a disc and I have to wait for a truck to bring it to my house to watch it  But it is the highest quality. I mean if you want, you know, uhd  hdr  Uh play it back on one of those new players or on your xbox 1s and I have to say it looks really really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really does there's a danger. There's a danger in  Going all streaming in that, you know in your in the the quality is better on the disc like you mentioned  But also there's availability  Um, I found out uh much to my dismay a couple weeks ago that the only way I can watch the the movie the commitments  Remember that movie? Yeah, great movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's not streaming anywhere. Danny Boyle  Right. It's just no no, no, see I was in 1990. I forget who directed it. But um, he did train spotting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but I confused the two because I can't understand anything anybody's saying in both of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  irish scottish same thing  Uh, but yeah, no, but that movie is not available that movie is not available streaming  And in fact, it's not even in print on on discs that you have to buy a used dvd. Wait, here's a tip from stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand. I even complained to a friend of mine  I was trying to watch his movies and none of them were on uh, you you had to buy them  You couldn't even rent them anywhere. I know I why why is that the case? Well, and I said, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right  Now i'm learning so much on this  um  Oh project ara, I you know, I want everyone's to want to get something right  From day one people were so excited about this modular phone system  And I said that is just janky. Nobody's gonna want this. It's gonna be loose  Pieces are gonna fall off your phone. You're gonna really and people were so excited about this  Well now google says yeah, maybe maybe not they're gonna license it but they are not gonna make  project ara  Modular phones. This was something they kept when they sold motorola  to lenovo  this was part of uh, motorola's kind of research projects and they've suspended it  At this point they didn't say why?  Maybe because they figured out nobody wanted janky phones to fall apart. I don't know  I am so upset. Oh, sorry. This could be something rick did because rick this is all this is all rick  This is under the reorganization under also and rick would know because he was at motorola when project ara was uh,  One of their research projects  Why do you think he killed? Why are you upset? First of all ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I loved this concept because I think that every phone out there we've reached, you know, um  Peak phone. Yeah, we peak we peak we reach peak phone. It's just completely homogeny and there's no real  Innovation going on on the hardware side and the also thing is that no one person  Has the same requirements for a phone as the next person. We all want something different. I want more battery  You want a better camera?  You know, there are all these different kind of uh variables  So the idea of making your own phone with these dinky little lego pieces to me sounded amazing  And the idea that you could have third parties building speaker accessories and projectors and batteries and all these other things and you can make  The phone of your dreams. I found that to be really really cool  Now I don't think it's a the kind of thing that millions of people are going to get and would be mainstream  But having that as an option is something that I was really interested in and i'm really disappointed that I will never get to snap  On a bigger battery or a better camera or flash, so I don't know. It's a bummer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, nothing nothing else for the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it sounds good in principle, but I just feel like it's gonna be a little rattly  You know, it's gonna feel like a lego phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but well that and that's the thing and look how well lego did everybody thought lego was crazy all those years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, why did they give up then what's wrong? I mean there must have been I think I think it's got to be something about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  taking a product from concept to shippable and  While the idea of snapping on all these things and doing hot swapping and stuff like that is great  There has to be a flaw somewhere in battery life and maintenance or in processor  You know management in that it actually wasn't a phone that they could ship because people would complain about one of those two problems  Yeah, that's my guess so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Four years in prison for gucci for  Uh gucci for uh, I didn't know they caught gucci for  It turns out he's a 44 year old Romanian Marcel Lehel Azar  Uh, he hacked george hw bush george w bush  Uh, I thought actually he was a kind of a cover for russian state hackers  Um, he was the one who uncovered hillary clinton's private email  Server he also hacked colin powell robert redford steve  Martin nicole kidman and he always took credit for it  But now he's been arrested and sentenced 52 months in prison 52 months  in jail  however  Now there's gucci for 2.0 and gucci for 2.0.

That was very nice  Um, and they would and they and they were they brought did  concerts  and stuff  But they were kind of the the others at bern  I don't know I think about the ethics or the culture of burning man  But apparently others at burning man didn't like these guys because they didn't share  It wasn't an open camp it is a communal culture, yeah  Uh, no chapstick for you  And so they just they ransacked the place  But by the way when crimes occur at burning man burning man does not hesitate to go to the local authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I gotta give it with the apple event more people were snapchatting than they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh tweeting so interesting. That's the place to watch it now, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is which is funny because i've seen i've also seen more  You know movement from twitter to snapchat but with the recent instagram  Snapchat rip off the instagram moments or whatever they are  I've seen a lot of my feed move from snapchat to be more active on instagram because there's more interaction because you know old people  Yeah, possibly, but I will say that snapchat has impressed me by the hyper targeting by media partnerships  And then I don't know if you saw I think it was last week  There's an article in variety about that, uh, Seth rogan animated movie sausage party  Uh that apparently sausage fest sausage sausage sausage party. It's called. Yeah, and it's an r-rated  Cartoon. Yeah, exactly and uh, 50 of their marketing budget was spent on digital  including snapchat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you're gonna make a movie like sausage party

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I gotta I I subscribe to common sense media which tells you what things you should let your kids watch and what you shouldn't  Not sausage issued a warning warning  Just because this is animated doesn't mean it's for kids. I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome, but it's rated r. I mean like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I I that's what I thought was hilarious and it's called sausage party. And if you look at the animation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's just a bunch of dancing penises. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I would never say that here's the new york times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Review the first word uttered in sausage party is a popular synonym for excrement  Which is a bit counterintuitive in a movie about food you would expect that to come to the end at the end. Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Well, if you want to hit some more tech news and you may not no I do I do please I beg of you  intel bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um a computer vision company. They just they just irped uh mac afee out  So maybe they're taking the mac afee money and buying a computer vision company

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think macafé probably made them more money. Um  So yes, movidius which is  Movidius  They're the computer vision chip inside project tango. They also are working with a lot of drone people manufacturers  to  Basically process. I mean it's computer vision. So it's it's basically helping computers in a low power format  Understand what they're seeing  Um, so really cool buy for intel it shows a couple things one  Google or google intel is not going to get behind hopefully on ai  Two it's embracing heterogeneous architecture. So things that are not x86, which we have seen  With manufacturing arm and with buying nirvana systems, which is using a gpu for machine learning  And this is all very nerdy, but it's all very exciting because it means intel might continue to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good bet  Movidius mo problems  No, movidius less problems fewer problems actually. Thank you for the correct grammar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There I tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I thought you were going to talk about intel selling off macafé. It's it bought macafé  Six years ago for seven point seven billion dollars changed the name to intel security didn't go anywhere. They're selling it now not  Entirely, but it's massive stake in it for four point two billion including debt  So they basically writing off billions of dollars on this one and the name goes back to macafé, which is after all  It's anonymous with security

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

What is the savings account interest rate?  It's like one quarter of one percent or something now. It's terrible  You got to invest you got to find, you know some vehicles to make some money on in most cases  That's the stock market  But are you going to manage that investment or worse you're going to pay somebody  one two or three percent of what you're  You know investing just to keep an eye on things for you. No, here's what you do. You go to wealthfront wealthfront is  computerized  Investing it keeps an eye on your investment. It redistributes it rebalances  It does tax loss harvesting  Maximizes your returns while minimizing your tax bill and it does it at a very affordable one quarter of one percent  a year  25 basis points  That's a heck of a lot less than that human down the street will do and they do a better job because they're monitoring you constantly  Using the best modern portfolio theory and nobel prize-winning economic theory to do the best job  These are the advisors.

You need to save for a rainy day for college for retirement, but  But how do you do it and maximize your results? This is the modern way to do it wealthfront.com  Slash twig go and read all about it. I think you'll agree. It's just fabulous wealthfront.com slash twig your first fifteen thousand dollars fee  free  last week, we said stacey you should do a  What was it a a recipe of the week or?  You did  So but not not a cooking recipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a clean. Well, I had a thing for this week  So I wanted to ask you should I do a thing do a thing and you could do it if this and then another time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or this time, you know what anything you want to do? This is your show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I have both so all right. This is my show really  It's your show now  All right. So this is what my thing of the week is if I can get it out because my this is my daughter's thing  This is the drop kitchen scale because last week you were talking and complaining about  What were you complaining about? Oh when you're making something and  Your proportions get all wrong or you don't have enough of one thing  Yeah, you can't re redo it. So what this is this is a 99 connected kitchen scale  It only works with ios. So this is a terrible thing to bring on this week in google. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have an iphone. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I lost my ipad. Um, so what it is, there's nothing on the scale except for this button right here you  open up the app and  What it does is when you put things on it, it gives you a recipe  So if you can actually show them a recipe that would probably be the best thing  All the recipes are modular, okay  and  When you start up the recipe, it's like okay preheat your oven and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here are your steps. Here's your recipe. There's mini chocolate. Oh, all right. You can do the other lemon sorbet lemon sorbet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's easy. Okay when you start the process  It gives you the ingredients at a very step-by-step passion  path so you're like  put  There it is place a clean saucepan on drop put the following six ingredients in and then as you  Press one you can either do it on the ipad or you do it on the scales if your hands are dirty  So this is cool because if you don't have in the lemon sorbet example  If you don't have enough lemon juice, you just say I only have two tablespoons instead of four  How do I how do I adjust my recipe? Yes, it's more interesting when you're like, I only have one egg. Yes  So this is really fun. The cool thing is at ifa  They announced it that they're working actually on a kitchen os and the recipes are the key of all of these things  So you can put your own recipes in  and eventually  The drop stuff will work with other connected kitchen appliances. So they have a deal with bosh  So now when the recipe says  Preheat your oven to 450. It'll actually just send the instructions right to your oven  Uh  If it if it works if it's integrated with drop, so I think that's really neat i'm excited about the kitchen  This is a great present for people who are learning to cook  Because the recipes are super like my my eight-year-old at the time loved it. She actually demanded this for christmas  You know two years in a row  And finally we gave it to her  So that is my device of the week  And if you want a recipe I can throw that out too not a kitchen recipe and if this than that style recipe it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's hear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So here's a fun one. It's really easy  But useful if you have an echo and you have hue lights or lifex lights because those will also work  You do a recipe that says  If my timer goes off on my echo  Blink my lights so that way if you don't hear your timer  Your lights go off and you're like oh my timer's up if that makes sense. It's a good recipe. Wow, we use it

Um, I already mentioned just watch which is fantastic  Just watched that tv. I love that. I I think I think considering that i'm on all about android  We're talking about the new nexus phones  I gotta recommend my daily driver the phone that i've been using and leo, you know, it's the next bit robin  but for a important reason, uh  That they have dropped the price now to 2.99 and they have a very good looking, uh, red version  of the phone  Actually, they call it ember and it's a red and black color combination  And I know earlier when I was talking about project aura  I was saying that my big frustration with phones is that there are you know, there's two they all look the same  They're all you know, they're all doing the same thing next bit is a company that is actually trying to do something different  And I really like that. I really want to support them  So, uh check out the next bit robin for just 2.99 now you get a really really solid phone  And you can get a really sexy red one, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want it well and that's proof in the pudding that you have had this now for months and still using it  Yep, means you really like it  Do you use the thing that this that made them famous the idea that you don't have a lot of storage on the phone  You have 32 gigs, but it will move stuff off the phone that you don't use it. Do you find that useful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny is that I don't because I had been operating for so long on a nexus 5 with 16 gigs that I  I run a really lean phone  So I actually haven't hit 32 gig yet on the phone  But I keep trying to download music and trying to put stuff on there to fill it up  But I haven't actually got to the point. They finally did uh back up four apps  Uh that were apps that I actually showcased on all about android and then never used that the showcasing  I'm just didn't delete them and then I saw they recently they the the icons grayed out and that actually reminded me that they were  Even on my phone, but uh, so it's just starting to do that  So I imagine i'll get into it a little more but uh, I just signed up and joined their beta beta tester program for their upcoming  os

So how is the battery life?  I thought it was pretty good. It's all right. It's not great. I mean it's it gets me through a day  I can get I can pretty much leave the house go work a full day and come home like around five or six and  Have to plug it in which is to be expected  Um, it's really bad when i'm at an event and i'm doing something and i'm you know using a lot of data  But that's to to be expected but apparently there's something in android, uh, and that  Combined with their engineering master mastery. They're gonna make that battery be that much better. So we'll see be very interesting  Yeah, but but that ember phone is oh, it's beautiful. Look at that. That's that's cool. It's very pretty. Yeah, so  It's 299 now. They dropped it 100 bucks. So  Oh, it's oh it was more. Oh, that's good. It was 399. It launched at 399 now. They dropped it to 299
