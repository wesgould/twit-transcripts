Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, always good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey has the week off, but we have the multi-talented Yorkshireman,  Kevin Marks.  I'm an adopted Yorkshireman I suppose.  Where are you? You're in Somerset.  Where are you? I don't remember where you are.  No, I'm in Yorkshire.  You are in Yorkshire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Call me a Yorkshireman is pushing it a little.  My wife's from here.  I don't think I can as a Yorkshireman quite yet.  I've only been here six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Or do you have to really be sixth generation to be a Yorkshireman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, you can.  I guess you can adopt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Yorkshire people.  I watched All Creatures Great and Smalls in Yorkshire, isn't it?  It is.  Yeah, I just love that.  I love that.  Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.  Yeah, beautiful country and a kind of a phlegmatic people.  They're like people from Maine around here kind of like that just kind of.  Yeah.  We have so much to talk about.  Let's start with the story that is just now breaking from The Washington Post.  Facebook says, oh, turns out we sold political ads to a shady Russian company during the election.  They told congressional investigators today they discovered this to a company seeking to target US voters company in a Russian troll farm.  In with sales of $100,000 of ads with a history of pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda.  They directly named Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.  I'll bet they did.  Most of the ads focused on pumping politically divisive issues such as gun rights and immigration fears, gay rights, racial discrimination.  Wow.  Yeah, but Facebook.  I bet that's not all.  Is it Facebook's job to block that kind of thing?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would report it.  It's called their attention.  I would report it, yeah.  The question is, was it called over their attention?  And did they did they not do anything?  But here's the problem.  I guess I'd not take it back.  I think about how would if you saw the ad, how would you know it's a Russian app?  Yeah, we saw all this crap come across.  You know, so the question is how how does Facebook in the end know that it's Russian company and how could they have known and how will they know in the future?  We certainly saw that there was tons of Russian manipulation in the election.  I've on this show before I've quoted the NATO handbook on Russian information warfare, and it's a script for what we're going through.  And so, yes, I think they have a responsibility to know.  So they stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The question is how do you know it is illegal for foreign nations to interfere in the US elections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's illegal for them to to contribute to contribute, but it's not illegal for them.  You know, we have a First Amendment here.  They could buy.  I was to come over and say something about our election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can do the First Amendment applies to anybody.  You don't have to be American to get protected by it.  Yes.  Okay.  So this isn't this isn't an illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This isn't illegal.  It's just it's just helping the scum scum balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Does Facebook have a higher obligation than than US law to prevent this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, certainly it does the same way that, you know, if you're a news.  Again, I'm not trying to call the media, but if you're another medium that takes advertising.  So if if the Kremlin came along and wanted to buy an ad on CBS attacking Hillary Clinton on the behalf of Donald Trump, should CBS take the ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just in politics, too.  These ads can be used to spread misinformation.  They're the Internet Research Agency, which is this troll farm in St.  Nice name, the Internet Research Agency.  Also, apparently in 2013, by the way, 600 people employed across Russia.  So it's a big troll farm.  I'm sorry.  2015 New York Times magazine reported that the Internet Research Agency had launched social media campaigns in the US, including a sophisticated hoax that spread false news of a chemical leak in Louisiana in 2014, apparently to sow chaos and fear.  So because, you know, I feel like there's not much we can do about this because we the Internet has made this made us.  This is the price we pay for being an open nation, the Internet and having an open Internet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's back and forth on that.  I mean, the UK is a fairly open nation, but we ban political advertising here and police it fairly very closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's what about this disinformation campaign, which is not political advertising, but merely an attempt to sow chaos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's tough.  It's just the goal.  Yeah, I mean, that's the goal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Data Boy points out is polarization is the goal.  Attack on institutions is the goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A weak West is good for Putin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And so we play along in media when we end up repeating their agendas.  Even when we debunk them, even when we fact check them, we help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we ask Facebook to do something that the US law does not ask them to do?  In other words, to block these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  We asked that we asked them to not put up sleazy porn ads.  We asked them not to put up sleazy drug ads.  Google's taken down, you know, junkie drug ads.  Yeah, I wish every media company would get rid of the likes of rev content and such.  There's a lot of sleazy junkie ads out there.  So yeah, I think we can expect them to have quality.  That's so, you know, I've done some work with with a store full and moat at the  news integrity initiative at CUNY.  And again, full disclosure, folks know that it is funded in great measure by Facebook,  but I have independence of Facebook.  So we've started identifying the worst of the worst lowest rotten hanging fruit of  fake news sites, you know, outright lies.  I don't have the numbers now yet, but we'll put them out as soon as we have them.  But some surprising proportion of ad revenue that at least one company sees passing  by its sites from major companies goes to these bad sites.  You have sleeping giants telling companies to get off Breitbart.  Yeah, I think there there is a there is at least a public and consumer  expectation now to behave and not to support crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no question that these social media campaigns and advertising  campaigns are successful can work.  They're powerful.  Oh, yes.  That's one of the things we've learned about Facebook is how powerful  advertising is on Facebook.  Here's another story.  This is Dan Gooden writing in Ars Technica.  A hacking group, Doug Dragonfly, has been attacking US and European energy  companies since at least 2011, establishing beachheads in the electrical grid.  Eric Chen, who is technical director of Semantek Security Responsive  Technology Division said what's most concerning is we now see them intruding  on operational networks of energy companies.  They actually before we were talking about them being one step away.  What we see now is they're potentially in those networks zero steps away  from flipping the switch.  There are no more technical hurdles for them to jump over.  At minimum attackers who have control of a company's operational network  could use it to become de facto operators of the company's energy assets.  That control includes the ability to turn on or off breakers inside  the company's infrastructure, hijack systems that monitor the health of the grid.  In other words, this looks like a concerted effort to undermine our grid.  We saw it happen in Ukraine.  Ukraine's considered to be the testbed for Russian hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is again why I recommend the NATO handbook on Russian information warfare  because it goes through exactly what was done and says that it's meant to turn us  against each other.  It's meant to turn us against the truth, to doubt the existence of truth.  It's meant to turn us against institutions and divide us from each other as communities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they turned off the power in Kiev, just outside Kiev.  About 225,000 people lost power for six hours and the power went back on,  but it was considered an effective test by one of these nation states,  probably Russia.  It's hard to know.  Manual attacks, according to Symantec, are more difficult in the U.S.  than the Ukraine based on sheer size in order to cause and effect something  or someone would need to flip the switch to play a crash device, etc.  But we don't believe there are any technical hurdles in doing so.  So there's some good news.  We should also point out that the last week, I don't know if we reported on this  show, but the seven members of the 32 member or 24 member, let me look and see  and get the number, a technical advisory committee to the president resigned  saying, nobody's paying any attention to this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those were, however, the hangover appointees from the Obama administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Insufficient attention to threats.  So it could have been purely political.  The rest remain.  It's a 27 member council, seven resigned.  Yeah, might not be anything.  Although when you tie all these stories together, it's a little concerning.  I hope we are paying attention to this stuff.  Okay, I'll just start with the bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the story that I loved today?  On the other hand, Oreo is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's a story that fascinated me today.  Can I jump to one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to hear what you have to say about it.  That Facebook is ready to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for music rights.  If I interpret this right, right.  So on one hand, this seems to be we don't know how to keep your music from being  pirated, so we'll just pay you and go away.  But on the other hand, this enables users to then use music in their videos.  I think that's more power.  That's more the point, right?  That's what it is.  I wasn't misinterpreting it.  That's amazing.  Yeah, the Facebook would enable its users.  I mean, they might as well buy a stock photo agency too for memes.  And you can make content here and make it freely and it won't get taken down for  all these stupid reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's phenomenal.  A good kind of template for this is Jiffy, right?  Jiffy makes these animated GIFs that everybody now uses.  They're animated.  I just got them in Gboard, the Google keyboard.  I can now paste animated GIFs into my texts and so forth.  So what's happened in the past, of course, is the recording industry has demanded  that YouTube and Facebook pull down anything with copyrighted music.  Facebook's saying, well, forget that.  Why don't we just give you some money and people can use the music?  That's what YouTube does as well.  Right.  YouTube does that.  In fact, the video doesn't make a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, YouTube does that, but YouTube doesn't allow you to use the music.  The users to use the music in their videos.  This enables the user to use the video.  Yes, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does?  Yeah.  If you insert copyrighted music, it'll say this is copyrighted music.  And depending on what the label has decided, they'll either, they get the  advertising revenue for it or they get a buy link attached to it.  Or they can force you to use it.  I think that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Got it.  But I think this is different and maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's only an inch, not a foot.  But in that case, YouTube is either paying ad revenue to the music company  because they left it up or they take it down or the user can buy it.  In this case, Facebook, I think what Facebook is just saying,  ah, we'll buy it for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lucas Shaw and Sarah Friar writing Bloomberg Technologies say that the  music industry executives also hope licensing songs for user-generated  video on Facebook will place greater pressure on YouTube to behave.  Yet by further empowering Facebook to host video and music, rights  holders risk creating another YouTube, a great source of promotion,  but a place where consumption outpaces sales.  The good news is the music industry grew 5.9% in 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the chart look like?  I don't even know how much did it shrink before it started growing again?  I don't know.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends where you measure from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So Universal Music Group, owner of the world's largest record label,  reported a 15.5% increase in sales in the most recent quarter.  Warner Music Group, the second of the big three, said a 13% increase in sales.  So this is going to be an even better year.  So the good news is the music industry has found ways to make money,  particularly from streaming services.  You know, that's the real way to make money these days from Spotify,  Apple Music and so forth.  So in a second quarter earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg said for the next  few years, video will drive our business and determine how well we perform.  And we're going to continue to invest in the format.  This is an interesting story related.  The rights to James Bond are for sale.  And among the usual bidders for James Bond, Apple and Amazon.  So I guess the rights to James Bond are owned by MGM.  They've been trying to sell it off for a couple of years.  Sony, Universal and Fox have been pursuing it.  Warner's and Sony, the most aggressive.  But according to Hollywood Reporter, Apple, with its newly arrived executives  from Sony Pictures Television is in the running.  It's about, it's Apple could easily afford the franchise.  Apparently you could, you too could buy the rights to James Bond for  a mere two to $5 billion.  In the world of Lucasfilm, which of course is Star Wars and Marvel,  Bond feels really underdeveloped, says someone familiar with the process.  I mean, look how well Star Wars has done.  Yeah, but Star Wars has done so well for Disney.  They have turned that into a money machine.  There's going to be a movie every year.  Every movie makes almost enough money to pay off the purchase in the first place.  They've got the Disneyland Star Wars is under construction.  They're going to have a Star Wars hotel.  Marvel's been huge for Netflix.  It's done so well.  And of course the Marvel movies have made tons of money.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, there's never been a, I mean, Bond movies have continued to be  cranked out.  What were there 60 of them, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, they ran out of numbers long time ago, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Daniel Craig is apparently despite his complaints about playing Bond back for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  another Bond outing at the end of next year.  No, it takes a long time to make these two years, November 8th, 2019.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They haven't started yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They haven't started making it yet, I guess.  I don't, you know, it'd be funny if Apple bought Bond.  I think Amazon, I'd be great.  Amazon's been been underwriting some really good movies lately.  And I think there may be either Amazon or Apple would be more willing to take  chances than traditional movie companies.  That's one of the things that I think Disney has done such a good job with  Star Wars by taking some chances and winning Star Wars fans over.  The biggest, it was Force Friday last Friday, and I don't know how many R2D2s  and BB-8s they sold, but a ton of them.  Everybody's talking about them for Christmas.  That'll be the Christmas gift, I'm sure.  The Sphero R2D2s and the new BB-8, the dark BB-8.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  See, that was some happy news.  That was a little bit of happy news.  That was a little bit of happy news.  That cheered everybody up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of.  Kind of.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about it Sunday on Twitter.  I can't remember if we talked last week about the think tank.  Yeah, we did.  So there was a follow-up that we didn't have, which was of course,  Cashmere Hill's article.  Which was very good.  Yeah, although you're the journalism expert, so I'm curious what your take is on this.  Cashmere, of course, we love Cashmere Hill.  She's great.  She's now doing special projects for Gizmodo.  She writes, yes, Google uses its power to quash ideas it doesn't like.  I know because it happened to me.  She's been telling this story apparently at bars for some time.  She said that.  I didn't make that up.  It's been a good bar story for her.  But when she worked at Forbes, so this is, I don't think it's completely clear, Jeff,  but I want your take on this as a journalism professor, as an ethics expert.  She was both a reporter for Forbes, but also managing social media.  And wearing her hat as the social media arm was invited to a meeting with Google,  which was about to roll out its Google Plus social network.  Google salespeople had made the other executive sign in NDA.  Apparently, she did not know about that.  Did identify herself as a reporter, but was then told by the Google salespeople,  Forbes should add the plus one button to its site, right next to the already Facebook  like button and Reddit share button.  They said, this is Cashmere's writing, it was important to do so because the plus  recommendations would be a factor in search results, a crucial source of traffic  to publishers.  This sounded like a news story to me.  Google's dominance in search and news give it tremendous power over publishers.  So she said, did I just hear correctly?  If a publisher doesn't put a plus one button on the page, its search results would suffer.  The salespeople said yes.  She did the right thing immediately afterwards.  She went to Google's public relations team as a reporter, not as a social media person,  told them that she'd been in the meeting, said, did I understand correctly?  The press office said yes.  We prefer to say the plus button influences the ranking, but they didn't deny what their  salespeople told me.  She says, if you don't feature the plus one button, your stories will be harder to find  with Google.  So she published a story, headlined, stick Google plus buttons on your pages or your  search traffic suffers.  That is a big story.  Google complained saying that was an NDA meeting.  She can't write about that.  She asked her, they asked her editors to take it down.  They went to her and said, take it down.  I'm not sure why, but I guess I guess they had it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, they had a very strange CMS in those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She probably had to log in and take it down.  But could you?  She said, I thought it was an important story, but I didn't want to cause problems for my  employer.  And if everybody was covered by an NDA, I can understand why Google would object.  She said, I had because I'd gone to the PR team and before publishing, it was already  out there.  I felt it more sense to keep the story up.  But after continued pressure from my bosses, I took the piece down a decision.  I will always regret.  Now this next piece, I think isn't doesn't prove anything, but she says then the cash  results of the story were deleted and you couldn't find that story.  Google's crawler just didn't show that story.  She said that was a little suspicious to me.  She got an actually I thought a very good letter from Google after she published this  story in gizmodo.  Their response was I thought well written.  I didn't see that.  Yeah.  Hi, Kashmir.  I want to clear the air on this.  We've always enjoyed working respectfully with you and are sad that you've carried this  since 2011.  I'm sorry about how this went down.  I wanted to give you the tick-tock from our end.  Let me tell you who's writing here so you can it's Rob Shulkin, who's Vice President  of Global Communications at Google.  From our perspective, this was a disagreement over whether a meeting was held under an NDA.  Our sales team, while I go on, you can read more about that.  I understand our PR rep asked the piece come down from Forbes website as it was reporting  on a confidential business meeting.  Your editor agreed.  He told our PR rep the article is being removed because it involved reporting on an NDA meeting.  As for the Google cash, and this is important, it's trivial for the website owner to request  that the cash be cleared.  I assume this is what happened because we had nothing to do with removing the article  from the cash.  We would never engage in this type of behavior.  I hope you understand that.  You've long held our and the tech industry's feet to the fire on privacy issues.  You've written more than a few critical stories about Google Plus and many other things.  To my knowledge, never have we had any issues like this, even with the most critical story.  So, after reading this, Jeff, I feel like, well, it was an NDA meeting.  She should have been told it was an NDA meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, there was a case with The Guardian and the private confessions site that used to exist.  Oh, God, you remember what that was?  Where people would go on anonymously and confess things.  Secret.  Yeah, it was a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Post-secret.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it now?  I don't think it was post-secret.  But there was a promotional, there was a same thing happened, a business meeting where journalists were part of it.  Because journalists are now, the walls aren't clear.  So, journalists are part of product.  Journalists can sit in the meeting with product with somebody else.  It's all mushed in now.  And the journalist knows something.  And so, The Guardian said, our greater responsibility here is to the public.  And they reported that information was being, I wish I could remember the details of the story.  I'm sure somebody in the chat room has it.  Information on users was not as private as they thought.  It was a mushy story in lots of ways.  At some level, I think that the journalist has to ask where her obligation lies first.  And I would say it lies first with the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To be clear, she had not signed the NDA.  If she'd signed the NDA, this would be a different...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She called the PR people.  So, what happens if instead of me with Forbes, Google had the same meeting with Businessweek.  And over that drink that apparently Cashmere enjoys, and that Google also had at the end of his letter,  over that drink, the person at Businessweek says, Cashmere, you cover Google.  I got to tell you what, boy, this thing just happened.  And that person may have violated an NDA, but like a reporter, whether it's Snowden or anybody else,  if a reporter finds it out, the reporter's obligation is to free the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you haven't signed the NDA or agreed this is off the record, or...  Because I'm sure Cashmere does honor it.  If somebody says this is off the record, she doesn't report that, right?  Right.  Regardless of the public's interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that Google made a mistake in asking for it to be taken down back in the day.  Whether it was NDA or not, once it was out, it was out.  And for Google to be caught in the right to be forgotten problem,  and Google to argue that we shouldn't be erasing history,  for Google to then go to a media company and try to erase history...  Oh, sorry.  Don't say the G word.  You said it too often.  That, I would say, is wrong.  Google's not listening. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said it's not okay. That was the problem.  Not okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so that's the one issue.  That's the one issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect the other half of this is that it's the left-hand with the right-hand doing it,  as I Google itself.  I'm fairly sure that Matt would have been very, very grumpy about the salespeople saying that  about search ranking and corrupting the work that they were doing to keep search rankings pure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the second question.  We can go back and forth over Cashmere's obligations, the NDA and so forth.  But no one's denied the essential assertion of her article that the plus one helped your search rankings.  You don't think that's true, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if I was being Matt, I'd say there are many thousands of factors that influence search rankings  and we can't disclose them.  So probably the plus one does have something for the search rankings, sure.  It will mean that they've been pinged and they're more likely to crawl in things like that.  If you want analogy, the current argument around this is AMP pages.  AMP pages influence your search ranking because if you have them, you show up in the carousel.  So they don't influence your ranking, but they do influence your placement.  And so that's a tricky one for Google is dancing around that at the moment.  And they're arguing it in good faith on both sides to some extent.  But from the media company's point of view, a lot of the reason they're doing AMP is to improve their search ranking.  In practice, it's improving their search ranking because their pages actually load rather than just sit there and spin at you  while junk downloads onto your phone.  There is a reason that the carrot there is that they show up in the carousel.  And any of these, when you're a company that big, a carrot and a sticker is not that, it's a bit harder to distinguish them.  That's the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me go to the larger thing.  There's also a story I put on the rundown just now.  Josh Marshall from Talking Points Memo, who's a really wonderful entrepreneurial journalist,  goes through a saga of how he has felt under the gun of Google just as a small business owner.  And so I started writing a post about all this and it was too big to write.  And so I thought instead I would talk about it here.  I'm often in the position where I defend Silicon Valley and the platforms against those who presume bad motive and bad behavior.  And I still do that and I still believe that.  But there are those who now argue that the platform is because they own, they are too big in their view  and because they control the Internet should be regulated, which as you know, I fear.  But it is true in my mind that the platforms have a much higher obligation to virtue than even they have presented.  And as I was thinking about this, I've defended Don't Be Evil because I knew where it came from.  It came from Paige and Brynn saying, keep us honest employees.  But there's a little bit of, I want to say cynicism in there, but that's not going far enough.  That do good is what their goal should be.  And there are those who will say that it's impossible.  Companies will always put profit before everything else.  Companies can't do good.  But we've seen these days that doing evil has a much higher price than it used to because of exactly what we're doing right now.  Because we can talk about the companies, we can learn about them, we can spread this.  So I think that that that the company, the Silicon Valley and the companies are still far, far too much in the mode of thinking.  People understand that we do wonderful things. They have to go out of their way.  Eric Schmidt should have said to New America, I'm going to disagree with this article, but don't you dare do anything about it.  Don't you dare get rid of this guy.  Don't do anything about it because we welcome different opinions.  And if we give you money, we expect that. And that's what we want.  Google should have said, don't you ever kill a story.  They need people inside these companies who think from an ethical framework at a very high level.  Otherwise, they're going to get zapped by the regulators.  They're going to get zapped by PRs.  It's bad business.  And they also have a higher responsibility because they control our Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, in this discussion, replace Google with Facebook, you'd have much the same discussion.  Same exact discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last week I criticized Facebook for having higher.  A person in charge of transparency who most journalists don't have a lot of respect for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Josh's point is kind of that when you get as big and powerful as Google,  the wielding of the power doesn't have to be kind of heavy handed and obvious.  It's just in the nature of things.  And I think it's true of Facebook.  The publishers rely on Google and Google wields great power with them.  In that respect, same thing with Facebook.  Publishers are at Google's mercy.  He says, this is actually a good analogy that might help people understand it.  He says, if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll understand this analogy.  It's a bit like being assimilated by the Borg.  You get cool new powers, but having been assimilated, if your implants were ever removed, you'd certainly die.  That basically captures our relationship to Google.  So it's not all bad for publishers.  In fact, it's so good for publishers, as is Facebook, that it's hard to turn your back on the candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what they have to do is they have to have a higher level of standards.  They have to put out principles beyond just don't be evil.  Do they do that?  To some extent, there are some statements, but I think what I'm saying is because they control our internet,  because they are so big, because they are under watch, they've got to be better than any other company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've always kind of said this in a different way, that Google should be like a priesthood.  One way to handle this is when you imbue somebody with this much power, you also have to instill in them,  and it's a little bit of a mythos, but you instill in them this higher responsibility.  It's like a police officer.  You give them a gun, but you have to install, instill in them this sense of this is for the greater good,  and I'm committing my life to the greater good.  I would even give my life for the greater good.  Otherwise, giving them the gun could be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the point of don't be evil.  That was the point there, was to say step back and think about this in moral terms.  That's not enough.  I'm not saying it's enough.  No, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I say a priesthood.  You need to have rituals and robes and incense.  And a Bible.  You need to go, yeah, you need a Bible.  You need to instill this as a holy faith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That can backfire.  That can backfire.  That can be wrong too.  Because then they get accused of being holier than thou, and we're perfect, we're wonderful.  No, you have to be more monks.  You have to be more supplicants.  You have to be humble.  You have to know that you're going to screw up.  You have to be held to principles that you set.  This is not easy, but hey, you got all the benefits in the world.  You're the biggest brands and biggest companies and the huge growth.  You control the damn internet.  We have to hold you to a higher standard.  You have to hold yourself to a higher standard.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay, so there's about three things here.  One is that the soft power has a sort of secondary insidious thing, which is that it's not necessary  actually influence.  It's just the idea that it might be is very chilling.  I'm fairly sure Schmidt didn't say, sack these guys, shut them up.  Yes.  But he said don't.  But the emails were, you're not being collegiate.  You'll piss Google off, and then the other part of our group won't get funding, so stop  talking out against Google.  So she was explicitly saying, do not speak against our major funders.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's what's insidious about it.  Why not even Google may have exerted zero pressure.  Eric Schmidt may have never said anything.  He didn't have to.  It was under his control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have to be conscious of that.  And when they, so, you know, and again, this is so much on my mind because I took a lot  of money from Facebook for the News Integrity Initiative, and we negotiated independence.  And this is exactly why.  But I had to be very conscious.  I didn't write about the case of Facebook hiring the former New York Times public editor  Liz Spade to be in charge of transparency and how I thought it was a bad hire.  Because it took me so long to figure out how to write it.  It was over, but you know, it was too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But would you agree that this is something journalists are constantly challenging themselves,  a good journalist is constantly challenging themselves with?  Am I biased here?  Am I looking out for the good of my employer versus the good of...  Am I transparent enough?  And that's where I mean the priesthood, because a good reporter has to hold as her high  as her highest ethic that I'm here for the people, right?  I'm here to speak truth to power.  I'm here to represent the people, not my employer, for instance.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do that sometimes to an obnoxious extent.  I mean, I don't think it may be obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who cares?  It needs to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm saying.  No, no, no.  What I'm saying is I've seen cases where report where, let's say, let's say.  Well, no, I've seen cases where the business side of a newspaper will do a deal with a  company and every reporter will back over themselves to not ever deal with that company  and to try to expose how awful that company because the business side did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We deal with that all the time.  I tell our people, you know, you need to know who our sponsors are.  You need to disclaim it when you're doing a story on our sponsors.  And you can't give our sponsors favorite treatment.  But on the other hand, you can't be...  It's very hard to do.  You can't be negative about them either.  If possible, put it out of your mind that they're a sponsor and report exactly as you  would have if they weren't.  That is very hard to do.  And it gets really hard if you're not...  This is a flat institution.  So advertising is right here.  There's no firewall between editorial and advertising in a podcast because we do the  ads.  So it's a very challenging thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nor is there in a product world in a news organization now where you're creating new  products all the time.  And in that team, you have technology and marketing and sales and editorial and all  in together, which is the way it should be.  So that's why the priesthood doesn't extend just to the journalist.  It extends to everybody in the company.  And part of...  I think that people in media companies, every employee should be trained in the eternal  verities of journalism and the cause of what they're doing and why they exist.  Similarly, on Google and Facebook and Twitter, for God's sakes, all the platforms that stand  in this powerful position, I think that they've got to do a lot more in thinking about their  moral authority.  And not to claim it, they don't.  But not to presume it, they don't do that either.  But to earn it and earn it every day and hold each other honest to that.  Same goes, by the way, let me say for media.  I think that we in media don't grapple enough with the fact that paywalls, redline journalism  away from poor people, reach-based advertising brings us to clickbait, which doesn't just  mean cats and Kardashians.  It also meant, watch out here, Donald Trump.  The conflicts that we have in media, the ways we're trying to save ourselves, the ways we're  forgetting what our real mission is, we ain't pure, we ain't clean either.  I'm not holding us to any higher standard, I don't think, or lower standard, but we all  have a larger societal responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, you wrote an article, a blog post.  I really like this.  You posted a link to it in the chat room.  Otherwise, I would not have known about it because you wrote it 14 years ago in your  blog, Apeus Epigone, about morality.  Or just showing off you know how to say that, Leo.  I don't.  I'm making it up.  I don't know what it means.  Edifying exquisite equine entrapments.  But this is along those lines, isn't it?  These are the kind of ethical standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was, Jane Jacobs wrote this book a long time ago called Systems of Society, I  think it was, System of Survival.  That was it.  Which is about, there are two primary moralities, two sort of cultures.  There's the commercial culture and there's the guardian culture.  And the difference between them is that the commercial culture has a coherent ethos and  the guardian governmental priesthood type thing you're talking about has a coherent ethos.  And when you mix them, it gets difficult.  And so there's a whole book about it, which is well worth reading if you want to pick  that up.  But this post sort of added, was trying to say, oh, there's a, could we come up with  a new one that's not commercial and is not guardian but is open source.  So it's trying to come up with these kinds of, trying to come up with a sort of open  source, open web version of these ideals.  And I'm not saying this is fully thought through, but it was very interesting to read this.  And that is the challenge.  You have to step back and think about these things.  Because her point, the underlying Jane Jacobs point is, is that the commercial thing is  consistent in itself and it is designed to, you avoid force, you trade, use initiative,  you're honest, you're optimistic, there's hope and you respect contracts and so on.  And you compete and there's a sort of structure to that.  And there's a coherence in the guardian, the priesthood mode, which is you have a monopoly,  you should not be trading.  You work within the system.  There's a set of things you do if you're in that mode.  You respect the hierarchy and the tradition and you're obedient.  And there's a coherent morality there, which can be useful in circumstances too.  And the challenge is if you get them mixed up, then you end up with a mafia or you end up with  the kind of sort of corruption that we're talking about with the Russian state or things like that.  And the worry is that we're moving towards, we have moved towards that.  Since you wrote this book in America and in the UK to some extent as well, where we have this,  we've mixed this idea that the government and the commerce are running in separate spheres.  They're now running these overlapping spheres.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's funny because I've been thinking about this a lot too, because I feel like one of the reasons  we're in shaky times, I mean, you wrote this in 2003 where it was, God, that was a long time ago.  Oh, those were the days.  Where you had a merchant ethic and you had a mercenary ethic or a guardian ethic.  And I love the desire to create an information ethic and all of these attributes.  But these are all based on, essentially based on a mythos that one has to buy into.  That's what, you know, you need true believers because if you're a police officer, for instance,  or a monk or a priest, you need to kind of be a true believer in the, you know,  the tenets of that holy order in order to enforce that.  And the problem is that I think we're living, not only are we living in a post-fact world,  we're living in a post-mythos world or maybe such a highly fragmented mythos that everybody has their own.  And there's no agreement anymore on a moral framework or...  Kellyanne Conway was actually president of the chain.  It's all made up anyway. And it's kind of like Bitcoin versus fiat currency.  Bitcoin undermines fiat currency because you suddenly realize just as Bitcoin is based on nothing,  neither is the dollar bill. And it all can start to crumble if people stop believing.  It's all made up.  Yes.  As soon as people don't hold these truths to be self-evident, even because they're not,  they're all made up. But as soon as people kind of see through that and we get in a post-fact society,  everything falls apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kellyanne Conway was more prescient than she certainly knew when she talked about alternative facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She may have understood that. It may be that she understood that. I'll give her more credit than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I just put it on the rundown.  Alex Stamos, the chief security officer of Facebook, just put up an update on the Russian ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. Let me look it up. Okay.  So that's why we're in this time of shifting sands.  So an update on information operations on Facebook.  Skip to the very bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We will continue to invest in our people and technology to help provide a safe place for civic discourse  and meaningful connections. They call this misuse of their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alex, by the way, is awesome. I have huge respect for him.  Where was Alex before?  He was at Uber before, wasn't he? Somewhere not so good.  Yeah, I was listening.  And no, he was at Yahoo. I'm sorry.  He was at Yahoo and he left because there was a breach and Mercer Meyer didn't tell him.  And he was so that's what it was that he walked out the door and went over to Facebook.  But he's a good security guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So 3000 ads, about 470 inauthentic accounts and pages in violation of our policies.  Interesting.  We don't allow inauthentic accounts on Facebook. They've shut down.  The vast majority of these ads were run by accounts that didn't specifically reference U.S. presidential election voting or the pro-indigents.  Rather, the ads and accounts appear to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum.  One quarter were geographically targeted, and of those, more ran in 2015 and 16.  The majority displayed by these accounts amplified divisive messages were consistent with the techniques mentioned in the white paper we released in April about information operations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to get people interested or upset about this, isn't it?  I mean, you can say, look, we're being manipulated.  People go, yeah, not really. I'm not worried about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is this is what read the data and society report. Read the data.  We know about it. We know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think the general public gives two figs about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's part of the point is that's part of the goal.  The goal is to make them say, ah, you're all corrupt and nothing's true anyway.  And there is no that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The goal is to break down the mythos that America is a myth.  Yes, yes, it is. Yeah, it's a myth.  But it's a myth that we need to believe in if we're going to continue to move forward.  And so but it's very fragile.  If you start if you can get people to say, oh, yeah, I used I've been seeing this for years.  Geeks, especially saying, oh, governments, it doesn't make any difference.  It's meaningless. It's corrupt. I'm not going to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Institutions are myths. Education is all expertise is a myth.  It's all right. And it's one we believe in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Other other other bricks go on top. What's what makes society is civilization.  Civilization is fundamentally a myth.  But it's but if you want order, you need to get people to believe in it.  At least somewhat or at least pay lip service to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what I concentrate a lot these days is is civility.  Yeah, I think part of what's happening is that we have the institutions of your we have government, media, corporations, NGOs.  And there's a fifth institution, which is communities.  And there's a great good to be had in that. I find my people.  I can connect with people. I can do things with them.  There's also a bad in that people who aren't in my community are bad.  The strangers are others. I trust my friends in my community more than I do doctors and lawyers and accountants and professors.  We're at we're at a point where people are refiguring their allegiances and beliefs around these institutions.  Yeah. It's hard times.  And it ain't going to be we're not we're too old. All of us are too old to see how this turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. I worry about my you're right.  And in some ways, I kind of am glad about that.  But I worry about I worry about my kids.  We all have kids roughly the same age.  We're entering this this new world.  And it's not it's not a world like we grew up in.  It's a very different world. It's not a world like 2003.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those innocent days, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you've got you've got fairly attractive problems, not to mention super storms heading up the coast.  I mean, it's terrifying.  Is it just being is just I feel like I'm trying to my own mind.  Am I just getting old? Is this or is this really look bad?  This is objectively bad.  This is this is a bad feel like it's objectively bad, but I don't know.  I love it. It ain't it ain't World War Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2003, we didn't have this power.  So it was easy for us to pontificate about it and do this because 2003 Google wasn't what it is now.  And part of this comes from this this sort of weird thing where these companies overshoot on their scrappiness  because they start out as the outsider and they've got to compete with the status quo.  And it takes them well to it as they become the status quo.  So if you're you know, if you're Larry Page, you may still think of yourself as the scrappy outsider,  even though you are now the CEO of the biggest source of information in the world.  And this was very much true of Intel and it was true of Microsoft.  And to some extent, it's true of Google as well.  And I'm sure Facebook had had that sense as they were growing to you.  You start out being the outsider.  And then you start out saying there is this establishment, there is this these power centers,  there's all this stuff going around the world.  We're just this little company, this ten of us, we're trying to do this thing.  But then you ramp up and you overshoot on that sort of sense of being the outsider that's trying to change the world  and don't realize that you are an establishment and also that your Twitter is an establishment as well.  So they may not.  You know, this is certainly true when I was working at Google, you know, how long ago it was eight, nine years ago  was that the execs didn't quite realize how much power they had and they'd make this pronouncement.  Then PR would have to go spend a lot of time cleaning up after them because they'd said something  that they thought was, you know, a thought experiment and everyone else thought was a policy statement.  You know, when Larry said, it would be nice if we had an island somewhere that didn't have any laws to experiment with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a little peek under the curtain there, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, it was the last time he had a he never went public again.  That was his last public utterance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm fairly sure he's got a bit of a telling off. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By who? Who's going to tell Larry Page off? Sergey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's her face? No, no. Who's the PR person?  The one who's now Uber. What's her name? British lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come back.  Come back to me.  But you know, but but a lot of that, you know, I'm sure she's not a group anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She left and went to Facebook. She didn't last very long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she went to Facebook. Facebook now.  There you go. So so I think I fight.  By the way, I think Mark Zuckerberg, people said, why would he want to be president of the who?  Rachel, Rachel, what's done? What's done?  What's done? People say, why would Mark Zuckerberg want to take a step down and become president?  The United States? I suddenly realized he doesn't want to be president of the United States.  Oh, he sees a world, a one world power.  He wants to rule the world.  So here's the question. Here's here's the stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we moving in that direction?  Well, here's here's this way. Here's here's a stupid question for you.  This is like a USA Today stupid poll.  Who's more powerful today? Right.  Larry Page or Donald Trump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Donald Trump's got nukes.  So there is true. There is a little bit of a hope.  We can't use them. Well, he can.  And so I think that's the problem is government isn't on the same scale as enterprise.  However, because of the rise of the rise of the bits, not not necessarily with with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're approaching that era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Schmidt used to say this. Schmidt would say, who do you trust more to tell you the truth, the government or Google?  Right. I know. I think they're equal.  And he was making explicit that either a lot of the time.  No, but we do trust Google.  I mean, Google is now it'll give us some answers nowadays.  It will often give us wrong answers and we'll call them out on it and they'll gradually fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's kind of like those three moralities.  I think neither one will tell you that they'll tell you their truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I've got I've got a I've got a clip for you if you can play a clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right now we're having trouble, I think, with our switcher because it's been sitting on Jeff for a while.  And that's happened. We don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't want Jeff to have too much airtime. No, no, no, no, no.  You put it in the chat room. It's clear proof it's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You put it here. It's in the chat room. All right.  Let me open this up. TV clip from from.  Oh, this is Terry Pratchett. You put this quote up earlier.  I like this. This is from earlier. This is from a movie called Hogfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was originally a novel by Terry Pratchett called Hogfather.  This is the TV version of it. Are you getting my audio, Karsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know? OK, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is well, it's Susan, Susan Death's granddaughter talking to death at the end of the time where they've defeated the auditors and restored Christmas or Hogsmas anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the key thing you need to know is the male voice here is death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and Susan is death.  Granddaughter was actually fixing human. OK, let me go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, humans need fantasy to be human, to be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.  With two fairies, Hogfathers.  Yes, as practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.  So we can believe the big ones.  Yes, justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not the same at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You think so?  Then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.  And yet you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But people have got to believe that. What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need to believe in things that aren't true. How else can they become?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I love that. That's awesome.  And I'm very, very. Yeah.  I've never seen Hogfather.  You need to watch Hogfather. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch it at Christmas. It's a Christmas movie. It's not kind of Christmas, but it's very well done.  It's about four hours long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Terry Pratchett, who is, you know, he reminds me a lot of Douglas Adams, both of whom understood this thing that, you know, eventually everybody comes to realize it's all made up.  And then now what?  Let's take a break. Kevin Marks is here undermining our very most fundamental beliefs.  He does that from time to time at IndieWeb.org.  Jeff Jarvis, he's pretty much the same.  He's at BuzzMachine.com and we are talking about all sorts of stuff.  I could talk about a shiny object.  I got the new Essential Phone.  I'm dying to hear about that.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's that's fascinating in itself.  I know.  Ever advertised?  Not that I know of.  Modems inside of phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's like it reminds me of Intel inside.  Intel inside.  Intel spent a lot of money to persuade you that Intel chips are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that was just kind of branding saying, oh, we're we're Intel and you trust us.  We're wonderful.  You've heard of us.  This is interesting because it's it's it's it's also a specific consumer benefit.  Well, but they're also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, notice where they're buying the ad.  They're aiming at a technically literate audience.  I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's that's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm I'm when when they call this up, I said, yeah, you bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm talking about an advertiser that's appropriate for the show.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, there's rumors that Microsoft's going to announce new surface devices running Qualcomm  ARM chips.  So that's I mean, if you know, which I had it right now, because I'm downloading I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  downloading Oreo.  I just got it.  How does the offer and it's not going fast enough.  It would go faster with a not Dragon Gigabit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to think that the Pixel 2.  I have it.  Yeah, I have it.  I gave up.  I finally went to the beta channel and said, you know, I just got it.  The Pixel X gave it to me yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, it's coming out now.  Do you notice any difference?  I don't know.  It's a huge amount of difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some subtle things.  The Ars Technica review was really helpful because as often is the case for these things,  it told me a bunch of things that I was like, did that change or was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Ron Amadeo did a brilliant job.  This is a 20,000 word review.  Oh, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The piece I just linked to actually ties up back with the Qualcomm thing because this I  hadn't actually clocked this in detail before.  And you've probably covered this all about Android already.  But one of the key changes they've made in Oreo is the ability to upgrade.  Parts of the OS independently of the OEMs.  Project Treble.  Project Treble, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, Google's had to do this because the biggest problem with Android is these  older Android phones that just will never be secure because they'll never be upgraded.  So by extracting bits of the OS, they've been doing this for a while and making it  updatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they said was they realized that they were dealing with huge numbers of OEMs.  They were dealing with a bunch of carriers.  There's a whole bunch of stuff going on.  But they were dealing with a smaller number of chipset makers.  And so what they did was they said, OK, let's define hardware abstraction layers around  the chipsets and then we will simplify the problem because then we're dealing with Qualcomm  and a few other chip makers like them and we can work with them directly.  And once we've got that piece abstracted, then the OEMs can layer on some software stuff  in between.  So they basically restructured the software stack to focus on the abstraction of the hardware  out so that it's easier to deploy this stuff in multiple stages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this what Microsoft did years ago with their hardware abstraction layer?  The idea of, because there was such heterogeneity in the hardware that they had to really lift  the operating system above that and then have a layer that interfaced with the hardware.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say Apple does it too.  Apple has a hardware abstraction layer and they have multiple vendors and they get them  to compete for each piece of the stack they're building and then they pick one for each release.  So way back when I was at Apple, even longer ago, 2000ish, the point there was we would  define a hardware abstraction layer and then we would go to the vendors and say, okay,  implement this hardware abstraction layer and we'll see which one of you does better  and we'll ship that one in this product.  And the goal was always to have more than one vendor for each piece of the system so  that you could have multiple bids and no one was able to hold your hostage.  That's less true now.  And part of the reason they end up buying some of those companies and doing these long-term  was that they are so much of the market, it's harder for them to ramp up the delivery of  the vendors and so on.  But this is a similar thing.  They said, okay, there's a choke point here.  We can have a large number of OEM vendors who build different devices and things on  the end, but there's only so many chipsets that are made because making a chipset is  a huge investment of time and money and physical silicon and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Ron points out that to update Android, Google has to go, after Google does its update,  it then has to go through three major steps going to the system on a chip vendors like  Qualcomm or Samsung and get them, this is in the past, get them to vet the release and  modify it for their hardware.  Then the OEM, Samsung and LG, get the OS, test it with their theme modifications and so forth.  And then finally, the carriers get it and it's usually the carriers that send it out  to the users.  But each, and we know this, each step not only causes delay, but also offers a roadblock.  Any one of those people could say, yeah, we're not going to update it for those phones.  So Project Treble has a vendor interface, a standard interface that sits between the  OS and the hardware.  The system on a chip vendor, Qualcomm, for instance, plugs into that interface and then  the, which is basically what we call a hardware extraction layer and the OS plugs into it.  And so that way the system on a chip vendor doesn't have to do as much work to get the  new version of Android working.  You still have some customization, but at least that can be done kind of in parallel.  You don't have to wait for the system on a chip.  So you have a new vendor test suite.  So this is stuff that when you get your Android phone running Oreo, you're not going to notice  a change there, but it's a big deal for security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you won't notice this for a while.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll make it possible to update these phones faster and for a longer period of time, which  is really, I applaud Google for really focusing on that and working on that.  Supposedly they're going to improve battery life.  They're going to, you know, they have these progressive loading apps now.  There's a lot of features, even a few new, you know, the way the system setting tray  works is a little bit different.  The problem is you can't really describe it unless you, unless we're all talking about  Pixel phones because almost everybody else customizes it heavily and it just, you won't  see the same changes.  I, you know, I don't see a huge difference on my Pixel, but you know, you want the latest,  I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you see, I mean, you see this sort of notification changes.  That's a big change.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got, it just went to sleep on me.  So the notifications have got more, um, distinction between them.  The, the, the, the, the live playing one picks up the color.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, there is, you, uh, I'm not going to be able to demonstrate this because you have  to get the right kind of notifications, but basically it tells you when there's stuff  running in the background.  Right.  Um, and you get, you get those doing there as you pulled, oh, as you pull down notifications,  you see the little icons come out of there and go back in and go back in again.  So, so there's a, there's a, there's a set of interesting stuff about the notifications.  Also, the apps now get little dots on them.  Um, have I got any?  Oh yeah.  Gmail at the bottom has one, but they're not, they're not counts like on iOS cause counts  kind of stressful.  It's just a dot saying you've, you've got mail.  Just a little dot saying you've got mail.  Then you, you, if you hold it down, it shows you the notification there as well.  Oh, that's nice.  And then you can, and you can dismiss that on its own or whatever, or click through.  So there's, there's, it's, it's not like, oh, this is going to change the world.  It's more like they spent a lot of time sweating the details and making a lot of these things  that are already quite good, a bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also clamping down on wake clocks, which is the bane of battery life applications  that wake your phone up and keep them awake while they do stuff.  Apparently Android will manage this.  There won't be, this is kind of what Apple did and gets very good battery life on the  iPhone because of it.  Free running background services are no longer a thing in Android.  That's, that's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when stuff is running the background, it tells you.  It lets you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see.  They're going to, you know, a little more efficiency here and there.  I don't, this is more of an under the hood upgrade than it is a feature update.  I don't think they didn't, they didn't, they didn't hype it a lot.  No, the biggest, I think single biggest new features is Google play protect.  Google says, do not install antivirus apps.  We'll take care of this.  You'll see a badge on the Android device.  It'll say Google play protect.  And I guess among other things, it scans.  Continually scans for malware looking for known flaws.  It'll do that for apps on the play store, but it will also scan apps that you've  downloaded from third parties and sideloaded.  Google says it scans half a million apps a day and any newly discovered apps get  queued up for deeper analysis.  I don't know what else.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is apps scanned yesterday at 720.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's, I don't know if that's window dressing because Google did some of this  before, although it was only doing it on the play store, I guess.  But that's a, but you know, a lot of this is about making the phone, you know, I  think there's kind of three prongs, more secure, better performance and battery  life.  And then a few, some cosmetic stuff.  Stage fright, which has always been a little bit of a problem.  The media framework is getting a little bit of protected protection.  The house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's part of, yeah, that's part of the same trouble hardware abstraction  there.  So they basically made it harder, made fewer things have direct contact with the  hardware and wrap those in abstraction layers so that they got more control of  them.  So that's the gate.  This is sort of another part, another reason to do that, that same kind of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web views are sandboxed running in isolated instances.  That's both for reliability and security.  You'll have to use a password if you turn on developer options, but most importantly,  new emoji.  That's, that's the thumbs.  Oh, what happens here?  This is a windows thing.  The thumbs are gone.  They're now round.  No more of those half, half round.  It's a little sad.  Well, good news.  There's an emoji for that guy crying.  He's laughing so hard.  He's crying.  There's a puking emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a hedgehog.  Is it giraffe?  Yep.  Very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny that you should bring up both the hedgehog and the puking emoji.  I think we talked about those same two emoji on windows weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also the other part of this restructuring is that emoji and fonts are now resources that  you can have control of without them being part of the operating system.  So that means in the future they'll be able to update emoji without having to update the  operating system.  And if they get this right, that will mean they can backport these emoji to old OSes as  well.  They're not as tiny bound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what was the last time we used to make a big deal of a new OS either in computer  or phone?  I think those days are over.  When was the last time you got excited about an OS?  It's all incremental now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you can't.  Which is fine.  Yeah.  It's hard to imagine.  I mean, I think that that's what's happening with Apple, the new iPhone.  But we'll see if Apple delivers.  It's very hard to come up with something so new that you go crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Apple is like the last holdout of the Big Bang release, really.  Yeah.  Everything else has gone continuous.  And that is an overall, that's a good thing.  You don't have to think about upgrading stuff as much because the upgrades happen in the  background silently, incrementally, and you don't notice that they've changed.  The browsers going that way was a huge, huge thing that made a massive improvement.  And a lot of it is because we have the web and we can do that.  I remember when software was stuff that you packaged on CD-ROMs and put in shelves.  That's what we had to do so that the process was built that way.  And Apple still retains some of that because they release a lot of their software with  their new machines.  So, you know, in a month or so, they'll push out some new hardware and then we'll suddenly  realize what those features and iOS 11 were really for.  And they're still bound like that, whereas everyone else is much more decoupled now.  And overall, that's a good thing.  It means that it's easier to patch things and that often means it's easier to patch  security problems as well.  But yeah, as you say, you don't say, oh, I've really, you know, don't have the, I've got  a QNITE to get Oreo.  It'll just like trickle out to your phone at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  There's finally color management.  I didn't realize this, but Android never had color management.  All desktop computers do, of course, but this will help make colors more consistent on  different phones.  There's a physics-based animation and there's a new octopus Easter egg.  I was playing with that before.  Yeah.  Yeah. It used to be a cat, right?  Now it's an Easter.  Now it's an octopus.  To get it, of course, you have to tap the, let me go and find it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to tap on Android version a bunch of times, then long press on the logo.  There was a cat game.  Remember the Neko cat game in Android 7.  Android 6 had a flappy bird and then press that button and lo and behold, a squishy octopus  will appear.  Apparently.  Oh, you work quite on the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You work quite on the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also support for SD cards, a new file system, SD card FS, which might make, this  has always been kind of a screwy, the way SD cards support it.  There's a squishy octopus.  Oh, he's so cute.  There we go.  He's so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can squish him.  Hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boot up times increased, doubled.  We're hard, hopefully.  Existing OS.  Graphics drivers can now be updated.  They've been pulled out into the Play Store as an APK.  That's good news.  Support for Bluetooth 5.  Of course, your hardware will also have to support it.  That improves the connectivity, doubles it to 50 megabits with quadruple the range and  eight times the messaging capacity over Bluetooth 4 LE.  There's also support for aptX, the new Qualcomm's Bluetooth codec for better quality sound  and Sony's LDAC.  Again, hardware support is required.  There's a printer service out of the box.  You don't have to download a plug-in anymore.  Oh, yeah.  Default printer service compatibility with 100 million Mopria certified printers, Xerox  Brother, Lexmark, Dell, HP, Samsung, Canon, and Epson.  97%, according to Google, of printers sold worldwide.  A big improvement here for musicians, a low latency audio API.  I always blamed the Linux kernel.  This was always a problem for Android users compared to iPad users.  There was a 10 millisecond delay in the audio latency, which made it very difficult to do  live performance stuff.  So you really didn't see a lot of audio apps on Android, but they say they fixed it.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said they've made it.  Well, they haven't really fixed it.  There's a new API.  There's a new API you have to use instead that gives you a fast path.  But it's still, it still had the Linux problems.  And this is very hard to fix.  Yeah, because it's in the kernel, right?  Yeah.  It's basically the Linux kernel is still a push model and the iOS kernel is a pull model.  And so that is, that dates back to OS X and goes back long enough that I was working there when we were changing it.  And the difference is that on OS X and iOS, there is a very low level interrupt that is running the audio that is pulling the chain all the way through the system,  which means that and that has that has higher progeny memory, which means that you can have audio latency without anything gapping.  Whereas Linux still has the sort of file system view of audio where you're writing stuff to a file and it buffers it a bit.  And if you want it to not gap, you increase the buffer size.  So the lag goes up all the time.  And that is very hard to fix.  And Google has been talking about fixing this properly for several years now.  And there's that they're walking towards it.  But I suspect that the newer the newer kernels they're talking about to replace the Android and Chrome kernels that we talked about these before may well be what they need to do to do this in the long run.  But in the meantime, they've got a new audio API at the system level that is designed to have a lower latency.  And again, it's not anyone you're basically in the same way that iOS and OS tended this.  You're basically saying in order to work with this API, I guarantee that I will respond within this time or you will shut me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there it is. Thanks to Ron Amadio for a 20,000 word summary.  There's a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if you if you care about Android, this is definitely worth reading.  Yeah, that was a great job.  Yeah, that was a useful hour and a half to read.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we I think we gave you the highlights there.  This is the essential phone.  Mine came yesterday.  I did not I did not get a pre-production version.  It is it is very apparently beautiful.  I mean, when you hold it in your hand, you'll love it.  Titanium and ceramic ceramic build.  It's got these two little pogo pins up here on the back for the do hickeys.  There's a 360 degree camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm impressed you know the jargon for what you call those pins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you see them on a lot of devices, including the new iPads, the smart connector.  And it's just, you know, electrical connectors.  I have to say, when I first opened the dust, I said, what is it?  Extra flash.  But on a closer inspection, you see it's there.  They're actually just metal connectors.  There's dual lenses.  The camera is buggy as heck.  I was hoping that they would have fixed this.  A lot of the reviewers mentioned this in the pre-production.  It's latent.  It crashed the phone, did a hard reset for me once.  It crashed itself another time.  But it does have a monochrome mode, which looks quite good.  It takes advantage, I guess, of the dual lenses.  The dual lenses aren't like on an iPhone where you can zoom in.  They're both active all the time, I gather, because there's no separate lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they right next to each other?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty close.  I'm not sure exactly how that works.  But there are still problems with the camera app.  I've heard some people download, side load the Google camera APK,  and it's faster and works better.  So I expect Essential will fix the camera.  You know, you look at it, and it's not only is it a fingerprint,  it's beautiful, but it's a fingerprint magnet.  And there's the monochrome mode of it.  And it really looks fragile.  In fact, we already got some hairline scratches on the bottom.  I've only had it a day.  Jason Howell had it yesterday for All About Android.  I'm going to give it back to him after this so he can review it for the new screensaver.  Your staff says that Jason ruins all phones.  Well, unaccountably, it's already got a crack in the glass on the front.  I know I didn't do that, but I think.  And Jason, I don't think dropped it.  So I think I'm wondering now, this could be a manufacturing defect.  I don't know.  The screen is beautiful.  If you compare it, I'll show you.  It's got a screen roughly the same size as the iPhone 7, 5.5-inch screen.  If you compare it to the iPhone 7, though, you'll see how much smaller it is.  And that's where the lack of bezels really makes a difference.  All phones going forward will have a lack of bezels.  So there's one thing that makes that difficult is the camera on the front.  If you don't have a frame, the camera has to notch out the screen.  Apple's apparently going to do this as well.  And the good news is on Android, because it's where the notification bar is,  and the notifications are kind of split between left and right.  You see it, but it's not functionally going to make too much of a difference.  Maybe on a game it will, or something like that.  It does not have a headphone jack.  And to me, that's kind of a deal breaker.  It's Type-C charging, and it comes with a Type-C adapter so that you can connect to a headphone jack.  But I just have to wonder, why don't they include headphone jacks, I guess, to save space?  It does feel great in the hand. It's very small.  But this is not going to be given that we've got the Note 8 coming out,  we've got the LG V30 coming out, we've got an iPhone next generation coming out,  and early in October Google's expected to announce the new Pixels.  I don't know if there's room for this phone.  It is practically a virgin Android.  I can't even see any customizations.  But it's 7.1.1. So it's not the most recent Android.  It's not running the Oreo, yeah.  It's not even running the most recent Android 7.  So it's unknown how often it will update or whether it will update to Android.  But I have to think this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I assume that they'll be working on the trouble stuff, because of who's running it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andy Rubin's company. I mean, he's the guy who created Android, right?  The camera sends abstractions.  If anybody besides Andy Rubin were making this phone, I think it would be just a complete non-starter.  But aesthetically it is gorgeous. The materials used are gorgeous.  I'm sure they'll fix the camera issue.  Get a case for it.  Yes, I'll put it.  It's sad because...  I always get a case.  Yeah, but you design a beautiful phone, but it doesn't matter,  because if it's in a case it could be ugly. It doesn't matter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this came with a transparent case, but I dropped it and it shattered, so now I've got a rubber case.  And exactly, I've got a pretty blue phone inside this black thing.  Who cares?  You'll never see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll see it when you sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a weird hole in the back for my finger to go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is one thing I have to say.  Samsung really screwed the pooch with the fingerprint reader.  The way the Samsung phone does it next to the camera is just a terrible, terrible idea.  This is a Pixel XL style or Pixel style fingerprint reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  I was confused by it originally, but it's actually really nice.  It works.  It's how you hold it.  You're picking it up right back.  It's very natural.  You can fix this there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because it is a small phone with a big screen and virtually no bezel, it just fits in the hand.  It feels good.  I could see executives buying this phone just because it looks so good.  Just don't drop it.  We will have iFixit on the new screensavers as well.  They said it is one in repairability because it is just terrible.  It's just you can't take it apart.  They were underwhelmed.  And there are already rumors there'll be a second generation coming soon fixing some of these complaints.  So, you know, it's interesting.  It's Andy.  I'm glad Andy's doing something.  I have all the respect in the world for him.  He worked at Danger.  Absolutely.  He worked at Android and then was sold to he sold the company to Google.  Now there's a review by Darrell Etherington in TechCrunch who said how the essential phone won me over completely.  It's emotional.  It is emotional.  You know what?  It is kind of emotional when you see it.  You hold it.  It really feels very, very nice.  But the fact that it's cracked already has kind of taken some of the luster off.  He praises the monochrome camera.  Gosh, it's just this is a this is this is a fine phone, but in a very competitive field that is going to be extremely crowded in the next two months.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think there's some good news here, too.  I want to mention the tech turds fight is over.  Oh, Mike Masnick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is great news.  Yes.  Yes, it's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to mention this.  Under other dismiss it.  Wow.  Shiva Ayodhya's defamation suit.  He is this guy's long effort to say that he invented email and he goes after everybody.  He went after Gawker and won a settlement.  A federal judge in Massachusetts has dismissed the libel lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see what the judge said here.  He found it's because it's impossible to define precisely and specifically what email is.  I had derised claim is incapable of being proven true or false.  The judge continued.  One person may consider a claim to be fake if any element of it is not true or if it involves a slight twisting of the facts.  Well, another person may only consider a claim to be fake if no element of it is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that's an issue for a fake news debate of these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did not win under California's anti-slap law.  So he cannot imagine it cannot have his legal fees paid.  Of course, there's always a possibility of appeal, but he was denied permission to amend the complaint and refile it.  So he would have to appeal to a higher court.  This is this is very good news.  This is the U.S. district judge, F. Dennis Saylor.  And I think that's actually exactly right.  Mm hmm. I think that's exactly right.  Yeah.  It's weird to think that I mean, I don't want to get sued by this guy, but it's right.  Exactly. I don't either.  Speaking of a chilling effect, but it's weird to think that somebody could have invented email.  What was the year he was like as late as the 70s?  I'm trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was long after email had been invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was long after I was using email.  He claimed he invented it in high school.  It just didn't.  He said he was a high school student in the late 70s and invented email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is another one of these things where the idea of invented is just misunderstood.  Right.  And the patent system sort of leads people towards this nonsense.  But inventing is not thinking of something inventing is actually making it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does have a copyright for his program called email.  So what?  There were no software patents at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can have a copyright for the words I say on the show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everyone has a copyright for everything they write ever.  That was that was what happened with the Basel.  Yeah.  Copyright thing in 1976 whenever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I wish Stacey were here for one story.  Well, every story.  I wish you were here.  Every story.  No offense.  One story in particular.  Juicero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the Juicero story.  Yeah.  You know, remember that Stacey knows Doug Evans, right?  I know she does.  That's why I'd love to hear.  She said has said in the past that he's a nice guy.  He was a restaurateur, an entrepreneur.  His restaurants were they called Organic Avenue, something like that, went bankrupt.  But he started this juice company called Juicero.  Initially crowdfunded at seven hundred dollars.  They raised a considerable amount of money.  One hundred and twelve.  Sorry about that.  I hate autoplay video.  Have I mentioned that?  They raised they raised considerable amount of money.  Google's venture capital arm and other backers poured one hundred and twenty million dollars into Juicero.  They eventually got the machine down to four hundred dollars plus the cost of a subscription to the juice packs.  The juice press, according to Doug Evans, wields four tons of force, enough to lift two Teslas.  But turned out Bloomberg tried this.  You could squeeze it with your hand.  And so if you could get the juice packs without the Juicero, which you couldn't, you could just squeeze them out and it would be exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At which point they are odd wallah.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Gwyneth Paltrow liked him after working.  Ivanka Trump liked him.  He really she liked Juicero too.  She twiddled out support for Juicero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doug spent three years building a dozen prototypes for devising Juicero's patent pending press.  In an interview with Recode, he likened his work to the invention of a mainstream personal computer by Steve Jobs.  And in fact, it was quite over engineered.  There are four hundred custom parts in here.  There's a scanner, there's a microprocessor, there's a wireless chip, there's a wireless antenna.  He actually pitched it as being able to squeeze large chunks of fruits and vegetables.  But in fact, the stuff was already juiced in the packages.  Anyway, they've gone bankrupt.  And the good news is, and this does, I think, speak well of Doug Evans, they're refunding everybody's money.  So if you bought a Juicero at 700 or 400 dollars, they say, we'll see, they say you'll get it.  I imagine the investors are terribly happy about that.  And I saw pictures, apparently, the number of bodegas in New York and elsewhere were using Juicero's and selling.  But that you won't be able to get the packets anymore either.  So the packets were only available in three states until Tuesday when the company expanded to 17 because the packages can't be shipped long distances.  So the whole thing is just what's most amazing to me is that he raised 120 million dollars.  That's this is that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is bubbly. Yeah, that's bubbly.  It's juicy. It's a juicy time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People look at Dollar Shave Club and a bunch of other companies kind of doing these subscription services.  Probably thought, well, juice.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But OK, so but it's between it's between a little rock and a hard place, isn't it?  I mean, it's it's between we have a solution for that.  It's been naked juice, not wallow, which is here's the juice in a thing.  Put it in your fridge and drink it.  And those little metal things that squish citrus that I've got one.  Well, if you ever bought a juicer, I've had an industrial juicer and those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a double. Those are the devil to clean.  They're horrible. So I understand why people might have thought.  Oh, look, if you could simplify this, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, if you are. Yeah.  If you want to like pick apples from the garden and sit them in the juicer and make apple juice.  Yeah, you can do that. And it works.  But then you've got to spend 15 minutes scrubbing the damn thing with a brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's so so you need a self-cleaning juicer.  That's the point is this is an aero press. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Aero press was actually a bit of engineering where they said, OK, coffee making is messy.  What if we reduce the essentials?  Here's a giant syringe with a filter paper in the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best thing ever invented, by the way.  And it's only thirty dollars. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's twenty five quid.  It makes great coffee. Love it.  I have. And, you know, I've I've I accidentally smashed the French press.  I bought one of these. I was like, why was I drinking that bad coffee for so long?  Yes. So, yeah. Yes.  It's the best coffee maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's from the folks who do aerobie, the fake frisbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the thing is, the point is, this is actually thinking about engineering.  It's like, OK, right.  How do we make this thing that actually solves the problem of get extracting the thing we want,  separate the thing we don't want and make it easy to clean?  And it's not you don't you don't buy special little pouches from them.  That's the other thing.  This is no, no. It uses real coffee.  It uses real coffee. You buy a photo papers from them.  They're like, you know, ten bucks for a four hundred or whatever they are.  Yeah. They last you a year.  And this thing will make you coffee.  And the point is, you then you once you get this, you start buying nice coffee because you can taste the damn stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can taste the difference.  We actually we're going to France in two weeks.  We're bringing an AeroPress with us just in case.  No. Oh, yeah.  No, Lisa's like, I'm not taking a chance.  That makes sense.  Why not? Right.  France.  I know. That's what I said.  We're going to the land of coffee.  But she also brought one to Ecuador.  So, you know, jeez.  One of those came out.  Yes, because you get great beans.  Yeah. She should have brought a hand grinder, however.  All right.  I love it.  The comparison between Gercero and the AeroPress.  That's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that is the difference between an actual disruptive innovation and somebody who's masturbating with too much VC money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But sadly, I doubt Aerobeat raised one hundred twenty million dollars for the AeroPress.  They didn't need to.  They didn't need to. It's plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure they've sold millions of dollars worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've sold ten to me alone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm about to buy two more for my sons.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  OK. I have a tech thing that I don't know if you've covered.  OK.  But it has since I was last on this has come out.  This is progressive web apps.  Installation has changed in Chrome 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about that. This is brand new. We haven't talked about this at all.  So, first of all, what are progressive web apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So progressive web apps in.  It's a marketing term.  It's a way of saying that there was a bunch of things that native apps could do that web apps couldn't do.  And so some deep work was done with the standardization process to say, how do we make these things more like apps?  What's the advantage of apps? What's the drawback of apps?  How do we get the advantage of the drawback?  So the advantage of apps was they have more access to the machine.  The drawback is they take you have to do work to install your web apps or so on.  So what progressive web apps was was.  And it's adjustments to the browser that lets it have something running in the background, which means that you can work when you're offline.  You can control what's cached whens, which means it will work completely offline.  You can also set it up so that it does notifications and does a bunch of the things that the native apps can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can do transactions directly, which is the beauty of it for stores and such as you can do a transaction directly without having to download the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you give me an example of a progressive web app?  Do we know of any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Washington Post was there. Now they're used a lot more advertisers used them like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the indie web one I use is Woodwind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it a browser extension?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, OK, what happens is, let me see if I can see this.  I'm running Woodwind. I've used it two or three times.  It says install this app. I click the install button a couple of minutes ago.  When I now click open, it opens up and instead of being in the browser, it's now in an app.  OK, so the browser Chrome at the top is gone. It's now in an app.  Is this only on mobile? Is that PWA or is it an app?  It works on desktop as well.  OK, so no, no, it's an app.  So what the thing that changed in Chrome 60 is that it now shows up as an app.  It showed up in an app here before. So it's no longer inside Chrome.  It's an app that happened. Chrome 53 or something.  But the thing now is that it also shows up.  If I go to the app overview, it's now shows up in there, too.  So they've basically made wrapped an APK around it.  So Woodwind now is in my list of apps and it behaves exactly as an Android app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do you get it? I mean, how do you install it? Where does it come from? Does it website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to a website. If you use the website two or three times, it will auto prompt you to open it.  Or if it's the right kind of website, it will give you when you do the save to desktop, it will go through this process instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is Woodwind's website? Do you know? Can I?  Woodwind.xyz  OK, because I want to see this experience. Now I'm on Windows running Chrome 60.  So Woodwind account is tied to your personal domain name. This is some sort of weird indie web thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the web. You have to log in with your use your use your use with known.  Use your known site. Yeah.  But you won't see the install dialog stuff on Windows to the same extent.  But it will it will work. You only get at the moment you only get this on Firefox mobile and you get it on Chrome, Chrome Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So. So what is new in 60?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is doing 60 is that it actually makes an APK from it.  So before it would show up when you click the it would show up in the list of apps that you scroll through.  What's new is that it now also shows up in the app drawer as well. So it feels more like an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is kind of like those Chrome apps that we had that Google deprecated.  Yes, but it's completely different loading experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so if you want another one, you should you can get a Jeremy's Jeremy's site. Hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What from a point of view of an end user? What's the value? OK, now I'm finally authenticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably the best one because it requires a bunch of indie web stuff to get going.  The value from the end user is that you start off using a website and it becomes an app transparently without you noticing what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then it shows up, at least if you're on a mobile device, it shows up in your app drawer.  What does it look like on a desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like an app icon on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. OK. Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Progressive web apps now better than ever.  Are a lot of people embracing this technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Now, people are starting to see that this is particularly if you've got something that is very web bound and makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you don't want to set up a roadblock to people to install the app.  That's a big problem. I could see why a newspaper consensus might use this.  If I keep going to the Washington Post, eventually I have a Washington Post app magically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Kevin, isn't that also there's also the same time there's progressive web apps and Android instant apps.  That's that's sometimes I confuse the two, but those are different.  So Android instant apps is to be able to pull a piece of an app out and server on the web.  Progressive web app is a web page that has so much internet acts like an app.  No. So the simplest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So progressive web apps is yeah, it's a web page that actually turns into an app.  So, OK, another example, resilient web design dot com, which is Jeremy's book.  He made that into progressive web app just because he could.  So if you go to that on Android and you can read the book and then it will offer to install it as a web app.  And then you get the little you get the you get it as an app shows up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then if I click that resilience, it pops up and there's the book again.  Oh, that's really cool. So you can you can do this.  You can you can create you can create a web app around content that will then work when it's offline.  So if I if I, you know, airplane mode this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do that all the time. I think, oh, I want to download this site or I want to somehow capture this so I can continue.  Then this example of Jeremy's book, you know, I could easily see downloading the PDF so I could read it.  So if I just go back to the site, it's cashed all the pages now.  Yeah. Yeah. So and that just does it the first time you visit or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's like the second or third time you visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great idea. So, yeah, do people mind?  I mean, it's a seven megabyte download.  Do they mind that I have the seven megabytes of this?  Is it is it in cash? Where does it store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a caching thing. So it's stored as a cash part of the browser.  Yeah, you could probably abuse this a little and then then the browser will start unloading you.  Right. But you know, for textual content, there's no real pain from it.  Right. Neat.  But it's this subtle thing that's this is like the end run of like about three years worth of work to say,  how can we make the web more app like? How can we make this part of the experience?  And it is now very, very smooth.  So if you're developing something that is primarily content like a web like,  this is just going to make the experience smoother for many more people.  And another key thing is that the offline stuff works better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So really good use for safe. I'm thinking about us.  If you came to our website, Twitter TV a few times to download podcasts,  it would just kind of automatically show up as an app in your in your phone.  Yes, absolutely. And then how do you feel about that? Do they mind that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they have to they have to click a button and say, yes, OK.  So but it will prompt them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it definitely eliminates that barrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then when there's a new episode, you can make a notification comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a new episode. See, that's nice. I like how hard is it to develop these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this. It's not too bad. I mean, they're basically they're basically developing a website.  There's a manifest file you can add that describes what basically gives you an icon and says it on the desktop.  You have to have a GPS and you have to create basically service workers,  a piece of code that will run to do this work of the caching and to handle the notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it essentially a WebView or is it something different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no, it's an enhanced Web App. It's basically it's a Web page that has some extra powers.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was also based, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  No, it's kind of orthogonal to that, but you can it's complementary.  So you can you know, the nice thing about AMP is that it gives you compact things that you can you can run that will give you a standalone experience.  And so if you combine that with the Progressive Web App, which is what that WAPO thing did when they still had it,  it would give you a bunch of stories that were offline so that you could then read them on the subway or whatever.  So there's a nice complementarity between the two.  But there's a but they're actually working in slightly different domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's Facebook like buttons, which account for 16 percent of an average website's code.  Yeah, that was amazing.  Really? Yeah.  It's a lot of JavaScript, right?  Caching stuff.  Wow. But people want these features.  That's why they put Facebook commenting on their Web pages as they put like buttons.  But you're ending up downloading a whole bunch of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook's theory, you know, this is Facebook trying to be OS like if you like.  So they've got an SDK that includes all the things that are Facebook flavored stuff you can do.  And the assumption is once you've downloaded this once, you've got it for all the sites that are using it.  So the pain of downloading isn't that high.  But it does mean that you've still got to download it once wherever you are.  But also you still got to execute all this code.  And just doing that will take a bunch of time.  And that article is worth reading to see what the overhead of that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like it's like these these apps like I'm thinking of the Atom text editor,  which you're basically you're downloading Chrome basically.  You're basically it's a browser you're downloading a bunch of JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does that Facebook button work in AMP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the Facebook button work in AMP? I bet not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't work in AMP because AMP doesn't let you download that library.  But if Facebook wants to conform to the AMP pieces, they can do it.  So this would be one of these like he says he said things that I suspect won't actually happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, AMP also sets the library. Right.  So AMP says here's the library of things that are downloaded to every browser using AMP and does that or does not.  It includes things like slideshows. Does it or includes trackers?  Does it or does it not include Facebook stuff?  It's a really interesting kind of little antitrusty thing going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a little it's one of those like you've got to wrap your thing inside my thing to make it work.  So I don't know yet. I suspect Facebook will resist that because they prefer being that having had I had previous here.  Facebook would prefer to have their own thing and rely on the fact that they are they have the ability to get it installed, which you know you probably have that installed.  You go to enough media sites, it'll be there.  But what you'll find is that it's also running that code in every web page you're viewing and that the overhead of that is high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you drive around L.A. or New York, you might see these billboards, big white billboard with just the simple text.  Netflix is a joke. Turns out they're bought by Netflix. Of course.  So I guess we'll find out what it's probably referring to some comedy series that Netflix is going to launch at some point.  These guys know how to market. Yeah, maybe. I don't know.  We'll find out. Amy Schumer said she'd asked for received money for Netflix for a stand up special after she said she wanted more money when she learned that Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle were each getting a little bit of a  $20 million for their special. Amy Schumer said, hey, I want some of that Netflix money.  Very subtle goodbye to Solaris. The last bit of sun has finally gone out.  Oh, OK. Right. Oracle has laid off and laid off all the Solaris tech staff.  And this is I think there's not much left of the sun.  Just mentioning it. It's amazing. Was it worth buying?  Well, it turns out what I think is widely agreed now that all Oracle really wanted was the right to sue Google for billions of dollars.  Yes. That hasn't worked out that well.  So apparently that was I talked to John was it Jonathan Schwartz or somebody?  Who was at the meeting when Larry Ellison came to Sun and when he heard the bit about well, you know, we haven't sued him, but we honestly feel like Google's infringing our requirements on Java.  Larry Ellison apparently rubbed his hands in glee.  I wish I was a triangulation interview. I'm sure we'll find it at some point.  All right. Let's take a let's take a little bit of a break because we still want some pics of the week and numbers of the week before we wrap this thing up.  Our show today brought to you by Keptera.  Keptera is a fabulous free and easy to use.  And it's a great way to get your hands on the latest news.  Before we wrap this thing up our show today brought to you by Keptera.  Keptera is a fabulous free and easy to use software directory.  If you're looking for business software, I think a lot of people just probably Google it, but that's a terrible way to find a program that you'll be running your business on.  You're just going to get a bunch of undifferentiated search results.  What I really like is a directory with all of the possible programs rated, reviewed, feature lists and all of that stuff.  And that's exactly what Keptera does in 400 categories.  Everything from managing a church to a medical practice to e-commerce to CRM help desk, field service applicant tracking, development tools and on and on and on.  So we have 400 plus categories from A, B testing.  Let's go to the bottom of the alphabet.  All the way to I think the last one is QRST, yoga studio management.  Let's say you have a yoga studio and you say, well, I want some software to run my yoga studio.  Turns out there's quite a few yoga studio programs that can run yoga studios.  I mean, lots.  So let's narrow it down.  You'll see we're going to only do four star ratings.  We're going to say 10 users.  We want it web based.  Maybe you want it installed.  You get to pick.  Do you want staff management, online payments?  Yes.  Member management, then filter the results and you'll narrow it down to the 11 products that do exactly what you want.  Then add them to a comparison chart.  Pick up to four of them.  Let's say these four right here and then we'll compare them now.  And look at this.  You're going to get everything you need to know to help you find the right software, including the starting price, whether there's a free trial version, where it's installed, how it runs, what features it has screenshots.  But the best part is the ratings and the reviews, the reviews from real users just like you.  Captera has hundreds of thousands of software user reviews all verified.  This is just a fantastic site.  Oh, did I mention it's absolutely free?  No charge, no sign up, no salesman will call.  It's it's a service provided by Captera.  Absolutely free.  You won't get annoying, annoying follow up emails or phone calls.  You won't spend weeks or months searching because everything you need is right here.  T A P T E R R A dot com slash twig.  Find the right software for your business.  It will save you time every day.  Captera and we thank Captera for their support of this week in Google.  So, Jeff Jarvis, let's start you up.  I see you have a few things in here that I saved because I didn't want to steal your number, but you left out.  You left out one of the numbers I was going to do.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  Hit me with it.  The amount of money Amazon spends on R&D, which exceeds every country, every company in the world.  Sixteen point one billion dollars.  Alphabet 13, Intel 12, Microsoft.  The tech companies lead.  They're the red bars on this graph.  The highest non-tech company is number six, Johnson & Johnson, General Motors, Pfizer, Ford.  But look at that Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is Amazon, you know, not making a profit.  This is Amazon.  This is where the investment goes R&D and it pays off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazing.  Eight, 16 billion dollars.  Nobody comes even close.  So I wasn't going to mention that because I thought, oh, that'll be Jeff's numbers for sure.  But that's a good one.  You got some other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we got some other ones.  The ones we got, Google and Udacity are providing seventy five thousand scholarships for coding and data.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter's taking a Udacity course on artificial intelligence.  She wants to know.  Well, Jake finished one on app development.  Isn't it great?  I just want to.  It's such a good thing.  This was a Google.  A Googler started this, right?  A Google X guy.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sebastian Thrun.  No, no.  Was it Thrun?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he started Udacity.  And they have these nanodegrees which you pay for some, some free and some paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of the nanodegrees, you can get a new career, a new job.  Yeah.  Which in this way, this day matters.  Yeah.  So that's one.  The other one, just for our amusement, is the top 20 how to searches in 2017 in Google.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guesses.  So.  Guesses anybody?  How did it tie?  How to tie a tie is number one.  How to tie a tie.  Oh, but it gets weirder.  How to kiss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Number three, if you have to ask Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to get pregnant.  More people want to know how to get pregnant than how to lose weight.  How to make money.  How to make pancakes.  How to write a cover letter.  How to make French toast.  How to lose belly fat.  No one's searching for that.  Come on.  How to write a resume.  How to boil eggs.  How to boil eggs.  How to draw.  How to boil eggs?  Boil eggs.  No, I look up hard boiling eggs all the time because there's a magic method that I can  never remember.  So I do search for that a lot, but I know how to do it roughly, but I just need to have  the details.  How to get rid of acne.  Oh, number 18.  How to love.  I want to know how to love.  Notice number, know what, how to hate is not on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How to love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to get rid of fruit flies.  Very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Simon Rogers, who's Google's data editor, a friend of mine, says that how to searches  have increased 140% since 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, everybody I know learns how to do stuff on YouTube.  Yeah.  My son has basically learned how to cook on YouTube.  He says everything, everything is on YouTube.  He cooks a lot of hot dogs.  No, actually, it's not true.  When I got my sous vide machine, I learned everything on YouTube.  It's amazing.  YouTube is the best.  I would guess that, you know, more education going on in YouTube than anywhere.  Kevin has returned to us.  He was jogging around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to let the dogs out.  Who let the dogs out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We now know the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can probably hear a dog drinking water in the background.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Kevin, I know you'll want to say something about the Indie Web or the Homebrew Website  Club or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Well, there's Homebrew Website Club tonight.  It's in, you've already missed London and Brighton, but we have San Francisco and Baltimore.  And new tonight, we have Austin.  That's just starting tonight.  So go along.  If you're in Austin tonight, go along there.  Half past six at Monkey Nest Coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Burnett Road down there in beautiful Austin, Texas.  Yes.  It's a coffee shop, Monkey Nest.  And I see Mozilla is going to have one.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Manton will be at the Austin one who does micro.blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Tantec will be at the Mozilla one.  Yes.  Nice.  That's right.  Nice.  Homebrew Website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there is also a Indie Web Camp this weekend in Dortmund in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As part of the Campa Festival.  And there are trying to be a lot of journalists to that one.  So you should tell your friends, Jeff, because I know you have a lot of German journalist friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're all about the Indie Web and Open Web.  So thank you for the good work you do to promote that.  I want to give a big plug to my new...  One more thing to shake.  Have you seen this?  No.  What?  You must go offline to view this page.  Wait a minute.  It says enable airplane mode.  That's a website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a website.  It's using the Progressive Web App features.  And now I'm in offline mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  That's awesome.  So that's a great demonstration of Progressive Web Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And part of the point of the Progressive Web App stuff is you can detect when you're offline and you can give them some content you've already cached.  We can give them a page saying, sorry, we're offline.  Come online again.  This is Chris Boland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so presumably when I'm on this first page, it's now caching the rest of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's now caching the offline page.  And then when you go offline, it will appear.  Oops.  I'm in the airplane mode again.  That's my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be kind of fun.  Let me see if I can...  You could do this on a desktop, I guess, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the desktop won't work in the same way.  But let's try and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I'm trying to figure out how I go offline on this machine.  That's the challenge on the desktop.  Yeah.  I know there should be a little Wi-Fi thing here somewhere.  I don't see it though.  Is this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're running Chrome on Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Windows is...  There's probably a way to do it.  I'll just do...  Oh, there's definitely a way to do it.  I just for some reason don't see it.  Let's go into airplane mode.  I am now in airplane mode.  Let's return to my page.  I've lost everything.  Nothing.  Come on.  I'm offline.  I'm fresh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're on Chrome, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Windows is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll forget it.  Do this on your phone.  I've lost my mouse now.  You're going off to have a bad day.  This sucks.  Screen goes black.  You crashed my computer.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.  I'm going to be in trouble.  All right.  Well, I can't show my pick of the week, but I will be demonstrating it.  And if I don't crash it between now and Saturday on the new screensavers, I have the worst  luck with drones.  I see all these beautiful drone videos people are taking.  And finally, Alex Lindsay convinced me, no, no, you can fly this drone.  I've heard this before, by the way, the first drone I ever got.  I was told by our drone expert, Father Robert Ballis here.  We call him the, what do we call him?  The what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The quad father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The quad father.  We call him the quad father.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a quadcopter expert.  He said, get a cheap one because you'll crash it right away.  So I got a $40 drone, used it once, turn it on, said, go up, start going up.  I said, come down, come down.  It just went up like a balloon and never came back.  I don't know where it ended up.  I lost sight of it.  So that's $40 down the tube.  That's when I bought $500 Bebop drone that everybody said, you can't crash this.  First thing I did, crashed it.  And it's ever since, I still have it.  When you launch it, it falls over like this.  So I really wasn't that excited about getting another drone.  But then I thought, well, it'd be fun because I'm going to be going on a Caribbean sale  with my son and he wants to make a video and all that.  And I said, well, it'd be great if we have a drone fly over.  So Alex Lindsay convinced me, and you could pull up the, it's from DJI, it's called the  Mavic Pro.  You fold it up, you can carry it.  It's tiny.  I mean, it's not a tiny drone, but when you fold it up, it's not big.  It's like the size of a computer power supply, sort of.  A little expensive.  But man, what I learned is we are really in a whole new era of drones.  These things are so much better than the early drones.  They do so many things.  This has all these follow modes.  You can set it to recognize you or a person.  It will continue to follow you as you ski or run or sail.  It can recognize a boat and continue to follow the boat.  It can rotate around it, keeping its eye on you.  It can follow you in profile.  Anyway, I've already flown it a few times and haven't crashed it, which is a good sign.  Knock wood, Leo.  Knock wood, because it's expensive to crash it.  But the 4K video looks stunning that I got back.  I would show you, but I'm basically offline at this point.  I don't know when I can get back online.  But you'll see more.  I'll do a full review.  In fact, we'll fly it on the new screensavers on Saturday.  But I'm very impressed.  The Mavic Pro.  This is DJI.  The camera's on a gimbal.  It works with a smartphone.  You can plug it in.  And they even have, see that?  They have a VR helmet you can wear if you want to.  How much, Leo?  Not too bad.  You're buying an airplane for God's sake.  Well, the amount of technology in this thing blows me away.  So $1,000, I know it sounds like a lot, but this has got a lot more technology than a  $1,000 smartphone.  I mean, this thing is kind of mind-boggling.  It flies for a half an hour.  It can go 12 miles away, or no, four miles away from you.  It has auto, it has GPS built in.  And so if you do lose track of it, this is, I really need this, it will just come home.  Or there's a home button you can press and it will come back to where it took off from  and land.  And I did try that.  The first thing I did, I said, well, will it really do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, find my phone for a drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I've lost so many that just that feature alone seems worth it to me.  It will come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can combine the two.  It's like, find my phone, the drone goes and gets your phone and brings it back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the good thing, DJI for 99 bucks has a fix your drone plan.  If you do fly into a tree or it gets wet or whatever, you can exit back to them and they'll  fix it and send it back to you.  So I bought the insurance.  How much is the insurance?  99 bucks.  It was worth it.  Believe me, after losing.  Is there a deductible?  I didn't even inquire.  I just knew I needed it.  I'm sure.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  I'll let you know the minute I use it because I'm sure I will be.  But review on Saturday.  Thank you everybody for being here.  Thank you, Kevin Marks for filling in for Stacey.  Always a pleasure.  Find him at indyweb.org at Kevin Marks.  I love doing this show because I get to be around really smart people and learn stuff.  Smart people like you, Kevin, and like you, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY,  blogger at buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.  He told me that on Twitter, I feel like I don't I want to ignore trolls and racism.  You said no, you have to fight racism wherever because if it were in person, I'd say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I feel like on Twitter, it's like I think we have to start to expect civility from others.  Yeah, demand it.  When we demand it, when we don't, we're somewhat called bullies.  When we encourage the incivility, when we say fight, fight, go look at that funny, we're  equally guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I like it.  I like it.  Let's bring civil discourse back to the commons.  Stacey will be back next week, I think.  Yes.  Jeff, you traveling or can you come back next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'm here.  I owe Carson a list.  I think I'm gone one time this month.  Kevin will have you back very soon.
