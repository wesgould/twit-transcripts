Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got festive lights here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Festivus for the rest of us.  Nice.  That's Matthew Ingram.  Yes, very festive.  December 23rd is officially Festivus.  But Matthew, just because I know you're a pagan.  Oh, I'm sorry. You're Canadian. Close.  We put up the Festivus poll.  Fantastic.  Feats of Strength and the airing of grievances coming soon.  Yes, let's get to it.  Actually, the actual Festivus...  Canadians have no grievances.  No, I know. What are you unhappy about? Softwood?  We do. We just keep it to ourselves.  They're sorry they have no grievances.  I'm so sorry.  No, that's actually...  Matthew might have a little grievance.  He, of course, writes for the Columbia Journalism Review,  where he is their man about the digital universe  and had an article this week in the CJR.  NPR's move into podcasting analytics raises privacy concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I imagine you probably have some thoughts about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I certainly do.  So what is NPR planning?  What are they up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they've rolled it out.  It's an open standard that they developed,  but they're hoping, obviously,  lots of distributors and creators will integrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they own a...  This actually explains why they bought...  What for us is the number two podcast platform, PocketCasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the interesting thing is PocketCasts has said  it has no plans to implement this standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They obviously didn't get the memo yet.  No, no, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to do it?  It doesn't sound like they're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That, by the way, kills this in its tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sure doesn't help, that's for sure.  So how does it work?  It's basically tags.  Audio tags?  Yeah, the content is tagged.  I wouldn't pretend to understand how it actually works technologically,  but the way it's described is that there are tags in the stream,  and you can tag whatever you want.  You can tag the ads, you can tag the beginning of the podcast,  you can tag when the guests all introduce themselves,  you can tag a specific feature within your podcast,  and then you can see how many people make it to that tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does it report back up the playing of the tag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, magic, I assume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's why it matters whether PocketCasts implements it.  The player has to be listening to the tag and then upload it.  So if iTunes doesn't implement it,  PocketCasts doesn't implement it,  it's dead in the water because those are the two,  number one and number two podcast platforms.  As a business, what do you think of it, Leo?  Well, to me, okay,  so the way NPR is pitching this, according to your article,  is as a useful thing for programmers  because they can know when people tune out of their show.  That's not the reason for it.  Oh, it's a bad thing.  It's shocking that a content company would do this  because it's really for advertisers.  This is what advertisers would like.  So frustrating.  Some of this comes from the fact that  the same people buy podcast ads by digital banner ads.  So they're really used to this kind of  instant metrics and feedback.  How many people looked, how many people clicked,  how many people clicked through, how many people bought.  They get all these metrics.  It really bugs them  that podcasts don't offer those same kind of metrics.  I should point out that neither does a Super Bowl ad,  nor, I mean, you've got ratings,  but we have ratings for podcasts that are very comparable.  In fact, I think better than television and radio ratings.  But you don't know if the person got up  during the Super Bowl ad and went to the bathroom.  You don't.  In magazines, Jeff, you know this,  having been in the magazine business for years,  magazines can't determine whether an ad was seen or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's extreme bullsh**.  Sorry, I'm just going to cut that out.  And even in the circulation ad,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what is it, ABC, the Advertising Circulation Bureau,  even has a pass-along rate to inflate the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's syndicated research.  So when I was at People,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People had a pass-along rate of eight readers per copy.  Every copy was dog-eared as could be.  How? Because it was public place.  Also, they counted people who would  riffle through the magazine and check out.  And if you passed a quiz,  then they counted their readers.  So eight readers per copy versus about two,  I think, for TV Guide at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the whole, the advertisers really want to know  who saw the ad, how many people saw the ad,  who clicked on the ad.  They really want that.  Unfortunately, every medium in the world  is competing against the two giants,  Google and Facebook.  And if you can't offer the customer information  that Google and Facebook offer  and the click-through rate information that they offer,  you're a second tier.  So NPR said, well, we can do this.  But what it doesn't consider is,  A, everybody has to use a player that supports it.  B, and you talk about this, Matthew,  there are privacy concerns in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was what Marco Harmon mentioned.  He developed Overcast and also Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another huge, Marco's Overcast is like the number three podcast platform.  Yeah, massive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I noticed when he said,  he said, I have no intention of implementing this,  and I hope no one else does either.  And that interested me because I,  you know, I wondered why he was so vocal about it,  especially since NPR was pitching it as a good thing.  And he said that even though NPR says that it's,  you know, it maintains user privacy,  he said, someone is going to use this to target users  because they've got an IP address when they download the podcast.  You can do all kinds of data extraction based on IP address,  and then you can tag that to how far they listen in a podcast,  and you can effectively, you know, come up with a profile on people.  And he thought that was, would be an actively bad thing for the podcasting business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how is that any worse than just a webpage?  Everybody listening to this needs to understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that advertising-supported media is under constant pressure from advertisers  to deliver more information about you to the advertisers.  That's the game that's going on, period.  And every single content creator is fighting back,  partly to protect privacy, but also partly in our own interest.  I don't want people to start counting whether somebody listens to this show or not.  In my opinion, the only thing an advertiser should ever be interested in is,  did your ad work? Did you sell more widgets?  If you did, if you sold more widgets than the ad cost, then you're ahead.  Why isn't that good enough? But they all want more.  They all want to know, oh, well, what age group, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hasn't having iTunes and Spotify already implemented analytics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But only again, if you use iTunes to listen.  Most people, even most people who get their podcasts from iTunes don't use iTunes to listen.  Okay.  Spotify.  Oh, really?  Yeah. Oh, no. Well, they download it on their phone. They might listen on their phone.  Maybe Apple's podcast app does that, but most other apps don't.  Marcos doesn't. Pocket Cast doesn't.  The iTunes stats are exactly that. They're iTunes specific for people who listen on iTunes.  I guess you could project from that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NPR, when I spoke with them, someone who developed the standard and they're sort of VP of digital strategy,  they very much focused on how useful this information was to creators.  They said that NPR had effectively used a similar technology and it had changed the way they did their politics podcast  because they noticed that people were bailing in the early parts of the podcast when everyone introduces themselves.  And so they went back and rejegged the podcast so that they got to the material faster.  And they described this as a win for that type of analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they just be honest and say, we're NPR, we have sponsors, they still pretend they're non-commercial for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have more commercials than we do.  Yeah.  So it's a lie. It's advertising driven. There may be some value to programmers.  I'm not champing at the bit to get that kind of information.  And by the way, I know our audience doesn't want us to spy on them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were definitely a bunch of people who responded to Marco on Twitter saying thank you for upholding our right to not be tracked and not to go the way the web has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no one in the world who thinks ad tech was a good thing for the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in the long run, if it increases the value of media properties and supports journalism, that's a good thing.  But will it though?  We can debate long and hard about whether advertisers should get this, but you're only going to compete.  You're competing with data that does exist for TV, that does exist for...  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. That kind of data exists for TV in a very limited fashion using people meters, which measures a small tiny audience and then extrapolates to the larger audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And so along comes every platform that exists on the web and the web promised greater ad accountability.  I mean, I guess. I mean, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's two ways.  Advertisers want it, but I don't know if it makes their ads better or more effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's two ways you could look at it.  And this was a discussion I had with Marco.  You could argue that if you offer these analytics, maybe advertisers will be willing to pay you more.  But you could also argue that the finer you slice and dice the attention in your podcast, you might end up with the same kind of nickel and dime garbage ads that we got on the web.  And actually wind up with...  Actually, I think it's potentially the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Podcasts now and well, I mean, yes and no.  Right. The power of a podcast, of an ad on this network is that Leo reads it.  Leo believes in it.  It's hard to fast forward through it.  There's high recall.  Right.  It's native.  That's the value.  Right.  Right. It works.  And as long as you have that kind of advertising, then that has added extra value.  The issue is if you're serving commercials pre-made into an audio format, into a podcast, then you're competing with radio.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there we've tried and with very poor success, we've tried insertion ads in some of our...  TAI?  Yeah.  I'd like to think of it as man in the middle ads.  But in some of our long tail shows and shows that we can't sell and so forth.  And they're terrible, right?  We made a few hundred dollars.  And the real problem for us and the reason we stopped doing it is we couldn't guarantee that the inserted ads weren't competing with the good, strong good ads that we put in.  And we don't want to lose our real advertisers for a few hundred dollars in insertion ads.  So you're right though, for that kind of inventory, I guess it's fine.  I don't...  I'm an old fart.  I don't want to see podcasting become massively commercialized, but it has to, I suppose.  I'm saddened to see NPR, non-commercial public radio, be the one leading the charge on this.  But it doesn't surprise me at all.  I mean, WNYC is just as much a podcast commercial podcast entity as anything out there.  They're juggernaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did notice a bunch of people were sort of said that they thought they saw podcasts in a way as a kind of, you know, a haven of content where they weren't where their every sort of step and breath and click was not tracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, did these kind of debates go on with blogging?  No.  Like the bloggers say, don't...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember Henry Copeland had blog ads?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a paid content debate.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that goes on, right?  The fake sponsored ads.  The fake content that really is just an ad.  We get that email every single day.  I get four or five people saying they'd like to write for our website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw something fascinating just while we're talking about this.  There was a story about...  I'm trying to remember where...  I think it was in the Atlantic.  And it was about would-be influencers on Instagram.  So mostly young kids.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Atlantic had a story about people pretending they had ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they make a post that looks as much like an ad as possible.  So it looks like they have ads and therefore they're an influencer.  I just found that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what?  When we started Entertainment Weekly and we did the mock-up, which I have around here somewhere, right there.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll show you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because Jeff goes back to the early days of...  Yeah, before the war.  Before the war.  He started Entertainment Weekly.  So he's got the mock-up here of EW.  We've got the mock-up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You keep it handy just in case.  Well, I have it because I teach it in school.  So in the mock-up, we put ads.  Yeah, of course.  Right?  We're going to put ads and everything we put out there.  We put ads.  They were not really ads.  The first issues of things, you'd offer advertisers space for free because it would look bad not to have ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heavy sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just cause me goodbye, Kevin.  I don't know if there's a whole lot of privacy you're giving up.  So these tags in theory would not identify you.  I mean, they could.  It's conceivable that they could, but as designed, don't identify you.  As a podcaster, you would get the information that...  Aggregated data.  A hundred people tuned out here, 200 people tuned out here.  And whatever privacy you've given up is through your IP address.  Yeah, and it's not more than you would on the web.  And the real value of it is that the advertiser then, and this is the thing that really scares me.  The advertiser would say, oh yeah, so we're not going to pay for the people who didn't get to our ad.  We're only going to pay for the people who got to our ad.  That's what advertisers want.  It's podcast visibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the other thing that someone mentioned, which I thought was interesting, was if you tag the ads, that's going to make it a lot easier to skip them.  Because you could just have your software run to a tag and jump to the next tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's easy to fix. You just tag before the ad, two minutes before the ad.  I mean, that's not so hard.  Five minutes after the ad, it's not so hard.  It's interesting.  I think it's a non-starter, just like iTunes is kind of a non-starter, unless they can offer, just as Nielsen does, a sample.  Well, we know 5,000 people listen to this podcast and this percentage tuned out.  And I guess that would be valuable.  It's sad to me.  I can't wait to get out of the podcast business because essentially it's being eaten alive by this kind of crap.  But it did feel like...  What you're going to get is a bunch of big media companies making podcasts.  They're just going to turn it right into broadcast television and radio.  Which is sad.  That's sad because that's not what I want to do.  That's the reason I'm in podcasting as a refugee from commercial television and radio.  Now I'm getting depressed.  Well, it always happens, right?  This is what's happening.  We see it here all the time.  We don't get the ad buys we used to because they want to buy...  I was listening to Conan O'Brien's podcast, which is fine.  He likes every other comic.  All comedian podcasts are essentially the same.  And he does the ads and he riffs his way through the ads.  They're funny.  Ha ha ha.  There's no direct response.  I'm sure Conan has said, well, no, we're not going to do a direct response.  You're buying Conan.  That's good enough for you.  Direct response is what we do, you know, slash twit or use the offer code twig.  And that's a very primitive way advertisers can see what kind of response they're getting to an ad.  Conan is saying, no, you don't need that.  You're buying Conan.  That's all you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's going the other way.  He's going further away from measurement.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's just the death of anything that's not Conan on podcasting.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and you had Ford.  There was no direct response involved.  It was a branding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I like branding ads.  I wish we could get them.  Wish we get more of those.  Those are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do some, but and I would argue in your case, because you get early in on me, you helped  brand a lot of these direct response companies too.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And most honestly, most podcasts advertising directly copies our model.  I mean, we kind of pioneered the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  But that's fine.  I mean, it's just I think I don't know.  I'm getting to be an old man.  I actually have a new theory, which I'm going to spring on you guys.  I don't know if I go for it.  Tell everyone.  Do it.  I've been reading and I highly recommend it.  You've all know a Harare's new book.  If you read Homo say was it said Homo's Homo Deus and his previous book Sapiens, he's a Israeli  professor philosophy, a deep thinker.  He's loved in Silicon Valley, which is interesting because he's not a huge fan of Silicon Valley.  His newest is 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.  And admittedly, I haven't got to the end of it yet, but he makes a very strong case at  the beginning for just humans are terrible at deciding things like driving cars.  Right.  We know that a million and a quarter people die every year in car accidents.  If you had autonomous, you know, if you if you if you said it's illegal for humans to  drive, let the computers drive.  That number would shrink to maybe a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, which shrink  by an order of magnitude, at least probably a hundred times less.  If if as AIs get better at diagnosing illness, they're not there yet.  Admittedly, why would you let a human with all our human foibles and failings diagnose  your illness if an AI could do it?  And then he goes on to say, and honestly, really music should be tailored to your emotional  reactions as soon as we can get a headband that gives you fMRI capable readings might  as well have the music tailored to what you're in the mood for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will suit.  I just I just happen to see at this moment a Facebook ad for mindset, head that headset  that reads your brain activity.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I look at this.  We're way this is years and years and years off.  But I can't wait to see where this goes.  If if humans can't be trusted to set election districts, let the machines do it to avoid  gerrymandering.  What the humans do is they set goals, as in with with health.  You know, what's the max?  What's the better?  What's the best health outcome?  Maybe I don't know, maybe because it's the best health outcome per dollar.  You could probably throw that in with driving.  What's the fewest number of fatalities?  Humans can set the goals for gerrymandering or not gerrymandering.  You know, what's the most representative way to set up our congressional districts?  Ultimately, follow me down this road.  As AIs get better, humans should probably set the goals, but they can't be trusted to  really implement just like self-driving cars.  We can set a goal.  We want fewest traffic fatalities and let the self-driving cars do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is how all of this auditing of platforms and stuff should be looked at.  Don't see the algorithm.  See the outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, yes, exactly.  So we got to be careful.  And look, we're at early days so you can you can pull up many ways it doesn't work yet,  including in self-driving vehicles.  But if you could get AI to really work, first of all, how would you implement such a thing?  How would you?  Because I'm saying let go and let Google.  Let the AI do it.  Now, OK, but it was a Google you trust or who do you do?  What humans set the goals?  Who do you trust?  What's the mechanism for setting the goals?  But let's assume we could solve that and maybe we can't.  But it's got to be better than we got.  Why isn't our next government going to be based on technology and AI?  Humans shouldn't be allowed to vote.  The more panic, the more stop it.  Yeah, I agree on that.  But we don't vote with our brains.  We vote with our hearts.  Everybody knows that.  But sometimes that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When?  Well, sometimes I can't think of an example.  I can think of bad examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can think of a lot of bad examples.  I mean, really, honestly, Brexit is a bad example.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For me, the problem is that artificial intelligence and algorithms are are just expressions of humanity.  I mean, the way you design an algorithm.  That's exactly right.  Because a bunch of people encode their biases into software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's what I submit.  When we talk about AI, we often think about the wrong hazard.  We think about machines that are going to take over the Terminator scenario.  That's not actually what's going to happen.  These AIs aren't going to be human.  They're just going to be very fast, smart, calculating machines.  They're going to be like AlphaZero that taught itself to be the best chess player, go player, and shogi player in the world, beating everybody, humans and machines.  And it taught itself without any examples, only knowing the rules.  So it was told, here's what you need to solve.  And it did it in four hours.  Yep.  Now, I know we're at the early days, but assume that that progress continues in 10, 50, 100 years.  We can say, look, this is what humans should do.  We should set our goals.  We should say what it means to win a chess game or what it means to drive safely.  But then we should leave implementation to AIs.  And then I think you're exactly right, Matthew.  The questions we should now be asking are not, how do we keep the machines from killing us?  Oh, my God, it's the Terminator.  What we should be asking is, how do you do that?  How do you determine what the goals are?  Right.  How do you implement that?  How do you train a machine without infecting it with our own biases?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would argue that very quickly, I would argue that very quickly, once you get beyond things like, say, driving or playing chess,  once you get into sort of messy human problems like who should get health care, who should get...  Once you get into problems like that, coming up with the goals and how you implement them is actually way harder than sort of incorporating those goals into software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, yeah.  But I mean, I think we could come up with an algorithm for who should get health care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where does this go for their podcast business, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The podcasts are long gone.  I thought this was all going to give you a new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to bring this back to podcasting.  No, no, I'm done with podcasting.  The algorithms will do the podcasting.  But I'm on the road.  Algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I won't look at it.  First of all, we're going to have a big problem because 90% of us won't have jobs anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you'll still be alive.  You'll be like a head in a jar or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, I think podcasts could be...  I mean, if AIs get to that stage, podcasts could be created by AIs as much as a hit song could be created by an AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're writing news stories.  You know, there's robots right around the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may still be me hosting because God knows we have hundreds of thousands of hours of me that could easily be used to create an AI if people wanted that.  That'd be a no-brainer.  They'd probably want something more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or they would use your sort of avatar and they would use deepfake video faking technology and stuff like that.  Exactly.  But it would look like you.  No, and an AI would generate the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could probably do that today.  We're actually fairly close to that, right?  Deepfakes is a good example.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you see the...  I think it was Nvidia actually came out with a whole bunch of photos of faces and I think cars.  And there was another category and they were all generated by AI.  So none of them are real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Faces most freak people.  But they weren't.  Yeah, right here.  But the thing is they were...  They're cops.  So they were...  I think they're actually they were still combinations of features.  They were inspired by faces.  Right.  There was a starting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still, none of those faces actually exist in the world.  And yet they're totally 100% believable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the point being that we aren't at that turning point, that inflection point yet, but it's coming.  And it's coming fast.  And you look at this and that's become a long way in a very short period of time.  Those are not real people, but you'd never know those are not real people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My fear is if you have, say, the health care algorithm that determines who gets health care,  then people will kind of absolve themselves of any need to think about it because they'll say,  well, the algorithm decides who lives and who dies.  The algorithm decides who gets sick and who gets medicine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's being discussed with cars, right?  As it should be.  Humans are terrible drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, if given a choice of killing the five-year-old or the eight-year-old,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's because it knows enough to be able to make that choice.  I think the trolley problem is a little bit of a MacGuffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think a million and a quarter people die every year in auto accidents.  All you have to do is tell the AI, drive as best you possibly can to maximize human life  and minimize damage destruction.  But human life of the person in the car?  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever, of all kinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maximize the life of the person in the car?  In the car and out of the car and property destruction.  You can easily think of a set of rules that you would follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The three laws of robotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not those. Those are made up.  But seriously, you could come up with a couple of real rules.  And yes, people would still die.  And there would still be pedestrians run over and there would be accidents.  People will still die, for sure.  But not one and a quarter million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But you know what's going to happen.  We already had that first case in Phoenix where the woman died,  but she was apparently homeless and perhaps a bit drained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the car doesn't need to know that.  That's not in the algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm saying is people didn't have a complete psycho-fit about that.  But what's going to happen is one of these cars is going to kill somebody.  And we're going to have a full moral panic.  And the argument that, well, but it killed one tenth,  the number that the physical drivers killed won't go anywhere.  People will be in a dither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Elon keeps mentioning that whenever someone brings up that it's not safe.  He keeps pointing out that the things that we drive every day are also not even close to being safe.  And yet, you know, they're a hundred times more unsafe.  And yet we're perfectly happy to keep driving them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you that the Mark Zuckerberg and the Zergs and the Larry Pages of the world  in the back of their minds are having this exact thought that really every,  why are we letting humans run anything?  Let's come up with some basic goals, some tenets, some values, and let the AI do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's why it's so important that it's not just people like Mark Zuckerberg  who can make these decisions or incorporate their biases into the algorithms.  I agree.  That's where we should be thinking. Exactly right.  There's got to be a lot more diversity, not just of skin color,  but economic background and world experience.  And I mean, you've got to have, you can't just have this tiny, tiny subsection of rich kids.  We're worried about killer robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should instead be worried about how do you design the tenets, the values,  what are our values, and how do you build that into a machine?  And I don't think, I mean, I'll look at AlphaZero didn't do machine learning, really.  It was told what the goals of the game were and left on its own devices  to play millions and millions of games against itself to figure out what the best strategies were.  That's probably the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I put in the rundown that Google has put out its, previously put out its policies for AI.  Now it's put out its procedure for how it's going to review those policies.  So it's like a hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. I think they've already gone down this road, and they're thinking about this.  There's one of the reasons I think Harari is so lionized in Silicon Valley, invited to dinners.  And there was a big article in New York Times about him a couple of weeks ago.  They were puzzled, like, this guy is telling us that the big tech companies are a problem  and that there's going to be a useless class of people, a large group of people who can't work,  who have no value to the machines.  And why is Silicon Valley lionizing him?  Because he's taking them down that path, and they're already thinking about these kinds of things.  And they're thinking about, I think, the right problem, which is how do you choose what you're going to optimize for it?  And then let the machines do the optimization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When do we make bad choices and the machine can make a better choice for us?  In every respect, almost.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Harari uses an example, choosing what your career is going to be.  This is something you deal with every day, Jeff.  People use all sorts of incorrect theories about life.  We're terrible at choosing our career.  And about themselves.  And about themselves.  I'm going to be a lawyer because I really love thinking about deep philosophical stuff.  And then they find out it has nothing to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's where a lot of the magic of life comes from, too.  Serendipity. Yeah, that's the serendipity argument, right?  And you also get people who, you know, you get incredibly tortured people who did all the wrong things, who become incredible artists, because they find something in that.  Not every single person who does that, obviously.  But that if you say that the oyster needs a kernel of sand to make a pearl.  Yeah. And if some computer said, here's what you should do instead, we would have lost that person and all the things that they created out of frustration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're making an argument for suffering. You understand that, Matthew?  Yeah. Yeah.  Okay.  Definitely.  Okay.  I don't know. I think that I have this idea.  It's just a kernel of an idea.  But I think pursue this.  This may be my new and final, because once...  Manifesto.  Manifesto. My last, Leo's last testament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From your cabin in the woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to make a bumper sticker. Let go and let the AI do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right, though, that the sort of coming up with how we decide on the goals and how we incorporate those is way more important than, you know, worrying about, you know, whether software is going to kill us or whether Terminator is going to...  Right.  It's actually more scary because it's so...  It's going to be so hard to do.  You know, it's going to make self-driving cars look like a day at the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We already have evidence that there are a lot of human endeavors computers do a better job with.  Maybe not all.  Our show today brought to you by Brex, the best credit card for business.  We started using our Brex cards. They're very nice, by the way.  You can see them in the lower third. They're nice kind of black and gray cards.  Very stylish. But that's not the reason you get a Brex card.  You get a Brex card because it's perfect for startups, small businesses, a business like yours.  A five-minute online application. Very easy.  Underwriting is based on cash raised by your business, the cash in your bank account.  And for that reason, Brex can offer your company 10 to 20 times higher limits than other corporate credit cards.  And here's a great one. No personal liability required.  Brex offers high value rewards too that are tailored around modern businesses.  Double the points on software.  Triple the points on restaurants and travel.  Seven times.  Tup-tuple the points on ride share.  And I love this. There's no limit on how many points you can earn with your card.  And points can be redeemed for statement credit on transactions.  So this is going to save you money.  They'll save you money with great deals too with services and brands like AWS, Google, Salesforce, WeWork.  Brex underwrites your company, not you.  And as a sole proprietor, I appreciate that.  No minimum operating history. Great for startups.  No painful paper application. No personal liability required.  And it's a Visa card.  Brex doesn't require a credit score, a social security number, a security deposit.  Employees get instant access to online virtual credit cards.  Physical credit cards come quickly in the mail. I mean, really quickly.  Every employee can have a corporate card because you control it.  You have real time limits that you can adjust at any time.  The expense management is built in. That's the other thing.  Again, why this is built for business. It's not a consumer credit card.  It's a credit card for business.  When I first used my Brex card, it was the greatest experience.  I used it for a meal.  It said, oh, send me. I got text right away.  Like the second I use the card.  Okay, take a picture of the receipt when you get it back.  It was before the server actually came back with it.  Take a picture of the receipt. I took a picture.  It categorized it and said, is this receipt goes to this, right?  I said, yeah.  They said, good. We got it all. And it's already in your QuickBooks.  What?  You get complete statement descriptions clearly telling you what you've spent money on.  Throw out the receipt because you've got it already in your accounting.  Not just QuickBooks, all the major accounting software.  Join the thousands of startups and tech companies who use Brex right now  to manage their growing business needs and earn valuable rewards while doing so.  B-R-E-X, Brex, B-R-E-X.  You get the card free and because you're listening,  you get the card with no fees in perpetuity forever.  But you have to go to brex.com slash twit.  You have to get this special deal.  Brex, B-R-E-X dot com slash twit.  Cards free and there are no fees forever.  But you have to go to brex.com slash twit.  We really love Brex.  Matthew Ingram is here from the Columbia Journalism Review.  He's chief digital writer there, CJR.org.  Jeff Jarvis from the, you know, the whole townite thing.  City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From the Newmark J-School.  That's all you need to say.  The Newmark J-School.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that all you need to say?  A lot easier.  Are you excited that Google is basically taking over Manhattan?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, for one, welcome my new neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Major, according to the Wall Street Journal, new expansion.  A billion dollars in capital improvements to establish a new campus.  Google Hudson Square.  Where's Hudson Square?  Is that, is that, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just uptown a bit from where they are now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is in addition to the, the fish yards that they bought or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they own the old Port Authority building and then the Nabisco biscuit works that were next door.  They own all of that.  And the Port Authority building is, I mean, it's a New York City block solid.  It's just huge.  It's huge.  And so they have all of that.  They built, they bought the building next door and they're buying up three buildings north of there.  I mean, to call it a campus in New York is kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too spread out to be a campus.  Chelsea Market.  That's the one I was thinking.  Chelsea Market. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That used to be the Nabisco factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're kind of spread out.  They're not in all one spot.  They have 7,000 employees.  Same as Mountain View.  I mean, Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, we're building 473.  Oh, that's five miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?  Is it easier to attract young, smart people to work in New York City?  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's the center of the FN universe.  Oh yeah.  I'm asking the wrong guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask the Canadian.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they could probably get some people to go there who might not want to move to  Mountain View for whatever reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was that New Yorker cartoon?  It was a cover where they had a picture of a map of the US, but it was as conceived by  a New Yorker.  I wish I could find it.  Basically, it was the New York and the rest.  Yeah, you can find it.  Yeah.  Anyway, this is not this, isn't it?  Anyway, very search New Yorker.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is.  View of the world from 9th Avenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, view of the world.  Here it is.  View of the world from 9th Avenue.  There's 9th Avenue, Hudson River, Jersey is a little strip, and then the rest of the  country in the Pacific Ocean.  That's basically your worldview, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got a problem with that, buddy?  Yeah.  That's it.  It's not even New York.  It's 9th and 10th Avenue, basically, and the Chelsea Fish Market.  This is brilliant.  And the Bisco building.  Well, that's where Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's Avenue.  It is the view from Google.  It actually worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The view from Google.  I'll have to do a new one.  Interesting.  Somebody pointed this out yesterday.  They didn't do what Amazon did, which was basically get information about how every  major city in the country is run and which tax breaks were best before they didn't have  a beauty talent search before they picked their...  They said, we're just going to do Manhattan.  Apple's doing Austin.  Apple's building a new Austin campus.  Big, right?  Big one.  Yeah.  Why do companies make a big deal about this?  Is this to prove that they're not Silicon Valley?  They're not...  I think so, partly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ... Insular?  Yeah.  I think so.  But if you were going to do that, you wouldn't be in New York.  You'd be in Atlanta or Nashville or some place where you could get a sense of the country  better, or some place that needs it, like Mississippi.  What it amounts to is there's a huge amount of talent in New York.  It is the childhood dream of conquering Gotham, and they're going to be competing against  Amazon for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.  Yeah, that's why it's kind of surprising, though, that they would move...  That's where Amazon's building at least half of its second headquarters is across the bridge  in Long Island.  Though Long Island...  Only in New York would we complain about that.  Queens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Queens.  They're so mean about this.  Are they?  See, I told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said it's...  Oh, no, that's all New York.  I said, well, technically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good enough for us.  Because there's going to be some gentrification.  There's some affordable housing that was supposed to be built that's not going to be built.  There's a strain on the number seven subway and a strain on public services.  So one of my students in social journalism is doing that as a community, is the people  in that neighborhood and that issue.  We were out for the last class.  We went out.  My colleague Kerry Brown took all the students out for drinks and we're sitting there.  And suddenly one of our colleagues looked up and realized the person covering this story  on Amazon is named Alexa.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So we all had a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She has a deep hatred of everything Amazon because of that.  That seems fitting.  There's a whole generation of women named Alexa growing up today who hate with a passion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hate Amazon.  People ordering them around, asking them questions just like we used to anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has a little bit of a diversity problem.  It turns out a vast number of Google employees, almost half, are part-time.  Only 50% are full-time employees.  49.95% are TVCs.  Yeah, TVCs.  What's a TVC?  Temporary?  Vendor or contractor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Gary's vendor team just completed a big milestone.  This is from the Google training document.  He wants to reward them with shirts in the Google store.  Should he?  Gary should not reward them with shirts.  Why?  Swag bonuses and other gifts are considered taxable income to the individual, which Alphabet  cannot report since we are not the TVC employer.  It can also raise ethics and compliance concerns.  Finally...  Wait, they don't report t-shirts to the IRS.  Finally, we need to respect and adhere to local laws and regulations and TVC employers  may have strict policies about receiving gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is fair.  You know, I was going to make fun of this until then.  If you don't get swag at least on Google, what the heck is the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, wait, Gary said.  How can we show appreciation for TVCs?  Write a thank you note.  Write a thank you note.  Send them a note on Google+.  A sincere thank you from all of us at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perform an interpretive dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Festivus poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a grievance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You cannot give half of your employees...  But this is actually, this was not the first time we've heard this, that they are stingy  with most of these employees because they're not employees, they're contractors.  You don't get the free candy or anything either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not for you.  Probably can't ride the bikes even.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yes, they can ride the bikes.  I was surprised it was 50%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's such a...  Red badges versus white badges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't forget, this is not just people in Mountain View at HQ.  No, this is generally the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how it is in the world.  We have full-time employees.  You guys are not, you're contractors.  But you only do one show a day, or rather a week with us.  But we have full-time employees.  But we keep saying, we really should stop paying these people benefits.  We really need some contractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm afraid Carson's going to start a strike while we're on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Contractors are the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what happens, I tell you.  Well done.  Well done.  Red badges versus white badges, the Guardian again.  Matt was on his way to a quote, whole team meeting for a project he was working on when  he noticed that one of his coworkers, a test engineer, was still at his desk.  You should come, Matt.  A Google software engineer recalls saying, only to be told the meeting was not actually  for the whole team.  Temps, vendors and contractors were not allowed.  The guy sits with us, like literally next to my desk.  He's got better knowledge than me about the parts of the project, to be honest.  It changes the dynamic a lot.  But a part of this comes from IRS regulations.  If you are going to use contractors, because there was an abuse of this for a long time,  you're a contractor, John.  He'd be doing exactly the same work as a full-time employee, except I don't have to give him  benefits.  The IRS said, no, they're not contractors and you have to pay taxes and benefits.  That's why Google and other companies now make this very clear line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also seems like, the way they describe it, it also seems like it's partly a security  thing.  They're not allowed to go to all-hands meetings.  They're not allowed to go to the Friday meetings where you can ask questions of executives.  I feel like part of that is they don't want leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, half of their staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot.  I would have thought maybe like a third or less, but half is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I want to hire somebody to just write an article for my center, we basically have  to hire them.  Really?  Yeah.  I end up paying money for benefits they never see because they only work a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For a long time in Silicon Valley, what they would do, Microsoft used to do this because  I know because I have friends who work for them.  They would have a company that's not Microsoft, hire them, pay them.  I'm sure that's what Google's doing.  It gives them an arm's length relationship with these people, even though they're coming  in, they're working, they're doing the same job.  They're not working for ...  Like Blackwater and the Army.  Yes, like Blackwater.  They're working for somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember when the security people did get hired as Google employees because there was  kind of a movement about two, three years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say at some point when you're hideously profitable, you probably ... This is the other  odd argument when you look at companies like Amazon where they're really making a lot of  money.  Is it still sensible for them to be so hard on their staff and employees, particularly  warehouse employees?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It certainly makes sense with Amazon.  It looks bad on that company.  It looks bad on Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart is famous for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're making more money than any company has ever made probably in history, but you  won't let your drivers take a bathroom break and you won't let them sit down for five minutes.  It just seems inhuman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart does the same thing.  Obviously all those jobs are going to go away anyway.  Half of Walmart's workforce part-time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my favorite features, I don't know if you read it, was about the retired people  who live in motor homes and work in Amazon warehouses, particularly around holidays like  Christmas.  They're basically-  It's the new migrant labor.  Lots of them lost their homes or whatever in the recession or invested badly.  They're 70 years old.  They're living in a van and Amazon lets them camp in the parking lot and then they work  in the warehouse.  It was just a fascinating and horrifying story.  There's dispensers on the wall of pain pills and stuff like that so that you can keep working  longer.  It's the weights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I just happened to search for, I was looking for the hiring of the security guards, but  I happened upon a LinkedIn page, Google employee reviews for security officer.  They're in love.  It's five stars, five stars.  Love being at this place, helping people that needed my help.  Felt good to see people leave with smiles on their faces.  This made my job fun.  I had fun.  It's a blessing to wake up and enjoy working for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to lose Mo.  He's going to go to work for Google.  Mo, put fingers in your ears.  Mo can't work for us because he carries a weapon.  The insurance for us, if we had him as a full-time employee, would be a big issue.  Our insurers won't let us employ somebody who carries a gun as part of his job.  He has to work for a security agency which we then pay.  California has new rules, by the way, about contract employees because this was a big  issue.  ScooterX tells me that these lawsuits against Microsoft in California, temps can work for  a finite time.  You can't just continue to work full-time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should point out that media companies have been very bad at that.  I worked on contracts that were extended and extended until the union basically complained  and said, look, you have to either create a job or get rid of this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how everyone who got transferred from Tech TV to G4 worked.  We all worked as contractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so sad.  This is Karsten who was at Tech TV when it got bought by Comcast and then moved to LA  and they adopted the standard Hollywood practice of saying, well, you're not employees.  You're contractors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's not forget Uber does that too, right?  I completely understand.  As an employer, I understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you just, it seems sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not going to be going to work in China.  In pursuit of profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Let's talk about Facebook.  Boy, there's a lot about Facebook.  Why not?  Jeff, do you want to just take the next segment off?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, okay, full disclosure is that I raised money for my school from Facebook.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I received no money personally from Facebook or any of the platforms.  But boy, are they messing up.  I don't know how to write about this, frankly, because where do you start?  But the other problem is though, so today the New York Times said that Facebook had  shared data, including private messages with big company partners and everyone had a proper  fit about it.  But then I read Facebook.  Say that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Including private messages.  Including private messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then I read Facebook's response.  And I don't know what to make of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's definitely truth on both sides.  I mean, the private messages thing.  Facebook's argument is it was specifically designed so you could share a song on Spotify  through your private messages.  So in order to allow Spotify to do that, it had to give Spotify access to your messages.  Right.  That doesn't mean Spotify could read and write messages on Messenger.  Like some of this is, I think, intentional misunderstanding.  As is often the case, mainstream media kind of willfully sensationalizes stories about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should also, I don't know if you guys noticed, but somebody pointed out that way, way down  in the story, it mentions that the New York Times was actually a partner with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That they were the ones that got this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And they did it because they had a sort of social story sharing feature that they wanted  to implement that they eventually killed.  And if there's one thing I think you could argue is bad, a bunch of this stuff was killed  and then Facebook just left the APIs open.  Like just left them sitting there.  So the features died, but arguably the access was still available.  That's definitely a flaw.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But some of the stuff we've read about already, right?  Some of it is.  Yeah.  And so in the early days.  There's a big deal of it.  Right.  Facebook had to allow phone makers to incorporate Facebook into the phone.  And in order to do that, they had to give the phone makers access to APIs.  That makes sense.  So that one doesn't seem like that big a deal, but the more modern ones were, it was giving  them access and then not really telling people.  I think that's to some extent, there's a disclosure problem there.  It wasn't clear.  Yeah.  And their argument is, oh, Spotify should have told you that or Amazon should have told  you that or the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put the response up in the chat.  Yeah.  And they're saying that there was always permission.  They said none of it violates the FTC.  And they said this was done mainly between 2010 and 2014.  So there were things as in the early days of Facebook all around, there were things  that would never fly today.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is, by the way, important because one of the accusations is they had a consent  decree with the FTC and then in doing this, they might have violated that.  And Facebook says to be clear, these did not violate our 2012 sentiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they don't get to decide that, right?  Yeah.  FTC will be the judge of that.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, okay, so which is it?  It's really ironic that the New York Times was one of these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see prior discussion about data.  Yeah.  Right.  Advertisers want it.  Media companies want it.  Facebook and Google are the only ones that are good at doing it.  And we and media clamored for the opportunity to get data.  And to this day, every media I go to, what do media people beg Google and Facebook for?  User data.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could argue that, in fact, it's like looking back in time, reading that story.  And you look at all the services and all the things that Facebook offered and how adding  social elements to everything was great and everybody wanted to do it.  And no one thought about the exchange of data.  And it's just, oh yeah, we can connect our calendars and our song choices and everything  to Facebook.  It's super great.  And now it's all horrifying.  All the things that we sort of took advantage of.  Right, because things have changed, right, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, honestly, as Facebook points out, we all signed up for this instant personalization  stuff.  We wanted our Facebook account to link to Rotten Tomatoes or Yelp or Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think Facebook could still have that if they had been smart about how they had  informed us.  Disclosed.  Remember we went through the circles of privacy where they keep on changing the privacy setting?  That was what this was, this process was.  So now today, you have tons of people who are, including famous people, who are saying,  oh, I'm quitting Facebook.  So my tweet of the day that got me in a little trouble in some places, I said, I want to  quit the platform people are using to brag to the world that they are quitting platforms.  Because I'm just getting sick of it.  And there's tons of them.  But I got into a discussion with Julia Ioffe, who's a journalist I respect greatly, who  covers Russia.  And she asked on Twitter, she said, I'm tempted to quit.  But this is where Russia is being discussed by people.  My advice was journalists need to listen.  You need to be there.  And everything that I put up on Facebook, I presume to be public.  There's no privacy in anything I do on Facebook.  I go back and forth about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason I'm not on Facebook is not because I worry about the privacy implications.  It's more a moral stand.  I don't want to support the company because I feel like the company's practices are questionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Walt Mossberg said the same thing when he announced that he was quitting.  He said it doesn't fit with his sort of moral principles and code he tries to live by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And admittedly, it impedes my ability to do my job.  I couldn't get the Facebook portal until I reactivated my Facebook account, bought the  portal and then deactivated it.  And the portal doesn't fully work without a Facebook account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And I argued to Julia on the Twitter discussion and to others that we in journalism need more  ways to listen to people, not fewer.  I agree.  And so it cuts you off not from the company, but from the people who were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do wonder, and I've been thinking about this a bit, the more people quit.  So Tim Wu said that he was quitting.  You know, Walt Mossberg said he was quitting.  And I get your point.  And I know Mandy Jenkins made the same point in an essay that we have to be in these places.  But I still feel like journalists, particularly not just you and I being on it, but journalistic  organizations, media organizations, being partners with Facebook, integrating themselves  with Facebook.  I think there is a conflict there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the public, we know because you're looking at it as corporate to corporate.  You're not seeing the forest for the trees.  It is to some extent, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is to some extent.  You're supporting this entity.  And they're supporting our entities.  Yeah.  So it's codependent.  No question.  I'm just wondering whether...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it also is about where the people are and we serve the public.  And that's what matters to me for journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But if the people, and I'm not saying Facebook is this, but if Facebook was a deeply unethical  organization, should we still use it just because a bunch of people are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was talking about it.  We had Paris Martino on the Twitter last week.  And she has to use Gab because her beat on Wired requires that she cover the kinds of  things that are going on on 4chan and Gab.  And so she has to stay there.  That doesn't mean an endorsement of it.  And then I think that's absolutely an exception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why I was making an exception or a distinction between me as a person and as  a journalist being there and my company integrating with Facebook.  My company's on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a Twitter page on Facebook.  We also are on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not. But I've got a company I work with that is doing Facebook watch.  They're reaching a tremendously large audience for it.  They're getting paid for it.  At our graduation on Friday, Jorge Ramos from Univision was on and he was talking about  how there are watch and he's getting an audience sometimes on watch that's equivalent to  what he gets on TV.  And he's serving a public that's there.  And so it's it's it's and that only can happen because not being I mean, Jorge was very  early in this, you know, two presidential elections ago, he was on online with video  and on Facebook and it was pretty amazing.  So he's made a huge following there.  So partly it is him.  But but without the company, it wouldn't be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's also but it's also where the audience he's trying to reach are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Bingo, bingo.  And it depends on who you are.  I mean, Mike, admittedly Mike, come at lots of other problems.  But yeah, they spend a bunch of money and built up a big team to create a Facebook watch  program and Facebook said and Facebook said we don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and then I see company is out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Person I respect greatly in this field and disagree with all the time.  But Siva Varinathian is, I think, the most intellectual critic of Facebook out there.  He has a new book out a few months old about this.  But he argued in The New York Times and argues straight and honestly,  that don't quit Facebook, fix it.  It's almost like a political structure that if you walk away,  that's a position of privilege.  Because you kind of can.  But if you're in, how can I fix you can't fix it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg controls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is we interviewed Siva about his book, Anti Social Media,  how Facebook disconnects us and undermines democracy.  Now, at that time, when we interviewed him, which was in June,  I think he was saying get off Facebook, so he might have changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he he wrote a piece in March that he linked to today.  OK, saying don't get off.  OK, I misunderstood him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you and I can complain about highly critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we blew to we're blue in the face.  They're not going to change because we say we don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew, we went through a whole list of features that aren't being done  anymore because of public pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just can't do it.  It's not even this whole discussion doesn't hit me because I just  I can't bring myself to be there.  I just I feel it's unsafe.  What is it?  What is it about it that bothers you? It's unsavory.  It's a crime.  I feel like it's almost participating in a criminal organization.  I'm not going to try to fix it with from within.  I don't think I can. I think you're right. It's Mark's place.  I just don't want to participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm I would miss the people there, including Matthew Ingram.  I don't miss anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, every time I every time I deactivate,  they put pictures of you and Matthew and others saying,  oh, Jeff is going to be really sad.  What are you going to say to him?  I do miss you. I do miss you, Leo.  I do. I do.  I didn't realize this, but apparently it's sending to each  and every one of my friends.  Leo's no longer your friend every time I deactivate.  And that's a nasty thing to do.  I was I wasn't going to say anything.  I'm not it's not personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do feel as though, you know, in the early days,  Facebook was this wonderful thing and Mark was this bright shining,  you know, creative individual who came up with this great idea.  And, you know, we've really seen  it move to the complete opposite end of the spectrum where people,  even people who aren't in media, aren't in technology,  have said to me the same thing you said, Leo, that they feel.  And maybe it's because of the reporting, I don't know,  but they feel icky using it.  They feel they're being used and tracked.  And they're right.  I feel like they're complicit in some sense in in this creepy enterprise.  That's I'm going to repeat again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is this is a privileged view for those of us.  You know, when newsrooms look like the three of us.  And if you're a woman in America, if you're African-American in America,  if you're Latino in America or media, don't cover you.  You have no voice. You have no way to speak.  These platforms, both Facebook and Twitter, as well as Instagram and others,  give you a mechanism to speak that enabled living well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I were a woman, I would not be on Twitter.  Matthew wrote the story every 30 seconds.  True. A female journalist or politician every 30 seconds is harassed on Twitter.  I'm harassed on Twitter in the minute.  I mean, there's no point in me being on Twitter. It's just a.  That's a depressing, depressing survey.  And I mean, not just women either, by the way, or politicians.  There's harassed general harassment all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And women of color, I think, were 85 percent  more likely to be harassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you want a voice, start a podcast, write a blog, do something.  But I think Twitter and Facebook are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is an alternate universe.  And I know this is crazy to even talk about,  but there is an alternate universe, I think, where blogs became a social network,  where all the interlinking that we started doing in really crude ways.  So lovely.  Was where that sort of became Twitter and Facebook.  Like both of those things could have been incorporated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark still still lives in that. I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could have been an open system, could have been federated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A Weiner, a Weiner begs us to live in that world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We would have been a sort of open API.  And yet here we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've been I've been I've been rereading  the raise of the guy who brought the Gutenberg  parenthesis to my mind, Tom Pettit, an academic in Denmark.  And he argues, as you know, don't worry, I'm not going to do it all.  That we're reverting back to a pre-Gutenberg era  and that that was an oral based world rather than a textual based world.  And what he argues in that is that was a performance based world.  And what we see happening to a great extent is people are not.  We in media think they're creating content.  They're not. They're performing.  Yeah. And they're performing in ways that shock us,  because that's part of the point.  And they're performing in ways that test borders.  They're performing in ways that that don't have norms yet.  We're returning to an  society built on a reality over textually text.  And I think it's a kind of a brilliant insight into.  So we're misinterpreting what people are doing.  They're not creating.  When we look at what they're doing is of creating content, we say, well,  this is crap. How could we allow this?  But if we say it's people who are performing and acting out something,  that's what our politics are entirely right now.  And we've got to judge it against that to figure out what they have to do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a great point. And I know I've talked to Hossein Dirakshan,  who's a Iranian blogger, spent six years in prison for blogging.  He when he got out, he noticed that the web had changed  and he described very much the same thing.  His sort of shorthand is that it's becoming like television.  Everything is becoming like television.  So Twitter's becoming like television.  Facebook's becoming like television.  Television is taking over and not just in the sense of video,  but in the sense of a kind of shallowness in a way of.  And so his view, obviously, as a person who likes text, is that  and you in particular really likes his legs and legs is that much of this content is  just shallow and kind of doesn't it doesn't encourage you to think.  It encourages you to feel and to feel strong emotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that that's a condescending way to look at it, too, I would argue,  is the problem with television was the television was one tube sent out to all of us.  And now when you go to my favorite conference, VidCon,  which you see is that everyone can make television  and they're not making it in the ways that we would think.  And people are going to look down their noses out of the production values of this.  They're awful. What is that junk?  And you have awful people like PewDiePie coming in or saying awful things.  Maybe it's not an awful person, but he says awful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter. There's no distinction.  And if you say awful things, you're an awful person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care. And so I could send the tweets to Leo, please.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you sent the tweets to all the tweets to me because I'm not on Twitter.  So you can't. That's why I'm saying that.  But I mean, clearly he's an awful person.  I don't. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't understand why YouTube.  Well, I do understand. It's money, right?  But it's a lot of ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The money works two ways. It's not just the money of, oh, there's ads on this.  It's also the money of the cost of having to manage all of that.  And so we're still we're still in this transition.  Managed getting rid of him or managed keeping him.  Managed to get rid of him, managed to figure out who to get rid of.  The million little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I know. I mean, I'm surprised they got rid of Alex Jones.  I mean, honestly, I don't.  They probably wish they could just let everything be  and not have to be editorializing at any point,  because it's very difficult. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do think it also came out of a certain opt for a blog ish optimism. Yes.  Right. Yeah.  And they didn't recognize how they're being manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sort of Gutenberg, you know, parenthesis idea.  I started thinking about specifically with relationship to Twitter.  Twitter is much more a verbal sort of oral  kind of performance, if you will, than it is text.  It feels like because you're talking to you, too.  But it's not actually like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what some have said is the problem with Twitter is it.  You feel like you're doing these off the cuff, you know, water cooler remarks,  but they're preserved forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. It's it's in the worst possible kind of gray area  between text and performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weren't for that, we wouldn't know that Jack Dorsey sent beard  shavings to Azalea Banks to make an amulet to protect him from Isis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a someone has got a like fact check that story.  No, there's a tweet. It feels too good.  I know it feels too good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. She tweeted because I don't think he ever shaved his beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, so well, you can just take little clippings.  You don't need much.  The question is, did he ever get the amulet?  Apparently, he did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the story, he did not.  This is so he's not protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New Music Express. Nick actually from Nick Bilton, right?  Nick referred to it in his Vanity Fair piece on Jack Dorsey.  Nick's been doing great work covering covering Twitter.  See, Nick can't quit Twitter, but I can.  Let's take a little break.  And how about a change log in just a?  Yeah, just a minute.  Some refreshing women.  What's this Brits tell New York Times to sod off?  Oh, did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was brilliant.  It is. It is. So actually, the stories here,  you should go to the original New York Times tweet, which it'll have.  Yeah. OK.  New York Times asked people, have you ever experienced petty crime in London?  Could you tell us your story?  So if you click on that tweet and just start reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an example, though, this is just what you said.  They should be reaching out to the people and see what the people say.  The replies are so hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People have the people found a million ways to say sod off.  New York Times. The replies are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sitting on the London Underground, a passenger met my eyes for more than a second.  Then he smiled. Yeah.  Some fellow was standing on the left hand side of the down escalators  at Shepherd's Bush today.  I toted very loudly as I passed.  It's hilarious.  It is. It is the best.  Charlton didn't have his oyster card ready this morning  before getting to the front of the underground queue.  Audible tutting ensued.  Well, visiting an acquaintance who lives in Shepherd's Bush,  she offered to make me a cup of tea.  I said yes. And she put the milk in first.  My neighbors left their bins out for two days after they were emptied.  The horror. The horror.  All right. That's pretty funny.  It's really nothing but that it's thousands of them.  Yeah. And it's just this is the second time the Times has done this to London.  Remember, they did a thing on how, oh, food in London is not so bad anymore.  Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Right.  The mutton. Everybody made comments about the mutton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is my mutton.  I haven't had a shag in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, and so you think that life was wonderful with the game.  They're trolling London.  Yeah, I think they were trolling the whole country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's time to get a home loan, it's time to go to rocketmortgage.com  slash twig rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans.  And you can get a home loan.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans.  I might add the number one lender in the country.  Nine years in a row, number one in customer satisfaction, according to JD Power.  Nine years running.  I'm sure they'll get it in 2019 too, because people love them.  It's things like Rocket Mortgage.  Quicken Loans realized that there needed to be an easier, faster, better way  to get a home loan, particularly for people like us online.  Right.  So Rocket Mortgage created the power buying process.  It's a three-step process.  Step one, answer a few simple questions.  No, you don't have to go to the bank.  You don't have to go get a big paper application to fill out.  You don't have to fax many information.  Just go onto the website, rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You could do it on your phone.  Answer a few questions, name, address, phone number, that kind of thing.  They'll check your credit.  And within a few minutes, most cases like under 10, they will give you  pre-qualified approval.  That fast.  You choose the term, the rate, the down payment, and you're done.  Then within the next 24 hours, and again, in most cases, with no effort on your part,  they'll verify income, assets, and credit and give you verified approval.  Verified approval has a letter with it that says essentially they're good for it.  You have the strength of a cash buyer.  No contingencies.  It moves you right to the front of the line when you're buying a house.  Take it from me.  I've bought a lot of houses.  That is, I've been beat out by cash buyers many times.  Never again.  And then the third part is really timely.  Interest rates again went up today.  The Fed raised interest rates.  That means your home loan index rate, whatever it is, will probably go up shortly.  That's nervous making.  You're out there, you're house hunting, and you don't know.  Is the rate going to go up?  Is it going to cost us much more over the life of the loan?  Not if you have rocket mortgage because rate shield approval locks your rate for up to  90 days while you shop.  You have up to three months to find a home.  Your rate, you know what your rate is.  It cannot go up.  You can take your time.  You can find exactly the right house.  Actually, if rates go down, your rate will go down.  They just can't go up.  That's why you want to go right now and lock in the rate before it goes up even more.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  There's a reason Quicken Loans is the most loved lender in the country.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  They care about their customers.  Rate shield approval is only valid in certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison  to public data records.  The Google Housing lender licensed in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support this week in Google.  The Google changelog was created by the great Gina Trapani many moons ago.  Jeff and I just watched as she did it so masterfully.  She did.  She was good.  We miss her.  Gina, wherefore art thou, Gina?  I was on All About Android last night which broke my heart.  What about us?  I think it's, well it could be you Jeff, but I think it also could be, no, she loves you.  I think it really is that daytime she's working.  She's got a day job now, unfortunately.  But if you love Gina, watch All About Android last night.  It was a great episode.  They had Brian Burnett came back.  Ron was in studio.  It was a really wonderful episode, including Gina Trapani.

Transcript:  I'm just mad she didn't come join us this week on the show.  In Reviews We Trust, Making Google Play Ratings and Reviews More Trustworthy.  This blew me away.  The Google Play Trust and Safety teams this year deployed a system combining human intelligence  with machine learning to detect and enforce policy violations and ratings and reviews.  And as a result, they have clobbered a lot of phony reviews.  One week, a recent week.  One week, millions of reviews and ratings detected and removed from the Play Store.  Thousands of bad apps identified due to suspicious reviews and rating activities on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a long time coming.  Thank God they finally did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess a testament to how big the store is, but also how much fraud is going on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say if you're a developer, don't buy fake or incentivized ratings because you might  be bumped.  Don't run campaigns in app or otherwise that say things like, give us five stars and we'll  give you this in app item.  That's not allowed.  That counts as incentivized ratings is prohibited.  Read the developer policy to make sure you're not making violations.  You used to see this anyway all the time.  Give us five stars and we'll give you 10% off.  That's not right.  If you're a user, don't accept receive money or goods, even virtual ones in exchange for  reviews or ratings.  Do not use profanity to criticize an app or a game unless it's f-ing horrible.  No, I added that part.  Don't post gibberish.  Okay.  Hateful, sexual, profane or off-topic reviews, they aren't allowed.  No profanity?  What?  You know, if I can't say a good juicy swear word every once in a while on a review, I  don't know what's the point.  Okay.  Helping families develop healthy digital habits with Chromebooks.  It's a new app.  The family-  The nanny state knows no bounds.  They're at it again.  The FamilyLink app helps parents see how they're using their Android devices.  Here it is.  Help your family create-  Android or Chromebook?  Well, I guess they've extended this to Chromebooks.  So it's both now, right?  I see that as true.  I guess that's the idea.  The FamilyLink app can run on a Chromebook anyway.  Keep an eye on screen time.  So this is, you know, we have all of this kind of on, for ourselves anyway, on Android,  but now you can do it with your family and your kids.  Guide kids to good content.  FamilyLink allows parents to customize websites kids can visit and review.  So don't watch YouTube then?  Such as YouTube.  Oh, I'm sorry.  YouTube kids.  Google Play Books.  Wouldn't want to leave YouTube out.  Manage Google accounts and Chromebooks from anywhere.  So that's nice.  That's nice.  That's the FamilyLink app.  Is it only on the Play Store?  But you could use it on your-  That's not clear.  It's just more FamilyLink features for Chromebooks.  So yeah.  Is it just for Chromebooks?  I think you get the Android version and it will work on Chromebooks is my sense from  reading this.  So we were talking about artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, on my Chromebook, I can no longer tell what version I have.  What?  They changed the settings and I don't know how to find out.  It must be somewhere.  There's got to be somewhere.  Do you look at that in the about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I don't have one in front of me.  There's no about anymore, huh?  Google has created a song composing artificial intelligence engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a sparse section right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was sparse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yeah, it keeps telling me if I can only do 10 more reviews then I can get socks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, it's so annoying.  Is that what you have to do?  Do more reviews who get socks?  Yeah, you do a lot of reviews.  9 to 5 Google says it's unclear who qualifies.  One user on Reddit is at level 7 as a local guide and notes receiving the socks while  others in that same ballpark did not.  Unfair.  I have a weird.  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google keeps emailing me because I'm a local guide and it says your pictures are  getting lots of views.  Like millions.  So one photo, one photo of a patio of a sandwich place in downtown Toronto has like 600,000  views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, you think they're lying because I get the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is nothing unusual about this patio in any way.  There aren't even any human beings on it.  Why are so many people looking at this photo?  Does it pop up?  Like when you look at a specific region in Toronto?  I don't know.  Or it's a mystery to me.  There's another one.  I did a review of a restaurant in Rome and you know, it's there's a shot of the outside  of this restaurant in an alley and it's like 370,000 views.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you tired of that music or did it just the robot gave up?  He thought we weren't listening.  Robot got tired.  If you're going to, if you're not going to pay attention to me, I'm not going to play.  That's the spark.  Just background music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I never get tired of robot music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the rest of the show should have freaking robot music.  Yeah.  Hell, robot talk.  It's just a matter of time, Jeff.  It is.  There's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't tell them our plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a new anyway, get your free socks, write more reviews, take more pictures.  If I ever got socks, I would wear them.  Google, I'm just saying.  Yeah, you, you, unfortunately you would.  It's going to be easier to share files on your Google Drive with non account holders.  That's huge.  They're going to use a pin so that they can identify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called such a pain in the butt to try to share something.  Is that you sent it to me?  Are you sure?  Yes, I'm sure.  Well, then they have to ask permission from me and then it's a McGill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus they kind of have to sign up, right?  If they're not, if they don't have an account, they.  Well, you can.  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.  You got to go through many hoops and they have fire in them and it's a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They ask you for permission and then you grant it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so now it'll be just a that they call pin code sharing.  You can invite non G Suite users to you can even collaborate using a personal identification  number.  That's kind of sweet.  This has been overdue.  Yes.  Yes.  You can ask Google Assistant for flight delay predictions.  I like that.  Google, of course, because of its acquisition of what was that?  The flight booking thing.  Yeah.  Now, I probably knows more about what flights are going to be delayed and what, you know,  historical information like that than anybody.  And they're they're exposing that to you.  You can even ask the assistant.  You can say what's the status of flight AA 528?  That flight is scheduled to depart on time at 11 p.m.  Philadelphia time due to delayed incoming flight.  There's a good chance it'll could change, it says here.  This is somebody Google doesn't make typos like that, do they?  There's a good change.  So I think this is fake.  It'll be delayed by at least 30 minutes.  You should plan still plan to be on time, though.  Good change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fake.  That's OK.  Well, what I do is I go to flight aware.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go to flight aware all the time.  I'm neurotic as hell, of course, and I travel a lot.  I have two hundred and thirty thousand miles is here.  So I go and I and on United, you can check where the plane's coming from.  I'm obsessed with that because I want to know where the equipment is.  And then, especially if it's other airlines, I go to flight aware and I just see how often  the plane's been delayed.  So I'm doing that judgment of really good, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really good.  This is actually really the whole change log could have been the things Google is doing  for the holidays.  Draw a line in the snow using tech with kids around the holidays.  Live from the North Pole, what's new at Santa's Village.  Keep calm and Google fit on.  Seven Ways the Assistant can help you survive the holidays.  These are all blog posts.  How Android can help you switch off and enjoy the holidays on the 12th day of holiday shopping  made by Google gave to me.  Unwrap the seasons on and on and on.  This is here in search 2018.  I think we already did that one, right?  Oh, have you seen this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was going to be my show end.  All right, I'll save it.  Oh, I won't go ahead.  No, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then I added something else under that.  Matthew, it's related.  So we can do it at the end.  But there's two things.  We can do it at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, you remember, then.  So, by the way, this is a little side note.  You remember the I didn't even show it because everybody and their brother sent me a clip  of the NASA engineer, Mark Rober, who made the glitter bomb, the glitter bomb for package  thieves.  Brilliant.  I don't know how many millions of views this video has gotten now on YouTube.  And I'm not going to show it because everybody's seen it.  But if you didn't watch it carefully, you missed the part where he said the thieves  should have known that this was a fake.  It would look like a Google Home pod.  They should have known for several reasons.  One, UPS doesn't deliver Google Home pods.  Two, the label was addressed to one Kevin McAllister, who happens to be the kid left  alone in Home Alone.  Are we getting some sort of Home Alone resurgence here?  Maybe.  Here's a Google Assistant video featuring Macaulay Cawkin, who has grown, who has aged  slightly as a as an updated Kevin McAllister in Home Alone.  It's the same house, by the way, at least from the outside.  Mom, what he really looks like the same kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, what's on my calendar today?  You have one event called House to Yourself.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google, add aftershave to my shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Google, remind me to clean these sheets later.  OK, I'll remind you.  You're a bad AC.  Someone's in front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do I owe you?  Looks like you paid online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep the change, you filthy animal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, Google, turn down the temperature two degrees.  Hey, Google, begin Operation Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Operation Kevin underway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess he's using the assistant to...  Kevin Durant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Better get out of here before somebody sees us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they even have the voice of what's his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cute.  That's a good ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well done.  And then to which, Jeff, Ever the Grinch.  Yeah, it is grinchy, isn't it?  As a metal floss article.  If you did the actual Home Alone pranks.  You'd probably kill somebody.  You'd be in prison now.  Yeah, the Pay Can Pendulum.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it would hit your...  A 13 pound of paint would fly towards your face at 20 miles an hour.  Vsauce, of course, a YouTube channel,  tested the impact this would have on the head of a ballistic dummy.  It would pretty much crush your skull.  And there was video.  You want to see the video?  Oh, sure.  Vsauce and Lowe's, wow.  Can you survive the Home Alone traps?  I'm Jake and my parents.  Maybe I don't want to watch this.  Yeah, I can't.  At least he didn't say, hey, guys, scary because I'm only eight years old.  Vsauce is a pretty good channel.  I like the Vsauce channel.  And that's a great idea for a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I want to save time for my favorite video of the week when we get out of the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google YouTube rewind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, I'm maybe the only person in the world who liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did we watch that?  We watched that last week.  We did watch that last week.  OK. We don't need to do that again.  No.  Finally, test your knowledge of the year's top trends with Game of the Year,  a quiz based on the most popular searches of 2018.  You ready?  Let's go.  You can play along at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How well do you know what trended in search this year?  Let's find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is going to be some sort of British thing.  I should have seen this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which boho chic DIY craft trended higher in 2018, filling our homes with lovely hanging plants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either macrame or decoupage.  Macrame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Crafty Matthew.  I deck out my nose with these things.  I'm a macrame user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Macrame.  OK, I do macrame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one got more love in search this year, dog backpacks or cat backpacks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dog backpacks or cat backpacks?  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Always dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The answer is dog backpacks.  Wouldn't it be kind of rough for a dog to carry a backpack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd this voice come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who was searched more this year, Elon Musk or Iron Man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Iron Man, Elon Musk.  Gotta be Elon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we're good.  We're killing this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The answer is Elon Musk.  I mean, he did launch a car into outer space.  Why is the voice so bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This mustn't be from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which version of IHOP was searched more in 2018?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which version of IHOP was searched more in 2018?  IHOP or IHOP?  IHOP.  Oh, it was IHOP.  Oh.  The answer is IHOP.  The only thing I answered, I got it wrong.  I'm sorry.  I ruined it.  We had a perfect score, Jeff.  Till I came along.  Lunar eclipse or total eclipse of the heart, which was searched more?  Gotta be lunar eclipse.  Total eclipse of the heart.  The only real place.  All right.  Anyway, you get the idea.  You've reached the bonus round.  Oh, well, maybe we should finish.  Oh, no.  Did it trend more in 2018?  Oh, okay.  Drag right if it trended this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Single drone.  No wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I ran out of time, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What kind of groups were we in?  Okay, that's enough.  Thank you very much.  Stop, stop, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  And that's the Rocket Mortgage lower.  Oh, what a mortgage.  I love throwing Karsten.  He's going like this.  Push a button, push a button, any button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, have you watched my favorite video of the week?  Yes.  The third from the last under other.  Fourth, woman tries to fill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has to be fake.  I saw this video.  You're kidding.  As a Tesla owner, I'm watching this.  I don't know.  She's trying to fill a car up with gasoline.  The sound up helps.  It's a Tesla.  We're watching from the car behind her.  Clearly the people videoing this know that she's not going to find a gas tank.  She can't figure out where it is.  You don't think this is fake?  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably.  I assume everything is fake.  It's fake.  Okay, maybe it's fake.  If it's funny, I assume it's fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, really?  There's no gas meter.  How would you even stop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was talking to somebody and they said, and I haven't driven a Tesla, so you know better what it looks like, but is there an empty sign?  No.  No.  For your electric?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that an S?  Yeah, it's a Model S.  No, there's nothing that would even show you.  She wouldn't.  She's going to do it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now she's given up.  She's figured, well, I figured out where the port is.  She's opened the charging port and she's put money in the pump.  Oh dear, don't put gas in the charging port.  She's now, she's trying to get the...  This actually could be dangerous.  I don't know what happened if you put gas in there, but it wouldn't be good.  You couldn't though, could you?  You know what?  I think this might be real because nobody could laugh like that.  I know.  It's fake, right?  Even the Google AI couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was starting to cry by now.  It has a happy ending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's giving up now.  She's putting it back in the holster.  She just doesn't, she's just baffled by it.  She's looking in as if that will help.  Of course, this wouldn't happen in New Jersey because we don't have self-service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't?  That's right.  I can't remember.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Oh, now she's opening the trunk.  Sure.  Maybe it's in the trunk.  Okay.  No, no.  She's decided that's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not a Tesla driver because she doesn't know you hit a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she doesn't understand.  Okay.  I think these people are cruel.  I would have gotten out and said, I'm sorry, lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a second.  It's an electric.  Your faith in mankind will be restored to literal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone comes up.  She's calling her boyfriend saying, I...  What are the whappers?  How do I put gas in this?  Oh, she got out.  See, there he comes.  Oh, sweetheart.  It's electric.  You don't put gas in it.  It's electric.  Electric car.  No gas.  She could have thought it was a hybrid, right?  Yeah.  Oh, now she's laughing.  Now she laughs at herself.  She's going, oh my God, I can't believe it.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  She must have borrowed it or something.  Yeah, or stolen it.  He's being nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's being nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's being nice.  He's being nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's being nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's being nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's being nice.  He's being nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's being nice.  He's being nice.  He's not rubbing the can.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's genuine.  All right.  I love that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  She waves goodbye to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice.  That seemed kind of real.  Based on the laughing, those guys are pretty high though, right?  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would explain a lot, actually.  Yeah.  Let's take a little break.  I didn't get to all the stories today, but there's a lot more.  But I'll tell you what I'll do.  I will let Matthew Ingram, digital journalist for the Columbia Journalism Review.  He's the chief digital writer and Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University  of New York Graduate School, the Craig Newmark School of Journalism.  I will let you guys pick some more stories when we come back.  Our show today brought to you by Grammarly.  I hope you tell your students about Grammarly.  I, at first, I was a snob.  I was a snob.

All right, I got one for you.  Did you see, and I wish I could see this movie.  You probably could see it in New York.  Peter Jackson's World War I movie, They Shall Not Grow Old.  This is unbelievable.  So Jackson, the creator of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings,  took really cruddy old newsreel footage, which is hand-cranked.  And so it's stuttery.  You've seen all these old movies.  Super jerky.  Super jerky, black and white.  He colorized it.  He's spaced out.  He cleaned up the timing so that it looks like an actual film.  And he did it not for a little bit, but for 100 hours of archival footage.  Amazing.  He actually ran out of money.  The documentary screens nationwide.  It's already shown once, December 17th, and it's coming up December 27th.  If I were in New York City or Toronto, I'm sure maybe Toronto,  I would go see this if I could figure out where.  Maybe it's only in Britain.  I don't know.  It is a 90-minute documentary, but it features so many of these videos.  And it really isn't interesting how it seems so much more real.  It changes your perception completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Imperial War Museum had a project that commissioned artists to create work  for the centennial of World War I.  We're 100 years after the end of the war, 1918 to 2018.  They approached Jackson.  He apparently is a real historian, World War I, World War I buff.  His grandfather was a soldier in the British Army before the war.  He served in the war during its duration.  So he wanted to only, no narrator, and only use archival footage,  which meant he had to really go through a lot of footage.  It took them three years to clean this up.  But, boy, and we only could see little clips in this New York Times article,  but, boy, it really looks good.  Can't wait to see it.  I hope I get a chance to do so.  I wonder after those two days if they're going to put it on Netflix or something.  I hope so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just incredible.  And he's really, they actually brought in, because some of them, like this one here,  this one, there's no audio on it, but they could tell what the guys were saying.  So they brought in forensic lip readers who,  and then actors to actually overdub it so that they would have voices.  And they even brought in actors from the different regions of England  so their accents would be appropriate.  Really, really cool.  So that's my article of the week that we didn't get to.  What about you, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to, there were a bunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to pick just one.  What's your favorite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is in the rundown,  but this guy sort of hacked the New York City Wi-Fi monoliths  so that they would play the Mr. Softie jingle.  It was only a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These things are great.  I mean, they have very high speed internet.  You have to be close to it.  Are they, Jeff, are they just where phone booths used to be?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, pretty much.  Yes.  But they have Wi-Fi, they have a screen, and they have a big ad screen on them.  And what you see is you see homeless people charging their phones,  sitting there for as long as it takes to charge the phone,  and it's their lifeline.  You can actually make phone calls from it, which is a little awkward  because you're kind of screaming in the streets of New York,  but it's a connection with people who don't have connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish that this guy had, when I first read the headline,  I was hoping that he had kind of hacked into the Wi-Fi  or into the system of the phone or the unit,  but he actually goes up to it and makes it a free,  so you can make free calls, I guess,  and he calls a conference call line that he set up  that then plays the Mr. Softie jingle.  Oh.  So it's not really a hack.  So not really that high tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I had, when they announced this,  I thought, oh, this is going to end poorly, but it's not.  Jeff, it's a success, you think?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good.  It also said, my favorite part of the piece, I think,  was that it said that most of the New Yorkers that the reporter watched  kind of turned to acknowledge the jingle  and then carried on as though nothing was happening.  It's New York.  Yeah.  Well, it's the big deal.  It's the big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's supposed to be playing the Mr. Softie jingle.  What a surprise.  A friend of mine has been putting on pictures of some guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who is dressed as a Christmas tree.  Yeah.  And pictures on the subway, and no one's paying the sleigh.  Yeah, of course not.  Yeah, no, nobody even notices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I love about New York.  Yeah.  Everything, you see everything there.  You got a problem with that?  Everybody's got, there's personal space.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's fun.  Yeah.  And I have to disagree with Gizmodo.  Mr. Softie is not creepy music.  When you slow it down, it's creepy.  It's a little creepy.  If you play it in a minor key, maybe.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Buy, buy Oath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We hardly knew ye.  Verizon has decided, remember they bought Yahoo and AOL.  And they called it Oath.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week they reduced the value of the brand by $4.6 billion.  Yeah, $4.6 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they're going to rename it to something a little more sensible than Oath Verizon Media Group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was roughly half the value of that you had.  That's the purchase.  That unit.  They've basically.  50% of that entire unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was 4.8, Matthew.  It was 4.8 down to 4.6, minus 4.6.  No, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  4.8 was what they paid for Yahoo or AOL.  That was the brand value.  But the total.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The purchase price was higher than both.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they wrote off a good portion of the purchase price.  The goodwill.  The goodwill.  No, no.  The brand value.  Now, I thought, Jeff, you'd want to pick this one.  France is going to tax Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.  GAFA.  European finance ministers did not agree on a block-wide digital tax next year.  But France says, yeah, we're going to do it anyway.  They want to raise half a billion euros in 2019 off the backs of these guys.  This is just business as usual, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the problem I always have with this is that it's fine.  You're a government.  You set the tax rate.  But don't set it for specific companies.  You've got to set it fairly across the playing field.  But that's not what they're doing.  They're playing politics.  But they have that's what politicians do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  January 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the story that is.  So what do you guys.  Do you think there'll be a panic about El El Gard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, really?  I think that's kind of cool.  You can now tell your Amazon Echo to listen for glass break or what else?  Screaming.  Smoke alarms.  Screaming.  No screaming.  So as you leave, you say, you say, echo, turn on Echo Guard and your speakers will listen for trouble.  They can't call 911.  But if you have a alarm service, it can call the alarm service.  And it can also notice it'll most most importantly notify you and you can listen in.  You can even speak so you can hear.  Oh, there's somebody in our house.  Get out of the house.  I'm calling the police now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this is not a new feature.  There's a number of alarm systems, including our advertiser, who do this.  Yeah.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet it's going to happen.  People are going to say, see, I know they listen to you all the time.  They can do that.  Oh, yeah.  That's what people are going to say.  Probably is going to.  The theory here is you turn it on when you're leaving.  You turn it on.  But that means it's capable.  It's already on all the time.  They're just clearly fooling us.  I know I'm going to hear it.  I know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know Tesla has a fart mode?  This bothered me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Yeah.  All my Tesla.  Has added a fart mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it do?  You can configure it in one of two ways.  Fart on demand.  Allows the driver to send flatulence through the speakers with the press of a scroll wheel.  Elon.  Then there's fart on turn signal.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are six different noises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can be randomized.  The stern mobile.  Falcon Heavy is one of the sounds.  It can fart on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, what is it going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can fart at random.  And it has.  Falcon Heavy.  Oh, Elon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kids love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shorts ripper.  Okay.  I guess I'll be turning that on.  I'm sorry officer.  I was turning on the fart feature.  When I didn't pay attention and I caused an accident.  I'm sorry.  I was turning on the fart feature.  When I didn't pay attention and I caused an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I was turning on the fart feature.  I'm sorry.  I was turning on the fart feature.  When I didn't pay attention and I caused an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people might say, Elon, if you could worry less about Atari games and fart mode,  you might want to work a little harder on the self-driving capabilities, but not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just opened a tunnel too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's your next car going to be, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I really wanted a Model 3 and I'm worried about the company and I honor Elon  for his vision.  He's a visionary.  He really made electric vehicles happen.  He's also insane.  And I just, I don't feel like it's safe to buy another Tesla at this point.  My lease runs out in July.  Probably.  I don't know.  I really, you know, Audi's doing electric vehicles.  I think I might look at a more traditional car manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think Tesla's got, there's a risk the company's actually going to go under?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's so mercurial that people have had problems, a lot of problems with repairs and bodywork.  And I do worry that, you know, he might hear me say something and decide he doesn't like me  and deactivate my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just worries me.  Well, at one time you wouldn't sell one to somebody, I know that.  Yeah.  Because he got upset.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the thing to understand is that Tesla logs everything you do in that car.  And I wouldn't be at all surprised if Tesla even logs the audio in the car.  Not for ad sales, but just they want records.  And particularly what they're anxious for is evidence that it was your fault if the car crashes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was one of the things I noticed when one of, a car crashed and burst into flame.  Within minutes or maybe hours, Tesla had provided detailed descriptions of every act that that driver had taken from.  They know all of that.  From touching the door to, you know, touching the steering wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That made me a little nervous.  Yeah.  I don't know. I really, everybody who has a Model 3 loves it, so I don't have to decide until July.  They're great cars.  Oh, I see. Okay.  I love my Model X. I have a Model X. Do you have a Tesla, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I do not, but a friend has a Model 3 and it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to do a trade. One of our employees has a Model 3. I'm going to do a trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that struck me that I couldn't get used to is that there's no dash panel.  I kind of like that.  So it's just a featureless expanse of wood.  Yeah. Isn't that wild?  So where all the dials would be is where you prop your book.  A piece of wood.  You can read that.  This looks like, you know, part of the, there's no dials, no gauges, no nothing.  It's just, it's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, actually I've been thinking a lot about, we were talking earlier on Windows Weekly about user interface in cars  because I drove the Jaguar electric vehicle, the I-PACE, and it's got buttons and knobs.  It's very physical everywhere and it's too cluttered for me.  Yeah.  I like, I don't know if, I mean, Tesla, the Model 3 is extreme, but I don't know.  I kind of like it. I've gotten used to the Tesla way of simple, clean interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It looks beautiful. It just takes a bit of getting used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's a Porsche coming out early next year, the Taycan.  Oh, no.  Yeah. It's supposed to be, well, it's the same as Audi also.  Oh, and then there's a new VW that people are going crazy about.  Really? Which one?  Well, it's not out yet, but they've been driving around prototypes.  Electric?  Yeah, all electric VW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was a rumor they were going to make.  You mean the van?  No, that's coming in a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a rumor they were coming back with the van.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are. That's in 2021, I think.  Okay.  This is, they are saying they'll have 342 mile range, which is huge.  Oh.  It's called the ID, but see, they're driving around these dazzle.  They've got this dazzle camouflage on them.  But it's going to be very, I think, affordably priced.  So I don't know. See, this all goes back, interestingly, to Dieselgate.  Yeah.  Because Audi and VW, which are the same company, of course,  where they were faking the results for their diesel engines.  And as a result, they got a huge fine.  And one of the commitments they made is something called Electrify America,  which is a multi-billion dollar investment into charge stations every 40 miles in the United States.  So there's going to be these chargers everywhere.  It's going to be very interesting. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was anyone upset that Chevy got rid of the Volt?  They killed the Volt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Because now they have the Volt.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very poorly named.  Yeah.  One's electric, one's hybrid.  So they got rid of the hybrid.  Volt was the hybrid, yeah.  But they kept the electric.  No, I think every car company is facing the facts that we're going to have to go all electric in every country of the world,  except the United States, where we will continue to drive...  Coal-powered cars.  Coal-powered cars for the foreseeable future.  God bless it.  You know, why isn't there a second amendment for gas engines?  I think there will be.  There might be.  There will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm picturing a future and there's like an underground group of guys who drive their own physical cars and put gas in them.  And they have to make their own gasoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only outlaws will have internal combustion engines.  Commies want to get rid of gas.  I think that's actually the attitude among some.  But I like driving electric vehicles. I feel good about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The torque just amazes me.  It is incredible.  It's a great drive.  The only one I've ever driven was the BMW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The i6, whatever.  So, Jeff, did you have a number or are we going to wrap this thing up?  I do. I do. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Chartbeat, which tracks traffic on most sites, put out its list.  I think Craig Silverman, Matthew's fellow, Matthew's lansman, Canadian from Buzzfeed, said, I think it was Craig,  said, if you get depressed about what people are paying attention to, look at this list from Chartbeat.  It's the stories that had the most engagement in news in the year.  So number one was Bourdain's death, tragically.  Number two was I'm part of the resistance inside the Trump administration.  Number three, Brexit Live blog, BBC.  Number four, this is why Uma Thurman is angry.  Number five.  Why is Uma Thurman? Oh, I remember now why Uma Thurman is angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these stories had high engagement and there's nothing awful in here.  And of course, these that's self-fulfilling because it comes from major news sites that pay chalk beat.  OK, but those sites also had dumb stories, every single one of them.  And those weren't the ones that got the most engagement.  So we're not idiots out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Engagement means what? Not that these are the most read stories.  This is this people read the traffic.  People actually like the Uma Thurman story.  You couldn't stop reading. It was all about how Quentin Tarantino practically killed her.  Yeah, when making was it making Kill Bill or I can't remember.  Was it Kill Bill? Yeah, it wasn't exactly me too.  It was a good story. OK, good. Time spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. Although I did notice BuzzFeed News, not to rain on your parade, Jeff,  but BuzzFeed News had a list of its top stories and not BuzzFeed, BuzzFeed News.  And all right. Number four was, is this person saying Yanny or Laurel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I hate Yanny or Laurel. I hated that. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it.  By the way, what did you hear? Yanny or Laurel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember, actually, to be honest. I read the I read it was you're wrong.  I read a description of how it worked, and then I could hear both. Yes, exactly.  It kind of ruined it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you have a pick, Matthew? Anything you wanted to tell people about besides Yanny and Laurel?  We stole it from him. I do not. We did. We stole his video.  We stole it. Yeah, that's right. It was in a good cause, Matthew. You sacrificed for a good cause.  So Amazon sells a seventy dollar puck that you put your Note or Galaxy phone on.  It turns it into a desktop computer. It's an interesting concept, right?  The idea that this phone, these phones are powerful enough now.  Why do you need a separate computer?  Why don't you just carry the phone around and have a little docking puck wherever you go?  The problem is it's kind of expensive. So this is my pick, and it's actually pretty cool.  It has all the value of a Dex dock, but it's only thirty dollars.  It doesn't come from Samsung. Comes from Next Jack, N-E-X-J-A-C-K.  And it actually does turn your phone. This is the Galaxy browser.  But if I want, I can launch other Galaxy stuff.  I even have a keyboard and a mouse attached to this.  And it's got an HDMI port. Actually, I think it's dead.  The mouse doesn't seem to be. Oh, there it is. Yeah, no, it's not dead.  How do I close this? We could show the desktop.  It's the scaling. Our scaler isn't working right.  But there's a desktop screen you get on it.  And Microsoft Office works as a desktop application, as does Samsung's email.  Some of their other applications, including their internet browser.  It kind of looks like a desktop. Here's the deal.  I'm not sure. I don't know how useful Dex is, and I don't know if you would want to use it.  But for $30, you get a little dongle that, by the way, also charges the device,  because it's got a Type-C connector. In fact, you have to plug it in to make it work.  It has a full-size HDMI port, two USB ports, one 3.1, one 2.0.  So it's a hub. It's a connector hub that also can be used as a Dex station.  I think for $30, this is a very sensible thing to add.  I wish they had a headphone jack, but I guess you don't really need one,  because Samsung still makes phones with headphone jacks.  But somebody in the radio show last weekend said, should I get a Dex?  And I said, there's this $30 thing. I said, let me get it and tell you.  Next Jack, N-E-X-J-A-C-K, you can get it on Amazon, $29.90.  If you have an S8, S9, or Note 8 or Note 9, I would get one. Why not?  Ladies and gentlemen, this is our last show of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2018. Next week, we're going to give...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in a lot of ways, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess it was. I don't know. Yeah.  High stress.  I've blanked it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So was the stock market blanked out in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, that was a bad year for investors.  We will be back January 3rd, or is it 2nd? 2nd. Yeah.  With a whole new show.  Next week though, it's the best of this week in Google, featuring bits and pieces from all of the shows of this year.  And actually, I think if you watch our best of shows, you can be the judge of whether this was a good year or not.  There were some good moments for us.  Jeff, have a wonderful holiday.  We'll do you too, boss.  Thank you. I can't wait. We're doing...  Best of the family.  A couple more shows. I'll be back for the Tech Guy, the new screensavers, and Twit this weekend.  And then it's a week off for our best ofs.  We're going to do a fun Twit though, kind of our holiday Christmas Eve, Eve Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I hear? Did I hear the return of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Possibly the Grinch will make a...  You know why? You know what I did? I set a trap.  I bought that Louis XIII Cognac, the 100-year-old Cognac for $3,000 in the back of a bottle.  I bought that and I said anybody who shows up for Twit can have some.  It was Dvorak bait.  It was Dvorak bait.  I set my trap and he fell right into it.  So yeah, I'm not sure who else is going to be coming, but it should be a lot of fun.  Alex Lindsay, if you've come out, you're on.  If you want to fly out for a $100 sip of booze, be my guest.  Matthew Ingram is at the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.org.  He's chief digital writer there. He's on Twitter too, M-A-T-H-E-W-I.  Math-ooey. Just remember, if you don't like math, you'll love Math-ooey.  How about that?  Okay.  Okay?  Sure.  Okay. And of course, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY and BuzzMachine.com.  At the Newmark Graduate School.  The Newmark School.  Can I ask you, Jeff, though, as a professor, graduate school professor, do you have patches on your tweed jackets, elbows?  No.  Good man. Get your wife to put those on immediately.  What good are jackets without patches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I also, I'm one of those horrible old men who tries to act younger and I wear hoodies these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no. You know what is really seemly is wear a beret and drive a sports car.  That's what you should be doing.  Always a pleasure. It's been a, it's, I don't know, you may not have liked the year, but I enjoyed this year working with you.  And as long as we're here on Wednesdays, it's a good year.  Yeah, exactly. Stacey, Matthew's been on many times.  Thank you guys. Have a great holiday season.  Thanks for having me.  In 2019 on This Week in Google. Bye bye.
