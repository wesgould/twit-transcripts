Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google. Stacey's here, Jeff's here.  We're gonna gather and talk about the latest news. Google results are in,  Facebook results are in. We'll contrast that to Microsoft and Apple's results.  And we'll talk about lots of cool new things, including a very scary robot and a very cute one.  It's all coming up next on Twig.  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  Hi, this is Leo Laporte and once again time for Twig's audience survey.  We'd really like to hear from you. It's only going to take a couple of minutes, really.  That's all. Just go to twig.tv slash survey and let us know what you think.  Your anonymous feedback will help us make Twig even better.  And thanks for your continued support.  This is Twig this week in Google.  Episode 390 recorded Wednesday, February 1st, 2017.  Bacon shortage.  This week in Google is brought to you by Curry, a real life robot with a great personality.  Curry is available for pre-order now at HeyCurry.com.  That's H-E-Y-K-U-R-I.com.  It's time for Twig this week in Google to show we cover whatever the hell we want.  But we attempt, we will attempt today to cover Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the maddening crowd.  With us, the king of the maddening crowd, Mr. Jeff Iresist Jarvis.  Hello, my crown.  Hey, great to see you at home and everything.  Yeah.  You recovered from Davos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. I did. And then I didn't go to Tokyo, so I'm probably kind of recovered.  And then I'm in town for a few weeks. I don't know what to do.  My wife's going to commit to Harry Curry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to be bored in the real world.  Also with us from Austin, Texas, Stacy Higginbotham of IOTpodcast.com, Stacy on IOT.com.  You know, I was thinking about you, Stacy, because I'm seeing more and more articles about ransomware  and how it's getting more aggressive targeting operating systems.  And I'm thinking targeting soon IOT devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is one of my big trends of 2017 is ransomware.  See?  Yes. There was the hotel issue.  In Austria.  In Austria, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which I misreported, because I read somebody's news report that said people were locked into their rooms,  as well as locked out by ransomware. Only locked out.  Only locked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, it wasn't they weren't locked out or locked in.  The keys didn't work.  They just couldn't issue keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Oh, and existing keys would continue to work or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe that's true. The Verge actually did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a lot of fake news around that.  Although I hate to use that phrase, but it's not. I mean, it was just errors.  There were error reporting errors.  But I love the statement from the manager of the hotel.  Apparently, this hotel in Austria, which is over 100 years old, has been hacked multiple times in the last few months.  And he said he finally said, that's it. I give up.  We're getting mechanical keys for the door locks.  Back to the key with a big tassel.  And that's one of the things I like about the old European hotels.  And as you leave, you leave it with the clerk.  And when you get back, you say I'm in room 304-918.  And they give you the key with a tassel and you go upstairs.  I like that. And you can't get locked out by ransomware.  But this is an example of as we increasingly use digital technology in our lives, that opens the door to mal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Malifactors. Yes. But those keys, you could also get copies of them made easily.  You could see if someone's in their room or not.  I mean, there's I don't know how many times that, you know, I'm reading a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you can't do it from Lithuania.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the interesting thing to me was I felt like their ransom was relatively low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So smart. Of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Two bitcoins. So like $1,800.  Was that all just two bitcoins?  Two? Oh, no. Half a bitcoin. Was it half a bitcoin?  500 bucks.  How much is bitcoin going right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about $938.22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Two bitcoins. Two bitcoins.  And basically, I can see this sort of thing happening all over town.  Like when you think about like someone hacking into like some nest credentials, for example.  You want to turn your thermostat on? Quick. Pay this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And the key is you make it low enough that people go, well, it's easier to pay them than it is to try to fix this.  So you make it up in volume, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like they say in the Shimada district. Yeah.  Yeah. Micro payments for ransom.  The pressing, isn't it?  You throw out the thermostat. You go to a different company. You get a download.  I'm trying to think of a scenario where really, where is the pain? Where have they got you by the short hair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, your car doesn't start unless you pay the ransomware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And our Teslas are probably sitting ducks for that, right?  Yeah.  They talk about drive by wire. I mean, it's all computer systems.  So, so the question is, you know, I'm not going to give up my Tesla, but I might give up my nest.  The question is, has IOT become useful enough that it's worth it to brave the risks?  And is it a big enough market that manufacturers will secure it better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're getting to the point right now where manufacturers are securing things.  So we've stopped. We've almost stopped.  Probably in 2015 is when people really woke up to the fact that like, if you want to build a connected product, you shouldn't go to a contract manufacturer and have them do the software for your product.  Right.  So the problem is those devices were still coming out in 2016.  So now we're so the devices that are actually going to be secured all the way are going to be coming out like later this year, unless you're really particularly good company.  And there are there are those companies in for the devices that are out there that are not secure.  There's a lot of like we Mo has a lot of issues.  Samsung has some issues with their products.  These are big companies. These are not.  Yeah, these are these are companies that basically made the call to not prioritize security because customers wouldn't pay for it.  It didn't make economic sense.  Now it makes economic sense.  They're investing in it.  And so you've got to look for companies that are actually willing to patch things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, and some companies are, you know, our sponsor ring, for instance, very famously, there was a security flaw in a ring.  And as soon as they were notified about it, they push.  I even know they could do it.  They pushed a firmware update down to the doorbell before it before it went public.  And that's what you're looking for.  A company that has that capability firmware that gets regularly updated and a company that considers owning the software as important as owning the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's where I think things are going to go.  The other thing to think about, though, is these companies cannot.  I mean, it sounds so obvious, but you can't rest on your laurels.  You've got to always be testing and being aware and updating your product.  And that's going to suck because not everybody has a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of what I mean.  Is that something you can outsource?  Is your product as much as the doorbell or the thermostat, the software is part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there is there is there a company that now offers that as a service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's White Hat.  There's companies that do like pin testing and White Hat hackers that you can hire to test your product.  Now, there's not a company necessarily that I can call to, like, make sure all my manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Right. So there's all right.  That's interesting, Stacy. So they're right.  There's two ways. What I was thinking, it's kind of a software as a service, you know, security as a service from the manufacturing side.  Yeah, there's companies that do that.  There are. So they offer that.  You can outsource that.  Yeah, for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, websites, the companies that do that for websites, that's a big business is these companies that will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So IOT as well. OK, so that's interesting, Stacy.  So is there a UL laboratories of security?  That's what we mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  UL actually has UL has a security standard that a cyber kind of security standard that they're working on.  I knew Stacy would know.  There's also I'm going to punt on the acronym for a minute.  Let me look and see what it there are several groups.  And Verizon has one that's pretty exciting.  So let me let me find it out.  It's the I OK. IOT security certification from ICSA Labs, which is a third party testing insert.  ICSA has been doing this for other other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's actually they have a cert for IOT security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And apparently this is kind of funny because I know the CEO of Canary or the CTO of Canary.  And they actually got this designation a couple months ago and they were the first company that actually made it through the first time.  And that up until then, the ICSA was like, maybe our standards are unrealistic.  Wow. But it was just that all these companies hadn't hadn't been controlling their whole process.  They'd never done it before. They had thought about it.  Thought about it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is ICSA would be I would be very they're kind of they're they're kind of the underwriters lab for digital stuff.  And that would be that would be really great.  They do have this ICSA Internet of Things security testing framework.  This is yeah, this is this is exactly what you need.  And as consumers, what we need to do is we need to look for things that are UL certified or ICSA certified.  That would be nice to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's that. But there's also things for consumers.  And this is why I'm wondering if there is a service opportunity in the market, because, you know, there are still consumers who are using crappy passwords, who don't change their password on the router, who use stupid SS IDs, which are all majority.  Right. I don't like to think that about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been we've been beating the drum for years.  And certainly that's one of the things I do on the radio show where I'm talking to real people.  I mean, constantly. But I think that that's still a minority of the overall user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's going to that's another issue.  And then finally, there is in on the consumer side, password review.  Reuse is actually a big issue because so many other companies are really crappy.  Like every time I implement a password with someone, I'm like, it's like my doctor's office, all these patient portals.  I have to have a password to get to my vet's records.  I mean, these guys are not taking good care of my credentials.  I know this, but, you know, it's hard for a consumer.  So I can see that being another weak point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to be depressed?  No. The most popular passwords of 2016.  Yes, most popular passwords. One, two, three, four, five, six.  Yeah, we did. Didn't we? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  Quirty. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  One, one, one, one, one. And on and on and on.  So that's not it's not getting any better.  Oh, that's right. We did talk about this was the keeper security list that we talked about last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we discovered one of the most common passwords is a bot password.  Yeah. Yeah. Our hard coded password rather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just in as we go to press about an hour ago, Facebook lost its Oculus lawsuit.  A judgment of half a billion dollars to ZeniMax.  ZeniMax, of course, is the company that was created that we created owned id software.  And it's CTO John Carmack went to Oculus and the contention is brought with him information.  ZeniMax claimed Palmer Lucky, violent, violated an NDA in order to build early prototypes of its Oculus Rift headset.  Of course, those is Palmer Lucky's fault. Well, it's an East Texas jury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not an East Texas jury. It's a Texas jury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. It's a mid Texas jury. I'm like, this is actually not the court that is so lenient.  It's not Tyler, Texas. OK. All right. Sorry.  Sheryl Sandberg told Recode, it's not material to Facebook's business.  We're disappointed in certain elements of the decision and we're considering our options to appeal.  Facebook spokesperson said the heart of this case was about whether Oculus stole ZeniMax trade secrets.  And the jury found decisively in our favor. What?  We're obviously, wow, we're obviously disappointed by a few other aspects of today's verdict.  We're on the third. Well, you know how these things are.  There's probably several counts or several points.  Oculus is half a billion bucks is what matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all the Oculus people. So Oculus is paying out 200 million.  Palmer, Lucky and Brendan Iribi, the former CEO of Oculus. They have to pay.  They have to pay. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how much do they make on the sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they can they can afford it. Let's put it that way.  So I guess the idea is. Palmer, Oculus 200 million for breaking the NDA.  50 million for copyright infringement.  Oculus and Lucky each have to pay 50 million for false designation.  Iribi has to pay 150 million for the same.  Yikes, Oculus says, we will appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So this is a U.S. district court in the North Texas North District.  Oh, OK. All right. So all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a somewhat respectable court. Somewhat somewhat respectable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, Facebook did release its earnings today.  And let's see the next news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say, I made enough money to pay this judgment.  Stock went up three percent today. So what does that amount to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Add revenues up 53 percent.  That's a decent result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It certainly is. They've got like, OK, yes.  So what were their earnings for the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here I have the Forbes article in three, two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never go to Forbes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we're talking about that big banner Forbes puts up that says you can go to the article in three, two, one.  Revenue rose 51 percent in the fourth quarter year over year.  Eight. Geez. All right. Wouldn't you like this?  Revenue went from five point eight four billion to eight point eight one billion in the same period a year earlier.  That's that's considerably more than the consensus among analysts.  A record for Facebook at seventh straight quarterly revenue beat.  Boyed by mobile video ad sales, including those on Instagram, mobile ad revenue.  Get ready for this. Eighty four percent of total ad sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and how many years ago were we telling them that Facebook was a mobile loser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, what we did say is and this was when Facebook went public.  They've got to figure out mobile ad revenue if they're going to go forward.  Well, they did. Yeah. OK. Well, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was I was curious. So they had twenty seven point six billion in total revenue in 2016, which makes a five hundred million dollar loss.  It's actually still material. OK. Half a billion is something.  I mean, that's what I was like. I was like, they're saying that's not material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it's one seventh of their total profit this quarter.  Oh, I mean, revenue, revenue. No, no, I'm talking profit.  Profit was three point five seven billion. Oh, oh, so.  So it's one seventh of their total profit.  Well, you don't care what the revenue is. How much did we make? Right.  I know that from my business. Well, we had fabulous revenue.  Yeah. But how much did I make? Well, we had a lot of expenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You spent it all on gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You bought a few too many computers, Leo.  In fact, excluding certain expenses, Facebook said it would have earned four point one five billion.  They didn't mention what those other things are.  The company warned when it reported third quarter earnings last time that expenses in 2017 will increase meaningfully.  Right. And that ad load, the volume of the ads the company can show users is less of a significant revenue growth factor this year.  So a strong quarter topping a strong year, said Sheryl Sandberg in her analyst call.  Businesses are making shifts to mobile and they're doing it on Facebook and Instagram.  Actually, did you see that Snapchat's lost a significant number of viewers to Instagram's stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Now, here's here's a little fun thing to think about.  We are moving to a voice. Voice first is kind of the key thing.  So remember how we were all like mobile first and freaking out.  So now as we get to IOT voice first, and I don't think it's going to be the sole way people access things.  But how do you generate revenue when people know what they want and just ask directly for it without mediating screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you're Amazon, right? Good. Right. If you're Google, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Google actually is Google's in trouble.  Like Google doesn't have a great business model yet for selling ads or selling anything because there's no ad in that search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. You're using Google search. Well, there's also no media brand there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So so this is this is if you want people to start thinking ahead, this is where I'm thinking ahead,  because I'm like looking at everybody's business model saying, oh, my gosh, how are they going to play in this world first?  But two, how do you make money when you take away screens?  And you shouldn't think about it as taking away screens when screams become not necessarily the primary interaction with computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, once again, just purely by luck, I chose the right model for our podcasts because they were great in audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Win. Win for me. Oh, true. Win for me, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, for all of us, because we're podcasters first and foremost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a journalist first and foremost. Oh, yeah, yeah, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I interviewed today for Yahoo for Katie Couric, and they're doing on podcasts.  I made a point of plugging. Thank you. But and saying podcasts have been around for a long time, been very successful.  I'm just now coming to day one. We never. Yeah, we never had a rental loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We always never ever. Mostly because we couldn't not make.  Yeah, because you had no capital. I can only spend what I made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've been in business a year now, you guys, by the way, I should say that I was so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knocked my microphone over. Oh, congratulations.  Is it exactly a year? When's the anniversary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the twenty seventh of January is when I quit fortune to start my own gig.  And so now it's been a year and almost a year.  I know. It's exciting. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exciting. How long have you been on the show now? May, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be a year soon. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. Congrats, Stacey. That makes me so happy.  That's a scary thing to do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was. Yes. No, it was super scary. It's still super scary.  But I'm really excited. And so and thank you.  I should say a big thank you. This I'm going to get all mushy. Thank you, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we love you. And we're just you know what?  I love seeing brand individuals able to take off with their own brand.  I just love it when that happens. And most of the people we work with have done that.  You know, they have their own personal brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still feel weird saying those words. I do, too. It's a creepy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I agree with you. I don't like it either. It's creepy.  But here's the non creepy side of it. You own your destiny.  True. So you so it doesn't have to be the brand doesn't have to be Leo, Leo, Leo.  It has to be the brand could be give you value, you know, help people, you know, whatever, inform people, entertain people.  But but but the real point is that you control your destiny.  To me, that was it was what it was all about. And I'm sure for you, too.  I mean, you were in a similar situation where Giga Home just disappeared one day.  Yes. And everything you've done for that brand was taken away.  Yes. Well, same thing happened to me with tech TV. Right.  Same thing happened with Jeff for Entertainment Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've been talking about weekly. I was like, you know, Entertainment Weekly is still around.  No, but but the Addison Herald Register Chicago today.  There you go. The paper that ended up tomorrow. The San Francisco Examiner.  I've killed lots of. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The examiner is still around, but it's like a tabloid give away. It's not a newspaper.  Facebook's monthly active users. Oh, I always like this number.  This isn't a number that has anything to do with profit.  Well, I guess maybe it does. One point eight six billion.  Monthly active users.  That's a 17 percent year over year growth.  Daily active users.  Remember when we made a big deal that they had a billion users?  Oh, huge daily active users.  One point two, three billion daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like a seventh of the world's population every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ridiculous. I need a better color if I'm going to highlight this.  Let's make this bright red and super bold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just need a bigger pen. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yo, it's toys. Yo, now I know.  Now I know. Educational.  User activity on Facebook's suite of apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can hardly read. Wait a minute. Let me erase it.  User activity on Facebook's suite of apps continues to grow.  Facebook owned messaging apps. WhatsApp and Messenger.  Both. More than a billion monthly active users each.  Instagram has not grown that much though, right?  Six hundred million was what they had last year, I thought.  That's Instagram.  Well, they're in a race against Snapchat.  Right. If they could just hold their own, that's good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they want younger people, right?  Do they care?  Well, everybody wants younger people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking for Leo and me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want me either. I'm Gen X. I mean, nobody wants Gen X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think Gen X is better than Millennials.  No, no, everyone loves the Millennials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're so fabulous.  Jeff and I were baby boomers. We used to be like that.  Oh, you guys are ruining the planet.  It's all our fault.  We used to be the ones everybody wanted.  Used to be all about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one ever wanted me in Gen X.  We're just sandwiched in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the dazed and confused generation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Enough of Facebook.  How about Alphabet?  Alphabet.  Google reported mixed earnings for its fourth quarter.  Alphabet's other... Well, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry's looking mature now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Larry's thinking, where's Sergey?  Where did he go?  Is he at the airport again?  What's going on?  That is definitely a far-distance stare.  He's thinking about something.  He's puzzling.  Always is.  I wonder how my island's doing and when I can go there.  Yeah, please, please, Larry, build the island.  We're moving. I'm buying the condo on the island right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I go to the island?  Wouldn't that be interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that what Peter... Was it Peter Thiel?  They want a sea step.  I wouldn't live in Teal land, but I'd live in Larry land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry land?  Is it different?  100 years from now, it'll be like water world,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and we'll all just be in different floating continents?  Seriously, if Larry built a floating country,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would move in a flash.  I'd move.  If Peter built a floating country?  No.  No.  Wouldn't move.  Who else would you accept as your technology dictator?  Not Zuckerberg.  Bill Gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill Gross is magnificent.  Bill Gross is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My roommate in Davos, Bill was the best.  I know. That's why I have three.  You know what? Paul Graham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  I know. People think... I know, but I think Paul's very smart.  And I know Teal is also Y Combinator Board and all that,  but I really think Paul Graham is pretty sharp.  I think Reid Hoffman.  Reid Hoffman.  He's a thoughtful fellow.  Very smart.  Yeah.  Would you live in Andreessenland?  No. Andreessen's a bullet-shaped nutball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't very nice of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said bad things about me too.  I do like...  Really?  I do like Reid Hastings of Netflix.  No, he'd be fine.  I'd go to his island.  The entertainment, we could chill the whole time.  How about Bezosville?  I'd go to Bezosville.  I'd go to Bezosville.  I'd go to Bezosville.  I'd go to Bezosville.  I'd go to Bezosville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about Bezosville?  Bezosophia?  Bezosistan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be Bezosistan.  So the question is, are you willing to give up  a lot of personal freedom to be a winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Just sounded like the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Winning is overrated in that context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're sick of winning, right?  Aren't we tired of winning?  He said we'd be tired of winning.  I'm tired of winning.  No, I want to win.  I don't think I've ever been on the winning side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, wait a second.  When did that last happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You come from that generation where everybody's a winner.  You all get participation trophies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never got a participation trophy.  Also, my mom let me fail on a regular basis,  so I would learn something.  It was cruel.  That sounds mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like you got a little something,  some little anger.  Something brewing there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you live in Muscopia?  Who's that?  Elon Muskopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Elon Muskopia.  Yes.  Elon Muskopia.  Where we'd all drive in tunnels under the ground.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be good for the planet overall.  I like Elon.  Unless it's on Mars.  If it's on Mars, I don't want to live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it might be on Mars.  You might have to get that.  Well, that's easy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bill Gates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's trying really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's proven to be.  This raises the topic I think we've talked about before,  which this lack of empathy issue.  Like these, like many of these guys are very smart.  And.  Padmashree Voyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would live on her island.  Who's that?  She was the former CIO of Cisco, no CTO of Cisco.  And now she's the CEO at some electric car company.  I'm bringing out a woman because honestly.  That's good.  Well, that's necessary.  I'd rather live on an island that's governed by a woman.  Me too.  I think it's time to give matriarchy a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sheryl Sandberg?  Because patriarchy is not working out so good.  You know, Sheryl has some empathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, not going to do it.  No, no, no, not going to live in Shenbergistan.  I think the whole country would lean, but I think it'd be a nice place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'd all be leaning in.  The whole thing would be leaning in.  But I think it'd be.  No, I think she's I think she's got a heart.  She has a heart and she's willing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The nice thing about a lot of female leaders is they're willing to say,  oh, you know what?  She acknowledges the flaws and lean in now.  And she's willing to let her life experiences shape her in a way that not  everybody lets their life experience shape them.  I think men like to be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think she would be an empathetic leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But empathy.  So that was what I was going to say is that some of these guys are analytic and very smart.  Everyone we've mentioned is very smart, very analytic, very talented.  The trains would run on time, let's say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But perhaps not not not an Elon.  Bill and the Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill, the trains would be persistently late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes, because he's always late for his presentation.  He's late for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes.  Yeah. So why?  So that's why I like him.  That's what I want.  I want somewhere where you manana.  That's why I'm moving to Latin America.  It's all relaxed.  It's all tomorrow.  Whatever.  It'll be fine.  Just relax.  Enjoy life.  Oh, the uncolla.  Anyway, Alphabets, other bets.  So Alphabets, other bets would be all the little alphabet companies besides Google.  Two hundred sixty two million in revenue.  That's like nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They. Yeah, that's their that's their hobbies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it is a job.  It was 150 million a year ago.  Companies losses shrank from one point two billion to about one point one billion.  So when I say revenue, I'm not talking profit because they lost money.  So basically, these are not revenue generating projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought their Alphabets operating loss.  Oh, that's an operating loss, not a net loss.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is accounting stuff.  Nest, you know, are they going to hold on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Stacey, let me stop right there.  Nest isn't making any inroads.  It was me.  Are they going to hold on to this?  Are they going to kill it?  Are they going to get rid of it like Motorola?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  I think some of the technologies that Ness brought in, they're still investing in.  If they're going to be like, yeah, let's make a lot more thermostats and a lot more cameras.  I don't know if we should look for more new products out there.  I don't know if they're going to sell it because they still have that three point two billion dollar price tag.  They've got to figure out how to recoup the investment on that down yet.  No, it's not been written down.  Not I don't know.  No, I would have noticed if they wrote that down.  Yeah.  So they're still holding out, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But sorry, sorry, I interrupted you, Leo.  You were going through the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's still he's still puzzling out accounting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just so complicated at trying to.  Here's here's revenue.  Google is the blue.  And if you look really closely, the other bets are the red.  OK, yes.  So the other bets include Access, Google Fiber, Calico.  Is that their life extension thing?  Calico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verily is life extension.  Calico.  Isn't that the contact lens?  Calico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on.  Nest, Google Ventures, Google Capital and the X research and development stuff.  So you could see other bets don't does what irrelevant to the overall ageing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Calico is aging.  Life extension.  Verily might be the contact lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gosh, I might have it wrong.  Verily.  I'm bad.  Thou hast it wrong.  Verily is life sciences.  OK, Verily is also.  Both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both of them.  Now I should remember who's doing the contact lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a see, that's the problem is none of this stuff is a productized.  Right.  It's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they even mention the cars?  What should we call it?  Waymo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waymo.  Yeah, no.  Oh, Verily was the contact lens, but it doesn't really exist.  It was just somebody's bright idea.  So there we go.  So that's the other bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's look at Google earnings.  There it is.  Google and Novartis won't be testing the smart contact lens after all, says that story in  Fortune magazine.  Whatever happened to Fortune?  After Stacey left, I stopped.  I stopped.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stopped.  Whatever happened to Fortune?  After Stacey left, I stopped reading it.  No.  Actually, you know what?  Matthew Ingram's been writing.  Matthew Ingram's still there.  He's been writing some great stuff of late and Fortune.  And he's really, his beat has broadened a lot.  He's writing about life and politics and all sorts of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He writes about media and politics is a huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it's a big part of media, isn't it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  I'm trying to find the Google earnings, broken out Google, Google earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So just Google, Google business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is way too broken out.  I can't.  This is like EPS cons surprise.  Looks like they did not.  They failed to meet expectations.  It was a negative 31 cents per share.  Revs, 26.04 billion in Rev.  Maybe I can get the details.  Let's look at the details.  I don't like it.  I don't know.  This is why I can't invest money.  Oh my gosh.  Here's this is, this is three months ending December 31st, 2016.  That would be the current quarter.  26 billion in revenue, increase in revenue year over year, 22%.  Nice.  Already accepted accounting practices, operating income, 6 billion operating margin, 25%.  Now Apple's to contrast operating margin is like 40%, but you know, hardware always a  little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Is that operating to operating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it gap to non-gap?  I don't know.  You're asking me that.  Are you asking me that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  No, I wasn't.  I was asking if it was operating or net.  So just revenue and net income.  That's where you should just focus for.  Yes.  Revenue and net income.  So not operating, just net income.  Because that'll take out all the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Operating will screw you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  EBITDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  EBITDA.  So I don't know what the answer to your question.  No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next time I'm going to look ahead.  Would you please read the...  I will grab my Google mix.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can, sounds like you can read a balance sheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can.  I took the chartered financial analyst exam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What you did is for me to be a better reporter.  Yes.  Good.  Google.  Effective tax rate.  Okay.  So I always look at that.  I don't know why.  Mainly because I get jealous.  Because as normal people, our tax rate, 30, 40, 50 percent.  Apple's 26 percent.  Google's 22 percent.  They paid 22 percent.  And you know why that is?  Because they're offshoring all their profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I did an interview on what might be the last episode of .NYC.  That's another story.  What?  We ran out of our grant money.  And so I got to figure out what to do.  We'll have that discussion.  I think we finally got our act together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw that.  I thought it was the first episode of something.  It was your new Kickstarter program.  Are you going to keep doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this was the same thing.  But I interviewed the chief legal officer.  I hope we can keep going, but I've got to raise money to do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Grant had a limited time.  So I interviewed Mikhail Rosen, who's the chief legal officer at Kickstarter.  And she is the one who did the conversion of Kickstarter to a public benefit corporation.  Good.  And really, really interesting.  If you look up .NYC, you can see it yesterday.  She's fascinating.  It's just 25 minutes.  That sounds great.  I'll watch.  But in a CPB, you know, you list the things that you're going to hold to.  And one of them is that they'll pay their fair share of taxes and they won't go through  various tax shelters like this.  And that that's a way that they're warning their shareholders that we ain't going to  minimize taxes and thus maximize profit through that direction.  Interesting.  Because the problem is, if you are a regular corporation and you have fiduciary  responsibility to your shareholders, the reason I defend the Google's, Amazon's,  Facebook's, Starbucks and such is that they they do have to minimize their taxes to  maximize their profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although there's can be you can make an argument that maximizing your profit is not  the only thing that you have a fiduciary to do a duty fiduciary duty to do for your  shareholders. You can actually that that's been there's there's some really interesting  writings about this in business schools now in the last couple of years about  what what constitutes fiduciary duty because I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well agree with you. But what happens when you have an activist shareholder coming  after you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's why this is so fascinating is that that's becoming part of like  the legal theory. So, you know, it and you could get economists to say,  yeah, you know, you should take into factor externalities like legal costs.  Do you have a fiduciary duty as a big company not to pollute the river your your workers  all come in from or the ground underneath where your workers live?  I don't know. So, OK, sorry.  Total segue or total side thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go on, Jeff. We call those a rat hole.  We used to have a rat hole jingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Merlin Mann recorded a rat hole jingle for us.  We did so many rat holes on Mac.  We have that. No, it's on Mac break weekly.  Oh, it's my week. Rat hole.  So what do we think? I mean, it was, you know, I looked at Facebook's results and it  was like good, good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do we think about Google's?  Google's gotten. I mean, the question is, how long does Facebook have before it?  It looks like it's the law of numbers.  Yeah. Yeah. It's growing like crazy.  It may have a long way to go. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Google's older. It's kind of in a more mature environment.  So it's not going to grow as fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. How can you grow at that rate forever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You cannot. You will like this.  Google's app.  Is now twice as prevalent in Google News.  So if you so if you want to if you want to be showing up in the Google News,  you better app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to be critical of ampere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This to me, this is a point against it.  But go ahead. You know, this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, yes, exactly. For two reasons, two reasons.  I'm probably one is that that you can't be kind of  maumout into having an app because you're going to show up in Google.  That's a conflict. And I agree with you, Leo, on that.  And the second is they haven't solved the URL problem.  When I get links from Nuzle, it's like that to an app page.  It's Google dot com slash.  That's supposed to be like, you know, just just a CDN.  It's not supposed to be the domain.  And they haven't fixed that. And that's a that's a problem for media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to recapitulate for those who haven't been around for the AMP wars over the  last year, AMP is a Google technology that they say is designed to speed up  mobile web page loading by eliminating a lot of stuff, including ugly ad tech,  most JavaScript.  They they cache a lot of content.  And as a result, AMP pages pop right up on mobile.  They're really, really fast.  But you have to do it this now.  AMP, to be fair, an AMP page looks fine.  You know, it doesn't require, you know, to you an AMP player.  You publishers don't have to use AMP or they can use AMP and it doesn't harm them  with normal non-AMP sites.  But my fear always was that because it goes, it's kind of Google says it's open,  but really Google runs all the caches and and does all and is the one that  approves all the JavaScript, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with some input  from other we've had Richard Gingras, head of Google News, who is a big AMP  proponent on the show. And we debated all this.  But this is a scary point.  In the last three days, Google has flipped a switch and AMP content on  January 26, last Thursday, a week ago, was about 30 percent of the Google news  results yesterday.  No, I'm sorry, Sunday.  A few days later, 70 percent.  So they flipped a switch and are now highly prioritizing AMP pages, which puts  even more pressure on publishers to support the AMP standard.  There are competing standards, right?  Facebook has its.  Is that still around?  Oh, yeah, it's in articles.  Lots of articles. Yeah, absolutely.  I just I think Google's.  Goals are laudable, but I worry a little bit that it's a little bit of a grab of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  web standards by I don't think that was the goal.  I think they are sincere when they say that they're they're defending open  standards, but they've got to they've got to get there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You could end it.  And as Bleak is pointing out in the chat room, you don't have to use Google's  caching. You can cache it yourself.  You can run your own app server if you want.  But still, Google Google approves what JavaScript's allowed, etc., etc.  And as as may deals with advertisers like Outbrain and Taboola, as well as Google  AdSense to work with AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And once you so I think I sent you this back in November, but a friend of mine  wrote this blog about it's called Gamp.  Gamp. Google's AMP is a gilded cage.  Yes. And he basically talked about how once he installed it, all his pages went to  write a certain place.  And then now when he decided to uninstall it, he was hosed.  Right. And the link stopped working.  Yeah. Yeah. And that was that was kind of a challenge.  I was like, oh, that's like Hotel California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. You can check out AWS.  Can't leave. Yeah.  Well, anyway, the good.  So that's a bad data point.  There's several bad day points.  But the good news is I don't think AMP has really chewed up the world or anything.  I mean, I see plenty of non-AMP pages all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the same argument that the telcos make about, you know, zero rating

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and chewed up the world yet.  Hey, by the way, data point we talked to, we debated last week, the new chairman of  the FCC, Ajit Pai and his long term goals.  Well, one of your predictions came true this week.  Ajit Pai silently canceled the requirement that cable companies offer third  party set top boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate it when I'm right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to give myself a little pat on the back.  I think I also said that last week that that's probably what this is going to mean.  That, yes.  Yeah.  I hate it when you're right.  We're both right.  We'll see what happens with that neutrality.  But that's, I think that's a very anti-consumer move, frankly.  I think consumers, consumers really would love to be able to run something besides  the junkie box the cable company rents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the cool thing is it was going to make, it was basically going to turn your  television screen into what is the internet because it would let people run apps and  search and like, it was going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Innovate.  Awesome.  And companies like Google and Apple and Roku were thrilled because.  In Amazon and Microsoft.  They could sell you set top boxes.  Yeah.  But the cable companies lobbied hard against this because they said, and to be,  we'll try to balance this a little bit.  They said, Hey, that is, that's our business is what we present to our customer.  Controlling what we present to our customer is how we make money and you  can't take that away from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's interesting there is it feels, and the parallels are not all exact, but  Carter phone and AT&T is kind of where it feels like for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carter phone was a famous, I think it was a Supreme court.  Was it?  No, maybe it was.  It was.  Carter phone was Supreme court.  I believe.  Carter.  It allowed third party equipment to be used on AT&T lines.  AT&T wanted to require you to buy those old Western electric hard rubber phones.  And the Supreme court ruled that that, that, that AT&T's contention that it would  be bad for service if we allowed third party devices, untested third party  devices on our, on our lines, the Supreme court said no and opened up for competition.  And you could see what a difference that's made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.  The FCC made a decision.  Did it go all the way to the court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  That was definitely a court case.  Do do do.  Oh, it's 40, 40 years ago.  What's the date?  Oh, okay.  That's an old story.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is a, this says this is only saying it's a FCC decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But was it Carter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Carter took AT&T in general telephone to federal court in 1966.  The court of appeals for fifth circuit agreed they would decide the suit, but  the FCC at that point ruled.  And I guess that means,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh, this just says it's a landmark regulatory decision.  That means the FCC made the decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  That's right.  They, and, uh, effectively making the court case irrelevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ta-da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Very nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facts.  Facts.  Wikipedia.  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Anyway, we're not going to see a Carter phone with cable companies.  No Carter for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, you do have Roku and you know, people are bypassing it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the bottom line is it's just one more nail in the coffin for the cable  companies.  Uh, they probably didn't see it that way, but it's just one more reason for  people to cut the cord, get rid of that $7 a month or whatever it is, rental  fee and that crappy box and do their own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the cable guys know this is coming, but like any good business, they're  like, well, how long can we milk this?  What else, what else can we add to these fees that people pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I can't blame them for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I could blame the FCC for not ruling, you know, the FCC had approved  this, but it was rolled back by Ajit Pai.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wait, is the super goal, is the super goal?  It's this week.  Is it going to be, it's this week.  Is it going to be on cable or is it streamed or what's the deal there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're Verizon customer, you can watch it.  Verizon has an exclusive with the NFL.  Fios?  No, no, on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, like I want to watch the super bowl on my phone or tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you could, you could cast it to the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you cast it from their apps?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on Verizon.  I don't know.  Uh,  I don't have a Verizon as one might know.  I don't have a Verizon phone.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a Verizon phone.  I'm not watching the super bowl, but I am interested in the puppy bowl on  animal planet, so that I would like also to have that be streamed.  My, my daughter is team fluff and I am team rough for this year's puppy bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, it reminds me of the puppy bowl, the U S media.  You ever, I was thinking about this.  The master of the segue.  I was thinking about this in the shower this morning.  If you've ever watched five year olds play soccer, right?  They just chase the ball.  They don't, there's no strategy.  It's just like a blob around the ball all the time.  And I'm thinking that the U S media these days is like that, that all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  present Trump has to do is tweet.  Nearly as cute though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just have to tweet or whatever.  And suddenly the story's over there and they all run over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  So this is something I have thought about a lot, partially because I  write about things that many people are not interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are more puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's, I do think that I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The challenge for media is there are people who sound the alarm and say  things and write stories, but if they don't get picked up by some ineffable  and I'm not talking about going viral.  I'm just talking about it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause it, cause ultimately the news media covers everything.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just, what do people notice at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I'm thinking, I mean, I think that the, the, the predominantly though,  the networks and the cable news networks kind of drive the agenda.  Right?  So what they're covering, it doesn't matter if, you know, some blog  somewhere is covering it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's my thought.  I mean, that's the tough thing.  Like I, okay.  So here's a super techie example.  I was writing about the peering debates in, in actually doing real reporting on  that, like about a year and a half before other people were in.  It was too complicated for real people.  Oh God.  It was so complicated.  Every story was a thousand words just to like explain it.  Although after, after doing that, I could like, like 30 minutes, I could  churn out like a thousand words explaining to your metaphors.  Go, go.  And then tiny little bit of news on top.  But that was a story that had like legit interest and impact.  Yes, it was complicated, but even things like broadband rural access or digital  divide, that was a big story and I had been writing about it forever.  And then I think it was the wall street journal picked up on it and they had  those kids like unable to get their, their homework assignments.  So they were working at McDonald's, which was a great lead that I did not have.  Um, data caps were another one that I'm like, it's just not ready until it's ready.  I don't know.  I don't know how else to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the reason I'm in course, um, I'm not, we're not going to get political,  but the reason I was thinking about it is I was thinking how with the  nomination of Gorsuch, New York, or such as our Supreme court, uh, next Supreme  court justice to take Scalia's seat.  Um, all of us, like a bunch of five-year-olds, that's going to be the story  for the next six months or three months or however long it takes.  And meanwhile, Russian hacking conflicts of interest.  None of that is any is on the map anymore.  And, uh, if one were a savvy media person, one could manipulate  the media pretty effectively.  Yes, one could.  Because they're like five-year-olds playing soccer or puppies in the,  actually puppies in the puppy ball are not a good example because they're  not, they don't even know about the ball.  They're scratching their ears.  They're looking around ball.  You don't need a ball in the puppy bowl.  You just put puppies in a cage or a whatever arena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it comes back to our business model of chasing clicks.  There was an op-ed this last week though, that said that a CNN should be  broken off and it should go for not for profit.  And it's a journalist having, um, a fear of profitability and capitalism,  uh, which I think is kind of ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there is a, there is a case to be made that since the Time Warner  AT&T merger is up in front of government regulation and CNN is owned by Time  Warner, that there might be some subtle pressure on CNN to tow the line until  that merger is approved, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Though you know who is, is, is feuding with CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So, so that's the point is CNN better shape up or we're not, you're  not going to get your merger.  So there is a point to be made that for-profit media may have vulnerabilities  that nonprofit media doesn't, but what is nonprofit ProPublica, right?  There isn't a lot.  Mother Jones is nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't say, you can't say public broadcasting is because, uh, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  being held ransom right now with the endowment, National Endowment for the Arts  and the uh, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, all those who say in Europe, you know, you should have a BBC.  I said, imagine a BBC under the present regime.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Right.  No.  Voices of America is going to start playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we need to, I guess what it is that people need to support journalism.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, I've talked to a couple of journalists, um, cause they're  friends of mine at various publications and it's actually a little disturbing  because there are some who say that their publishers are cracking down on  their columns.  There's a couple who've had headlines changed or stories rejiggered to be  less antagonistic towards the current.  I see that happening.  And it, well, me too.  It is happening.  Right.  And that's actually, I'm very curious because I've never actually worked  in a very political area in a giga ohm.  Our focus was, you know, the consumer comes first.  That was always like how we wrote all that was our point.  I know.  What a mistake.  No, it's good.  At fortune, I had one headline changed, but I could kind of understand  where they were coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um, I think that's, that's all Malik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The consumer first.  Yes.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, that's when you, and that's what you need.  You need a leader who hold, who says this is the, this is our value.  These are our values.  And this is, these are the values we're going to adhere to regardless of clickbait.  But you, but you might do it at your peril from a business point of view.  I don't know.  Anyway, I, I, this is, I'm just not, that's not political.  That's a, that's media commentary.  Okay.  But file under media commentary, let's take a break and then we're going to  talk about fun things like robots, robots, scary robots, robots, robots.  I have a robot.  Uh, I don't know.  I don't think we want to talk about Android because we've got this great show  the night before every Tuesday night with Jason Howell and, uh, Florence  Ion and Ron Richards called all about Android and they really cover it pretty  darn well, so I don't see anything really pressing.  I do want to do Stacy and you can help us with this more coverage of echo and it's  ilk, right?  I have a really good new echo skill that I'm going to share with you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, is it Starbucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better than Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Is it a hit workout?  Because I really want a high intensity workout skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some very good ones on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Haven't you found Google home has a new one too.  That's very nice.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy wants to work out for seven minutes a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I did the seven minute workout.  That's not exciting.  Um, I want like a 25 minute hit workout.  Okay.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, we'll find one for you.  The chat room.  There's your assignment.  Please.  Please.  Um, and, and God is un-  verified at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the Amazon echo is available in the UK chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good news, but not all the skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nah, I don't know about that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show today brought to actually by a very cute little robot.  I met the other day named Curry and Curry is just the cutest darn thing about knee  high.  I really, I'm starting to think that the, the, the whole premise behind Curry and,  and, and how I understand Curry is that this will be your first robot.  Like your kids 20 years from now will say, Oh yeah.  I remember when we got a robot.  It was so cute.  Curry is a kids love Curry.  I've seen kids interact with Curry.  Curry is a just a couple of feet high.  Uh, he or she, I don't know.  I'm saying she, cause she looks like Rosie from the Jetsons a little bit.  Kind of, I thought you said it was a he.  They say in the copy that it's a he, but then I asked him when I went down and I  said, I really feel like calling it a herd.  They say, well, we just, whatever you get to do, you get to choose Curry though.  And they did some really interesting things.  In fact, they have a t-shirt that they have two t-shirts, one that says Curry  does and one that says Curry doesn't because they very consciously decided to  not make Curry look humanoid exactly.  You know, no limbs.  It doesn't walk.  It rolls around.  It doesn't have a voice.  Now it can read to you and sing and make music, but it doesn't talk to you.  It has distinct chirps for yes and no.  It shakes its head.  It's eyes follow you around.  There's a wonderful idle mode where Curry will just join it, just stand there  while you're talking and she'll just look at whoever's talking and then look at  the, it's so cute.  Pretty soon you feel like there's a person.  This is a person.  And it's so, I think this is the kid's first experience of Curry.  Now that Curry does do some very useful things.  For instance, you can have Curry come and wake you up in the morning, start  playing your favorite newscast or podcast.  Have it start this week in Google.  And then you could say, Curry, follow me.  And then as you go about your morning routine, you go cook the bacon and eggs,  go, go get on the treadmill, whatever.  It'll follow, she'll follow you around and continue to read to you.  She does not fall downstairs.  She's smart enough not to do that.  In fact, she's mapped the whole house and you can name the kitchen, the living  room, so you can say, Curry, go to the kitchen, Curry, go to the living room.  See what the dog's doing.  Curry has in her right eye there.  She has a very good camera, which you pair with your phone so you  can see what she's seeing.  If there is a loud noise in the house, she'll go investigate and send  you images.  Hmm.  She, she recognizes you, different people.  She recognizes different sounds.  Uh, you can always see the saved videos and photos Curry has taken.  So you could see what happened earlier today.  But I think part of it is just that she's really cute.  And it's like, I'm telling you, your kids will say, yeah, we had our first  robot, you know, and round about, uh, you know, 2017, I remember when we got her.  Now Curry's not out yet.  But you can go to the Curry's website.  Hey, curry, H E Y K U R I.com and put down a refundable deposit for a pre-order.  If you want no, no commitment, just a hundred dollar refundable deposit.  Uh, Curry will be 5 99 remaining at time of shipment.  That's excluding tax and shipping.  And they think it'll be later this year, maybe September, October.  I know, uh, Curry was at CES.  Many of you saw create CES and I know that they say he, but you can,  you can call her she, if you want.  I'm I after meeting Korean, spending some time with her, a, I fell in love.  I mean, it's just, but B I really think it's a girl.  Maybe that's because I fell in love with her.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you shouldn't anthropomorphize your robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at her.  She's get her eyes blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She looks around, you pat her on the head and she looks up at you and she does.  She has a heart light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  She's a heart light that glows can glow different colors.  Uh, she's very surprisingly communicated, but I think it's interesting  that decided not to make her too humanoid because that would be a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of like the latest Boston dynamics robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Now you know what I'm talking about.  Now, you know, if you want to know more and pre-order, go to HeyCurry.com  H E Y K U R I.com Curry is from Mayfield robotics and they're really neat guys.  Really smart.  I want to know what your cats are going to do.  What my cat would do with that.  Um, they've tested it with pets and the pets seem to like it.  Or really?  Yeah.  And, and you can actually, it's kind of, you can talk to your pet.  So there's, uh, it's interesting.  I think the pet really, I'll tell you what we had, we just lost our dog, you know,  a couple of weeks ago, it was very sad and the house seemed really kind of dead and  quiet and I, what it was missing was that presence and Curry's kind of like that.  I mean, I know she doesn't replace Ozzy, but well, except that she kind of, in  some ways does, cause it's not like you're not alone.  Like there's a presence in the house and she wanders around.  She, she, she interacts with the house.  Uh, she, if you say so, yeah, but she also can just patrol or wander or just wander.  And she has a little charger.  She'll walk up to the charger when she gets low and charge yourself.  It's kind of sweet.  I don't know.  And it's easier than a dog in some ways.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, and, uh, no robot mess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, I didn't mean to bring up Ozzy.  I'm sad now, but Heycurry.com H E Y K U R I.com.  We have really, we're going to get one as soon as we can.  I just, we'll have one in the studio to wander around, which will be kind of funny.  She can get over all the wires.  I asked him about the wires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can you, uh, API into the camera?  Yeah.  You can broadcast Curry's Curry view.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is she going to do in the studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever she wants.  Okay.  I, you know, I don't know.  We'll think, you know, you could maybe just be the Curry view.  The Curry view.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now, one thing she's not going to do is do this.  I am scared to death of the new Boston, Boston dynamics.  So we've seen their dogs, the robotic dog that walks and we've seen the, um, so  this leaked out the other day.  Uh, this is Boston dynamics.  This was at an investor's presentation and somebody pulled out a camera  phone and took pictures of it.  There's the humanoid and you could see, these are kind of creepy.  These walking and there's a reason why the dogs and the, and the humanoid shapes  cause they can get over terrain that a wheeled vehicle can't, but at the  presentation, they said, there's no reason we can't have robots with wheels.  And they showed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It is the, it is like the combination of that, that feels and it's probably faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's super fast.  Oh God.  That's so scary.  It can run lots faster than you can.  Keep watching.  Cause it can also jump over obstacles.  Um, and this is by the way, this is autonomous.  This is not remote controlled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a figure skating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a, this is a company Google briefly owned.  I think that they just divested of it because, um, what, cause of the  defense contracts and Google didn't want to, I can't remember the D but they did.  Cause it's evil.  Cause it's maybe because I think they realized that this probably wouldn't be a  good thing for watch this.  Look how fast this thing goes.  This can whizz along, jump over things.  Wow.  Oh, this is your worst nightmare.  Anyway, thank you to the investor who, uh, I don't know what this slide means  approach harmony, computer robot, physical world, and it's double  lot headed lines between each.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's making me nervous.  They call it handle because it can handle things, you know, physically pick up things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big dog.  That's the scary one.  Big dogs is scary one.  Oh, Boston dynamics is still a wholly owned subsidiary of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought they were going to divest.  Oh good.  I guess.  Hey, we were speculating.  We mentioned last week that Hugo Barra had left Xiaomi and we just missed the news.  We just missed shortly after we left the air.  We found out he's joining Facebook as VP of VR and there's a VR look at Hugo and  Mark.  That's not creepy at all.  Sitting in the Facebook headquarters.  Uh, so that was right after we got off the air, they announced that Hugo Barra,  who everybody loved.  He was a great demo guy for Android.  Yeah.  Uh, we just, uh, he's just, he's a great guy.  And I think this is a smart move on Google's part to get somebody to be the  face, not Palmer lucky to see face of Oculus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody would you, would you live on his Island?  Really?  That's the question we should be asking.  I would not live on Palmer lucky's Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not, Hugo Barra's Island.  Yes, I would.  It'd be great.  They'd be top of.  So I keep on getting every single media company I talk to says the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, VR, just, uh, and I say, well, I don't know, Google and Facebook are  investing a hell of a lot in this media.  People say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google and Facebook, the NBA is going to do a VR or 360 degree game of the week.  Every week you can watch it with your Google cardboard, your gear VR or your  Google daydream.  Next game is February 7th trailblazers at Mavericks.  Uh, so remember 3d.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, there was a lot of investment.  I don't know if there was this much investment, but I don't think the  market was as frothy either then.  So, and it may be that we just haven't hit a tipping point and we're about to.  So I'm not, but I gotta say VR to me still has yet to be compelling in a way that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  I am completely in agreement with you, Stacey.  And I am equally oppositely bullish about augmented reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there was some augmented reality news.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh,  so VR you're sealed into a visor and you can't see anything.  And I think there's some merit to say like a VR basketball game.  They're going to be NFL highlights in the Superbowl and in virtual reality as  well for Google cardboard or daydream.  Um, I think there's a lot to be said for that.  Football games are really good example.  When you watch a football game, you're forced to watch whatever perspective or  view the director gives you, but many of the time, well, that's one of the reasons  I like to go to a football game in person.  If I could only just get as close as the cameras do, because many of the time  you'd like to see what the backfield's doing while the quarterback has the ball  or, you know, how are they defending it?  And you don't get the chance to because the director, so the ability to  look around is great.  So I think there's some uses for 360 degree video, maybe more so than virtual  reality gamers like VR, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Um, snap that's snap is doing, um, the information is reporting that snap is  doing augmented reality on it's kind of advancing its spectacles technology to  add augmented reality, which I thought was kind of, oh, cause I have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  spectacle so I could turn my existing spectacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't think you can turn your existing spectacles.  I'm trying to get into the story, but you know, I bought a subscription to the  information and by golly, I have literally never been able to use it.  I should probably email them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Call Jessica.  I can, I'll cause I use it.  I bought it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it too.  I just, I just work my way around it.  Cause my subscription doesn't work even though I've subscribed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can read, you can read it on my screen.  Actually, Carson doesn't have my login, so he's only seeing the short version.  Snap is working on smarter lenses.  Uh, oh, so this will replace the existing ones.  They bought a company called C image that does augmented reality.  So, and you know, they're going to go public within the next month.  So they're going to have a lot of cash to lay out on something like this.  And I get, I would guess that given the threat that Instagram's starting to be  that they're going to, they're going to want to step it up in a way augmented  reality is nothing new to Snapchat.  I mean, all of those faces and stuff.  That's, that's augmented reality.  Right.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  You could put filters over people in real life and what happened?  Hangouts took all of that ability away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stupid.  The youngs, they like that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that stuff.  It's the funnest thing.  Snap has already released ad products that incorporate  scannable snap only QR codes.  Snap to unlock ads, let people scan a QR code, which unlocks hidden  features like a lens or a video.  Oh, that's cool.  Kind of cool.  That's, this is some of the new stuff out of snap labs.  I, I, uh, I like Snapchat.  I don't know if their monetization strategy is working as well as say  Facebook's, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a pretty high bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or Instagram, Instagram, you get an ad every 10th image.  Okay.  I was going to say.  Snapchat, like the discover page has become a garbage page.  Right.  And so I, I wonder, yeah, I know they're banning the kind of link  baity, uh, you know, images.  Cause what happened is they changed it from just dots, which obviously  wasn't a super engaging feature.  So now the discover tab is images.  It's like a little magazine, like a Pinterest or something, but for a  while these images and they're okay.  Here's one is being a nudist good for your health.  And there's a half naked.  Right.  So that's, you know, and somebody had link bait where it was like a woman  in a bikini and the story was about a guy.  I mean, it's like, so they've, I think that Snapchat has toned this down.  Are you a Gigi or a Kendall?  Hmm.  So, but, and I suppose this works with the youngins, but, uh, meet America's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are you a Gigi or a Kindle could be a legit story could be a legit quiz or an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  excuse just to have more pictures of Gigi and Kendall on the other hand, I  think sending it as a messaging, but it's harder to monetize this stuff.  I mean, one way they do it is with, uh, with, uh, monetizing lenses, right?  You have, you know, w w here, let me do a world of Warcraft lens  or something like that, right?  So that, that, uh, that's an ad.  Let's see if they have any paid lenses here.  I like the Easter bunny one.  That's good.  You can't really see it.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are the sorts of things I do with my 10 year old and I am fun.  But how do you monetize 10 year olds?  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that Club Penguin is shutting down by the way.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  That was like the story of the decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, Disney, when American girl shut down, my daughter was beside herself.  Wait, American girl shut down?  No, no, no, no, no.  They, they had a, sorry.  Look at Stacy.  No, no, don't worry, Stacy.  Don't worry.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Look at Stacy.  What about me?  No, they, they, they had a, they had a special, a safe club for girls there.  They had a, they had a social space.  Okay.  Yeah.  And they shut it down.  And so, so, you know, this, we actually talked about this on the show at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Club Penguin was huge.  Wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.  But they're replacing it with something that's mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, well, Club Penguin's now becoming like a mobile app or something.  Did Disney buy it?  Disney bought Club Penguin.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, and so if they're shutting it down, it will be to replace it with, you know,  mobile makes sense, right?  Why, here's the problem.  And it's a big problem.  If you're under, if you're 13 or under, right?  You don't have the smart phone.  The, uh, COPPA prevents companies from gathering information about you.  And that's obviously who Club Penguin is aimed at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was, that was always an issue for them.  That's an issue.  You know, Disney understands COPPA, COPPA, however you say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've, they're just discontinuing the virtual reality world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, it's not a...  So the question to me is if a, if a child has a membership in this thing and feels  associated with it, are they losing that?  Yeah.  Or is it carry over into this new thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says waddle on.  We've decided to discontinue the current Club Penguin game on desktop  and mobile on March 29th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that's when you start a community, you have a, you have some  obligation to that community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tell Google that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially kids.  Tell kids.  Okay.  But, but, you know what?  I agree.  15 year olds who were excited five years ago when the Club Penguin was happening,  they're probably not checking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yes, that's true, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't, maybe they have it.  Oh, I got bigger problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're right.  Cause it says here Club Penguin Island coming to mobile March 2017.  So you could just, just go mobile with it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, how many kids, I mean, my child is in fifth grade, so she's 10.  She doesn't have a smartphone.  Um, she might get one next year.  It's unclear.  I don't think so.  Like, that's a really good point, Stacey.  Yeah.  So, and she can only have my phone on certain occasions, not in their, their  few and far between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And somebody in the chat room says, Leek says, why would they close Club Penguin  before opening the alternative?  Wouldn't you want to kind of run them simultaneously for a little bit?  Transfer people over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Create a transition for them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As of today, God's page has been unverified by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had trouble understanding this one a little bit.  I put it up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They verified God?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was too good a headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, uh, God, God was taking sides, uh, in the, in the Trump, Trump, uh,  wouldn't you think God would do that?  Trump Muslim debate.  God had an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If God didn't stop Hitler, he's not going to stop Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But God can at least complain, can he or she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not even going here.  So you can order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now I can order Starbucks from my Echo.  Is that right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, you have to have the Starbucks app and then you basically tell the Echo,  you say, Hey, Echo, order me a venti grande, whatever flavor or size rather.  Um, and you, it will actually handle things like a, I don't know, half calf  soy latte, you know, with macchiato or I'm trying to think of the most  obnoxious Starbucks orders, but I don't order them, so I don't know.  Anyway, the point is Starbucks was having an issue because everybody  was using its mobile app, which was good, except they would go to Starbucks  and they'd be like, they put their order in and then they'd wait at the  counter to pick it up.  And so it moved its line backlog all the way to the counter.  Plus they still had the people who were coming in line and people were getting  kind of pissy because they have to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excuse me.  I've already ordered on my Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say, so it's not common in Austin for people to really do this, but when I  was in San Francisco, I was just like floored.  I was like, nobody, like, I looked in and I'm like, the line was super short.  So I was like, sweet.  You know, there was like one person.  So I'm like, all right, I'm getting a coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll be with you in half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  I ordered my coffee and then like 14 people came and walked in and picked up  their coffees or went in your room to pick up their coffees.  And I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what that's like, Stacey?  You know what that's like?  I can empathize with you because that's what happens in Chipotle.  Take your at the head of the line and then they've got a, they got, they got a,  they got a list like that in front of you that they got to make instead of you  who's standing right there staring at the black beans.  Oh, not fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still like the idea.  So I can order it.  I can get in the car, go get it and be here all in one swell foop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you can get a coffee pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to give you another Alexis.  I mean, echo, sorry.  Echo school.  I should just name it computer, right?  That would never set it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, so that was my challenge to Kevin, but he didn't do it this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to rename his echo to a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause he was complaining like it would be terrible.  So was it bad for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, no, it's funny because he's in my office and I was doing the tech guy show.  So I probably said the word a few times.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think you have to say it like more like intentionally computer.  So what you need to do is go to your app, the echo app and enable a skill  called Ditty, D I T T Y.  Have you seen this?  Oh, I read about this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want this, but keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you, then you, you turn on Ditty and you say, uh, anything you want  and Ditty will turn it into a song.  They have fast songs, slow songs and football.  Here's an example.  And by the way, after it makes a song, it says, okay, you want me to share that?  And I said, yes.  And they just put it right up on Twitter.  So now I can tweet songs.  Oh, God help us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Leo's Twitter, he's gone from hating it to actually  actively making Twitter even worse.  I'm polluting it.  Worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, don't you want to pollute the things you hate?  So here's my, this is, I did this for Lisa cause it was her birthday on Sunday.  Oh, you don't have my audio.  Thank goodness.  Karsten lose the plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It did that.  You thought Twitter couldn't get worse.  I await the moment when the president of the United States discovers this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.  You know what?  I want to create an alternate, uh, Diddy Trump or P Diddy Trump.  And I'll just take any of his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, can you take his existing tweet and make it into a song?  Can you just take it?  Do it.  You can do it.  Don't cut and paste, cut and paste one of his tweets.  Oh, you don't have to cut and paste it.  You do it verbally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shall I start doing that?  Make a new, make a new account.  Diddy Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Uh, let's take a, let's take a long tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, wait a minute.  Oh, somebody has to bring.  John is John around.  Bring me my, uh, my echo.  It's a, you have to unplug it.  It's under the desk and all that's in the corner.  And then we'll have to plug it in and it has to wake up.  So it's going to be a while before we can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I got, so just Nancy Pelosi and fake tears, Chuck Schumer held a rally.  I love it.  And then Mike didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would all be, that's all I needed.  I could probably do that much.  So what you do is you say, you know, ask Diddy or hell.  I can't remember what the trigger word is.  Hello Diddy, make a song Diddy something.  And then you say whatever you say next.  It just say it, you don't sing it or anything.  You say it then turns into a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or the failing New York times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a good one.  That'd be a nice song.  All right.  We're going to, uh, I'm having Curry get me my echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I thought that was cute.  I was like, aha, we have found a use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soon as Curry gets back with my echo.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to duct tape it to her head though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  She's not going to really be able to carry it.  Researchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, please.  While you're on skills.  I was going to say stick a tray in there that comes out, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I said that, or, you know, and they said, no, you know, we really don't  want to make it do anything too useful because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause a $700 robot shouldn't be too useful.  It shouldn't be too useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should.  It's just a companion robot.  I want to get, I want to see if I can get it on a plane with me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Get to buy a seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's my companion robot.  Oh no.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what you do is you get one of those jackets for it saying, no, no, no, no.  This is my therapy robot therapy robot.  So while you're on skills, I have one on there for the Google home,  which is really kind of neat.  Oh, let's hear it.  Look it up.  Uh, so you can tell the Google home.  I put my passport in the upper drawer.  In the upper drawer.  And then you can ask, remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is a good skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, it's like you listened in on the podcast this morning or you read  story about it, but yes, you guys mentioned it already.  We, we tried it.  Yes.  And it works.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't want to step on the Stacy on IOT podcast because that's a wonderful  show, but I would like to do more echo skills.  I think that's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  We can bring lots of echo skills.  I actually was thinking about doing an echo podcast.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that is, you want to do an echo podcast, do it here.  Can you plug it in?  We're going to see what we can do here.  We got my echo.  It takes a little while, as you know, to, to wake up and smell the roses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, uh, I put on there, there's new wooden and leather Google home covers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did see that leather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you want that?  Leather.  Uh, okay.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm driving the car that would be my daughter's car.  It has a plastic steering wheel and I'm telling you, I understand that why you  want a leather player.  Ooh, wood looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  So can I get that for my existing one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just a cover.  I have to say, I still, I have it.  I have a Google home sitting right next to my echo.  I still use echo more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, so what did I do the other day that I was like, Holy cow.  Google home is so much better.  Um, cause I talk to them on a regular basis.  Um, okay.  I'm not going to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, I mean, it's really good at, um, you know, asking it questions of  facts, the knowledge grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was, yeah, it was a search thing, but you can also have it play songs  that are actually like, instead of saying the exact name of the song, you can say,  Hey, play, you know, the theme song from that Kevin Bacon movie in the 80s.  And it'll play you footloose.  So I haven't tried that actually.  That may not work, but I have been equally general with it and it's,  it's like, Oh yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, all right.  Should I, let me, let me, let me try this here.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, sorry, I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  So what, what, what should the tweet be?  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Oh, give me a good one.  Should I, should I do the one with a, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, where's the dudes one?  I got to find the dudes one.  Oh, here we go.  Um, no, that's not good.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got one.  I got it.  Where am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just have it send in the feds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this is an app you can also get on a Google, on your Android or app store.  And so now, so now they've added a, that's pretty cool.  And echo command as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When did Mark Zuckerberg start wearing suits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he had to testify in Dallas, Texas.  Or when he meets Chinese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Cause there's a couple of pictures that aren't from him in Dallas wearing a suit.  And I was suddenly like, what happened?  So, oh, the CEO summit in Lima, Peru, he wore a suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Sorry.  Okay.  Hey computer, ask Diddy to make a fast song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't look like you have enabled the Diddy skill to enable.  Go to the skill store in the Alexa app and search for Diddy.  Do you have to enable it on every, I thought you could enable it on your account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have to enable it on every, uh, device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I have all my skills on the account, but maybe is this one on a different account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope not.  I certainly hope not.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you, did you tell it play Diddy or use Diddy to make a song or  whatever that's code words are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I did the right, uh, the right thing.  Phrase.  Phrase.  The phrase that pays.  Yeah.  Skills are, uh, maybe, maybe I, maybe some, maybe somebody in my home.  Now I'm thinking somebody in my home disabled it.  That's what I think happened.  Oh man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh,  Hey computer, ask Diddy to make a fast song.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What would you like me to sing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What should I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh,  the failing New York times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New York times has been wrong about me from the very beginning.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't really understand it.  Huh?  No, you can't.  Okay.  I'm trying to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So all songs in the public domain are just dude.  Okay.  I got another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Changes, make some changes.  I'm a change in music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I promise our administration will always have your back.  We will always be with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make some things like replay this Diddy, change the song, change the  message, save it, share it, or make a new Diddy.  What would you like me to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Change the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want a fast, slow, or a football song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Football song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you have to really choose your words carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, it's just a silly little skill it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast.  Would you like to say just Diddy, share it, or make some changes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cancel.  Sorry?  Can I help you with anything else?  No.  No.  Go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alexa's so rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was really polite.  But Comcast is now, you can use your Roku as a cable box replacement,  but you have to pay Comcast to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to rent my Roku from Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's only if you want to use it instead of your cable box, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the FCC made them do cable cards, but that's interesting.  So I can tell them, well, I'm going to do that and see what happens.  But would Roku make a very good cable box?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, oh, look at this.  This is my buddy.  I bet it is because it's a Scoopy Scoop.  Oh, it's not my buddy.  Okay.  Nevermind.  It's Variety's reporting this.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, Variety knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was thinking it was my buddy Yonko, but it's not my buddy Yonko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey computer, ask Diddy to make a slow song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you like me to sing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make America Great Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This skill is terrible.  It's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is why I did not like the skill.  And by the way, that's not a slow song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you like to save this Diddy, share it or make some changes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks for using Diddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She sounds so sad.  She sounded disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she did.  Sorry.  Okay.  So more details on the Roku box thing.  Do they say how much they're going to charge or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They will get, hold on, net charge of $7.45 a month.  Let's see.  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's such a rip off.  During the beta program, Xfinity TV users will not pay a fee to use the Roku app,  but they will level additional chart outlet charges for connected Roku devices  once the app is officially launched.  How do they justify that?  The operator's additional outlet service fees per set top box are $9.95 per month.  Customers using their own equipment, such as a TiVo, receive a $2.50 credit,  resulting in a net $7.45 per month.  That's what I pay for my TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a Comcast rep said the company is, quote, evaluating our additional outlet  policies, unquote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the good news.  The data that you use on the Roku does not count against your terabyte data cap.  Oh yeah.  That's such good news because they freaking need the data caps, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  We're already screwing you, so we're not going to screw you twice is what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say it's something awful.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, did you see, did you guys see that Americans are eating so much bacon  that reserves are at a 50 year low?  Bacon reserves.  Now, I'm not going to say that.  50 year low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bacon reserves.  Now there's, this is good news and bad news.  I mean, of course that's bad news, but the good news is we have bacon reserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like the maple syrup reserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bacon reserves.  There are maple syrup reserves too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Canadian, remember in Canada, how the maple syrup reserves were pilfered  a couple of years ago, it was like the great maple syrup ice.  Oh, that's right.  So here's what we should do.  We should start a breakfast ETF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So USA Today says, nation's bacon reserves hit a 50 year low as prices rise.  And they've even got video of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the list of problems facing the United States, a bacon shortage wasn't  supposed to be one of them.  And dramatic news.  According to the US Department of Agriculture, the inventory for frozen  pork, New York Times says, fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I put this from Fortune.  Which I felt was sort of trustworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the exactly the kind of story that always turns out to be wrong.  Always.  No, wait a minute.  I should go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50 year reserves being low commodities, like as a former finance  reporter, that felt like legit enough.  I wasn't saying we were running out of bacon.  I was just saying, reserves hit a low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've gone to the newspaper of record for bacon.  Ohio's country journal and the Ohio Agnet.  And this comes straight from the Ohio pork council.  So there in the month of December, the total pork inventories total 41 million  pounds at the end of the month.  It was down to 17.8 million pounds.  A decrease of 35.6 million pounds year over year.  Due to a supply and demand analysts expect a continued rise in pork belly prices.  Pork belly is what gives us bacon.  So now you know, when you hear about the commodities prices and all that pork  bellies, that's bacon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also an orange juice and like lots of other exciting commodities.  The world of commodities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I've never understood the good news.  This is from a rich Deaton president of the Ohio pork council.  While bacon may become more expensive for consumers, rest assured the pork  industry will not run out of supply.  Ohio farmers will continue to work hard to ensure consumers receive  the products they crave.  For more information, there's a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  baconshortage.com.  Is that that looks like fake news then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  baconshortage.com is blank.  It is.  It's blank.  There is no baconshortage.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is really, there's so much, so many questions here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think the Ohio's country journal on ag.net would, would pull our leg on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Let's just go look at pork belly prices.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello.  Chicago, Mark.  The end of December's frozen pork belly inventory, Mark, the lowest  on record since 1957.  Hello America.  Pork is going away.  No more bacon for mom and dad for breakfast.  Pork bellies at their lowest since 1957.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where we've been doing sending all our pork to Mexico.  Is that the problem?  We're going to bring the pork back from Mexico.  We're going to make sure we have a wall at the border to keep.  I don't want no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want no Mexican pork.  Actually, you know what?  The best pork is Danish Korean black pork, but you don't know why.  You don't want to know why it's black.  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's how they feed it.  Can't be.  Wait a minute.  Now we're getting to the meat of the matter.  Here it is.  This is from pork.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why isn't this?  Why isn't the Chicago Mercantile Exchange?  Why isn't there market online?  Why can I not find this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this is the UK pig meat index.  There it is.  Pork.  The UK pig meat index shows a increase in pig prices.  Kulsao prices flat, but wiener prices are going up.  I don't know.  I don't think that's what you think it is.  Wiener, as in W-E-A-N-E-R, is probably like, you know, wieners.  I don't know what it is.  That's enough of this.  That's enough of the meat news.  This week in meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Okay.  Okay.  So what else should we talk about?  Do you have another advertiser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no hope from advertisers.  Show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you read Nick Bilton's article in Vanity Fair about fake news is going to  get even scarier than you ever dreamed?  Can you give me the TLDR?  TLDR, very simple.  And it's something everybody knows.  And Nick's writing for a more mainstream audience than he typically does.  He's saying that new technologies like Adobe has a new audio program.  There's the Digital Emily Project, a study in which researchers created digital  actors that could be used in lieu of real people.  Adobe's program allows you to get voice samples and generate new voices.  This is a face-to-face real-time face capture and reenactment.  It's, remember Clutch Cargo?  Where they would have, you know, they would take a face and they'd cut out the  lips and then have the lips move on the face.  This is Digital Clutch Cargo watch.  This is George W.  Bush.  And you see, watch his mouth and watch the mouth of the actor.  Bush's mouth is completely reflecting the mouth of the actor almost imperceptibly.  It doesn't look like it's cut out lips, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you look at it carefully, this actor is captured.  This is this Bilton specializes in the, if it could happen, I'll  declare it's going to happen.  It's kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not something we got to worry about.  But I think there is a point to be made, which is we're making really good  progress at simulating video and audio and faking it.  I mean, I think if you, you could be easily fooled by this reenactment.  Watch, watch here.  We've had this song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have?  Yeah.  And Nick, God bless him.  Nick, Nick declared to the end of the civilized world when Robert  Scoble came into an IO men's room with Google Glass on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Nick is a little bit of the, you know, tech.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the man who told us we weren't going to have pens in the future, right?  We're not.  I'm still, I'm still looking for pork bellies on the Merck.  All I can find is lean hogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, well, and one of the things he raises is, uh, that clip that went viral, uh,  from the inauguration of, um, uh, president Trump looking back at his wife,  Melania, who flashes him a big smile.  And then when he turns away, uh, her face falls and he's, he points out, you know,  it's not known whether that was real or not.  It would be easy enough to fake it.  I think it'd be easy enough to debunk it because obviously it must've come from,  uh, pool.  The source video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, but he makes, but he makes a good point.  And, and since people, I think the real point is this technology exists.  It's not hard to use.  It may be, isn't perfect and an experts could certainly detect it,  but people who are willing and anxious to believe a story might find that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sufficient to convince them.  I was so, so back in the day when I was at the New York daily news, I remember  wowing the editor, showing them how you could do something with this thing  called Photoshop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There's nothing there anymore.  Yeah.  No, it's nothing new at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And experts, good news experts generally can detect Photoshop forgeries, I think.  Uh, Georgia Institute of technology has analyzed 66 million tweets and they now  believe they can identify words and phrases that lend credibility to Twitter  posts.  All right.  I'm going to growl again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another growly one.  Yeah.  I'm going to growl about this one.  Yeah.  It's, it's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so yeah, you put in, put in the word undeniable and people can't deny it or  eager and terrific again, highly credible.  Words indicating positive sentiment, but mocking the impracticality of events  such as ha grins or joking seen as less credible.  So we're hedge words, including certain level and suspects, you know, some people  say, like our program says, way down at the bottom.  Yeah.  Anyway, that's, uh, I think you're right.  I think that's another one like Nick Bilton story.  I love Nick, but, uh, yeah, it's not, it's nothing, nothing we didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think we didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you read the story about, uh, all the, all the Silicon Valley types who have  Heidi holes and are preparing for the end of the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could we not?  So you want some super fun stuff?  I did some reporting on an article about home security for the ultra rich.  And this story was reminiscent of that, except it had, I don't think I saw any  mention of the big time fear that came up again and again with every professional  high end security company, which was EMPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, we're dead meat if you get an EMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So all of like the ultimate in home security and your bunker mentality is  being prepared against an EMP.  And I can actually give you the names of several companies that  are able to do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So EMP, which is electromagnetic pulse is a side effect of a nuclear explosion.  It sends a pulse of high energy that doesn't harm humans, but breaks all electronics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And apparently you can do it without a nuclear explosion too.  So there's some EMP guns or that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you could do it with a certain, yeah.  It takes a lot of energy though.  That's why it's easier with a nuclear explosion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, as long as you're chucking everything might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so like for instance, this, this, this survival condo project in the former  Atlas missile silo, north of Wichita, your 15, your 15 stories of underground  condos would be impervious to EMP.  I think, I think it'd be sufficiently deep enough not to worry about EMP.  You got other problems because if you've got food, you've got stuff, you also  better have some weapons, some trained troops protecting you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a motorcycle.  I really thought that was awesome.  That in, in LASIK, LASIK in a motorcycle.  I was like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, uh, this is, uh, the LASIK comes from Steve and the motorcycles come from Steve  Huffman, who was the found, one of the founders and a great guy.  I really liked Steve.  Uh, one of the founders of Reddit.  He, I don't know.  This is reasonable.  It actually makes me think about doing LASIK.  He says, if the world ends and not even if the world ends, but if we have trouble  getting contacts or glasses is going to be a huge pain in the butt without them.  I'm screwed.  I'm editing for content.  Uh, so he got LASIK, he got surgery so he can see without his glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, that's, it's a compelling argument for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you have diabetes, you're going to be a problem.  If you have, uh, you know, a heart area, you're going to have a problem.  If you, you can list lots of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also says, I own a couple of motorcycles.  I have a bunch of guns and ammo food.  I figure with that, I can hold up in my house for some amount of time.  Is it weird?  Cause I've already thought through all of these scenarios in my head.  Is that what you think about this all the time?  Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  You're both weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that's it.  I think maybe it's a function of reading too much science fiction and also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  feeling a common trope in science fiction.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, so with global, sorry, climate change, um, and kind of the disparity  between rich and poor, it, it doesn't feel like our society's on the  verge of collapse exactly, but it does feel like, like I've very seriously  thought, you know, Austin, Texas is not where I should live, you know, as  the earth warms, I really should be.  Living up North somewhere and probably gardening.  Um, but I always break down when it comes to guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really do.  Well, that's the problem.  And this is where I break down the whole thing breaks down for me, which is if  you do stockpile stuff and you have prepared some sort of safe haven, you  have to have some massive security because people will try to get it.  So if you don't have guns and, and, and barbed razor wire and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-oh Leo's Leo's going over the edge.  Well, that's why I don't, it's like, no, I'm not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going down with the ship.  I'm going to be like the captain of the Titanic.  I'm waving as we go down because I don't want to do all that.  You have to be willing to defend it as every good science fiction  author will tell you, you can't, you can't just stockpile.  You have to be willing to defend it.  No, it's nutty.  Did I do this story last week?  I apologize if I did this last week.  Oh, I did it on Twitter on Sunday.  I did it on.  Oh, you didn't do it here.  You didn't do it here.  I've been doing it all week.  Somebody in the charms.  I've heard you talk about this all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is like, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And again, it's disaster mentality.  It's typical of children of alcoholics, actually, which I'm not.  But it's, but it's the, it's the, it's that.  And I'm sure Stacey's not either, but it's that it's the, it's like, do you think  that you're preparing in your mind?  The worst is going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So what other positive story we can end on?  Hey, how about the ACLU raising?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The origins of totalitarianism is out of stock.  Oh, you already mentioned that Jeff.  Yeah.  Hannah Aaron's guide on how, uh, how totalitarianism happens.  The ACLU had a big weekend, million dollars from Lyft over four years.  ACLU got enough money to join Y Combinator as a startup, which is weird.  I can't quite figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They raised $24 million and they want to know how to scale the  effectiveness of that lump of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you go to startup school, which Y Combinator is, uh, you can get mentored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I, I think this is interesting, although I don't have a sense of how  media savvy ACLU is, I do think there's a greater role for tech in kind of  the democratic process.  So we'll, we'll see.  And how cool would it be?  Actually, the ACLU was very active on Twitter when they were fighting the  executive order on Saturday night.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we've interviewed Ben Weisner, who's one of the, one of the guys at the ACLU.  In fact, he's going to be on this week in law on Friday.  He's great guy.  Carson's a roommate in college.  And, uh, I think ACLU is quite savvy, not media savvy in the sense that, you  know, they know how to be telegenic and go on the talk shows.  There's they're savvy in the sense of.  They know what court cases to fight and they know how to get the word out.  They're fighting them, which I think is exactly what you want.  Um, and the ACLU doesn't always fight for, you know, on the side of the angels.  They fight on the side of the constitution.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  Nuance.  We can't handle that.  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they've defended, haven't they defended like Nazis and other Neo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nazis and some of the ACLU doesn't decide what's right.  They decide what's legal.  They're protecting what's right.  They write the first one.  Yeah.  Well, they're doing what an AG should do, but I won't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, the six strikes copyright alert system is D O A, which we were all scared

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of it was going to ruin entertainment was going to ruin life and what killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  So this, the whole idea of this was, you know, in other countries, there've been  three strikes, uh, systems set up where if you are caught pirating content or  accused of pirating, not even caught accused of pirating content, three times,  you lose all internet access forever.  Not just with your current ISP, but you're blocked forever.  We didn't want to do that in the United States.  So the entertainment industry made a deal with a kind of a voluntary deal with  ISPs for a six strike system, which as you can see from the flow chart is fairly  complicated and that's just one strike.  But the idea is increasing penalties.  Uh, each time you get warned, it gets worse and worse.  This is about four years old.  It was responsible according to ours, Technica, uh, for sending  millions of notices to customers.  The problem of course is false positives and, uh, you know, there's no trial.  You're just accused and guilty at the same time.  Um, but, but really the real problem was it didn't, it didn't have any teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, it didn't curtail infringement and it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, nobody was kicked off the internet.  Uh, the first two strikes were for educational purposes.  Uh, upon a third and fourth notice, a subscriber was supposed to respond  and acknowledge it.  I did wrong.  On the fifth and sixth notices, you might have your speeds throttled and then the  plan leaves it up to the right soldiers if they want to sue, but nobody in the  content is going to sue anymore.  Cause that, that didn't work so well for the music industry.  So it just, you know, the, uh, the, uh, the statement after four years of  extensive consumer education and engagement, the copyright alert system  will conclude its work.  The program demonstrated that real progress is possible.  Not that it failed.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, it educated people who were infringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, the MPAA said they were a little more forthright.  It didn't curtail infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was a pain in the ass and probably expensive to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They, these are, this is a, uh, Stephen Fabrizio, executive vice president, uh,  and general counsel at the MPAA.  These repeat infringers are the ones who drive ongoing and  problematic peer to peer piracy.  In fact, an estimated 981 movies and TV shows were downloaded in the  U S last year using peer to peer.  Uh, and the program was not simply not set up to deal with a hardcore  repeat infringer problem.  In other words, they just figured out ways around it.  Like using your wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, like my wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like coming over to Stacy's.  Uh, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I've gotten now from Comcast two notices about using more than a  terabyte, but that's two notices stretched out over five months.  So 500 gigabytes, then 1400 gigabytes, then 500 gigabytes, then 1,200 gigabytes.  Then 500.  So I don't understand why it's going up and down like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, do you have a backup?  Automated backup runs every 45 days.  No.  I'm just trying to think of something that might continuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing.  There's nothing that happens every month or what, you know, every other  month or anything like that.  It's all continuous and we haven't changed our viewing habits.  I don't use BitTorrent.  I can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you, so this is actually where the, the Eero's fall down, which I  think Eero is a sponsor of the show.  So I know I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know, uh, what's he using?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's he using?  What?  Um, I used to have a router that would show me that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, okay.  I, I, I did too.  My ASUS, uh, AC 3,200 would do that, but I retired it for mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we should, we should call a good old Nick and be like, Nick, get on it.  Care everybody.  Nick.  No, Nick Weaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The CEO of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eero.  I bet you, uh, actually I bet you they are, I wouldn't be surprised because,  but that's a more complicated thing to do, but they do at least know  each device, right?  So they could theoretically monitor the bandwidth of each device.  I just don't know if they want to spend that horsepower to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Software development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  I think we should stop talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause good.  Cause I have to go to the bathroom and B I am starving.  Oh, oh, is it TMI Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you made anything?  What?  Oh, what kind?  Have you made anything?  That's usually where the crude ones, Stacey, not you.  Have you made anything in your new oven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  I had beef tenderloin the other night and it was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're, you think it's really worth the 1500 bucks that you spent on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I am so sold on this and you know what?  It's not me that thinks it's worthwhile necessarily.  It's the fact that my husband who is a total normal person thinks this is  worthwhile because he basically, my husband, I love him, but the man  loves his food cooked beyond all recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He must be a native.  He's, he's special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when he's making anything, I'm just like, like, take it out now.  Take it out now.  And he's like, no, no, you'll get sick.  You'll die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he's afraid of a trichinosis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's afraid of everything.  So do you like it rare?  Oh my gosh.  If it's like a piece of good meat.  Yes.  It should be rare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We show.  Run off together, Stacey, because I'm the same way and I'm surrounded by  people who want it well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so this is awesome.  So you're just like, boom, I want it rare.  You stick the temperature probe in.  Oh, then you can take your half out.  I take mine out and then his, I do that on the grill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You start eating or does yours get cold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put a little piece of foil.  I tent the foil over it so it stays warm.  It doesn't take that long.  I'm just concerned about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you actually want steak or whatever you're cooking to sit for a little bit  after you take it out.  Yes.  So what are you dying to make it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I, I think it recognizes and has recipes already for like 25, I think  precooked foods and I've made most of them.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, we should disclaimer.  They are an advertiser on your.  Sorry.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, they are an advertiser on my podcast, but I did buy the oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  She took the money.  They paid her for advertising and bought a June oven, which is kind of a net net

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  zero kind of, given that I gave them that $50 taken in ovens directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get, yeah, right.  Just save the middleman and just say, pay me in ovens.  I paid $50 for a deposit, but I can't bring myself to pay $1,500 for a toaster oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if it's not a toaster oven, it's a full scale oven.  I've made chickens in that.  I've made salmon.  I make roast vegetables.  Um, you know what?  I'm going to make a souffle cause those are freaking complicated.  You can't make a souffle in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what this reminds me of?  I'm old enough.  Leo and I are old enough to remember.  Sorry.  Leo and I are old enough to remember the introduction of the microwave oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Leo.  Yeah.  They called it a radar range.  Right.  Because it is radar to cook your food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there was the same exact discussion.  Oh, nobody's going to use that.  What a ridiculous thing.  Who needs a baked potato in four minutes?  Oh my God.  What is it going to do?  This is really stupid.  She stays, he's ahead of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, this is an oven.  This is a regular oven.  The difference is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not, so it's okay.  It is a convection oven.  It's a convection oven.  It has ceramic heating elements, which means it preheats.  It comes to like from zero to 400 in just like three minutes.  Okay.  So it's super fast.  That's handy right there.  No, my oven, my big ovens take like 10 to 15.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I use, I have a Breville convection toaster oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is your Breville.  Um, so the presets are awesome.  They're going to only get better.  So like if something doesn't work, you're like, oh, this didn't work for me.  And you tell it and it's like, okay, well, so they've already done  something with like the cookies.  They realized that they had tuned their oven for slice and bake cookies, but  people were putting homemade cookies in there and they were like, they come out  burnt and so they fixed it.  Um, you can make intelligence, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the intelligence.  That's what's interesting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so, I mean, again, I can't return it for after, for a hundred days.  So maybe I will.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you've got till March.  If you order it before like March 31st, you can re you can return it  after before a hundred days are up.  And who cooks more in your house, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I'm the cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Stacy and yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's both.  I'm the fancier cook.  So you could actually make something and leave it in the fridge and then just be  like, yo, Lisa, pop this in the oven at this time, and then you could have like.  Dinner waiting when you get home.  Yeah.  Oh, it's early for you though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nevermind.  Yeah.  That doesn't, that doesn't sell me.  I, you know, the other problem is I have a lot of, uh, I've, I in the, in my  past have spent a lot of money on stupid kitchen gadgets and we're running at a  counter space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you just got to get rid of the, sell the ones you don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, um.  What's the Stacy, what's the, what's the kitchen gadget that you most  regretted buying in life and Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were going to ask me like the one I like, which is my Vitamix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, um, I have a Vitamix too and I'll stand by on that one.  That's an awesome thing.  That's just a big ass blender, powerful blender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's the best blender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was an article in New York times about these new fast cookers.  And it's like the same thing.  People like crazy about their fast cookers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an Instapot.  Sorry.  I get very excited.  I will not buy an Instapot.  Oh, why not Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have, um, I have a pressure cooker.  I don't need another pressure cooker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a pressure cooker that makes yogurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A food processor actually is probably my least exciting thing.  And I don't own a KitchenAid mixer.  Those fancy KitchenAid mixer things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a KitchenAid mixer and I used it yesterday to make macaroons.  I use that.  That's what I use more than anything.  I can make pasta with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate baking.  I'm not a baker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, I'll tell you the gadget I wish I hadn't bought.  I'm trying to get rid of.  And I was, I interviewed Jenny Jardin and I'm a sucker.  See people tell me about this stuff.  I go, Oh, I got to get it.  And she's talking about homemade tortillas.  So I went on Amazon and I bought a tortilla press, not an automatic, a  manual tortilla press, and I have in my pantry, a 50 pound bag of corn.  That's been sitting there.  How long ago was that interview?  A year ago.  And, and, and another bag of lime.  Cause this doesn't seem like a good idea, but you use lime, you slake the corn  somehow and then the press.  And I have never made tortillas.  And so if anybody wants, I tried to palm it off the other day.  I'm one of our employees.  She wouldn't have any of it.  She says, yeah, I don't have much room in the kitchen.  Thanks anyway.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, tortilla press, George Foreman, girls, I have a panini grill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do have a panini grill.  Bought that, put that in the back.  That's way in the back of the cupboard now.  Gathering dust.  I got that from my son.  No, I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like R2D2 and actually I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm afraid of bread makers.  Cause I would make bread and eat it.  Slather it with butter and eat the whole damn loaf before anybody got home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but then you can make another one so easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't exactly what I was concerned about.  Now I'm trying to find my June email.  They sent me an email.  Is it June.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a June, June Oven maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  June Oven.com.  All right.  I'm going to just try to find that email because they said, Hey, you  never sent us the rest of the money.  Hey, yeah.  You want that oven?  You want that?  Come on.  You must want that oven.  Don't you?  It's your turn.  You can have it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really like this.  Even when it's not the presets, it's, but again, you know, I, it fits with our life.  I'll leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, here it is from Matt Van Horn.  Exciting times.  Matt writes June Ovens are now.  Don't show that.  That's got my token in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  If you want to see it in action, there's, there's a quarter court, the  village at Corte Madera.  Yes.  And it's just on the road a piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can actually go see it there.  They've got a pop-up showroom and you could probably, I bet they do  demonstrations.  June Oven pusher.  No, I'm just looking at it.  You asked me about it.  I didn't even bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  June Oven pusher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I swear she's a June Ovenist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, I, I am a convert.  I will be honest, but I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's interesting how people get really, uh, they proselytize for their new thing.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I process anything that makes my life easier.  I will proselytize about, I mean that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I have the most, I do have to buy it because apparently I put a  hundred dollars down on it.  Oh, I can't very well.  Just leave that on the table.  All right.  I just bought the June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you don't like it.  You can send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a hundred days to send it back.  Well, I had to buy it because he showed my offer code on the screen and I had to  buy it before somebody else got to it.  Took my a hundred dollars.  All right.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it work with Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just bought something exciting.  What'd you get?  But it was, it was only a hundred dollars.  Um, I bought a pine 64, uh, board.  It's a, it's a computer board and I bought a Z-Wave module and a wifi module  and I'm going to download open hab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are such a cool person.  Yeah.  I can't believe how cool you.  Shut up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She apparently, Alexa thought I was talking to her when I said, you're such a  cool person.  So you're going to make your own hop open hab device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to make my own open hab smart home hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So open hab is open hab the same.  What level is open hab at?  It's an open source.  It's not, it's not at the Z-Wave level.  It's a lower level than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's a, it's higher than that.  Higher than that.  So open hab is a application layer.  So you can use it to program your devices now.  So I pledged on my podcast to try this out finally, because so many people were  like, Stacy, you've got to see, you know, you've got to try this.  So I'm going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's vendor neutral, but it does ride on Z-Wave.  You said, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to, so I, yes, that I had to buy a Z-Wave module to talk to any of my  Z-Wave devices, if that makes sense.  Right.  Yep.  So that's, that's the way it could use Zigbee if you had Zigbee devices.  If I had a Zigbee module, yes.  Got it.  So that's, that's the physical, like the literal computer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is up at the application layer, not at the network layer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And open hab is on top of it.  It's a no.  I can't wait to hear about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be fun.  Why'd you choose that chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, but the Pine 64?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they have a friendly Z-Wave module and my friend, Kai Kruisner, who is the  guy who does most of the open hab stuff, promised that he had an SD card with all  of the open hab two flashed onto it.  Pine 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ready to run.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm like, boom, I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cause you could use a Raspberry Pi.  There are other devices you could use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you could use a Pi and this was like a way to make it slightly  easier for someone like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you get your order in before Chinese new year?  Um, no, you're not going to see it for a long time.  Not forever.  No, just a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.  I want to hear all about it.  So yeah, when the time comes, you guys, I will show you my smart home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've given you a lot of pics.  We probably shouldn't even bother doing pics of the week, but why not?  Uh, Jeff, you've got a number and then I'll let Stacey do her.  Well, let's see what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Uh, relevant to the earlier discussion.  Uh, 97% of voice apps are used for one week only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I, that's ditto right there.  Diddy one week.  Yeah.  One week.  Uh, is that voice apps like talking to people or skills?  It's echo and, uh, and Google home skills.  Yeah.  Uh, and with, you know, that makes sense though.  There are a few that I keep using.  Actually, mostly I just use the built in stuff.  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also have to remember it's hard enough when you have your phone, you  have a little reminder that does that.  Oh, I can use that.  But, but to remember that, oh, yeah.  Well, what'd I do use home for last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I do do as, uh, last week, Matthew Ingram mentioned 60 DB.  Um, which is kind of a, um, radio.  Yeah.  It's cool.  Stacey and IOT was on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, um, I was talking about a cheap pie when he's, uh, my friend, a friend of mine  that I used to work with at Giga own Liz Gaines is a reporter for 16.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did she, I was wondering if she moved over.  I hear her voice all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's her new job.  She's not a recode anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is her new job.  She, um, had a baby, did a fellowship and then did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Liz.  Uh, she's been on.  Which fellowship did she do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a really hard question and I can't answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is an excellent, uh, echo skill then you, you have to open that skill  and then you can say, um, computer, actually I turned her off computer.  Listen to 60 DB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  I can't find the answer.  And she'll have no idea what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have, we're, we're on it.  Some twit bits are on it.  It's they have short ones that, you know, five, 10 minutes, and then they have  longer shows and you pick the categories, but then it picks just kind of an endless.  Feed.  And this was Matthew Ingram's pick last week and I love it.  And so I'm still using that skill.  I like it.  And it's kind of like, it's just a mishmash of news and interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And short audio recordings is what she told me it was supposed to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost all podcast from podcasts, but she occasionally will come on and do a story.  Um, she and I did one.  Yeah.  And you did one.  Yeah.  So they're adding their own content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interviewed me.  So it was exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  She'll do her own content.  So they have, uh, get to know Neil Gorsuch.  Um, the Gorsuch announcement is seen from a reality TV producer.  So I guess she's doing interviews for them, which is great.  But then they have CBS news.  Here's like a twit bits.  Um, so I think this is great.  I like this wake up and smell the coffee robot.  Beyonce pregnant with twins.  See if I'd been listening, I would've known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm here for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're big pop culture news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your pick of the week, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, this is actually a podcast and I feel like I've never talked about it, but I love  it and your audience is probably going to appreciate it if they don't already know  about it, which I bet you guys do.  Um, this is, I always script the name of it though.  So, uh, it's the flash forward podcast and this is, it comes out, it used to come out  twice a month.  Now I think it's once a month.  Um, it's well produced.  They basically take a scenario from the near future and run with it.  So it can be something like robotic farming and they start every show with like.  They immerse you in the future world.  Right?  So you get this like, uh, it's just like a NPR podcast, except it's not real.  Um, and so is it like black mirror?  Kind of, but not always as grim.  Um, Jeff, you would like the future of news.  Uh, they, in December they did one in the future news and it started out with like  president Jim Bannon was eating Thanksgiving dinner with his family and Marina del Rey,  California.  And then the next was a different story.  It was like president Jim Bannon was in spend Thanksgiving in Iraq and people were  really upset and they went through several of those and you're like, Oh my God, what's  happening?  And then she breaks in with the future of news, you know, is fake and we won't know  how to tell the difference.  And then she brings in experts to talk about what this means.  So it's really engaging show.  It's awesome.  I love it.  Rose, Evelyn and she is just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no wonder it takes a month to do because that's a lot of work.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a very well, it's not like, it's not like the podcast we slapped together, Leo.  It's, it's, it's not like a trash we crank out.  This is actually produced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's, it's really good.  I like it a lot.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a, you can find it at flash forward podcast.  I have it on my screen.  Dot com.  Flash forward podcast.  Oh, someone asks if you allow promos for other podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It never even occurred to me.  No, we don't.  So I'm just going to edit this out and you'll never hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course we do.  I was like, it's just good content.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not competitive.  Well, I am competitive, but I'll, I'll, so can I also, I'm going to plug, I'm going to  plug this whole this against you for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.nyc we did the shows today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened?  We just did a show.  So Donna, we, we, I think we finally got this.  I'm going to send you and Lisa a note about this.  I think we finally figured out the structure of it.  I do an interview show and I do, we do kind of a shark tanky show, but nice because we  have no money.  And so today, as I said earlier, I interviewed the, was it yesterday?  If you go to, if you go to Facebook and look up dot nyc show, you'll find it there.  And so I interviewed, there she is.  And so I interviewed, there she is, Michal Rosen, who's the, the chief legal officer of  Kickstarter.  And then we had three Kickstarter products on one is Dame products, which makes  vibrators.  They were the first sex toy on Kickstarter and really kind of interesting how it was  done.  And then there's a bicycle that puts all the gears in some place so it doesn't ever  break and it's neat.  And then we had a guy who made a clock that only goes for one year.  And there are products that were successful on Kickstarter.  That's a good monetization strategy.  Isn't it?  We admit it.  It's only going to work for a year.  No, no, I don't mean, it only works for a year.  It takes a year to go around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  I thought, hey, that's great.  Hey, you know, here's your new June Oven.  Good news.  You won't have it in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have only so many Kelvins in your oven and then it goes away.  It's gone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry about clutter.  You won't have it in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway, so, so we are our city grant has run out and I think we finally, finally  have for many, many false tries.  And boy, I learned Leo and Lisa how hard it is to do podcasts and figure out what it  is. But I think we finally got there.  So now we don't need money.  So the question to the world is I'm going to go and write some letters to some rich  people in New York who are in technology who want to support this because it supports  New York technology.  It's a great idea.  I like should we do a Kickstarter campaign for the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patreon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patreon.  I agree.  Do you use Patreon?  I don't.  No.  You just do ads.  If you have to choose, if you're going to do ads, you really shouldn't do Patreon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And I find I don't want to ask my audience for money.  I'm really bad at asking even advertisers for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yep.  Don't I don't like I don't want to become like, you know, public radio where every  15 minutes you're doing pledge drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I have a backlog of South by Southwest tote bags from years of going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I could have tote bag for every donation.  Yeah.  Tote bag.  Get your tote bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can also give away Fez's, but you have a few of those.  Yeah.  Well, we give them to our hosts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I'm not taking Fez's from other podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not giving it away to anybody.  Okay.  I don't have a Fez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, you deserve a Fez and I don't know how we escaped Fez-ing you.  Well, because you weren't you weren't with us yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was probably old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This came out like it was last Christmas, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was.  But we'll get you.  We'll get you.  I think we might can find a Fez for you.  I'm okay with that.  If that's what I thought.  The truth comes out.  I didn't get a Fez, but I don't want a Fez.  So thanks anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what Stacey needs?  Stacey needs some like twit artwork for those walls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't like it when a sentence begins with that, do you?  You know what Stacey needs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have art, Jeff.  You just don't see it.  It's.  It's.  It's invisible art.  It's in front of me where I face.  Here, you want to see, you want to see my favorite picture?  You will like it.  Sure.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  This is exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  A little window into Stacey's life.  It is kind of barren from the view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Keep mum.  She's not so dumb.  Is that a, that's like a world war two propaganda poster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Isn't it awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  World war one, maybe.  And it's a, the idea is loose lips sink ships.  Don't talk in front of the ladies.  She's not as dumb as she looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was, I loved it.  I've got my Princess Leia resist art that's coming or that I'm  printing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're a little feminist womb in that room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Feminist womb.  Actually, that should be your podcast art.  I like that.  That should be podcast art.  Keep mum.  She's not so dumb.  That would be a great podcast album art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll work on that.  It's so related to the internet of things.  Well, we've got to do a new podcast.  Oh, okay.  Stacey knows things.  Stacey knows things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey ruins everything.  Stacey knows best.  All right.  It's time to say goodbye, everybody.  Ladies and gentlemen, and we are working, by the way, you'll be  relieved to know we are working on the punch Leo button.  I've, I've tasked our, I've tasked our crack engineering  staff with figuring out how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they want, they should email me and I'm happy to work  with them because I do want that button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an ultimate internet of things device.  Why?  I get one for Kevin.  Stacey can hit us both.  Yeah, no, we get one for me and Kevin.  I think Kevin Toffle probably needs one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, Kevin doesn't need a, Kevin is perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's, he's just like, Oh my, you're not her favorite co-host.  Leo, I'm sorry.  I know it hurts.  Oh, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's been with me for years.  Like, like almost a decade.  Holy moly.  I have to send him more bourbon.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You send him bourbon too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's, he's my co-host man.  He's okay.  Leo's like, see all you do is.
