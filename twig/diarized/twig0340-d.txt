Matthew Ingram  Who by the way is just getting better and better?  I'm serious. I have been you know I'll be reading a fortune article. I go. Oh this must be Matthew  I'm not kidding you have you have I think  More than ever you have found your voice and your niche the place you should be the stuff  You're writing about you have it sounds like you kind of can write about whatever you feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mmm more or less yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a senior writer there you focus on media and technology, so you're writing about the stuff that I read over and over again  But I just really enjoy your analysis and thanks. Please go on  Well well the most recent one we talked a lot about last week the author's guild is still wrong about Google's book scanning  It was just mm-hmm. It was  I'll use a readily word anodyne. It was  It just cuts through all of the grease and the fat a great word

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there's a there's so much $50 word yeah, it's a 50 well 48 99. It's there's a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Noise and stuff that makes it hard to kind of see right to the core of it and this  Boom you just you nailed it, and it's like thanks. What are you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Margaret that would about that on the show that we did why someone said  Are your ears burning your name came up, and yeah, I wasn't sure what it was about  Yeah, I can't remember this short twit, but absolutely great, and that one's been going on for so long  I remember writing about it. You know in 2005 is when it started. Yeah, Louise

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I thought you know Denny Chin  Was the judge was really  Exactly right, and we'll see what happens with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know actually what part of me actually wants it to go to the Supreme Court even though  I think it shouldn't like there's no there's no reason, but it but I would love to read  the Supreme Court just definitively saying  The things that Denny Chin said yeah, but the public benefits of this far away  You know any copyright concern, and then that's what copyright  That's the whole point of copyright in the first place and what the authors killed revenue stream for authors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what the authors guild is doing and is really taking it  Taking to the Supreme Court  Overfair use over with a definition of fair use which is great because we need more  Clarifications we definitely do yeah on what fair use is it's not a law  You know it's just kind of a doctrine and it we need more clarification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and there's the four factors and so every time you bring it up  Someone will say well, what's fair use and then you just have to go into this long-winded right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you can't just say oh well, it's this like trying to explain this encryption to people these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, all right. We got to do it. I know this is this week in Google, but the biggest story of the week  the day the week at the month and probably the year broke this morning and  It's it's a it's a blockbuster  Judge has ruled  That Apple must federal judge in Riverside, California  Help the government unlock and decrypt an iPhone this is in particular the iPhone 5c  used by the man who shot up the  Did the terrorist attack in San Bernardino?  Shut up the the party the welfare party office party  Apparently when the FBI  Searched his apartment they found his phone the phone is locked and as with all modern iPhones encrypted  United States Magistrate Sherry Pym  wrote Apple that Apple must provide the FBI with a custom firmware that  Would allow them to brute-force the passcode Apple's reason this is what she wrote Apple's reasonable technical assistance shall  This is a court order  Accomplish the following three important functions it will bypass or disable  The auto erase function whether or not it has been enabled  To it will enable the FBI to submit pass codes to the subject device see the problem right now with an iPhone is if you  Have a lock and a four-digit lock is all it is the modern iPhones are six  But I think a 5c probably a four-digit lock you have you can't enter the codes fast  There's a delay and if in some cases if it's it can be set up so that if you enter the wrong code ten times  The whole thing is erased the FBI quite rightly is saying oh  We're not going to try to crack this thing because we don't want it to be erased  So one she wants them to bypass the erase the auto erase  Two she wants them to allow it to you them to use software to try rapid fire all the codes there are if it's four digits  there are only ten thousand codes and  three  Ensure that when the FBI submits pass codes software running on the device will not purposely introduce any additional delay between attempts  Beyond what the hardware does in other words let them brute-force it  Beyond what the hardware does in other words let them brute-force it as quickly as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can I ask a few things here just just to for clarity first points of order  number one  unlocking the phone obviously is separate from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  De-encrypted the phone no no so here's the deal all iPhones are encrypted  And of course if they're encrypted you can't use them until they're decrypted the entering the passcode decrypts it  Does decrypted at from that point yes?  And let me so in other words if you were able to get somebody's phone grab it from their hands you'd be  After they enter the passcode you'd be able to use it and read everything as soon as they shut it off or  Press the just to turn off the screen button, then you need the passcode again. It has now been re-encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but all the data on the phone every time you turn it off is re-encrypted. Yeah, yeah, really yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Apple I mean I forget when exactly this happened  Maybe you know Leo, but Apple specifically did that Ios 8 so so that  Your so that no one could get into your phone including the government. Here's the problem Apple had a long

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  waiting list of law enforcement officials who are asking them to decrypt phones and at the time or  Unlocked I'm sorry not right decrypt unlock phones and at the time Apple had the technical means to do so  So they modified Ios with I believe it was Ios 8 I'm almost positive  So that it by default encrypted phones and Apple would no longer have the ability to decrypt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they didn't want to do it so then they can just say we don't have the key right whereas before they would have to say  Well, we don't want to do that and here's why now. It's just we can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well  Except right that they can because the judge has written this order, and I've seen a number of experts  I'm not qualified to weigh in on this, but I've seen a number of experts write  Pieces say yeah, they could do this and in fact Tim Cook implies that here's the message Tim Cook posted this morning on  Apple's site  The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers  We oppose this order which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand this moment calls for public discussion by the way  That's what we're going to do right now  And we want our customers and people around the country to understand what's at stake the need for encryption  I I'm I I'm gonna read the whole thing, but I'll try to jump around a little bit because I don't it's it's kind of long  Yeah, but the need for encryption smart phones led by iPhone and become an essential part of our lives  People store a lot of stuff on them including financial information health data all that information needs to be protected from hackers and criminals  Customers expect Apple and others to do everything in our power to protect their personal information  Compromising the security of our personal information to put our personal safety at risk. This is why encryption has becomes so important to all of us  We have even put the data out of our own reach out of Apple's reach because we believe the contents of iPhone are none of  Our business your iPhone not our business. Okay, that's good  The San Bernardino case we were shocked and outraged by the deadly act of terrorism in San Bernardino  We mourn the loss of life. We've worked to support the government. We have no sympathy for terrorists  When the FBI has requested data that's in our possession. We provided it  Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants  We've also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI  We've offered our best ideas and a number of investigative options at their disposal. We have great respect for the FBI, but now  The US government has asked us for something we simply do not have and something we continue consider too dangerous to create  That's an important phrase. That's that's the key of it all  We don't have it, but we could create it is what I'm how I'm reading that so effectively he's saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple would have to create a customized version of  iOS  That would allow the things that the court order specifically mentions and apparently could put it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And apparently could put it on retroactively on this 5c that's what puzzles me yeah, yeah, I don't get that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so then that what Apple's saying and I think what what security?  Experts are saying is once Apple creates that  It it's not like it will just get destroyed. It will live somewhere  Someone could get their hands on it that  ability could become  Available to others not just to the FBI and this is what Tim Cooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Says the FBI may use different words to describe this tool  But make no mistake building a version of iOS that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor  And while government may argue that its use would be limited to this case. There's no way to guarantee such control

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exist and that that that ladies and gentlemen is the key point, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am gonna say something you may surprise you I think Apple has to and must and should do this  If Apple has the means to decrypt that phone which they're I think admitting they do  Not only are they required to by law?  Ethically and morally they are they ought to do it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play I know you play devil's advocate in these cases  But I I don't think you're gonna want to go on the record forever of asking for a permanent back door to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not what's being asked for and that's I think disingenuous of Tim Cook to imply it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not decrypting though, right they're gonna set it up so that the FBI can brute force the password exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's with a valid court order  Now the question is  Does Apple keep cut by the way this puts us no in a no different situation than we were in just a year or two  ago with iOS  7 and previous to iOS 8  He puts us in exactly the same position and I would submit we were there's no greater

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Edward Snowden has told us that the meantime  Let me ask one more one more point of order your honor or chairman or whatever you do in Roberts rules of order  What is it they could want out of that phone anything that was done in terms of phone calls  There's a separate record of the phone company anything done in terms of texts and any communications  There are separate records elsewhere that they can subpoena elsewhere the  Light out now if they if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if he went around taking pictures of the crime scene ahead of time? Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  So what is that? What does that give them the case the people are dead?  It's right seven let me keep going for one more second one more second. So so you can get any communications elsewhere  If they sent encrypted email that is a separate act of encryption  Right, so that doesn't that this doesn't unlock that  without that private key  And  So what is it that they expect to get out of this?  So this is a very important precedent being set around technology and around the safety of our technologies  Especially knowing what we know now  Thank you  Edward Snowden about the NSA and DCHQ and what we know about China and Iran and other countries and so I would just suggest you weigh  Carefully the balance here to say that this is a huge and important precedent for what end the miscreants are dead  Are there others involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are others involved there is a man under arrest for providing them with the weapons  I think what is it they expect to get here? They expect to get evidence that would convict this fellow of selling  them with the weapons well, but that's the guy is facing trial for that and  They are quite reasonably saying the evidence may be on this phone and we would like access to this phone  Let me ask you this Jeff  Would you submit suggest that the that if with a due warrant police should not be allowed to search your premises even in a locked  box on your premises

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It with a do warrant fine  But if that that if that if the way they got into that lock box was a master key that could open any house in any  Box in any country

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just this case  It's that it's that Apple is being required to create a master key that could unlock any phone  Not just this phone and so and so it it's interesting ours technica mentioned in their piece, which is quite good that  Apple has received multiple requests very similar to this one  Like recently and it's probably gonna get more so it's not just this case  Whatever happens in this case is gonna create a precedent that that makes it easier for other security agencies to do the same thing  to other phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a couple of things first of all Apple has  Probably unwittingly revealed something that is kind of a shock to me  Which is that this process apparently can be reversed that they in fact have the capability of doing this  They're just in effect denying it to the government, but they have this capability or they haven't yet written the tool  But they know how to do it. That's quite surprising  Normally their defense has been we don't we can't do it. We don't know how to do it. There is no way to do it  That's not what they're saying they're saying they choose not to do it a no B. There is a legitimate court order  It's the job of a federal judge to weigh these matters not you or me  What it's a job of a federal judge and that's the Constitution of this country and the rule of law in this country is  That we let judges make this determination that law enforcement comes to them and says we this is your honor the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're pursuing and why is this reasonable search and seizure the judge has ruled that it is this is appealable as hell  Well, it's appealable and if it goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court agrees

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you then go along with it? Jeff that point? There is no choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but then then that's the country that I'm afraid that Donald Trump is friggin running. I disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that we have of course under the Bill of Rights  rights against unreasonable ceases search and seizure and those  Very specifically the Bill of Rights sets a sets a process for reasonable search and seizure  There is such a thing as reasonable search and seizure  It has to be the process there has to be probable cause and under those circumstances  There is currently a way to reasonably search your home reasonably search your stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Balance two coulds here. Okay one could that you said is there could be information on that phone that might involve  One trial balance Matthews could this could be used by  Authorities good and bad and powers good and bad to unlock every frigging iPhone in the world  Reasonable search and seizure I would call that an unreasonable search and seizure because the impact on society is worse than this one case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that needs to be discussed and adjudicated if it was just unlocking this phone. I think we would all agree  Yes, it's in the interest of of the courts and law enforcement and society in general to unlock this. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Well, let's start there. So you're you both agree that if we could just do it for this one phone and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did nothing else if there were if they didn't put it into the air some ability to do this  Otherwise you would be okay with it some data that let Apple say. Oh, yes, we happen to have  Their their their code in their own  And we'll will and we'll give you the you know, whatever data you asked for about that person that's open will give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my fear is the FBI or the NSA or whoever is gonna say to Apple  Can we just have that thing that you may know but that's that I've seen there's protections against that copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why we have judges. That's why we have the Bill of Rights

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there are protections against that but there's protections against all kinds of things that happen routinely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, I think we should take guns away from all police officers because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo Leo, here's the issue. So this is Matthew's boy fine. You've got your American judges and they're wonderful  We're exceptional and we're special we do nothing wrong  But once this capability exists, it will be the law of the land and China and Iran and Russia like that  That's the issue. This is worldwide. We can't act isolated that oh everything's okay here in the US  This case is fine here  If that capability exists every government that can will demand it under law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's unconscionable for a private company to decide on its own to defy  The legal system in this country and say no, we're not gonna do it. I think that's unconscionable  They're gonna win. I think they cannot be allowed within their within their rights and at some point if they were compelled

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't got they well, let's but let's say this is the discussion  We need is because of these are implications that should be brought up and the EFFs of the world and others of the world are  You know friends of the court like crazy smashing down the doors to say wait and  Understand the implications and the precedent of what you're doing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do want to separate from the conversation though is you know, a lot of this comes from this kind of mistrust of government  Because of Edward Snowden, I understand that  But that is not a league that's not a legal ground for for defying the law  That is  Mistrust of government to run this country then we have a much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got the inability of government to do wiretaps without warrants  It was because of exactly a case like this where where they they bugged a phone booth  Do we stop all warrants trust government? Should we stop all work limits? Shall we stop wiretaps? Oh, here's the limit  Well, we well the way the NSA is done you bet your bloody bit we show yes and  And we put limits on them and that was the problem with warrantless wiretapping that was done by the NSA was exactly that  New laws were passed of which we have no awareness in a secret court that did this this this all goes to the definition of reasonable  Leo reasonable is gonna be redefined and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's making the decision? We don't have access to FISA court rulings. We don't have access to what?  The criteria I  Should have this ability for every phone right and they convince Apple to give them the master key we will never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not insensitive to all of these  Allegations in the in the inappropriateness of the FISA court and we should fight the FISA court, but that's a separate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my opinion, they'll have this same tool then Leo  Defies the court can come and say ah now that exists  We will secretly ask for it for lots and lots and lots of phones and you'll never know it and therein lies the problem  It opens a penniless box

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It unlocks which we put it the encrypts Pandora's box. Apple has five days to respond and they haven't yet formally responded  They've written this public this open letter  I don't think that's the proper way to influence the judicial process. They're certainly  I'm sure they're doing things behind the scenes. This is a public country  It's exactly well, but I think this I think well would you disagree see this is the thing that worries me would you disagree if  It the Apple appeals and ends up in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rules the same way  Would you at that point then what would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll disagree to my heart's content, but when when Steve Cook says I'm not going to jail. I'll follow the law  I'll understand fully what he's doing. I'll just hate it. Right? That's that's what it is. Yes, but but  Knowing what we know now about how our government has behaved knowing what we know over now about secret courts  Thank you, Edward Snowden knowing what we know now about the differences in technology and the precedent could be set here because there isn't we're  Trying to make analogs to the real world  Oh, there's gonna be a single skeleton key that gets into every lock in the world now  Let me that's that's impractical. Let me give you let me give you now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me give you an additional fact and see what you say  Apple says the only reason we can do this is because it's an old phone. It's iOS 7  Worth is iOS 8 or 9. You could ask all you want. We couldn't we couldn't do it  Yeah, only reason we can do this is because it's iOS 7 now what they're saying. Yep  That is what they're saying. So that is the case. No Apple's not saying anything. That is the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see your that is the case. This is an iOS 7 phone Apple actually did say this in a filing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With the judge it's impossible to do this for iOS 8 or 9  But it can't but it only can do this because this is an old phone running iOS 7  That's only 10% of the current phones out there. Now, what do you say? So I guess all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  upgrade pretty quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These were dumb terrorists for damn sure my concern remains the the larger precedent that is set here that that if a capability  Opens up to ruin encryption. Can the government enforce us to do that?  That would concern me at any level

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Apple have any particular secret sauce here that the NSA and its geniuses don't have on their own or the CIA or the FBI  Or any of those places is what they're why they just asked this. What does Apple know that are they gonna just brute force it themselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it that they can do? Do we think Apple's Apple? So the court order specifically asks Apple to make it easier  For the FBI to brute force the password so explain that so to remove the restrictions to remove so if you type  The password or unlock code too quickly  Right you repeat it too many times you do it too quickly  So the order would remove would force Apple to remove those restrictions not to unlock it  Just to make it easier for the FBI to do it because if if they had to brute force it so to fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Years, okay  So then to play devil's advocate with the devil Leo for a second then  Apple's not de-encrypting the phone Apple is enabling them to do so right by just making it easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Apple software will de-encrypted there. It's it's allowing them to brute force the lock right? Yeah  And it is interesting that this would not apply to every phone. What if there were a lock box in your house that had a very  Strong and known to be very difficult to break lock  but the law enforcement needed to get in that lock box and  And subpoenaed the lockmaker  to help them  crack the lock  What would what would how would you feel about that?  Now they have a search warrant in the end they have the right to see this  Right to see this  It's locked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do we have any right to privacy? Can we go walking in the woods? I don't think that is the larger question truthfully

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's actually a very large question that worries me considerably  Which is that we have a rule of law now  I I think that it's very much complicated by the international points you brought up. Yes, and I  Table that momentarily, but I feel that we have a rule of law in this country  That is the probably one of the few things that distinguishes us from any other country or except Canada. I love Canada  No, many other Canada doesn't trust on many other countries  That rule of law is absolutely critical. I believe  To the success and survival of a nation. I've been in nations many of them where the rule of law is  corrupted or damaged I'll never forget going to Egypt and  the corruption that occurred in Egypt basically makes society crumble and  So I think it's so important that we not  that we not  disregard the value of living in a society ruled by laws and and  Very often the law does something that an individual doesn't like  Right. And in fact everything we're talking about here is it you know, you could say well  That's a violation of our constitutional rights to privacy  We don't have a constitutional right to privacy, but we have  implicit right  And so you could say, you know, the government is overreaching and we need to that's against the rule of law  I know I think you got to be very very careful about assailing the rule of law  That's the only thing that protects us from the government. No, I'm not assuming the rule of law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm saying what Apple's saying is there needs to be a full discussion about this and not just to answer this judge like that  We've got to go we've got to see this to the limits  This is a big deal  so at pardon me for the what I'm about to do at Davos I  Sat in on the panel on whether your brain will will declare you guilty and where we are and the ability the minority report  Pre-crime kind of yeah. Yeah, or post or post that your brain isn't encrypted  right, there's a precedent that goes even there that that that that  Is concerning and there is there is a question of I mean, no, we don't have a constitutional right to privacy  but we have is a constitutional right to know  unreasonable search and seizure and  unwarranted as well  And and we are we have to be wary. I think you're of setting precedence  Going forward for new realms of technology. That's why I you know, as I said, I agree do the skeleton key argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if Apple's it's here's let me Steve Gibson's in the chat room  We've had this conversation in fact, if you want to try to get Steve on the line, please do  We've had this conversation with Steve before Steve said something quite shocked me, which is that Apple and and actually I am now  Agreeing with him Apple should probably go back to the day when they could decrypt, you know, they didn't encrypt by default  Because of this that it should be searchable with a warrant in the way that your home is searchable with a warrant  Steve is saying and I I don't know what he's basing this on but he says  One Apple uses their secret code signing key to sign an update that will only operate with that one phone  To the op and I think this is actually technically exactly what would happen and  Certainly Steve would know better than I that to the updated iOS has weakened protections  They've weakened it which then allows brute forcing of the passcode and that's what the law enforcement is asking them to do and that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was for if it was just for that it is just for that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  now  What tick says is you've let the genie out of the bottle because we've now written the code to do that  We now have the capability so law enforcement is gonna keep coming to us with  Subpoenas and warrants saying you've got to do it with this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And China it will be it'll be in every phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be no by law. No, no, it won't cuz Apple has it no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll be required by law to put it in every phone. It will get out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple has to do it one Z to one one at a time  So that's not to say Chinese authorities won't send a phone to Apple and say decrypted. They that's what they used to do, by the way  So this is possible that it could only be done for that phone. Yes, I believe it would only be I believe that Steve is correct  That technically sounds and Steve has looked very much into the security of those phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then that would remove my main problem, which is that it would somehow  Become something that government can use at it at its will on any yet. Don't concert me yet Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't leave me alone here. Sorry  What will what about the international argument Matthew that that that once Apple has proven this capability and demonstrated that they will offer it then  China Iran Russia will all petition that and again and again and Apple and then Apple can just drag its feet and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what's been by the way. That's how it was pre iOS 8. That's exactly how it was  All the court is saying is let's go back. We just this is a pre iOS 8 phone  We ask you to do the same thing you do with used to do with those phones for this phone  For this phone Apple's already said and I think this is true that since I one of the reasons they did it and you know  It almost feels like a convenience argument Apple just didn't didn't want to they was a long line of law enforcement saying  Please decrypt this phone and Apple was doing it one by one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's also remember back to Yahoo and China where a man went to jail for a decade  Right because Yahoo had to follow the law of the land and hand over information about it and know yeah  Yahoo Apple doesn't want to be in that position  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is want to be in that position. I understand but you're doing business in that country

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why they don't want to set this president. But wait a minute America as the standard that's highly hypocritical

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To say I mean I tell people when they go to China people say well  How do I get around the Great Firewall of China?  I said you shouldn't you're a guest of the country you should adhere to the laws of the country just as I would expect  A Chinese citizen well, but that's the problem right Google and Yahoo want to make money in China  But they don't want to adhere to the laws of China

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well by you by that logic Leo by that logic Leo the nothing should be encrypted then encryption can be made illegal or you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do business in those countries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you just make it no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the theory I mean the theory for Google and and and Apple certainly for Google and I think Facebook is that  Being in that country helps you. Yeah, yeah push against those  I'm gonna work with the establishment to change  Well, and maybe maybe they should just pull up and not do any business in those countries, but that's that doesn't seem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Realistic it's not realistic because they're their profit-making entities. So there's a little hypocritical stuff going on here  Well, we don't want to follow the laws of the country, but we'd like to make the money of the country  I think that's a problem ethically  And I don't I think if the laws are wrong  Well, what if somebody let's say?  I  The Middle East comes the United States says, you know  I think the laws of the United States are wrong and I'm gonna do what I want to do and it might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Americans what if Apple is doing business in in Saudi Arabia and one of their employees, you know  Does something that requires them to be be headed in the public square is that should Apple just say? Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break cuz Steve Gibson is gonna is prepared to join us. I'm really thrilled to have that  that's great such a good conversation and  I'm really glad you got we got the smartest minds on  This right now and this is exactly I'm sure what Tim Cook intended with his open letter published this morning and  Absolutely Apple's gonna appeal it and if SCOTUS takes it  Then I'm sure we'll hear from that gets us into the other fight  That's why that's why that's so important by the way, isn't it?  But they should it should appeal it  To be tested it should be tested up to the highest court in the land and exactly and then if the highest court in the land rules  We have to we have agreed as a society and this is the only way our society can continue to adhere to that law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just got a little breaking news here, but we do the commercial first. Oh, all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I'm glad you were listening Steve

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had some time and I figured I'd put you guys on in the background  I always love listening to this week in Google. I'm great to be on with Jeff because I often concur with his

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of extreme except this except this case you're gonna say Steve

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know see Steve what I love about Steve is a great thinker and he's never he's never dogmatic about this stuff  So, what do you think first of all what you said in the chat room is that accurate Steve is that yeah what I wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To do was if nothing else we in order to have a discussion  We need to we need to know we need the right technology  base and then and then I think separate the policy from the technology because they're they're really  separate things so what we what we  Absolutely know and we've talked about this a number of times in the past and this has been true for quite a while  Is that?  individual  iOS updates are  Per phone. I remember clearly going over this at some point when that one podcast we did on when we I think  Actually, it was several podcasts where we really took apart Apple's current security model  and I think it was with iOS 7 it was the big white paper that they did then and  What I remember is that every phone is unique in  You know for whatever, you know, we'll call it a you know  it's got its own key or its own serial number and so in order for  an iOS update to be accepted it must be signed by Apple and  using Apple's secret code signing key for iOS and  Be per phone and and and this was an important security measure that prevents other  Older iOS's from being installed on a different phone  Which wouldn't create a downgrade attack on iOS and like and then allow  Things that have been previously fixed to reappear  So so there so Apple has a lot of control over what the phones get and I have also been following this story this morning  reading the the various back and forths and so as I understand it what  That what the court is ordering Apple to do is  to  Weaken the safeguards which are in place to prevent brute forcing  There's an 80 millisecond delay  And also some of this is from Matthew Green. He also posted about this  That where in oh in 14 two years ago  He took a strong look at this exactly this aspect of the iPhone and so the idea is they they they remove any  software imposed delay  Between guesses which they're able to remove in order to increase their the rate at which they can brute force and they disable  the ten hits or ten ten misses and the  The key gets wiped out thus  preventing the phone from being ever decrypted and so the idea is that  And there's something called the acronym is I think DR you I can't remember what it stands for but that is you a  DFU  It's the ability to update the phone through an attached USB connection  Which is one of the the routers best tricks  the and so the idea is that Apple would so the FBI would physically and would need to  physically prevent present the phone to Apple and  Say here's the phone. We need you to make it possible for us to brute force  So Apple would then modify  an iOS  Which it would sign for that phone and  then install in that phone and then the one other thing they're asking for is to have  electronic access to  Input passwords so that some poor, you know FBI intern isn't sitting there going zero zero zero zero  Zero zero zero one and so forth. So I think that's where we are  So but you know other than so in other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would not be kind of a global back door just be one phone this could just  However, it would be an admission that app by Apple that they have this technology  Although this is I suspect what they've been doing all along up to iOS 8

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Future phone have to physically be presented to them to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it has to be running an older version the operating system, right Steve? You can't do this  Retroactive firmware update on iOS 8. I don't think so  I don't know. I don't know either  But I believe that Apple's intent with iOS 8 was to prevent this from ever coming up  Well, the only reason according to ours Technica the reason this comes up now is because it's an iOS 7 phone. It's an older phone  Right. Let me this is thank you to gadget hog for providing a great quote  From a surprising source. This was a decision in 1987 by the US Supreme Court 6 to 3  in  ruling for  The police officers were who were legally searching an apartment for weapons  Remember they're looking for weapons  violated the Fourth Amendment the Bill of Rights Amendment that  Prevents unlawful search and seizure  unreasonable search and seizure  violated the Fourth Amendment when they slightly moved stereo equipment to check the serial numbers to see if they were stolen remember they were looking and  Search warrant said looking for weapons  But they ended up moving and and that was thrown out of court  Justice Antonin Scalia  Wrote in the opinion and it's a great quote  There's nothing new in the realization that the Constitution  Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all  And there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some systems that could qualify as a weapon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it really threw them at some it really is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know and this is about probable cause and about the Fourth Amendment  But it shows you that you first of all this was Justice Rehnquist Supreme Court and Scalia a staunch conservative who was thought to support Rehnquist  but it's interesting because  This is why the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court  They they did in fact constrain police powers in a search. You can't just kind of go on a fishing expedition  But that also encourages me that if if if the judge and ultimately if the Supreme Court says no  We want you to decrypt this phone that means there is good probable cause the police have presented a good probable cause  That there's something on that phone that will be of value  Jeff to say one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff D. S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think at this point that  Where we are in time given?  how far we are post Snowden and the Patriot Act and sort of feel that this general feeling that maybe there was  some some overreach that the country as a whole has learned a  it's lesson and that  Or do we just have to mistrust government and give them as little power as possible as?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As always Steve I expect the best questions from you and I won't have answers for you the way you have answers for us  I'm so delighted you're here. I'm so happy you're here  I I think a few things one is that  If you were sitting on the Supreme Court  What you what you have to do is not as you just said Steve you have to separate the technology from the policy and from  The law in this case and not worry about the limitations that happen to be on this particular phone on this particular  iOS you have to be saying that a  Ability was demanded of a technology company involving privacy and this and no matter what the technology is in the future  we can demand the same thing and  And when new technologies new capabilities new issues you get you get wildly fast computers that can brute force in different ways  You know what doesn't matter then so the fact that Apple put on things to protect all of us so that any garden variety  Crook and criminal and miscreant couldn't do our phones when asked to take that off under the nation's law whatever the nation is  That's what we have to be concerned about and we have to somehow rise to the level of principle here  I've said on the show a couple times that  the law around  Our protection of privacy and our in our mails was miswritten to a technology  It was written to the technology of the US Postal Service and a physical letter  The law should have been written to the principle to say that our private communications are presumed private unless  Sought under a lawful warrant yada yada yada  That's why our our mail is still protected, but our emails and our chats and our phones are not so the larger question  I need to ask first is what's the principle then you're right Steve the next question is  has the country learned given the lessons of Snowden and  and I think so and I think that the trust that we have in this country is  tarnished because of the NSA and GCHQ but that's kind of irrelevant in this case because I'm I worry about the lowest common denominator for an  International company like Apple and Google and Facebook  I have to worry about the lowest common denominator of freedom around the world because that's the one will live under henceforth  If China can do it, it doesn't matter whether the US law is better. It might as well happen here  and so we have to look at the precedent at a level of principle and  Internationally and that's hard, but I think that's I want to see that high and hard test as God help me agreeing with Scalia  You know, he has last laughs  that we liberals have to agree with him on that, but I think that that's the case I'm not a  Libertarian I keep on you know making clear. I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat full disclosure here  But yes, I think you're right Steve  Or I think your question is right that that we can't just hand over too much power in this realm to government  Especially when we know as Matthew was saying earlier that we have secret courts. We got to worry about that  What do you disagree though? I think the I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're you're over globalizing this  For instance if Apple demonstrates this capability and by the way as we now know  It's a very constrained capability that doesn't apply to 90% of the new phones and none of the new phones  It doesn't mean that all of a sudden you have to do whatever China says you still  You know, they would I think you could find  But it doesn't change the law of the land in the United States you still need a  Probable cause and due process to get that phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It changes the security of this technology and the trust in this technology around the world  Steve where do you stand?  This way or Steve

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I will well here's my question to you Steve we had talked a couple of weeks ago on a  Security now you said something very surprising which actually as I thought about it was very sensible  Which is that Apple should just go back to the way it used to be  Which is that encryption was not on by default?  Because it was using tech new technological capabilities to cause a  Problem with law enforcement. Do you still feel yeah, so the position I took was that was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have the technology  to  create in our phone  this a  Reasonably secure lock and  As I understand the Constitution far less well than Jeff does but you know as a citizen of the US  There's this notion that you know, my home is is my  Sanctuary and domain and I have a key to the front door and it is illegal for anyone to come in without my permission  except that  except in the case that the Constitution provides for there being reasonable suspicion and  You know so forth and so so  Where I came down on this I mean on like exactly where we are in the middle of this really interesting question  About you know given that we now have the technology for unbreakable encryption  Are we going to create exceptions to that and  We have exceptions that we've been living under where  duly authorized law enforcement can enter a  Facility if it has  If it has reasonable cause for doing so if a judge looking at the evidence says yes, we're going to  Give you access and so my point was there is a technical  There's not there's a technical way not a back door not a way that weakens anything  Which I which I described on the podcast which is every single phone has a has a unique  randomly generated  Key which Apple stores, so it's not an algorithm that can get loose  It's not something that China can discover. It's not something that can be reverse engineered  It is a there is no linkage between the phone and the key  except that they were they were created together and and Apple has a vault where they store it and  And that without weakening anyone's  Encryption anyone's phone in any way it does allow Apple to respond to an order  to make a specific one specific phone  unlockable and  and I and I and in in discussing this in subsequent weeks I added the  Additional criteria again, it's technology  We can make it work however we want to you could be designed so that Apple must physically have the phone and  have the  disassociated key

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which which together then allows the unlocking Steve is that is that true in seven and eight and beyond or just seven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I know I'm just making up a technology. Oh, I  Was what they could do. Yes, I was exploring the idea of  of giving Apple the ability to to safely respond to a  Court order and saying that you know as much as possible this mimics the existing  powers that the state has for for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Conducting searches and seizures and I think that's this I think that's the key  Steve is that we were talking before you came on about how one of the risks  we were afraid of and others are afraid of is that this  ability could basically escape into the wild and be used on any phone  So if it was restricted in some way so that it would only work on  This one phone and then the next time the FBI or somebody wanted to do it  They would have to get another order and then Apple would have to do it for another phone and would have to physically have it  Then that that sort of that would  Calm my fears to some extent about this master key escaping that would somehow be used by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Law enforcement or who knows who it's interesting because that's exactly how the debate is starting to take shape  you know Apple Tim Cook in his  Open letter said it was creating a back door. The White House has now issued a statement  Josh Ernest talking with reporters  Said it's important to recognize the government is not asking Apple to redesign its product or quote create a new back door to its products  This is about one phone and one case and a one-off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is asking Apple to take a  An action here that it built into the phone that we all bought we all bought with a presumption. This couldn't be done  No, there was a contract. No that 5c was sold before  This was possible Apple did not routinely encrypt. Let me explain. Let me explain  Okay, the the the notion that you can change the time delay on trying  Okay, we bought the phone in a contract that said this phone is equipped with this. I  Didn't even know that to be honest  Some people did  Let me let me ask this question at the principal level  Do you as a citizen have the right to encrypt your communications? Full stop simple question. Absolutely. Absolutely  Well, then then you've just violated kind of everything that you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's not what this argument is about if Apple has a means to decrypt it and the government demands that they do  So their Apple has no choice and you don't have the right to encrypt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do that encryption would be that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  GP no if I use PGP, which I do routinely and no one can decrypt it  That's that's done. It's there's not even a there's not even a question. There's no court ruling and no mandate no warrant  It can't be done  That's by the way why Apple changed iOS because they didn't want to be in the position to be able to do this  This is not about going forward or current iOS is this is about an old iOS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  10% of the actually wired wired says it was running iOS 9. Oh, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cuz ours technically ours says it's 7 it says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They think they can do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the thing I found interesting is Apple effectively admitting that they had the ability to do it  Which I was shocked to read or you surprised  I don't know what to say at this point  Maybe wired got it wrong. I don't know. I'd like to see the filing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's in the PDF. Okay, remember that there are sort of degrees of encryption  We've talked about for example iMessage where the way iMessage works is that?  Apple has a key server and when you send a message to someone else  Apple sends you that or or a group sends you the  the public keys which match each of the recipients of the of the message that you're sending and  The message is encrypted individually  Such that it can only be decrypted by the other person's private key  Which never which has never left their phone so in principle  Oh, that sounds wonderful that means that you know nobody can decrypt these messages except the recipient  except that Apple runs the key server and  Nothing prevents them from including an additional key  Which they have the private key to or the FBI has the private key to so so again it  We need to separate policy from technology, which is why I think this is you know such an interesting discussion and why?  2016 is gonna be such a fascinating year because we we have  something in encryption within math which is  Absolute and and there are I argue  ways to compromise  Such that we keep the strength we want while  while adding additional privileges if we choose to and  And so we have to decide now if we choose to and I mean just point is right  You know either we have a right to encrypt or we don't  or or  Maybe somewhere in between I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna wrap it up, and if you want to stick around Steve you're welcome to if you want to get going  I know your server is still down  He's been D. He's being D DOS'd he's being been D DOS'd for  Minutes of uptime between 10 45 and 11 this morning. Oh, that's probably cuz he went to school  First period is always bad for D DOS attacks, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take off it's been a pleasure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grc.com if you can get there yeah, I tried actually and it just said connect. Yeah, he's been D DOS 13 13 gigabit attack  massive  By the way Steve will be back and we will probably discuss something around these topics  He was the best on on Tuesday for a security now at right about this time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't find in the court order whether I can't find where it says iOS 9 yeah, so that's that's according to wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know ultimately though and and and we did not cover this as much as it deserved to get covered  And I really want to point people to the Harvard Berkman Center's  excellent  Excellent discussion of all of these topics that came out a few weeks ago  It's called don't panic if you google don't panic and Harvard or Berkman Center  You'll find the PDF making progress on the going dark debate and the people  Brought together for this were amazing the conveners were Matt Olson Bruce Schneier and Jonathan Zittrain all three  Really very well known in the security field and they brought together some of the best security people  To talk about it. It's hard to bottom line it because there's so much going on in here, but essentially  They said don't panic  First of all encryption is absolutely vital for national security as well as individual privacy  but law enforcement has plenty of other ways to  surveil you and in fact with the advent of the Internet of Things and  And widespread internet access. There's no issue that government has more information than ever about bad actors  And so it's not unreasonable to say let's preserve  The privacy we've had and and we have and of course  This all and they even call it the catalyst Apple Google and others introduced easy to use built-in encryption  And that's really why this debate is happening is because Apple made encryption a consumer product where in the past  It's only been available to the highly technical users  Remember when Edward Snowden first wanted to reveal the contents that he of the treasure trove from the NSA  He wanted to use PGP. Yeah with the reporter  And he said what's the PGP? I had no idea  how to implement it  but but now thanks to  These companies it's really interesting  There is a statement in here from Jonathan's it ran down in the appendix if I can  Get to it and the appendix each of the signatories and there quite a few has gets a chance to say their own  thing Bruce Schneier is of course a personal hero and  He says ubiquitous encryption protects us from  Protects us much more from bulk surveillance than from targeted surveillance  For a variety of technical reasons computer security is extraordinarily weak and this guy knows  If it's sufficiently skilled funded and motivated attacker wants in your computer therein  Yeah, if they're not it's because you're not high enough on their priority list to bother with  widespread encryption  Forces the listener whether a foreign government criminal or terrorist to target and this hurts repressive governments much more than it hurts terrorists and  criminals and then that's a great point isn't it it's really about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Collection exactly the bulk sort of mass net sucking and everything as opposed to targeting specific individuals. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and then Jonathan writes I  Empathize this is to what Steve was saying I empathize with the idea that just how much  Government can learn about us should not depend on the cat-and-mouse game of technological measure and countermeasure  Ideally, this is what I was saying a polity would carefully calibrate its legal authorities to permit access  Exactly and only where it comports with the imperatives of legitimate security in other words where there's a real  Security reason and with basic human rights as recognized through the protections of conventions and constitutions  It's a very challenging argument  Absolutely, and it's clear when you read the the white paper that there wasn't total agreement among all the parties  But boy one thing they do agree about is surveillance bulk surveillance is easier than ever  And encryption does not force law enforcement to go dark by any means

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to go back to the point about iOS 9. It's so NPR or Washington Post  wired and  Wired and a couple other  Sites all said it's running iOS 9. Okay, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could all be reading off the same exact source as we know business. So you don't know as we know that does happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what each other. Yeah, I don't know what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That never happens never never happens Leo. I'm looking at the document right now and one interesting piece of notice is  It's not it wasn't his phone. It belonged to the state. Oh, well, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was a phone provided to him by his employer as a work phone, right?  So there's no question it does significantly because his employer has given permission  for the phone's contents to be read and  since is their phone that's they're the they're the  Responsible party they they have the rights to say you can look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only technological methods that are preventing them from looking at and it does say that it did receive the last update

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so okay, that would be iOS 9 and all like I also read

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No secure enclave however on the 5c they have multiple they have multiple backups of this phone already  So they have  That's like that. I guess the phone did yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a second the beginning the conversation you said eight nine  It's all moot because it can't happen anyway  So does this mean that the government once they're once they can brute force has more capability to?  brute force  Then we know no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the biggest difference is hardware difference  Subsequent iPhones have touch ID and what's something called a secure enclave, which is on the chip, right?  Yeah, and and as far as we know there's no government backdoor ability to crack it and I can have as far as we know  Well, but I have to believe that with Apple taking this strong stand today that that's probably the case  They seem pretty principled Tim Cook seems pretty principled in his argument against this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know I admire  Snowden and what he did  But I think tell me if I'm wrong here he on a tweet  He basically said Google silence proves that they're on the wrong side there on the other side. This has been a couple hours  Yeah, give Google a chance. This requires lots of lawyers. Google has fought around encryption like crazy. Google's a victim of the NSA  Was enraged when they heard what was happening  I think it's a little unfair at this stage  Now obviously I'm a Google defender all the time but all I'm trying to say is encrypted  No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nexus phones are encrypted. Yes, they are  Since the next they've been encrypted and I'm first asking with their public stand here visa via Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This takes time to go through a bureaucracy and lawyers and all that and they got all kinds of implications  So if Google comes out with a statement saying screw Apple, I will I will  You know be critical of Google but I think it's just a little too soon to condemn Google on this case  I did email them and I said what is your stand? I haven't heard back yet  I don't expect to right away, but I do think that for other technology companies. Yes, we'll wait and watch  I don't know what the proper amount of time is, but I agree. That's a little soon a  little bit yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll hear from Google. I'm sure I think so. That's the Twitter. That's the Twitter talking not Edward Snowden

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the Twitter talking Snowden tweeted a link to a New York Times story  which says the Chinese government is going to be watching very closely and that if law enforcement agencies push Apple to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlock the phone it would embolden Beijing to demand the same and I totally agree with you Jeff that that's the the real  Concern is that once they show this capability?  Then it's a free-for-all with every  You know, but it's kind of a cheesy way to okay, but let me rise up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Into the clouds and low oxygen which is what I specialize in here  so  Fine, but I would argue that we're at a point now where we're questioning the very  Institution of government and that that's what we see happening in our election right now. It's what we see happening around the world and  Technology has to decide and live on its principles as well  and  we as technology users have to expect technology companies to do that and  To fight for us because they do hold this power one way or the other we've got to know what their principles are  And so that to me is a big is that extra governmental?  Yes, so is life so as being able to talk to your priest and not have that revealed to government  That the church came up with its principle and lives by its principle and psychiatrists came up with their principle and live by their  But they were enshrined in law very important  But but but yes and I mean I could I could decide that I am that I am you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As if you tell me things because I am a chief twit that it is protected under the twit  Confidentiality agreement that's the discussion we all government but government has to then enshrine it in law before it's the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's the discussion we have to have and that's the precedent that a court will eventually set in this discussion to say that  when you entrust to a technology company  your  security and  That can be so easily violated then then we have forced an entire industry to not be trustworthy anymore  And the technology companies have to decide what their stand is as to what will they do to fight for us?  And that's where Snowden's right and that's where the issue is right now  And so in a sense I would argue at a time when I think government institutions are going to be challenged all around the world  I'm not suggesting now that that you know, Google is the new government Google doesn't want that job  But the technology industry because it is so international because we dependent upon it in all these ways  It's gonna have to stand up to almost quasi legal  Questions of principle quoting Loris. Let's lesson code is law  Yeah, and that's where we are right now and that's why this discussion is so important  That's why you can't just quickly say oh judge said it. Okay. Sorry guys. We got to do that  I I salute cook for saying this is a much bigger discussion and damn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think the other thing the other thing that troubles me at least is that I  Get the feeling and I don't know this but I get the feeling that  The FBI and other security agencies have been working on trying to get into iPhones on their own  Yeah, they clearly want to set some kind of precedent. That's why they're doing this  So they want to be able to say look you did it this one time  Want you to do that again or do it multiple times or let us do it?  And I think it's that the precedent that's being said set is almost more important than just getting into this guy's phone  That's what does it allow the the security agencies to argue in the future?  What sort of kind of slippery slope are you starting on and I think that's why Apple's you know resisting as hard as it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a great conversation  But there's a lot of other things to talk about so we are going to do that  But I thank Steve for dialing in and joining us and adding a considerable force and weight to the conversation and  But I can't think of three better people to talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a great. It's a great subject. Yeah, it means so many things are crystallized in this example. Yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it putting myself in Tim Cook's shoes. I would do exactly what he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah  Yeah, I don't think he has a choice. I don't think I'll choice all right. No, I'm not I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I but I but I what I  Here's one of the things I fear we we've come to the point now and where we so mistrust government  That we essentially want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. We just well, that's just you know, we can't trust government so  we can't we shouldn't we just forget it and  We have survived  250 years  on the rule of law and on the on the Constitution and  Those are very precious things and but they got that way by people pushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, I mean it has to be a debate the debate has not stopped is not written in stone. It's not you know, it's gonna evolve

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But ultimately, you know the we didn't have a coup in this country when the Supreme Court in 2000 ruled that  George Bush won the election

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One might argue it was a coup but that's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it was a coup by a by the Supreme Court. Yes, right and  Because we have all agreed as a society that that's how it should be  The risk is if you start saying well, I don't care as technologists  We have the right to encrypt and we're gonna do it whether the Supreme Court says so or not  Of destroying something far more important, which is the the rule of law and the national polity and we need that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think or we will descend into you know, and I totally agree but there has to be a process where  A security agency says we need into this guy's phone and you don't need to know why we got an order from the secret court  That's wrong. I think yeah, I think there needs to be a little bit more  There's diligence of that me. I say three things one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That we have to look upon this as a level of principles no matter what the present technology is  What the president said to we have to look at this internationally?  Because we have to recognize what's being done and three we have to do it transparently  And that's why I'm glad the cook did what he was doing. Yeah, you know, there's this believe me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I didn't think this was an important conversation, it wouldn't have just voted an hour and a half to it. Jesus really?  It's very important and it's probably the most important technology as I said at the beginning the most important story and technology of the year and  Maybe of all the year  But you know and I think there's much many words that will be spoken over this and I don't know if there's a clear answer  But I would just I would I would argue that  Just as you quite correctly say  Encryption is is vital for security and privacy for its citizens  I would also say that there's a reason we have rule of law because lacking that you have  Anarchy and that is even more dangerous to all citizens  Let us let's see you said you had breaking news is it there's so many things it could be let me just give you  You know what let me just give you some of the things that could be breaking news  Yahoo more layoffs

Transcript:  So proud of well you should be proud of me. I'm so thrilled with it. That's great company. It is  fresh books calm  Well, that's nice. I didn't I again. I maybe we've talked about that before that's really cool, so  Brandon Chester wrote a somewhat scathing review of the pixel C  And I think he was not alone many of us who bought the Google tablet  We're just kind of felt like the hardware was really great, but that's that the Android the Android version that came on it 6.0  One or whatever it was just wasn't all there in fact. It was a little bit buggy that  slow  So and that and that's kind of what Brandon said  He reached out to Google and Google gave him an update  He was offered he says the chance to test a new unit that would run a new  Unreleased build standing fixes Google plans to release to the public in the future  Given the fact that pixel see his solid hardware. That's only let down by buggy software the chance to see their improvements  Was welcome  So he goes through it he says you know it's better  Still not perfect  I  Still I'm hoping for Chrome OS on the thing. I just I really love it here. Yeah  I'm hoping for any OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened?  Oh, man drop it  No, it's look at the it's the androids dead  The Android Android has a little red triangle coming out of its tongue. God bless Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I went through a few diagnostics and call him up, and I said it's gotten worse worse worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before this went fully dead and  No argument no complaint send me the keyboards broken to there send me both of me the right ways and no folks  It's not cuz it's me. I just called the number and I'm just some guy with the device  The Twitter complaint they jumped on it maybe because it's me, but not not the phone they were great  Yeah, it remember when I was on the show from a hotel and the thing went to fluy. Yep  Brandon says this too by the way that yeah random crashes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't restart it. I couldn't restart it. I finally got it to restart and again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was nervous about it ever since and then  Like a week ago. It started doing it where it would just  Crash or I couldn't get going or this one on its own would take many many many many attempts to get started  I finally get started, but for God's sakes so then I rebuilt it and it got worse quickly  And in fact, I was like  Quickly  And in fact, I was starting at one last time so I could erase, you know, I could clear the machine  Then I can't get to it. I should clear it before so it's gonna be okay  Google will erase it if there's any data on there, right? Yes, of course sure they will

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't hand it right over to the NSF  By the way that is encrypted all of Google's Nexus devices are encrypted out of the box by default by default you can turn  It off but they are in crypto by default in fact with the Nexus 6 the the Shamu the big one  People really complain because it slowed down disk performance considerably because I guess it wasn't hardware support

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is there a reason why the pixel see he doesn't have Chrome OS on it like why well we heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know how true it is that it was designed for  Chrome OS or some actually not exactly Chrome OS a hybrid OS that Google was developing and killed at the last minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some kind of turf war between Android and it sounds like when Andy Rubin left

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the issue. Matthew. Here's the issue. I keep on I'm gonna try to get my head around this because it because it is  I'm in a middle ground, right? I've got my my my my six my seven my nine inch this my Chromebook  Ah, if if the pixel see were a Chromebook, it would be you know, a laptop substitute what it wouldn't be though  What I use it for is I'm on the plane. I'm watching movies  The the downloading on to Chrome OS does not work. Well, I've done to work yet at all. Oh interesting  It's just not as good at that. So those those things that you want to run apps for right?  That's what Android is good at okay  Versus but as a laptop and a productivity device and getting full value out of the software  Including there's all kinds of things that Doc's doesn't do on it. It sucks  So it's stuck in a bad middle ground. This is where he's right  It's it's a less than optimal Android device and a less than it would be a less than optimal Chrome device or desktop device or laptop  Substitute so they do need to figure out how to get the two OS's together  Yeah, and just it feels like those what if functions and say what function should it do? Well, let's make it do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and what if Chrome OS had better downloading built-in? Well, let me tell you  This is the story recording Iran Amadeo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually and while I'm telling this story Jeff unplug and replug your headset because we're getting some  Some weird effects on there back in 2014 July 2014 a new Ryu board  Motherboard was popping up in the Chrome OS open source repository  Further trips to the source code revealed that Ryu had a light bar like the pixel C  USB type C connectors like the pixel C and Nvidia Tegra SOC  Pixel C has the X X 1. Yeah and  wireless charging  And in fact you see in the source code on the pixel C the product name Ryu  So this was going to be the launch hardware according to Ron for an all-new  all-touch version of Chrome OS which at some point got cancelled and  It's a really great story if you read through this and and Ron's done some good reporting  I think yeah on this the Chrome OS was working on a new interface called project Athena  Which added a lot of functionality based on touchscreen usage?  It's right about the same time July 2014 that we started to see references to the pixel C project Ryu  The biggest addition we knew about says Ron was an experimental window switcher  Which would have taken Chrome OS's windows management UI from a taskbar interface to a cascading  Scrolling thumbnail UI that looks a lot like you see in marshmallow  They added swipe gestures  I don't know if they would have added the media features you are looking for the project Athena never shipped in December 2014  The project was cancelled  So with no touch interface to run on the 10-inch touchscreen no mouse to drive the mouse center Chrome OS the pixel C was in a pickle  And  So for a while they considered dual booting  Android and Chrome OS  and  But that idea only lasted about five months in July 2015 the dual boot project seems to have been scrapped a  Comment on a Ryu commit mentioned the cancellation while giving us more evidence  It's so great that you can go back through git commits and look at the comments and learn so much the comments had abandoned  Franken board is dead  Franken board  Franken Franken board plans went out for beers. Yeah, well they came up with plan C  We got it let's ship it in  September just a couple months later at the Nexus launch event they announced the Android 6 power pixel C  Remember what a shock that was and he was showing the keyboard thing. This was just two months after Franken board was killed  and  Then as you remember they didn't announce the ship date, but all of a sudden December 8th everybody says oh, it's on them  It's for sale and you and audit and I bought it. We all rushed out and bought one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as it you know, I keep on dripping  So so I love and I still love I feel I feel disloyal to my neck by my seven inch  Right. Yeah, the Nexus 7 Nexus 7 is beautiful. It's not sold anymore. It's the right size for a pocket  It's the right size for me sitting on the subway  The problem with it with the pixel C is it's just it's so big to hold it on a subway or a train or something  And again, it's it's it's a bad  Laptop substitute. It's a too big  Tablet but but love it. The screen is gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a and I feel like if I'm really relieved to hear that Google's working on it  Like yeah, they're not gonna abandon it and it yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so and yeah, the fixes aren't enough yet. They fix some of the obvious things that are there the low-hanging bad fruit  fine  There's something there. There's some day in which but I'm traveling around the world  I want to take that as the only device  Be lighter and be put on the plane. It'll be good, but they've got to fix  They've got to fix the the productivity  uses because they put the keyboard in there in a way that you're now going to expect to use Doc's really well and it  doesn't do Doc's well and  You've got to expect that it's not gonna make apps really awkwardly huge and they've got to work on other things as well  But you can start to see this future, but they've got to care about this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna call you back Jeff because it came back and didn't solve. Sorry. That's okay  While Matthew and I talk about Jiffy and RISC  So this I you know, I love I use Facebook Messenger. I use a telegram both have GIF buttons use telegram  Yeah, I love telegram interesting. I wish other people used it. But since I'm the only one  It's kind of boring  It's a little it's not a great experience, but it's fun because you can type  The messenger does this too you hit the GIF button and then you type a word and it will find matching

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Animated use slack at all slack same thing. So slack. Yeah, they're they're Giphy  Integration is fantastic. We use slack at fortune. Love it. We use it a gig. Um and  using a  The right gift, you know is a great feeling  I thought I have to confess that I actually thought because I'm an old person  And words are my thing I thought gifts were kind of dumb and sort of infantile no actually it's old people that love gifts  Yeah, well  But I think I think people actually like them because they can be very effective they can they can trigger  I agree whether it's a laugh or a or a smile or or  It's like a teeny tiny  Movie, you know, it's like a little and so I actually have kind of come around to them in a way  I felt the same way about emojis  I thought they were dumb and that kids use them and they were  Dumbing down the population or so on but there are there are ways you can communicate visually  Through things like a GIF or a or an emoji that are different  Then you I mean you could either type a thousand words to try to describe something or you could just agree  Use a clip of Donald Trump looking like an idiot and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is very powerful there was this evolution and telegram really did it where we went from  emoticons, right semi-colon dash right paren  to  Emoji which basically had really the kind of the same weight as emoticons except they were easier to figure out a bigger variety  But there was still tiny and then stickers we went through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Facebook like stickers, yeah, cuz they want to basically take over emojis and have their own there's a revenue model and stickers and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  museum to  Telegram straight because I have a whole set of Donald Trump stickers  And the thing that telegram did that I love is that telegram tied its stickers to the emoji  So what you do is you type the thumbs up emoji  But you say but I want a sticker and then you can get the Donald doing a thumbs up. Oh  Yes, so cool  This is actually probably the most sophisticated use of this, you know today my brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Colleague professor Kerry Brown talked to all of the the main journalism professors today about how to judge social media that kind of stuff  I just imagined them all watching the conversation you just had it for the last three minutes. Their heads are gonna explode  Well, welcome to the new so look I've typed and I was there too. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you it's exactly right it's much more nuanced than text yeah, and it's fun  So you can show the lower part of yeah, you can show this screen  I don't think there's anything wrong with this Jason  So I typed a thumbs up emoji and then it's offering me because I have a lot of sticker sets  It's offering me George Costanza  Fallout 4 but I think I'll use the  The  Trump I mean  But I but I so you could do a heart and then you get all the if there are stickers that correspond to hearts  Which there aren't you bought the stickers? No. No. No, this is a nice thing about telegram. Everything's free  Would you but you said there's a business model and stickers but there is for Facebook for Facebook  Yeah, and for others including and this is where the story's leading perhaps Twitter. Look I can also do Taylor Swift thumbs up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great Twitter's a great example when it first implemented  autoplay animated gifts I thought  This is terrible. This is gonna ruin Twitter  Yeah, so, you know and I was very vocal about how and and vine autoplay and all those other things and I was completely wrong  because  Some some days the gifts that I see that people post  They're so great are the most enjoyable point of my day. Yeah, and maybe that says a lot about my day  but  but after Jeb Bush posted that a  Photo of his gun or whatever and said America that the animated gifts I saw after that  15 or 20 of them were hysterical and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now compare it to so now and this is why I agree with you. So this is now tella. This is now messenger and  This started I think really with an Apple keyboard for jiffy giffy because now I've tied thumbs up as the search  So I can get a rather large and isn't that better than the emoticons and many of them are very topical, right?  And so you can see has a keyboard. Yeah, I think Rissy and jiffy both came from third-party key  At least the first time I saw them third-party keyboards on iOS  There you go, there's my thumbs up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just came across called at slash gif  And I'm not sure who does it but if you if you at mention  Slash gif and then you put a word in it will just randomly reply to you with a gift  So it will just randomly choose so if you post love or Trump or thumbs  It will just pick one random. Is it just GIF is the Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slash gif so SLA SLS SL a sh  Yeah, yeah, yeah, cuz you can't use the there it is slash gif I find gifts for you tweet a search term. Oh nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice, you just mentioned at slash gif and the term and it responds to you with whatever comes up  Oh, I'm gonna follow this fun. It's quite fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is Twitter's institutionalizing this as every text based messaging platform should and then it's interesting when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mentioned this in the post I did about Giphy my sort of you know the reluctance to see gifts as a  Not not just my reluctance, but people's reluctance in general to see them as something  More than just a time-wasting goofy thing and the CEO  Giffey made the point that it's not just  Cat gifts or you know funny things it can be lots of other things it can convey strong emotion  It can be a highlight from a sports game. It can be a score from a game  It can be a weather report on slack. You can actually slash  Giffey and put in your area code and it'll show you the weather  I mean, there's a lot more it can kind of be conveyed in  in a gift in a short animated gift and you would think so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tweeted  slash gif thumbs up and this is what I got you got it dude  Which is a good one Jimmy Fallon as Donald Trump, so it really combines everything into a good one. Yeah  So what do you think Jeff? Is this a crazy? I think this is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I always gonna say the I am my only I see gifts everything can be gamed and everything  We can be spammed and I see a lot of gift spam now  Really? Yeah  Yeah, what does it look like? Well, so not always animated, but you know somebody somewhere  There's a service that took some quote that I did like do what you do best link to the rest and  Made it a new gift, right? And now I see that thing coming across with my app name all the time  And the reason is it's fake spam accounts trying to look real by doing those gifts  Okay, and and so and so it's kind of the only reason they exist  So anything and everything can be both spammed and gamed and and that's what I'm so to put that aside  Yeah, I think I think Matthew the things you just said about how it can be used to convey news if you look at the  New courts app, which unfortunately is only iOS  it's doing news as a  as a text conversation and  Yeah, you want more that here's more you don't want anymore  This is interesting. It's really interesting now imagine using graphic  We used to call them graphics column gifts column  whatever you want that as you say can convey the Dow or can convey whether or can convey a moment of news or  You know the moment when Jeb Bush walked by  Carson going to the debate or whatever you can convey a lot in that and and so I I used to make fun of  dancing gifts and and decry them too and  Decried sure. Yes, they could still they can still do a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I remember I keep coming back to whenever something like gifts comes up  I come back to what I thought of when Twitter first showed up  The dumbest thing I'd ever seen and then no one in the right mind would ever use it for anything  clearly a little wrong  And I'm reminded, you know, even Alexander Graham Bell didn't know what the hell people were gonna do with the telephone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just thought it was a good idea. He didn't even know how people were gonna answer it. He said everybody should say ahoy. Ahoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ahoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what does  Is being giffified do anything to save Twitter no, it's just one more no no not at all not at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but but it is interesting that they  You know by building it in they kind of  They're taking advantage of it, but they're also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Effectively giving the network over to it. It's interesting too. Cuz it's a step away from the kind of very basic text focused  Oh, yeah, which was my first that was originally Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my problem with it was I just want to see  140 characters somebody and then we got screenshots and screen captures of things and then and then Vine videos  Auto-played and then gifts auto-played and I thought you know, it's just becoming more like Facebook  I I have to say though. I actually find it more enjoyable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So again, I was totally wrong and lest you think this all dumb and dopey  I  Really see has just raised a considerable amount of money 55. I'm sorry  55 million dollars giving a 300 million dollar valuation with no revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I so I mentioned I mentioned on Twitter that a maker of animated gifts was worth more than the Washington Post  Which which obviously people don't like to think about particularly people who probably what work at the Washington Post  But in a way they are both so the point I was trying to make in the post and that the CEO  I was making is if he is a media company  You may not like the format that the media is in but this thing is integrated into so many different things  It's reaching billions of people theoretically. It's got partnerships with every  conceivable platform  From Facebook to slack to Twitter to tinder. It's got partnerships with movie companies and record labels  It's not just a website where you go to find a funny cat gift effectively is a media company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The of course the revenue model is actually pretty straightforward when a movie comes out  You know you all of a sudden you start seeing offered to you hail Caesar gifs for instance, right?  And then everybody goes. Oh, yeah, and and that's worth a lot of money as snapchat has  Shown us. This is not the only  Edition following the addition of a gif button Twitter is now bringing video support to direct messages  In iOS and Android or on Twitter comm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna have to turn off the all DMS except all DMS  Because if I start getting I turned that off auto playing in my DMS. Yeah, I never turned that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only want DMS from people I follow that's that's it's insane to say anybody can DM me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turned it on for a while and it was kind of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It becomes email at that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, and nobody was the Twitter gif you button gif button rolled out. Not yet  Yeah, and is it and here's my other question is as it always are they're gonna do it only on twitter.com and not on tweet deck  Which they all they've abandoned tweet deck

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is it it's not it's rolling out slowly, I mean it's rolling out today, but it's not I don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it probably never ever ever use twitter.com never oh I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do for that very reason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you want the full Twitter experience. Well, they also normal wouldn't retweets normal comedy on a retweet. It just it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how do you feel about the the what you missed thing? I kind of I guess that's while you're away

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess that's algorithmic. I like it. Yeah, it's okay as long as I take over the feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm a little I wrote a whole thing about it because it feels like a slippery slope to me  So while your way is fine, I have no problem with it. Lots of people have no problem with it  And it is an option  But eventually it will become the default and so then you want to turn it off and then eventually it will become more  While you were away and less what it used to be and you probably won't notice  Because it's the default and so lots of people will never turn it off and eventually we will I mean Facebook did exactly the same  It was an option and then it became the default and then turning it off became almost impossible  And then they hid the way to turn it off and now when you do turn it off, they turn it back on  And you have to keep turning it off. And so no one does it and so  You know huge proportion of people aren't even aware that their feed is being filtered. That's concerns me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you. I I think but I think that while you were away is actually a nice  Kind of intermediate step that it gives you a little bit of a best of both. It's not gonna stop there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not gonna stop there because they need to boost their engagement, right? That's the whole reason they're doing in the first place  So in order to boost engagement, they will just keep tweaking it and turning up the volume on the algorithm  And then it'll be the default

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has launched something called Gmailify  I'm really thinking this is a good idea a way to use Google's best features with non Gmail accounts  So for instance, I guess you would be giving Google access to your Yahoo mail your Outlook mailbox  So they could scan it do anti spam goals reading your email  Yeah, and and and we like it inbox organization  You'd get Google now benefits because it would be reading your man. It's a good idea  It's a great idea and you know, you don't have to use it  Yep  I'll have to try it on my you know  It'd be a good test on the outlook comm account because if it actually does get the spam there will be nothing in the mailbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same with you, right?  That was actually the first when I switched I was using outlook of course cuz that where I worked required it  And the thing that really sold me on Gmail was the anti spam  It was just so flawless and so fast and outlook was just the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's in you have to  Sign in enable a gin. I don't understand how it works exactly  There's it's a there's a blog post but so  Starting today if you use Yahoo or hotmail or outlook comm  All you need to do is open the Gmail app  Oh, I see you do it in the Gmail app and then the new Gmail app allows you to sign into those accounts and then there's a  Okay, okay, get it Gmailify. So it sounds like it doesn't actually modify it won't like take a spam out of a Yahoo mail  I wish it would but it but it does when I'm looking at with a Gmail app, right? I kind of step back from the Gmail app  I like inbox so much, but  Yeah, I do too actually yeah, yeah, just you and me is mailbox for a little while. Yeah, you know use mailbox  I've tried them all I just I just started deleting from iOS all my alternate email programs  And I've yet to find one that just really works for me  One of the reasons is I demand I need to have PGP or GPG in my case open  PGP in  There for signing an encryption and a lot most email programs don't  Most email programs don't yeah, very few on mobile support it. I keep going back to Thunderbird with enigma. I'll believe it or not  It's pretty darn good. Yeah, it's free  tech editor in chief at Yahoo tech Dan Tynan laid off also  The and the hits just keep on coming David Pogue is not late leaving

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moving over to news. They're only doing four areas now. Yeah, there's they've folded it over a folded

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're shutting down some of their magazines  Yeah, it sounded like at first that they were gonna shut down Yahoo tech altogether, but it doesn't look that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kara Swisher according to sources close to the situation Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer has designated Wednesday is the day of the week to make the  massive employee cuts  right yay  So we're just gonna do it every Wednesday. It's cut me day. It's cut me day  Well, you don't want to fire somebody on Friday they can really put a damper on their weekend, right?  You file them on Monday, you know, it's just it's just it's just an insult

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they could have a party for the people who are being laid off sure Marissa could ride around on the Zambonia

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Food is gone  Carrie diamond out she was parenting parenting is gone travel travel  Auto we  See I didn't even know areas that should have good advertising. Yeah, who knew they had it  Yeah, I mean I looked at the tech section a lot and there was a lot of advertising in it  And they were they mixed in the time because it was tile based and they mixed in  advertising tiles with the content tiles, which is not my favorite way they also kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aggregated a lot. I mean, yeah, a lot of it wasn't their stuff  If they were gonna really devote time and resources to it then they should have done it like really do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess amp has amp has amped up the competition  Facebook's amp competitor  Instant articles is going to be available to all publishers as of April 12th took him a year to do a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it? Yeah. Yeah, I have already big deal publishers that they I'm reading a lot more Washington Post now a lot because  Facebook feed exactly. Yeah, and it's  And it's very fast. It's a good experience. I have argued to many publishers  They should really consider creating whole new media properties entirely on Facebook because instant articles now as monetization in there and I'll tell you  I'm gonna I'm gonna go I want to be able to put anything I write henceforth  I want to do it under as you know a long post an article so to speak  I want to put it in on instant articles. I'll make you know a cup of coffee a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but I want to do that I'd like to go one step farther and ask Facebook to add an audio post  Format for set for you know kind of SoundCloud like audio. Yeah  Right now WN my see which is a lot of podcasts is just putting a video with a static picture up and because it's auto  The problem is doesn't auto play audio. Yeah, so that's maybe less than desirable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be interested to see whether I forget who brought this up in my Twitter feed  But somebody said how long until  someone a sort of independent journalist just goes  Full-on instant articles publishes everything through instant article bus feed and vice right aren't they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Deprecating their home page just saying we'll be wherever you are whether it's snapchat or Facebook or actually fast company had a huge takeout

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  piece on  Buzz feed that I wrote a post about because they're it's fascinating how much people are  It's fascinating how much that's a data driven company  It's it's more than I can go into at the moment, but it's just fascinating how much data there is below the surface  But but there was a stat in there  75% or more a buzzfeed the content that BuzzFeed creates never appears on their website

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So another way put another way what what Jonah told me in a conference?  See elsewhere was the secret that BuzzFeed has 5 billion interactions of people a month only 1 billion of those interactions occur at  BuzzFeed.com and Jonah said to him now but BuzzFeed.com is his laboratory  The business is off-site and media companies have to understand how they have to go to users and go to readers  What we want to call them wherever they are  Now the hard part of that is twofold one modernization, but both and and I a solve that the second problem  Is how do you build a relationship which I argue has to be the future of media if you're interacting with people all the hell  Over creation we've got to work on that and and the platforms have to help us be able to do that  But I think that there are ways that that can be done and I think BuzzFeed's in effect BuzzFeed's pitch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their monetized monetization is their pitch to brands and advertisers as we understand how content works  On all these platforms  They don't sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't sell media. They don't sell space. They don't sell audience  They sell a skill that skill is we can make our understanding we can make your crap viral too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's it's fascinating to me how much time they spend and how little time lots of traditional media companies spend on  Looking at what people actually do so not just do they click and not just do they come back to our website?  What do they do after that? So?  The art fast company article makes clear that clicking is not enough. That's not what BuzzFeed is interested in sharing is the most important thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but  in that sense of selling that skill of  Viral because you can sell that but in the end does that really actually lead to real reading?  Chartbeat as we know has found clearly that people share and don't read so it's not an indication that people have really read it and so  Journalist mr. Journalist or ms. Advertiser just because they shared it doesn't mean crap in terms of value

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but sharing and not reading is better than not sharing and not so sure. I'm not so sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sharing and not reading doesn't indicate that you they've read your precious story sharing and not reading doesn't mean they've absorbed your advertising message  No, I don't think that that's this I think I think the the what's waiting to be out there is it is that the bubbles gonna  burst on on sharing and  Say it's worthless. It was fun. Well, I'll ask them. Okay, what's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they have you have to look at things beyond just the sharing you have to look at  You have to measure engagement, which is really really hard to do. That's the point man. Right?  There's no one saying Oh sharing all I'm saying is at least they're  Part way down the road to doing that lots of traditional media companies are not even they don't even know  The road is there or how to get there. They're great. They're not  Go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me there's there's there's levels here at level one of metrics in our business is page views reach frequency  That's the old mass media business model. That's dead  Next is so-called engagement time spent sharing likes that's bubble to burst the next one to me  That's most important for the future of the business's relationships. How many people do you know? What do you know about them?  What value can you bring them as a result? Then the fourth is in journalism is impact  Impact is really  Almost a brand question the business basis is relationships and we're really bad at that in our industry  We don't have relationships people we we give them a one-size-fits-all product. We don't know who the hell you are  As I'm always fond of saying Google knows where I live and where I work my newspaper doesn't that's a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wrote I just wrote a whole post about the Guardians membership  Approach as opposed to the sort of one-size-fits-all paywall approach one is here's a bunch of content  We created we have no idea whether you're interested in it or not  But you should probably pay us and the other approach is trying to get to know  Your readers and figure out what it is. They actually want I think those are very very different. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Held a full disclosure. I'm working with the Guardian on membership  And and I had a small event with WB easy Chicago and WNYC WGBH  WFMU and also the Guardian and also I think I mentioned this before Leo Jack Conti from  a trail and  You know Jack's view Jack has really fascinating information now  Jack's just brilliant about when people want to support something when they want to become a patron to something and they support more than one thing  How that kind of generosity works and so it's not about getting access to content  It's not being part of something and helping something and we don't understand that in our business  Public media begins to understand it but still in a media centric way not in a public centric way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact most of the things you see membership based  Plans offering or things like go behind the scenes and get a tour of the newsroom. Well, actually  It's really interested in that at all. What about how can you help us about you?  Story, right exactly. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See here so I just put up I don't want to go back to the topic but I  Didn't watch it yet, but Fox News says that if Apple wins Isis wins

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's enough you don't show it. Yeah. Did you see the Grammys?  Did you watch Adele?  No, she wasn't she was kind of not sounded so good. She had technical problems, right?  She really am I the microphone fell into the piano  Which is interesting because Google's ad for the Grammys in some interesting way  presaged  this  Is there  Be together not the same  88 keys on the piano and a virtuoso  Can really make it sing each one is different. But what if all the keys were the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to admit I watched this the first time and I didn't get it. Yeah, you have to read the captions  I thought it's a weird composition, but what the hell I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think it's interesting if all the keys have the same note  I don't mind the second one  Might be what Adele was singing to I don't know. It's kind of like a gift. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually here they come the Grammys  Exclusively through Twitter you could do so I did not have it on real time and I feel like I sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watched it. Here's the boy. I want to see Hamilton. Geez. I want to know I know that makes you want to see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you  I'm gonna come out. We're gonna scalp tickets and we're all gonna go. It's just all go  Stephen Fry has quit Twitter  again  Is it is he quit it before?  He has taken  sabbaticals love the British comedian. He's very tech savvy, but he just had it after  critiques of his BAFTA Awards  Talk, you know conversation about I don't know anyway, it's who cares  The real interesting thing is when is Kanye West gonna quit Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I hope he never quit. He's got a  amusing  Someone said they should put him on the board or something or give him stock. He's doing more for Twitter. It's quite engaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, West took to Twitter on Saturday to say I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt  Please pray we overcome. This is my true heart  Let me ask mark for a billion and then he says Mark Zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into Kanye West's ideas  After realizing he is the greatest living artist and greatest artist of all time. Thank you. I  am Kanye and  Then he follows it up with Mark Zuckerberg. I know it's your birthday, but can you please call me by tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a bunch we probably don't want to mention on the air because he swears but it's some of them are hilarious

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He also said Larry Page I'm down for your help, too  I think it's performance art. It could be performance art. It could be he's actually gone. I I'm torn between  He's actually gone insane. I think  Yeah, it's it's a it's an interesting turn of events, you know who has quit Twitter is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marc Andreessen what?  Well, he hasn't said he quit he'd last tweeted on February 10th what?  That was a week ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this after  Considering according to sources a purchase of Twitter with Silver Lake  And of course he invented the tweet storm  Marc Andreessen the and you know, one of the writers of the original mosaic browser the one of the guy, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why I netscape so he tweeted about  India  His last tweet was a series of apologies for that  That which is really too bad. It is too bad that guys are following him was  He's a man still wish he was writing blog post because those were amazing. But his his Twitter account was  fantastic like  even  Even if you could question that specific tweet  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was a very good example of what we talked about which is it's way too easy to just write something offhand on Twitter and  Unfortunately because it's written and because a lot of people see it  It becomes short as if you wrote an essay and treat it as if it was a carefully thought out  pronunciation exact pronouncement it clearly wasn't I mean and and mark really abjectly apologized as he should because I  Can't remember what he said, but it was not very nice. It was a reference to colonialism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't all that bad, right? Which is but that's kind of a third rail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it has to do it has to do with the internet org and Facebook's attempt  Yeah to to give free basics give free internet to India Indian government has rejected it saying it's a  Anti-net neutrality. It's zero rating  Oh Malik has been very forthright about that and of course Ohm has standing to talk about this  Subject being from India. He says it is a fascinating  it's a form of colonialism says they say when when the  British East India Company came they gave a lot of free stuff away and then they did colonized

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and and I mean I don't have any standing to talk about it because I'm not Indian and I don't you know  I get Facebook the same way I get everything else  I've got lots of internet and you know, I have money and I'm white and so on but but the thing that fascinates me about the topic  Is you can?  So Mark Zuckerberg he doesn't want to take over India obviously except in financial terms  Maybe I say genuinely think he wants to give people  free internet but  But because of the history and the culture and the way that Facebook approached it  Which and I would argue they made a mistake in the way they they sort of marketed it and then the in the way  They I don't think they tried hard enough to understand  The country before they came in and said hi, we're Facebook and we're gonna give you a dumbed-down version of the internet  It's just a fascinating story to me the whole thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark's comment  Was anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades  Why stop now the kind of offhand comment that  people might say in public and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  deeply regret moments later the problem is worse because he's a director of Facebook and as I said last week I  Suspect that I would bet you anything that had recent called  Zock and said shoot me at dawn. I  Messed up, you know and and then hold off Twitter for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do hope he comes back and we now have as of one minute ago a response from Sundar Pichai  Google to the Apple ah  Logo this is a tweet storm a five tweet post on Twitter  Why blog when you can tweet starting with important post by Tim Cook forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users privacy  Tweet to we know that law enforcement and intelligence agencies face significant challenges and protecting the public against crime and terrorism  Tweet three we build secure products  We being Google obviously build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement  Access to data based on valid legal orders  For but that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data could be a troubling precedent  Five looking forward to a thoughtful and open discussion on this important issue a balanced and nuanced  response

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart and smart. Yeah, so Edward Snowden it may have taken them five hours, but he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he write that before Snowden's tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just came out three minutes came out it's no Snowden three hours ago now, I think it is, you know, it's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really kind of amazing  That this is where the conversation happens is on Twitter  You know, that's what individual 140 character posts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and if you think about it, I actually when Mark Henryson and the India thing happened  I thought if you had tried to describe to someone ten years ago  Mark and recent is gonna post a tweet and then India is gonna get upset and Mark Zuckerberg is gonna have to make a public statement  On this thing called Facebook. No one would have understood what you were talking. Yeah, you'd be speaking a foreign language a tweet a tweet

Yeah  and and  so  however, however  Dave kenny david kenny who's now the head of ibm watson.

This is great  But the the thing that has to gives me the giggles  Is that the winners are going to present?  Ted talks, so you think the ted talks are made by algorithms. I thought they already were  They all sound alike. Oh, that's interesting  Um having gotten to my that my giggles out of me, um, I do think it's interesting that that now  uh, you know, we're gonna see  What happens with with uh ai or ai human ai combos they say  Uh to get this money on the ted stage and then the people in ted and the audience who will fawn over anything they'll they'll you know  i'm sorry, um  Will vote on the winner to get this  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, isn't that wild? I wish it were on android. It's only ios here, but it will be there's no  There's no technical reason why they couldn't have done it on both platforms. It's it's just you're talking with a bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's it's actually not about it's at their editors, but it simulates a conversation  So it's not a real conversation. I think it'll be even more interesting when it becomes a real conversation and it's embedded in a messaging  Uh servers, let's say messengers  Right, right  And those are automated. I think there's a lot of personality. I think you're right though. It's obviously editorial

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, it's an interesting choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine if there was a bot a  Quartz bot or whatever in your messaging tool and this is coming and you can just say hey what's happening today?  And the bot would say well, what are you interested in? Do you want to know about world news? And so you start having a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or with your amazon echo maybe yeah, exactly. I suspect that's why they only put it out on ios  They're just gathering data because that's not the end game. The end game is exactly as you say is a real bot  Yeah, yeah  So why bother developing for a lot of platforms?  You just need to get some information and see how people like it and tailor it a little bit and then you could put it  Out as it really is which is as a bot I want it on my amazon echo. I have now I bought two more
