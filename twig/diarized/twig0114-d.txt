Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, how's it going?  Going great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to be down your way in a couple of weeks.  I'm going on vacation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Going to stay at the Hotel Del Coronado.  Is that a nice place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, beautiful.  You must do the Sunday brunch.  It's amazing.  Yes, the Hotel Del.  That's where they filmed that Marilyn Monroe movie.  Some Like It Hot, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some Like It Hot.  And also one of my favorite Peter O'Toole movies, The Stuntman, was filmed there.  Oh, you'll love it.  Yeah.  So that's why I wanted to stay there because I kind of have this image from the movies  in my head of this classic old place.  So apparently it's got a very nice beach out back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exciting.  That's what I required.  Well, we'll get together.  Excellent.  I'm down there for CTIA.  I'm going to do one little thing and then I'll be having fun.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, whose book is officially out.  Yay.  Public Parts.  And then he froze.  You know, that's a good shot.  You're going to get frozen.  That's a good shot to get frozen on Jeff.  That's a really good shot.  Let's just leave it like that.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog.  That's where he blogs and of course, at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.  Let's switch to camera three.  Danny Sullivan, who's reaching over to get his book from Search Engine Land.  You wrote that too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing.  Just don't show this part here.  It's okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By some guy.  We don't know who.  Search Engine Land is the great blog about all things search.  Somebody said SEO is out.  It's SMO is the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  They're both good things for people to be doing.  People keep mistakenly thinking that somehow social media is pushing away from Google.  And I keep saying, no, the pie of ways, if you think of the ways you're going to get  traffic to your website, that pie has gotten larger.  It's not like the Google slice got smaller.  It keeps growing and growing and growing.  It's just that now we have a big giant Facebook pie and a big giant Twitter pie, a big giant  Google plus pie.  So pie for everybody.  You've got to optimize for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Social media, search, just optimize.  Get your piece of the pie.  Public parts just came out.  Simon and Schuster.  And actually, I want to take some time talking to you about that.  Maybe you know what we should do, Jeff?  We should get you on Triangulation, our interview show.  I would be honored.  Let's do that.  And then we'll just do a whole hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We won't take up any time on it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it's germane to everything we talk about on this show.  You're right.  I'd like to have a whole hour just talking to you.  So we'll book that in.  I'll talk to your publicist, Shelley.  You can talk to me.  Also here from searchengineland.com, the great Danny Sullivan.  Welcome back, Danny.  Thank you for having me.  You've probably been as busy as we have.  This morning we got up early, 10 a.m. Eastern time.  That's 7 a.m. our time to cover the Amazon Kindle announcement.  There was a Facebook announcement yesterday.  Next week there's an Apple announcement.  It's the season of the announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It's like I always joke about it on tech meme.  It's what plays rock, paper, scissors.  And right now Amazon crushed Apple, which had crushed Facebook before that.  So, you know, it's probably due for Google to come up with something else before Apple  can come in and stomp on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, as we begin recording, there's a huge story, which we will get to, about Samsung  making a deal with Apple and a significant deal from Google's point of view as well.  In fact, it could really mean some big bad news for Android in some ways.  But we'll talk about that in a second.  But first, let's start with the Amazon story.  Three new Kindles, kind of a smaller Kindle classic.  No more keyboard on the bottom.  Hallelujah.  The classic.  It's ad subsidized.  Boy, are they getting that price down.  Then in the middle, we've got the Amazon Kindle Touch, which is essentially a classic, except  that the screen is touch screen, so you can turn the page by tapping the screen.  That's a little more money.  And frankly, I'm not sure why people would buy that.  I guess because it's so hard to use a keyboard on the classic.  You have to, you know, use the rocker switch to go to the letter you want, press click  to highlight it.  It's a little bit like entering text on a PlayStation 3 or an Xbox.  And then finally, the big story, which is the color Kindle, the Kindle Fire.  Big surprise.  $199 price point.  Does include one month of Amazon Prime.  Is Wi-Fi only.  A very impressive device.  Looks a lot like a Blackberry playbook.  In fact, that's probably because it came from the same people.  It is about content.  Content, content, content.  And not once during this event did Amazon mention Google.  Or Android.  Or anything.  We don't even know.  We know it's Android under the hood.  We don't even know what version of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be eager to hear what Gina says about this, but she says that she's muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, unmute yourself, Gina.  Or maybe it's us.  No, she said on your end.  We've muted her.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is going on?  We didn't mean to mute you.  While we're unmuting.  I was trying to clever segue there.  While we're unmuting, let me show the video, which is not muted.  If you pull that up of the Kindle Fire ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The instruction we find in books is like fire.  We fetch it from our neighbors.  Newtemberg.  Kindle it at home.  Everlast.  Communicated to others.  And it becomes property of all.  From Kindle, fire is born.  A Kindle for movies, music, web, games, and reading.  Kindle Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Predictions.  Predictions.  Predictions.  Let's start with Gina since we've unmuted you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can hear me?  I hear you.  Awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is such a great announcement today.  I'm totally fired up about the Kindle Fire.  I think it's really, really well done.  The price point is amazing.  This is going to get tablets into the hands of people who are not nerds.  And Android out there.  I feel like there are lots of knockoff Android devices, but this is like Amazon's Android  device.  It really makes Android kind of the mobile platform.  So I think it's really interesting.  Although I'm definitely going to buy one.  Although I was thinking about all of my favorite apps on Android happen to be Google apps because  I'm just so sort of embedded in the Google ecosystem.  So I tweeted earlier joking around that if Google makes Gmail and voice and Maps and  the Google Plus app available on the Amazon app store, you know, I'll really love the  Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But will they?  That's the question, right?  I mean, I would guess, although we don't know, that you will not be able to go to the Android  marketplace to buy apps for this.  You'll have to get it from Amazon and it'll be the apps they approve.  It is a tablet.  And you know, the probably then arguably the next most successful Android tablet is actually  the Nook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People have rooted and turned into a true Android tablet, but that's about the closest.  This is a lot faster.  The Nook is an 800 megahertz single core Cortex A8 processor.  This is the TIO map for running at.  It's unclear one to one point two gigahertz.  Lots of memory on this eight gig storage.  But Amazon was a great pains to say it's all about the cloud baby.  In fact, they said about 18 times that your books will store them for you will store your  content for you.  It'll always be available.  And I really think that that's a backhanded slap to Apple.  In fact, they even showed a core.  You don't need this either.  You got Wi Fi sinking.  Jeff, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What fascinated me most, there was some quote today that said that they don't see this  as a device.  They see it as a service.  And I think that's critical.  Steve Rubel said that, you know, Amazon is selling a device so they can sell content.  Apple sells content so they can sell a device.  And I think that's not not wrong.  And so, you know, the attitude here, I think, changes.  It doesn't matter what the device is to some extent.  I use Kindle software on my iPad.  They'll still give me that on my iPad.  This is just a way, as Gina said, to get it in more hands.  I can't imagine why you would get this if you have an iPad or an Android tablet of any  size because it does limit it.  It doesn't have the camera.  You can't get to the Google stuff and all those things.  So to me, it's, you know, it's for grandma and grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you do everything on the iPad that you could do on the Fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think that probably the video media playing isn't as smooth.  And you can't direct download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I presume I guess you could buy stuff or rent stuff on the Amazon store and play it on.  I don't know.  Exactly.  Play it on your iPad.  So it's comparable to.  So in other words, it's not better than an iPad, except maybe it's smaller than an iPad.  It's smaller, right?  And cheaper.  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot cheaper.  No, but that's the point.  If you already have an iPad, do you want this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know that Amazon needs you to have it.  That's that's the they don't care.  That's what I'm saying.  I wrote an open letter to Mel Carmisen at Sirius years ago with my usual hubris saying, don't  look at yourself as a satellite company.  Look at yourself as a content company.  Put Howard Stern, you know, everywhere and let me get him as a podcast.  They didn't get it.  And no, but that's all right.  But I think that Amazon does get that.  We now understand why they have an app store.  We know why they have the cloud storage.  But it's not as if they're going to drive the business.  The business is clearly not this device.  This device is the lost leader.  So they want to serve you content and store your content and sell your content on any  device at all.  So it doesn't matter to them.  I don't think if they buy this device, if you do buy this device, you're more tied to  them.  You know, they can, you know, knock down the nook and all that.  But they're happy to be, I think, on your iPad or your Android tablet.  Don't you think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's one big difference.  And Danny, I think you might be able to comment on this.  In fact, Andy Anotko, who was at the event today, said, you know what the sleeper announcement  of this is not the hardware.  It's this Silk browser.  Amazon's got a new browser based on WebKit that will essentially they'll cache everything  for you in the browser ahead of time.  And this is a very interesting play.  This is something you will not be able to get probably on the iPad or maybe you will.  I don't know.  But right now you can only get it on the fire.  It would be in Amazon's interest, wouldn't it, to put Silk on every platform?  Danny, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm mixed.  I got one of the nooks and I returned it quickly after realizing I started with the Kindle  earlier this year.  I had been hesitant on using ebooks because I kind of liked the idea of I had a book and  I could do whatever I wanted with it.  And then I started using it and I got the nook because I thought this will be an alternative  to the Kindle because I'd like to read in the dark and I'd like to be able to actually  touch it and whatever.  And I realized that the nook itself and I'll get back to the Kindle, but the nook being  an Android device really didn't deserve to be called that name.  It was simply Android so buried under the under the hood that if you wanted to run any  of the Android apps that I'd already bought and I'd already purchased and I'd already  used on my other Android devices like my phone, I either didn't get them or I had to buy them  new and I had they only were from nook itself.  So that's frustrating, isn't it?  That is.  It's crazy and if you're somebody who has an Android phone and you've purchased some  game or some application that you like using, are you now going to have to go through and  purchase it again because it turns out that the Kindle Fire doesn't actually run it because  not necessarily because it can't run it, but because Amazon perhaps chooses not to allow  you to run it because they don't want to have anybody using stuff that's not in their own  app store.  And I don't know what that case is.  What I do know is anybody who talks about it as being an Android device until we actually  see just how cross Androidish it is, if you will, I wouldn't necessarily call it that.  It might as well be Amazon tablet, you know, with Android being very buried underneath  it.  The price points I think are great.  I mean, I agree that if you've been looking for a tablet and you like the idea that you  just kind of want to surf the web, you're already buying things from Amazon such as  music or in particular books, which is there's still their strength.  This can be a no brainer.  I mean, really, the $79 Kindle is awesome, right?  I ordered that too.  I bought both of them.  Yeah, I bought two today.  I mean, I bought the touch and I bought the Kindle Fire.  I want to look at them both.  The Kindle 79 I almost wanted, but I thought the touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm probably not going to use the touch that I find with the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's an interesting thing there too is like I take a lot of notes in my books.  I use them especially for nonfiction.  So I don't know whether the Kindle that other you notice then they didn't stop selling the  old Kindle right now.  It's called Kindle keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what I suspect do they still have the big one, Danny, the my daughter, the kindle ds

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they still sell as well.  And I suspect what happens is I'd love to play with them, but I suspect that the Kindle  touch will have an on screen keyboard.  Yes, it will.  We've seen it.  So for me, that is going to be well worth the extra $20, you know, to have that sort  of thing. Plus, I kind of do like the e-paper in some situations.  But, you know, I mean, it's I love Amazon.  I never buy music from iTunes.  I've always bought it from Amazon for years now because I've been able to do whatever I  want with my music and put it on whatever device that I want.  And it works perfectly fine with iTunes.  So as a way of perhaps getting people to start having more music, you know, that's that's  perhaps a hidden type of thing, as well as the content that's all involved in this as  well. I'll just be very curious to see what the  Android experience is like and if this is going to be a further fragmentation of it,  because it is frustrating when you are, for example, using a Verizon phone and you find  that you can't get the right app because your Verizon phone isn't supported to point  two or whatever. And they're up to two point three on something else.  And it just gets to be a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, Jeff, you hit the nail on the head when you describe the fact or Steve Rubell  that Apple is a hardware company making a hardware device and Amazon is a content company.  And, you know, there's no GPS in this.  There's no camera in this.  You know, this is the keyboard is, you know, limited.  Actually, it looks a lot in the ad anyway.  It looks a lot like the traditional Android gingerbread keyboard.  But but this is going to be a superb portal to Amazon and Amazon as service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it's you know, I think they see themselves as a service company, too,  with Amazon Web Services.  You know, we'll get to Facebook in a little bit later.  But but I think that all you tie this into with Zuckerberg's view that he's changing the  structure of media now and that the primary means of not primary, but a key means of  discovery and thus distribution won't be brands and it will be less so brands and less so  search. Sorry, Danny.  And more so sharing.  And so the question is, the interesting thing to me is, you know, you look at Facebook on  this, you look at social things on this and social sharing.  Amazon is a little bit social.  You can comment and all that, but I don't have a community at Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. We remains to be seen with how much Facebook will be involved in  Apple's next announcement.  In fact, it looks like Facebook and Apple are kind of at odds with one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So that's that's to me.  Interesting, too, is that if you if you go beyond, you know, the spheres of discovery of  media used to be it was only brands.  You had to go to the brand. You had to buy the publication.  You had to go to the store or whatever.  Then it became search and then it became links through Twitter and Facebook and all that.  Well, that's going to, I think, go nutty here.  And so search, I mean, social and sharing will have a big relationship in how you discover  and view things and then how you view them socially, how you watch them together and all  this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes me wonder if Facebook isn't considering doing a device that's social focused.  I mean, boy, wouldn't this be a smart thing for Facebook to do?  Or maybe maybe they should just be talking or same philosophy, same philosophy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why wouldn't Facebook, you know, be you know, look at what what what Google is doing, right?  The fact that you can do a hangout and watch stuff together.  That's social. The fact that we now search on a topic, you can save that and start to gather  around that topic in some ways.  You know, that could just as easily be a game, though.  I wish I could get rid of the game notifications on Google Plus.  That's another thing.  And so, you know, I think that, by the way, I think the game notifications are gone, aren't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from Google Plus?  I think it went away.  You still get them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I've been getting I've been getting killed with them, too.  I don't play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a fun guy.  OK, I don't have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cause music.  Actually, Danny, Greg Sterling writing on Search Engine Land says that the the Android  Fire tablet is an act of audacity that thumbs its nose at Google, even while using Google's  OS in the background.  It's true. They not only didn't mention Google or Android at the talk,  but nowhere on the device does it mention it.  And they even created their own browser.  With your Google, what do you think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think this is great?  It's a really nice gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google doesn't mind?  I think Google would love this the next time they get called in front of some antitrust  hearing and they're told, you control Android, you do whatever they want.  And they say, well, really?  Because Amazon does whatever it wants with Android.  So what are you talking about?  This is a this is a really good gift for Google in a lot of ways.  Remember, also, as far as Google's concerned, the more people are connected, the more they  win, because a lot of those people are still going to do searches.  I don't know what the hardwire search is on that browser.  I wouldn't be incredibly surprised if it was tied into Google simply because that'll be  the perception of a lot of people who use Amazon that I should just get Google.  Right.  Amazon doesn't have its own search engine, so they're going to have to hardwire it  somewhere.  So they're going to have to hardwire it somewhere.  If they did cut a deal, which could be entirely possible with Bing, which is really their  only other choice, people may very well try to change it or go to it or just go to Google  directly. If they're there, Google still has a very solid brand.  Plus, one of the things that Amazon talks about is, hey, you can get all these copyright  free books. So one of the providers of those, Google.  So, you know, so Google's in the background.  I don't think Google's going, oh, this is a terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, when Google open sourced the project, when they made the decision to make Android  open source, they were wanted this to happen.  I mean, this is you always go into an open source project hoping that other people are  going to use it.  You know, I the Kindle Fire, when I first got my Kindle, it occurred to me that the  Kindle felt like just as much a shopping, a buying machine as it was a reader.  And the Kindle Fire, I think that this is going to be the best buying experience, like  mobile buying experience out there.  Right. Because Google checkout kind of stinks sometimes.  iTunes is annoying because you have to sync and connect.  And I mean, this is it's going to be so easy to buy things through the Amazon ecosystem.  And, you know, I buy stuff from I rent movies and TV and buy all my MP3s like Danny  through through Amazon. I don't do it through iTunes at all.  So I think that's going to be a really good experience.  And what Danny said earlier about, you know, what defines the Android experience?  You know, to me, the nook was never really fully Android because there wasn't an app  store. To me, the app store is the difference.  And it doesn't have to be the Google, you know, the Android market.  The Amazon app store is a perfectly good app store.  And in fact, I'm going to I am going to spend a little time updating my app in the app  store now that I know that it's going to be in the hands of so many people on this on  this device. So, you know, it's interesting, you know, what what makes something an  Android an Android device.  And, you know, I hope that Amazon's lack of mention of Google doesn't mean I mean, my  kind of ideal hippie view of like how open source works and my hopes for this is that  Amazon and Google are going to work together to make Android better.  For that would be lovely. Yeah, that's the way open source works.  Right. If you're exactly.  Yeah. If you're working on the project, then you submit patches back.  And I hope that that's happening or that that's going to be such a fork, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this thing is not even close.  Yeah. Well, we can't even tell what version of Android it's running on.  There's been dissent. Some people.  Oh, yeah. Sorry. I thought I thought that was clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it clear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ours mistakenly reported that it was three one, but it's it's it's definitely two, three.  It's definitely gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw the gingerbread keyboard with the predictions and everything.  So but that doesn't mean you couldn't apply that to some other version.  So you're sure we're sure it's two point three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. If you're Amazon, what do you want Google to do?  I mean, look at what's the negotiation like?  Google says we want to we want to hook into your customers for some way.  Amazon says, OK, if what is that, what's that balance like?  I can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one would hope that they wouldn't share anything at all.  Oh. This has been apparently this is the the rub between Facebook and Apple,  that Facebook wanted customer information from Apple  and Apple said, no way.  That's what stopped integration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Google wants customer information.  I think what they want is the opportunity to talk to the customer  directly through search and its own apps, which aren't there.  So how does Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess you could have adsense on the webpages you go to and silk.  Yeah, maybe not. Maybe they'll strip them out.  This is the thing when you Amazon  acts as a complete intermediate on all webpages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the difficulty is if Amazon starts going through and stripping out  ads on other people's websites, then they get into that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that'll be in court like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't do that.  All right. So Google has that much of a presence.  You know, it was very interesting.  It looked like they've got deals with almost every magazine  right out of the box.  And Conde Nast, of course, heavily featured with Vanity Fair and Wired.  And GQ, they said that they would have interactive apps,  special apps with video, not apps.  I shouldn't even say because it's a magazine newsstand.  They're not saying apps.  It's a magazine newsstand, but these magazines will have video  interactivity and features they don't put in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is it HTML five? Is it, you know, so if you're a publisher now,  what do you what all do you have to do to get on Apple and Android?  Regular and Amazon?  That's a very good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What format are these coming?  So these aren't apps. These aren't standalone apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are not clear. Right.  They have a store,  you know, like a newsstand and call it newsstand, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the thing that may sound dumb and I hate to get back to books,  but what concerns me most about it is I've been playing with the Kindle  and buying more books through it.  My ability to do with these books that I purchased and supposedly owned  are limited. I don't I can't export them.  I can't give them to my kids if they want to read them.  I can't put them onto another device.  I can put them on any of my any of my devices support Kindle, but only Kindle.  And I've got an entire bookcase behind me that is full of books  that I've had for decades that I've taken and I've shipped them  across the ocean twice, the Atlantic, back and forth coming here.  And now the the tablet that they brought out,  I think it's going to further accelerate us all buying these  proprietorially locked up books.  And I don't know what happens down the line.  One of the things I loved about Amazon was when I bought music,  that music was not locked.  It wasn't, you know, I was able to get any kind of song I wanted, it seemed.  And I could use it on any device and I could take it off if I wanted to.  I bought it.  Apple eventually came and did the same sort of thing  where if you want to buy the song, you want it to be un copyright restricted.  You can you can do that sort of thing and you can put it onto a different device.  But people are building entire libraries of Kindle based books.  And I feel like part of me is like we're we're buying  all of our libraries on eight track.  And I would feel much happier if Amazon gave me some long term guidance  into what's going to happen with my books down the line.  I had Stephen Levy's book where I took huge numbers of notes.  And I can't even see all the notes I've I've I've written and all the things  I've highlighted because his publisher or Amazon or the both of them have decided  I've highlighted so much of this copyright violation.  So they can't display them all. Right.  I mean, it's my book. They're my highlights.  If I want to review everything I've highlighted in a book I bought in one go,  it's crazy. So that I feel that's the biggest  misgiving I have in all this.  And Danny, that was really important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really important point, I think, is that is that we're at this  this point, besides being the obvious point about you're right about books and it's a  holy cause, but also who's sucking up to the entertainment industry more,  in what ways to get more stuff.  Right. And I think that the battle for trying to go without DRM now goes the other way,  because if if Amazon or Apple or whoever has control of us and they can hold back,  who's going to get the ability to stream stuff or put stuff up?  We're going to see, I think, the return of more and more DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, that's depressing.  Depressing, depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is why I don't play games.  I'm depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, but I mean, like, I don't know if you can you can see my bookshelf, but I just  clean through it and everything.  And I mean, I've literally moved these books around.  And I and I've gone to that point now where I thought I can't buy any more books, not  because I can't afford them.  I just don't have the storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I want to test how they're they're all the same height.  You do them by size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, they're very complicated by a favorite author and group of author.  Tidy.  So the top shelf is all Heinlein and Peter Hamilton.  And then you get down into some of your alternative history and further down.  That's just this science fiction bookshelf, though.  But so, yeah, they are by height in the sense that I always buy paperback simply because  I prefer the size.  I don't like holding big hardbacks, which is why I love the Kindle so much.  That's why I love getting one of the reasons I wanted the nook was I wanted a small,  light little tablet that I could read before I'm going to sleep or something like that.  That the iPad is like I'm always holding it.  I feel like it's a fall into my face.  So it was worth it for me to get the Kindle.  But I want a library I know I can depend on in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think, of course, we care about that.  But I think that the average consumer isn't really thinking that far down the road.  They just want to read the latest Danielle Steele.  And no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I agree with you.  And I think that's the other thing is I realize is I went through a lot of these books  and I thought, gosh, you know, I I paid seven dollars for this paperback.  I'm not going to get anything for it now.  And in the past, I used to save it because I, you know, I just it was really weird for me  to throw away books and get rid of books.  And now I'm going through books.  And if I do buy the paperbacks, unless it's an author I really love, it's like, OK,  that book is going to get donated or something.  So that's part of my older mindset, which was books or something you hadn't held forever  to goes away.  And that's the same sort of thing with music that I'm kind of going through.  I think with Spotify, right.  It was you bought the song, you owned it.  And then you get a spot.  I like, why do I need to buy that music again?  I mean, you know, aside from the times when I'm rollerblading, I'm not going to have a  good connection. I'm not going to download it.  And I haven't configured it to be offline or whatever it is.  For the most part, I can get songs without having to just, you know, actually own them.  So maybe that's, you know, them damn kids, they're going to have a whole new world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Culture is changing. Culture is changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And definitely think these attitudes are changing.  Like my attitude about books has definitely changed over the years.  I used to feel the same way that I wanted my favorite books and a shelf and my office  and my identity, you know, was kind of tied to that.  I want them when people came into my office to see my books and kind of know what I was  about. But but the Kindle with the Kindle, I just I buy and I read a lot more and I  treated a little more just like, you know, hey, I'm just I'm reading this thing and I  have these highlights. I love highlights and notes.  Although that story, Danny, about you, about you being told that you highlighted too much  copyright violation. That is horrible. I've never run up against that.  That's horrible. But but my attitude has definitely changed.  I mean, if I love a book and I want, you know, or if I go to a signing, an author signing,  I'll buy it and put that on my shelf. But otherwise, I kind of treat them more just  like like magazines, which I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.  I just think it's a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do remember saying years ago, oh, I'll never read an e-book.  Nobody will ever want e-books.  And I think even at the time I said my kids might be different.  Well, it's happened really faster than we thought.  It isn't my kids. It's us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. It didn't take that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what it also says is that with with with Borders Gone,  the role of the publisher is, you know, when I went to work for Advance,  which is kind of nasty, they still own Random House.  I got all excited. I was going to work with a book publisher, Random House.  My boss, Steve Newhouse, said, don't get so excited.  It's a distribution business.  We don't have religious readers, religious authors.  We're just the middleman of distribution.  You're romantic. I know.  And so, you know, I just went through my publishing.  I won't plug the book again, but my editor gave me great service.  But you know, I remember Bennett's serve.  What's the rest? Really?  So you look at Amazon.  But the funny thing is, we still keep on looking at things.  I wrote this five thousand word piece on Gutenberg as the original technology  entrepreneur, and I wanted to sell it.  I sold a version of it to Wired Germany. They asked for it.  I wanted to sell it to a magazine. Couldn't find a buyer here.  So I pumped it up. I was going to do a Kindle single.  I'm telling the tale out of school here, but my publisher, an agent,  got all nervous and Amazon did, too.  You shouldn't have that up at the same time you have a book.  Really? I said, well, yeah, I should.  It's going to promote the book.  It's a disaggregated magazine article is all it is.  No, people will come in and they'll buy it and study your book,  because I think they get the cheap version.  Wow. Wow. Yeah. Right.  So, you know, I'm going to put it up for free eventually, probably from CUNY.  And that's fine. I was going to make any money on it.  I was just going to I wanted to learn about Kindle singles.  I wanted to do a Kindle single and everybody, including Amazon, said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Does anybody think it's a little ironic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Read it.  As the chat room does that, we're talking about books  and reading them on a device named Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only if the books are priced at $4.51 each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a pad moment, isn't it?  Little Ray Bradbury reference in there.  You are a science fiction fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Figure this chat room of all rooms would figure find that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that. I like the irony of that.  I don't know if that's irony.  I don't. I, you know, I'm confused about what irony is.  Let's take a break. We're going to come back.  There is so much more to talk about.  We haven't talked about the Facebook changes, the stuff rolled out at F8.  We haven't talked about the fact that Google Plus had a  one thousand two six one thousand two hundred sixty nine percent increase  in use last week.  And the fact that Spotify now requires Facebook to sign in,  to have an account if you're new.  Lots more to talk about before we do that, though.  I would like to talk about a new advertiser on the show.  We always like to welcome new advertisers.  Yay.  I've talked about that.  Have I talked about Vast Conference before?  Conference call services from vast conference dot com.  You know, I got to log into my account here real quickly.  And I'll show you one of the cool things that happens when you have a  a vast conference is you can name the conferees.  I'll go to my dashboard. I just had a conference call.  Here's so here's the dashboard you get.  Here's usage and so forth. We just signed up.  You can see what your calls were. Here's a conference I had.  And I'll go to the detail here.  I can actually see who was in the conference call, how much time,  their connect time, their disconnect time.  I can actually listen to back to them.  We've got recordings.  This is the kind of detail that you would love to have on your conference calls.  Vast Conference makes it easy.  You only pay by the minute.  So it's very affordable, very straightforward.  Vast will support up to three.  This was a small conference. You can have up to 300 callers at once.  You'll get a regular dial in number as well as a toll free number.  They're using fiber optic lines and high end teleconferencing equipment.  So you get a very high quality, better than VoIP quality.  And their conference call management interface that you're looking at right now  really is fantastic. You can manage users and callers.  You can have question and answer sessions.  You of course can recall as MP3s, lots of detail about usage and billing codes.  They've got a great customer service team.  Really great. I highly recommend them.  And the pricing is very affordable for a regular call, toll number.  And nowadays with everybody having unlimited calling, that's not a big deal.  Two and a half cents a minute.  Six cents if you want to use an 800 number call.  And you decide whether you use 800 or toll free.  By the way, by participant.  So if it's a, you know, your client, you give them the 800 number or a prospect.  You give me the 800 number.  Then everybody you work with, you give them the regular number.  Very easy. There's no commitment, no contract.  You pay only for calls you host.  And we have a deal for you. You can get up to 300 minutes.  Two business calls free.  300 minutes of calling free at vastconference.com.  Use the promo code twig.  So this is even better. You can try it yourself.  300 minutes free. vastconference.com.  Use the offer code twig.  It is, I just love the interface. I love how it works.  This is conference calling in the modern times, the modern world.  vastconference.com.  Somebody's saying you should do a conference call with everybody in the chat room.  You know, I keep planning to do a hangout somehow.  Yeah, we're going to do a broadcast hangout.  And I just haven't gotten around to doing it.  So Google's upset. I'm upset.  Microsoft made a deal with Samsung.  Cross licensing agreement.  You know, with all these lawsuits, I don't blame Samsung for saying,  Let's just, you know, we still got to deal with Apple.  Let's just get out of this with Microsoft.  But Google says, quote,  This is the same tactic we've seen time and time again from Microsoft  failing to succeed in the smartphone market.  They're resorting to legal measures to extort profit from others' achievements  and hinder the pace of innovation.  We remain focused on building new technology and supporting Android partners.  Hey, Senate, go after Microsoft.  No kidding. Don't bother us anymore.  Look what they're doing. Look what they're not.  Mommy, Microsoft's extorting me.  Actually, doesn't Microsoft already get something like five bucks  for every Android phone sold?  I believe that much.  I think it was a lot of money.  So now they've got to deal some sort of cross licensing agreement  in which they'll get paid, I presume, for every Samsung phone sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So instead of Google paying them, then Samsung has to pay them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They listen to Microsoft, not to Amazon.  Not to Apple that's still up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are seven Android developers,  Acer, General Dynamics, I-Tronix, Onkyo, Velocity Micro, ViewSonic and Wishtron,  all of whom pay money to Microsoft whenever they sell a product with Android on it.  Does Amazon need to?  Well, Microsoft hasn't sued them yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, is the same stuff there?  What's the basis of the patent?  What I'm trying to get to, did Amazon cut that stuff out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Interesting question.  HTC too, by the way.  So every time an HTC phone is sold, I was told it's five bucks to Microsoft.  I presume it's something like that now.  Microsoft doesn't even need to have a successful phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They make money.  That's funny.  Did you all sign the petition, the White House petition to end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Software patents.  And as long as I was there, I signed the one about legalizing weed.  Because you're from California.  No, I didn't.  But I thought that was very interesting that that's the number one petition on the Whitehouse.gov  site.  And the petition to do software patents actually is doing pretty well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if it had a patent on selling weed, then I think that would be more support on  the patent thing.  You joke, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As soon as marijuana is legal, that's the very first thing people do, is they patent  various hybridizations.  I guarantee you.  And then let the war begin.  Geez.  Happy birthday, Mazel Tov.  To Google, 13 years, now you are a man.  And you saw it.  You know, I kept after all of these elaborate Google doodles with Freddie Mercury, I kept  clicking this thing, hoping something would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That something would happen, right?  Jim Henson, they got a Muppets eating Muppets.  They got a stuff.  Nothing.  Was it just me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean, they do have other things where they don't go nuts on all this stuff.  So maybe they were tired.  They're busy.  Maybe it was like, hey, it's our birthday tomorrow.  We better do a logo.  Okay.  Whatever you've got.  I mean, there's 13.  There's 12.  And if they did do a big huge thing, then you probably would have had people saying,  oh, Google doing a big thing for your own birthday.  Right.  What about Martin Luther King?  Yeah.  So I don't know.  Yeah, I kind of like that it was understated.  I'm sure the 15 one will be pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some debate over how old Google is.  September 14th, September 27th.  It looks like September 7th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what happened was, and I did a, it's linked to off of our article on search and join on  the 13th, but it was like, when is the Google birthday?  And they're kind of like the Queen of England where she has an official birthday and then  her real birthday.  And the official, what's that?  I'm just laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So her official birthday is this public holiday.  And no matter who is the queen or the king, that will always be the king or queen's birthday.  And then when they're actually born, they got a whole other thing that's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they incorporated September 7th, 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And that's what they used to celebrate.  And they did that for a long time.  And then there was this thing around 2005 when Yahoo had announced that they had a bigger  index than Google and Google went crazy and got really, really upset about that.  And there was like a month of back and forths.  And in the end, and you know, old timers will remember this, you used to do a search on  Google and on the homepage, it told you how many pages you were searching through it,  kind of like going to McDonald's, billions and billions served.  And they dropped that number as part of a post that they did saying, hey, we're seven  years old today.  And since we're growing up, we don't think we should have to talk about numbers anymore.  And they all did this in conjunction with suddenly the 27th being their birthday.  And they've held to that ever since.  But it was, I remember very much being tied into we need an excuse to kind of make it  seem like we're dropping this number so we don't have to have this fight with Yahoo anymore.  We're tucking into our birthday celebrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's bizarre because I mean, really, there is nothing that happened as far as we know  on September 27th, 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Avril was born, right?  Singer.  I saw that on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they registered Google.com on September 15th, 1997.  They incorporated, we think, September 7th, 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, at the Google Zeitgeist conference that they had yesterday, Larry Page, when  he was talking, he said, hey, we're 13 today, although, you know, that's kind of we kind  of debated ourselves.  So that's the date they're going with now.  And unless they get busted for drinking underage, you know, it probably doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How was Zeitgeist, by the way?  What was your what were the takeaways from Zeitgeist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's similar to like a TED event or where, you know, you get a lot of inspirational  speakers that are trying to tell you how the world should be changed better.  And Cory Booker Booker from New Jersey was there from Newark.  And he was incredibly inspirational.  There was any number of inspirational speakers to the point where I just kind of felt like  I needed a panel on why when everybody seemed to know the answers to everything, do we still  not follow those answers?  Any more solutions at this point?  I just you just like why do we not listen to this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the old George Burns line.  He says, why is it everybody who knows how to run this country is working in a barbershop  or a taxi cab?  How come everybody knows how to solve our problems is speaking at TED conferences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it exactly.  They had a fascinating panel with Arianna Huffington and Ted Koppel where Koppel was  borderline grumpy old man, right?  Like social media.  And yet he just kept scoring.  I felt point after point against her on.  You know what?  Journalism isn't just going to go make itself.  She had one point she's like talking about, well, we have all the reports, we have all  the things, it's all going to be great.  He's like, how many foreign correspondents is the Huffington Post run?  And she's like, well, we have some people in Canada and the UK.  And he really was this sort of old school journalist who didn't quite sound like the  typical old school journalists who I think sometimes try to look for excuses.  I mean, he just really felt concerned about the fact that there needs to be more reporting  of things that people care about.  And he was equally harsh on the mainstream media for going after stories that they think  people want rather than they need.  That resonated with me.  But in terms of Google stuff, Larry Page at the end, this was probably a big deal for  him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You live blogged this event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He did this wrap up at the end where I think this is the first time he's spoken at Zeitgeist.  I've only been to it twice.  They've been running him for at least seven years.  But I'm pretty sure Eric Schmidt has always done the closing.  Hey, you've been hearing all this stuff that doesn't really have to do with us.  Now let's talk about us for a bit.  And he talked many, many times about how excited he was about Google+.  Although he didn't really get into any specifics of what it was supposed to do other than  greater sharing, greater social, greater knowledge.  We know it.  Perhaps one of the highlights was really at the end of it when somebody had said to him,  what do you think is the big threat to Google?  And he took the mic and he said really loudly, Google.  And it was that Google is the biggest threat to Google?  Yeah.  And the point was that if they can't learn how to manage themselves and not let their  own internal processes keep them from being developed or going off with stuff, that that's  what will slow them down.  He said something like, there are no big companies that have successful slow decisions or something  like that.  In other words, if you're sitting around trying to figure out every single thing until you  think you've got it right, you're making a mistake.  You need to make your decisions quickly and keep moving forward and keep learning and  iterating from that.  So that was really interesting.  That was when you really felt like you were kind of, Larry was finally loosening up and  you were kind of hearing some things about what it is he's been doing in the past six  months or so that he's actually been CEO and trying to revitalize the company and get them  organized and goodness knows they've had no lack of action going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the stories I've seen, Danny, I think from you and elsewhere was that it seems that  Larry and Eric's rapport is as good as ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see.  Let's see.  I got a little video here.  Here is why I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Larry.  Why I love technology and why I love my job here at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not a...  Thank you.  He's no Steve Jobs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now he's introducing...  He isn't, is he?  He's very nerdy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's Eric Schmidt standing up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I've asked Eric to join me because he knows how to answer the really hard questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's so mild-mannered.  He reminds me of Sheldon in the Big Bang Theory.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But first, I think for everybody here, I really appreciate you all spending two days...  Here's the adult supervision.  It really is.  That's how you characterize it, Danny.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  There were so many that I've enjoyed and I think feedback from you is consistent.  I know, Larry, you feel the same way.  I thought I would read while you're getting your thoughts together and your voice back  a quote from Cory Booker yesterday morning.  But yet we as Americans who drink deeply from the wells of freedom and liberty that we did  not dig, we lavishly eat from the banquet tables that were prepared for us by our ancestors.  We are too often just sitting around getting drunk on the sacrifice and struggle of other  people's labors and forgetting that we're part of a noble mission in humanity.  The First Nation formed not as a monarchy, not as a theocracy, but as an experiment,  an idea that a diverse group of people, that when we come together, e pluribus unum, that  we can make a greater whole out of the sum of the parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This almost feels like a company meeting, not a public event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the only, this is the only part where it became that way.  I mean, that's what's unique about this or smart, if you will, is that they've brought  in all these advertisers and big partners and this has not been, you know, cheerleading  and hey, here's the Google products here.  Here's the Google thing there.  There are some subtle mentions and most of the time the people that are talking will  have a nice thing to say about Google or there's been something that's been about with Google.  Not always.  Sometimes people have put some criticisms about Google as well.  So, but, you know, you want to pump up your partners, make them feel special.  You have them come to a thing where on a panel you've got somebody like Tony Hawk or Cory  Booker talking to them and mingling with them and meeting with them.  That's that makes them feel special.  And this was the sort of the wrap up where you do get that kind of company line where,  you know, here's and even then it was really subtle.  There was no like that is going to bring out the power point and show you where our  projections are and this is how you're going to do better with AdWords and you know, we're  rocking your world with Android etc. etc.  And in terms of the dynamic towards the end, when you get past Eric kind of stepping in  at that point, then they start having this dialogue.  One of the most fascinating parts was when Larry got asked about, you know, are things  harder now or were they harder then?  I think it can seem harder now.  And then Eric's like, Larry, what about that thing when we almost ran out of money?  You know, remember, like we almost didn't have money.  Remember we were running out of it.  We had all the creative redaction program or crap.  What he said where we didn't pay our bills for a while.  Remember?  And then finally Larry's going, oh yeah, it was harder then.  It was hard then too.  Yeah.  But it was sort of like, oh, you just like, okay.  I mean, they clearly like each other and everything, but but it was very polished and you could  just see he's kind of wanting to get into the jokes.  And sometimes Larry was sort of like, I'm just talking because I need to be talking.  And then other times he loosened up and he would say things and he'd give you a laugh  and you really, you know, you saw this sort of personality coming out.  That was it was nice to see.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google to government.  Let us build a faster net.  You saw that Facebook, by the way, has started a political action committee to promote social  media, which strikes me as more to promote Facebook.  I don't know.  What do you think of that, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've spoken well, you know, yeah, it's well, put it this way.  Some of the folks there have read the book, it's an old plug right now, but I think that  I know that they want to change the tenor and tone and substance of the conversation  around certain topics like sharing and publicness, like tracking and all that.  Aren't you nice?  Great book.  Great book.  I said I didn't say the name.  I wasn't trying to plug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just looking for my name.  It's in there.  It's in there.  This is what you do, don't you?  You flip to the index and say where does he mention me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard an old friend, old boss of mine got the book of a night and that's the first  thing he did and he was safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On pages seven and eight, that's good.  That's two pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the law and then the port.  And so, you know, I think that absolutely Facebook has to see that they have to change,  just as Google had to learn that they have to go with policy.  Facebook does too, because they're affected by all this.  They're affected by all this privacy talk, all this tracking and do not track talk.  Not just here in the US, but certainly just like Google in Germany and the EU and all  around and I think that makes a big difference and they have a hard time trying to recast  that conversation.  But they've got to be there.  And you know, the other thing that really struck me after watching Schmidt testify  when we were on last week, that the next day, and I kind of hinted at this earlier, you  really saw that the Senate is going after yesterday's war, which is search, and tomorrow's  war is sharing and signals and all that that I blather on about.  And so this, you know, it's like fighting Microsoft after Microsoft's going downhill.  The Senate's way late to the party, way late to the war now.  And so, you know, the odd thing is you've got to go to Washington and convince them  that the thing that doesn't matter anymore really doesn't matter.  And maybe I guess hope that you don't notice what really does matter in the future.  But in that area where it does matter, there's huge competition.  There's gigantic competition for, you know, look, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter,  they're all competing for, you know, signals, searching, allowing us to share things, and  a few of them on content delivery and discovery.  So there's huge competition there.  And Google does not own that world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's important the government understands these kinds of apps.  I'm a huge proponent, obviously, because this is kind of what I do in my full-time job.  I mean, the government being more aware and more involved in social media is a good thing,  even if it's about Facebook promoting it to them to help protect their own interests.  It might be just about them understanding, our elected leaders understanding how these things work.  I mean, the fact is that this is where the people are, Facebook, Twitter, all these sort of social spaces.  So I think that raising awareness and pushing those up toward government agencies is a good thing,  definitely a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about the new Facebook.  F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg spoke on Thursday.  We had seen quite a few changes already to Facebook, the ticker on the right and so forth.  And then Facebook announced new profiles, the new timeline and stories, and of course,  apps interacting more directly with Facebook.  In fact, I think what they really announced was frictionless sharing.  In other words, the apps just don't even ask you anymore.  They just tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds a little bit like a Ziploc F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, with the tip of the hat to Eric.  So this is the new timeline.  You can turn it on with a little bit of a hack that was published in TechCrunch,  basically establishing yourself as a developer.  The subscribe button already made big changes.  I've got more subscribers than I ever had fans on the fan page.  And they kind of encourage you to go all the way down to when you were born.  And they even say, hey, put a baby picture in there.  So they say, oh, that's me as a general.  Yeah.  So what's interesting is you really this is an ego page, obviously.  And they give you dates in here.  This is the date I graduated from high school.  This is the date I what did I do on this date?  Did not graduate from.  Yeah, I have to have them.  They don't give you, by the way, you know, this is the developer interface.  They don't give you a lot of ways to change this.  For instance, I can't change this from graduated to to ungraduated dropped out.  But but but it does give you quite a bit of,  you know, it takes it takes material from all of your postings  and kind of arranges it into  a pretty cool looking timeline, which you can then modify.  I'm going to raise it.  I think it's gorgeous.  In fact, I love it.  But I'm going to raise the question I raised last week  and I've raised on Twitter as well.  Isn't this going to scare the hell out of people who just want Facebook  to share pictures with family and friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't that what every single time Facebook makes a big change?  The story is huge.  This is not. I know.  I know. A Jay, my son, Jake, is worried that his friends will leave.  He didn't say that whether he liked it or didn't like it.  He was he was playing coy with that.  But what he told me, I call him afterwards, just he already thought.  And he's worried that if his friends leave, that's the value of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's what keeps people on Facebook, is it not?  And that and the fact that there's where else you're going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus. That's what he said, too.  He but he argued that now there are more competitors.  The Google Plus is the beginning of a credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus feels like a Twitter competitor, not a great.  I agree. Yeah.  I know. I don't think people will go to Google Plus to find college  roommates and to share pictures with their mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I to me, this this gives the thing was Zuckerberg made us all do his  plain vanilla before, and I think it's a big change in his head  to really get more designed and to let us have more impact on that.  I don't know. I I'm you know, my problem is I've been doing nothing  but feeding Twitter into it for three years.  I want to look like I have no life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and that's another thing.  Facebook's been saying for a long time. Stop that.  Yeah. I have to say, I am kind of tempted to and I have, as you could see,  fill this out a little bit to put more stuff in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To such a compelling experience that you go into it and you say,  oh, no, actually, it wasn't that year.  It was this year. And oh, I have that picture.  You start because you love to look at the pictures and the  the stories of your life and Zuckerberg's words, which I thought was really interesting.  I think that people are just so,  you know, want to define their identity and so and get so pulled  into personal pictures and friendships that that I think that it's  it'll be initially initially a little hey, you know what happened.  But I think I think then you just get sucked into it.  Let's start with the ticker.  But with the timeline, I think was just is just so compelling that  folks will like it more than want to run from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ticker is really a big part of the of the frictionless sharing,  because if you if you go to your your front page of Facebook,  not your profile page, this ticker going by with people, what they listen to,  what they watched, what they liked, what they read.  And then you just highlight over it and you can see the details of it.  You know, this is this is pretty impressive stuff.  I have to say this is this is really great design.  But it's so much more complicated than it was.  I just I just wanted it is it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And the top stories where they figure out how do you know, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is a top story and then there's more recent stories and and what's  the edge algorithm that they use to do that.  And it's just it's a little confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to say, I've been  you know, there's two significant things going on, right.  There have been the change to the news feed itself, where they're giving you  those top stories and everything else.  And that's the timeline that practically nobody has actually seen yet.  Right. That you didn't do the developer stuff.  You haven't gotten to it.  Yeah, nobody has. But I, you know, I really use Twitter a lot.  And that's just kind of fit for me.  And then Google Plus came along and I found myself kind of jumping into it  and being involved both because I needed to understand it better.  For whatever reason, I kind of liked it also.  And I turned everything off of Facebook, kind of reasons like Julia  where the privacy stuff, I just I just got done with it.  So I fired up the fan page.  That was pretty much it.  And every so often I'd post something there and that was it.  You know, you could do that.  And when they brought in the subscribe and also since  everything's all kind of locked down or not locked down  because I just assume everything I do on Facebook is going to be public at this point.  That plus the new news feed or whatever kind of got me into it.  I know, I'm terrible.  And I'm going over there and I'm like, wow, this is really kind of neat.  This is, you know, I'm seeing stuff from people that I'm not seeing on Twitter,  not because Twitter doesn't show me stuff, but because I have actually different  social networks in different places.  So I'm discovering other content and I'm really kind of enjoying it.  But the privacy stuff, I when they made the change to subscribe  in the news feed, all the old stuff, if you remember a year ago,  and they wrote out yet the news by privacy controls and what can go here  and what can go there.  And I wrote a really long article about it.  All that stuff immediately became outdated.  All those controls don't exist anymore.  They all went away.  We got yet another set of commands and controls on what can you do?  It doesn't do or whatever.  And Danny, I think it's isn't it better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it better that you get the opportunity?  And I think that Google and Facebook are coming together here  to make that decision whenever you share.  Isn't that better than having control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, that's great.  You can make the decision at the time you can do it.  But what what was striking me was when I brought up the timeline,  I'm discovering on my timeline that posts that people had tagged me in  that I didn't realize or hadn't noticed because they move off so quickly  or thrown up on their certain people were identified as friends.  Like randomly decides which one wants to say that you fronted somebody,  whether or not that person was a particularly good friend, bad friend,  you know, not bad friend. Right.  But I, you know, I went through a time on Facebook that I think  a number of people may have been through where you just like,  oh, I guess I have to friend everybody. Right.  And so you're like, why is it featuring that person there?  Why is it not featuring this person there?  And then there was the thing that came out of, well, now you can tell  when somebody was unfriended because it did the wrap up.  And I actually went to and I like got rid of everything  that wasn't stuff that I posted myself. Right.  Because I hadn't realized I had all this tagging that was going on.  I don't even remember the controls that were there.  There are controls now, right?  They're really nice controls.  And if somebody tags you, you can decide whether or not you want that  to go on to your wall slash timeline or not.  But I think in the past, you might not have noticed that it would have happened.  But I just kind of got struck by, oh, wow.  Yet again, I feel like the privacy sands just shifted out underneath my feet.  But the difference was this time, it didn't blame Facebook.  It blamed myself and anybody who was still using base  that expected anything to say that I started to do a write up about it.  Right. Maybe I'll get back to it.  But I was like, you know, I don't want to rain on everybody's parade,  but it feels like everything shifted around again.  And really, it's our own fault because that's what Facebook does.  It's going to move everything whenever it wants to.  And if you haven't gotten the point  at this at this point, that that's always going to happen.  And you never really quite know what's going on with your privacy  and that you just treat everything publicly, then, you know, good luck with that.  It really is a stalker's delight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at look at this.  Eileen just checked in at the break house.  And not only did she just check in, but look, it's put a dot on the map  just in case I'm trying to find her.  I can I can I mean, this is stuff is your friend.  She's my friend, I guess.  Do people know what's going on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she checked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Eileen's hurt now.  She's no, she's my friend. No, no, no.  But I'm also subscribing to people.  I mean, if Ariana Huffington checks in,  unless she's careful, I may well see exactly where she is as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then that's the weird thing, too, again, where the Facebook  sands shift all over the place, right?  It's not just friends in here.  These are people I subscribe to.  If you're if you run a brand or publication, right. First, it was.  I guess you could have a personal account, then it was like groups.  So then people would get groups for their organizations.  But then we got, oh, we can have fan pages.  OK, so now we have fan pages.  And then groups change into something else.  And then fan pages get renamed like pages.  And now and then fan pages were positioned as a way, for example,  authors to go out there and do something on Facebook  where you could share to the public and not have to approve people.  And now so I've got like 3000 fans  and I have like 400 people who've subscribed to me now.  But now I don't want to use my fan.  I don't know what to do with my fan page at this point.  I like did it post out there saying, hey,  yeah, I wish you could move people over.  I wish you could move over on this other thing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're building a tool to let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are. OK, yes.  Yeah, I want to take people who are fans and make those subscribers.  And I want to take people I hadn't said OK to and make them subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bothers people at least who just assume, as Danny did,  that everything's public on here and I'm only going to put stuff on here  if it's public.  But that's not, I would say, the majority of Facebook users.  If you see this as a broadcast medium like Twitter,  you're probably very kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think where it goes, because they don't have the circles  that Google has, you really can't get to to find a point.  I mean, they have now, but I'm not going to go back and redo them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can get to a very fine point.  Look, they now I can you post back and redo everybody to do that.  No, because many of these lists were created automatically by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I know, but even so, you're not going to trust them.  I mean, I think you're going to have three layers on Facebook.  One is a group that you made your family.  You know who it is.  The other is people you've friended and the other is the world. Yeah.  And it's where Gina, you talk eloquently about, you know,  trying to share and having concerns and all that.  What do you think about this as a user of Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The timeline or the ticker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, everything, the kind of sense of privacy  and how you think you'll use it or not use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm honestly pretty wary of the ticker.  I just I don't see myself wanting to say to broadcast what song I'm listening to  or like what I'm cooking that night or what book I'm reading.  I'm pretty and I think this is just because I wrote at Lifehacker for so long  and the site was so popular that I became a little maybe extra protective  of my privacy because I had such a big audience.  I had the privilege of a big audience, but then I but that made me kind of draw  in a little bit. So that's not something that I would want to do.  But I could see how my sister-in-law, for example,  has a close circle of friends and she's a stay-at-home mom.  And I can see how that kind of sharing with her friends would be really gratifying  and would make a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they have Google buzz style privacy issues in here,  but it's so deeply buried that there will not be this kind of brouhaha.  For instance, here's an example.  If I share something with a list of specific people,  the names of all of those people that I shared with are now available  publicly to everybody else on that list.  Now, that's exactly what happened on Buzz.  But it's so confusing and convoluted that nobody you're not going to see  the same hue and cry.  But there are absolutely all sorts of information leaks.  This thing is riddled with information leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  You know, I found myself wondering listening to these announcements like,  what apps did I say it's OK for them to touch?  Because I have given the permission up front instead of during, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that slide. Furthermore, we thought that the like button, for instance,  would only track you if you remained logged into Facebook.  Now it turns out it's always tracking.  That's wrong. That was like so wrong.  OK, correct me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It not only wasn't been fixed, but it wasn't broken to begin with.  And the article that was written was kind of like almost pedestrian.  When when they rolled out the ability for you to first of all, like a page  and see what your friends there in to some degree, it's obvious that  when you go to that page, it's obvious, I think, to, you know,  more tech savvy people, but obvious when you go to that page that  if the button is there and you're seeing stuff and these are all your friends,  that Facebook knows you're on the page, because otherwise had Facebook  do that in the first place, right?  But there was a difference between Facebook has a cookie  so that when you go out onto a page where there's also Facebook code,  Facebook will personalize that page as opposed to Facebook is somehow  using that cookie to track every page you go to on the web.  They're not. They can't.  They can't track every page you go to on the web.  You can only track the pages you go to that have Facebook code on them,  which is a lot of pages, which is everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Facebook's making sure that it's almost that's more and more all the time.  But it's usually so let's make this clear.  Are we wrong when I say that I go, OK, I've logged out of Facebook on my browser,  but I still have Facebook cookies on here, uniquely identifying Facebook cookies.  When I go to a page with a like button, isn't that cookie collected,  regardless of whether I'm logged on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've changed that.  Leo, the story is up on the on the dock.  And there's a journal version of it, too.  It's confusing. And Danny, I'm sure could do a much better job  of explaining this than I can.  But they had a few cookies that did still record in the cookie,  but they didn't log it, they said.  They logged only one cookie, if I've got this right,  to try to track false logins or some such thing that I don't understand.  But even that logging that that non logged recording cookie,  they said shouldn't have been doing that.  And they've changed it. So we'll do that.  Now, if you're signed out, it won't the cookie won't record that you were there.  Right, Danny? I guess the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't gotten that, I guess, because I wasn't that concerned about  what you're saying in the first place.  It's sort of like saying I'm logged out of Google,  but I go to a page and there's Google Analytics and that Google Analytics  recorded that I visited from an IP address or more better,  I'm logged out of Google and I went to a web page  and that web page is showing me ads from Google that in turn may be targeted  through Google's ad system. It's like it.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every page already logs your unique one and only IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this does there.  And so to me, the concern wasn't, oh, my goodness,  Facebook knows I was on that page.  The real concern is much, I think, better than that.  How do I know a page's Facebook is tracked and how do I delete that information?  Right. Yes. With Google, with Google, you can go through and if you're using  web history and you've actually used their toolbar, you can delete all that stuff.  What you can't do with Google is cause Google to  every page it is tracked you from a particular cookie  because they've done that through the ad targeting.  But you can at least opt out of ad targeting altogether.  But I think that's what we really need is like, hey,  if you're collecting information as to what my personally identifiable account  seems to be doing, then give me something like the Google dashboard  and keep growing it so I can see what you've got and I can clear it out  periodically from time to time if I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the dashboard is Google's response to all this.  I doubt you'd ever see anything like that from Facebook, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We think I mean, no, I kind of agree with you.  Facebook always feels like you've got to pull and tug  to get the things that you want because they've changed yet another thing again.  And, you know, but that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you, the other thing that bothers me because we've got it,  we've got to run.  But the coercive nature of the Facebook environment reminds me a little bit of Farmville.  Now, this Spotify thing is a perfect example.  I don't know how they convinced Spotify to do this, but you cannot create  a new Spotify account without being a Facebook user. Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're in the UK. I thought it was.  It doesn't make any better if it's just UK,  but I thought it was only something that was happening in the UK.  I still not if that's the case, I misunderstood that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But in other words, I think that's just the beginning  of this this kind of coercion,  where if all your friends and all the sites you visit,  if you can only make a comment on TechCrunch via Facebook Connect,  if you can only listen to music on Spotify via Facebook login,  this ecosystem becomes a lock in to Facebook and  it becomes very scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that if you're a brand or you're somebody who's running a product, why?  Why would you do this?  I should be able I should be able to interact with you directly without having to go  through some third party to use your products and services.  That's just something you should have a direct relationship with your customer  to begin with.  And I shouldn't have to rely on a third party when a third party may want to do  it to use your service. And I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, there's a huge value to the third party.  You get access to 750 million users.  And who knows what's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who are broadcasting every single thing that they do always.  Who will let all their friends know they just sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it because I already do that.  But I worry about everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's like I know I was thinking the timeline makes, you know,  Facebook like Leo's broadcast.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's where I think I've long I believe that  Facebook, if it can start today, would come out and call itself a sharing service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. But why did they make this pivot that weren't they doing?  All right. They didn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing, Leo, it's positioning.  It started off, you had friends, you shared with those friends and people  that got under this impression that that there was kind of a vault  where I put my secrets with my friends.  Of course, you tell people stuff, they'll blather it.  And it's not you're sharing with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it was like real life in the sense.  Yeah, if I tell you a secret and you tell Danny, well, shame on you.  But I still I'm sharing with you.  I'm not sharing with Spotify.  And I agree with that. I agree with that.  But I think that whether whether that's true or not,  Facebook certainly encouraged the belief  and the feeling that you were vaulting your information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I think that was their mistake.  I think that they did that on Wednesday because they said,  Oh, we have all these controls.  We have all this. We have that.  And when make people comfortable and secure, they shouldn't have.  They should have said, this is a place to share.  If it's a secret, don't put it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You fools. Don't I feel you're being very generous.  I feel that Facebook knew perfectly well what it was doing  and coerced people into putting information in there  in a time when they would have been uncomfortable doing so,  unless they assured them, oh, don't worry, it's completely safe and private here.  Otherwise, nobody would have done it.  Now times have changed.  And we've got Twitter and we've got Google and people are going,  what the hell? I'll share everything.  So now they're saying, oh, oh, yeah, by the way, you shared everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I take the point, Leo.  But by the way, last week when we disagreed,  people loved the fact that we disagreed.  We didn't always agree. So it's good. We're disagreeing.  No, I'm not a conspiracy theorist that way.  I think I think they I think it was it was the change from being  in a closed community of a college to the world  and that they architected something that was made for a campus  where there are certain norms and understandings of how the society operates.  And the world does not operate that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Campus is a closed place with security.  And your friends are on your dorm room hall and in your classrooms.  And it's it's it's an enclosed.  This is about connection.  Yes. Right. Facebook was about connection, you know, initially.  And connection is a lot about intimacy and about sharing things  that you don't want other people to know.  And that's just kind of inherent in it.  You know, when the timeline came out, I really started to think about,  you know, public performance versus like who you really are.  You know, I'm going to publish my wedding pictures, for example, on my timelines.  It was a big, big event in my life,  but I'm not going to publish the details of my horrible divorce.  You know, and so I put out this question to my Twitter followers,  like the person that you publish that you that you write,  you know, the stories that you write in social media, is that the real you  or is that the published kind of public polished public you great conversation?  And someone said the person who I am online is the person my grandmother thinks I am,  which I thought was such a great answer, because you kind of, you know,  you edit things down and, you know, don't get too controversial  or too opinionated here or feelings.  But I think that's one of the risks of kind of living in public.  And actually, I wanted to have this conversation with Jeff, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. But, but, you know, wouldn't you say that that what this does,  that the edging of more publicness and police that room,  I'm not trying to plug the book now, but that it changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's wrong with plugging the book? Plug the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It changes society. Right.  So so if I may use you as an example, if this was 30 years ago,  you would have had a reason to be very cautious about saying  that you were lesbian. Right. Right.  And the consequences of doing so and the the benefits of doing so.  The equation was utterly different.  Now, I argue in the book that publicness was the greatest weapon  that gays and lesbians had against the bigots who forced them in the closet.  I also argue that no one should be forced out of the closet.  But the equation there passes to a certain point where  you come out because it does  challenge the bigots to say, you got a problem with this? Right.  And then you come out because you can and then you come out  simply because you want to and why not? Right.  And and but but the act of being public in those things,  I do believe leads in bit by bit brave step by brave step to more tolerance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. I completely, completely agree.  And you know, it's it's it's OK for me to be out of closet to grandma now.  Maybe a few generations ago, it was not. Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My gay uncle, may he rest in peace, Richard.  My grandparents to their dying day or not to their dying day,  but almost to their dying day, they just kind of didn't get it.  And I'm very proud of my father that he made my uncle tell them.  That's neat.  And it was very neat because he had to be him.  But here's the point.  He had to be himself with his own parents.  Even though he lived with Jay, the same guy for for 35 years,  a long time companion.  Cognitive dissonance is a very powerful force in parenthood. Right.  But but, you know, I think that that's important is that the closer  you feel you can get to your authentic self.  Isn't that a better word? Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I agree. I do agree with that. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said we're on privacy and somebody's yelling at the chat room,  but there's a lot of privacy.  I want to mention one more thing, if I may, because I just want to say ha ha ha.  The Wall Street Journal was going wacky with all kinds of series  about how how awful companies are, what they know about you.  And cookies are evil and tracking is awful and yada yada yada.  Well, they just changed their quote unquote privacy policy,  which means that they are now going to attach your real name.  And mind you, most media properties do not have your real name.  They don't know who you are. They know your IP.  They don't know who you are.  The Wall Street Journal, because the subscription has your name  and your address and your credit card, and they're going to attach  your real name to your browsing history without notice, consent or control.  Oh, yeah. Wall Street Journal, you're such a protector of the people.  She's Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That includes, by the way, all things the market watch,  Baron's smart money as well as WSJ.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I assume it already wiretapped at all anyway, so I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, Rupert. Bravo, Daddy. Bravo.  You know, I teach my entrepreneurial class.  I always go through the first class, the business plan for entertainment weekly.  Not quite rest in peace.  And may I rest in peace there.  And I was going through the budget this time and I saw there was this line  for list rental and I forgot about this, that that, of course,  magazines sold your name and your address and the fact that you read that magazine  openly, no notice, no consent, no opportunity to change it, no privacy policy, nothing.  It used to be a lot worse.  We have a lot more controls now, except at News Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that funny? Isn't that ironic?  Am I using it properly now?  Yes.  Oh, I didn't go to college. I dropped out.  Let's quickly, as we're running out of time, get to a Gina's Tip, Jeff's number and my tool of the week.  And Danny, just chime in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we go to Jeff's number first? Because we lost Gina's video.  Yes. Let's start with your number, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'll go to two different numbers. There are actually three real quickly.  One is all things D already has an estimate up that Amazon is losing $50 per Amazon fire.  Who knows how they got that number, but I find that interesting.  Number two, Netflix has lost nine billion in market cap and there's speculation that it makes it now an acquisition target.  At the same time, Google has reportedly offered four billion for Hulu,  which I think all ties back into our earlier conversation about content and who can offer what to whom through what.  And I think we're going to see an interesting war going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might point out that it was Gene Munster that came up with the $50 loss per Amazon fire.  Gene is not, despite the fact that he's a well-known analyst from Piper Jaffrey, not notorious for his insider accuracy.  So one of the teardown sites said it was $188 per based on purely components.  So it's probably very close to cost if not a loss.  It's a loss. Yeah.  Yeah. We got Gina back or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Gina.  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speak. We don't need to see. We'll imagine.  Oh, we do. But we do.  You can hear me OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great. It's a great tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, the visual really can be me demonstrating as Gina does talks about this feature of the week.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool. Yeah, that sounds good.  So Google Plus launched a feature this week where you can share circles that you love this.  Yeah, this is really neat.  So if you build up, say, a circle of great photographers or fantastic twig guests or people who, you know, basically your own suggested user list,  you can go into the circles.  Leo, I can't see what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm doing it. I've gone into the circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gone to your circles area and you can drag and drop a circle into the top half of the screen or just click the share tag, which is on the circle as well on the circle itself.  Right. There's a share link.  So you could share and then you can write a comment saying, hey, this is my think up circle or my twig circle and then post to your stream.  And then other people can see that list of people in your circle and subscribe to it and see the people who are in it.  They can they can circle people selectively or they could circle everyone in the circle.  And the name of the circle is still private.  And you're actually just publishing the circle as it is at the moment.  Like if you change the circle afterward, your post doesn't change.  So people are actually kind of forking the circle and make just thought of a great game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could create a circle and say, guess my label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a really good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's here's something that I didn't know, which probably all of you knew.  But if you click add circle, what I was doing, which is crazy, is slowly one by one selecting everybody from the circle.  You don't need to do that.  You nearly need to create to add to an existing circle.  And then if you click the blue button, it will add everybody in this list automatically to the circle.  So you don't have to do it one by one. You can do them all at once.  You probably all knew that.  But it took me about four or five times before I figured that sucker out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room said that it's a follow Friday release to help.  It's a really good way to suggest users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it. There is a limit.  Only two hundred fifty people per shared circle.  So if you have a massive circle, I can hear Scobel crying.  Oh, that's how I found out. Scobel went, what?  So but I have immediately I immediately went through all of the people who are sharing photography circles and added all the photographers.  And it really does make a big difference.  What's happened, though, is now my Google Plus stream is very photograph heavy.  I don't mind that.  But it's made it really feel like Google Plus is the place where photographers go to share.  But that's fine.  There is a search you can do.  If you find a shared circle, you'll see there's a common text that Google puts every time in the share.  I can't remember exactly what it was.  Something like shared circles with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shared a circle with you.  Shared a circle with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's how you can find all of them.  Thanks to the new search.  Thank goodness.  Finally.  Oh, so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's a very, very good way to find a lot of circles that people have have shared.  Oh, there was a problem.  By the way, we were saying in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just got an error.  There was a problem performing a search.  Please try again later.  That's not what you expect to hear from Google ever.  My tool of the week is actually a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, you know, we're getting ready for the iPhone 5 to come out.  And I thought while I still have the wherewithal before I have to buy an iPhone 5, I would try the new Samsung Galaxy S2.  There are Galaxy S2s for every carrier except Verizon, which has used the Droid Bionic as its big screen Android phone.  This is the Sprint version of the Galaxy S2.  They call it unaccountably the Epic Touch 4G.  But it is, in fact, a Galaxy S2.  And I have to say, I love it.  That big screen.  This is the four and a half inch screen.  Some of them have only a four point three inch screen.  It actually makes everything very, very legible and clear.  I'm using the TouchWiz interface.  I think they've actually improved TouchWiz to the point where you might even want to use it.  But of course, you could put other launchers on there as well.  This is absolutely my favorite phone.  And the image quality on here is spectacular.  In fact, that's the second tool I wanted to share, which is a HD camera application that I found on Amazon's Android Web Store called HDR Camera Plus.  And the images on this are spectacular.  It takes three exposures, each of which is, I would guess, a couple of stops apart and then merges them together into stunning HDR very quickly.  This is an HDR I just took this morning of John Slanina on our control tower.  And it just really is lovely.  I want to see it in Trey Ratcliffe's hands. Fast.  Oh, no. See, this is how you could be a Trey Ratcliffe without Trey.  I could be Trey. Yeah, exactly.  Because you don't have to. This company that makes this Amalance does, in fact, make PC software for doing HDRs.  But this does it all pretty automatically.  There are settings within it, and it does a spectacular job.  And that complements the already excellent 8 megapixel camera in this phone.  I really think this is a fantastic phone. I'm really excited.  And I wonder when the iPhone 5 comes out next week.  You know, they say that they've added voice dictation, the new assistant, which is very similar.  There are really going to be two things in the new iPhone that are straight out of Android.  One is this dictation.  And the other, of course, is the improved notification system that looks exactly like the Android notification system.  So we'll see what else iOS 5 can bring to the table.  But for right now, I really love this phone.  This replaced the G2X, which I was using from LG on T-Mobile.  Also Sprint's the last company still offering an unlimited data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure it's not long for this world.  All right. That's my tool. Danny Sullivan, anything you'd like to share as a tip, trick, tool, tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this will be one of my own. You seemed to like the periodic table of SEO last time.  I've got another one you might like.  We did a little three minute video.  And if you're at Search Engine Land, you go to the home page, you'll see at the top, we have the little navigation links.  And one of those is SEO.  When you go to that, you'll see that we've added a new movie and we work with the people over at Common Craft.  It's like three minutes long.  It's like this is what SEO is.  And it's not like make sure you get your black hat up here.  Make sure you're like doing your link spamming there.  It's like this is how search engines operate.  These are the kind of main factors they look for.  It's designed to be the kind of thing you could show to somebody who has no technical background at all.  So that they understand what's going on with all that sort of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Common Craft. I think what they do is just great.  They really are experts at explaining stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a real pleasure to work with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to searchengineland.com and you click the SEO link, you'll get, of course, this,  which we talked about before, the periodic table of SEO ranking factors.  And then this very clear, easy to understand explanation of SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The movie's up there.  The other thing, by the way, I'll mention, and this isn't a new tool.  I just always get surprised most people don't know about it.  It's called doodle, D-O-O-D-L-E dot com.  And it is if you've ever said, like, tried to schedule a call with more than like three people or two people  and you're emailing back and forth, can we go here? Can we go there?  You go online, you set up a times that are free for you or times you think everybody can do it.  You can send everybody the URL. They can go through. They can add themselves.  I can say I can do it this time. Maybe I can do it that time.  And it just makes getting together a snap.  I wish they had a better name for the service because I can never remember what it's called.  But it was been one of those essential things I use all the time when I got to try to find a common time for everybody to meet.  Cool. What's the URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doodle.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doodle.com. D-O-O-D-L-E dot com.  Yeah, I know it doesn't really...  Nothing to do with doodling.  Nothing to do with doodling, but it's still a great service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very good. And so much to have. So great to have you on the show.  Danny Sullivan is at Search Engine Land. We always enjoy having you on. Thank you for being here.  It's great to be here.  By the way, people were asking, it's HDR camera plus.  There are a number of very similar programs, unfortunately, in the Android marketplace.  This is the one. It's from a company called Almalense.  And it's the plus symbol, not the PLUS on here.  $299. That's the program I was recommending.  It's easily the best HDR program I've used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Leo, by the way, did you get Apple to finally let you go to the thing I saw here?  No.  Really? I thought it was crazy because we don't hear from them either.  I kind of thought it would be alright for me. I assumed you'd have been there, that you're on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In some ways, what he's talking about is the fact that ever since I streamed Steve Jobs' iPad announcement  with my laptop pointed at Steve, I've not been...  I don't know if it's related. They never said anything. They never called me. They never talked to me.  But I would suspect it's related. I haven't been invited since to Apple events.  And to be honest, in some ways I kind of like it because then I could say,  See? I'm independent. They don't give me nothing.  But I feel bad for our audience. We do cover all of those events.  And we will in fact be covering Apple's October 4th announcement live.  And we have plenty of people inside and outside the event.  You can't really cover it from inside the event.  You kind of do the best job of covering it outside, watching all the live blogs.  My real request to Apple, perhaps poorly couched, was would you please stream the damn thing  so that we can all watch it together? That's what I would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish Amazon had done that as well today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, streaming... Thank you very much. How did you find that?  Google search.  Anyway, I don't care. I don't want to go, so don't try to get me in there.  I really just wish Apple would stream it because we actually do better coverage sitting here in our studios  with correspondents out there and able to talk to people.  That's what we did today with Amazon. That's what we did with F8 last weekend.  That's what we'll be doing October 4th starting at 10 a.m. Pacific.  That's 2 p.m. Eastern Time at twit.tv on October 4th, Tuesday.  It will be a lead-in of course for MacBreak Weekly.  Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Travis's new book, available everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And thank you, Twiggers, for buying it.  I'm very grateful when I see the tweets and the G pluses.  And I'm very, very grateful. Thank you.  And I want to hear what you think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and Eileen, let's book Jeff into triangulation so we can sit down and spend an hour talking about this.  It's a very important issue.  And obviously you get a lot out of that when we talk on the show, but I'd like to get more.  And Gina Trippani of SmarterWear.org.  We don't see you, but we know you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
