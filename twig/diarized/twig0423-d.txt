It's time for TWIG This Week in Google and I'm Jason Howell. Leo Laporte is not here.  He is traveling the world. I don't even know what magical wonderland he is at today. He's  probably sleeping actually at this point because he's on the other side of the world. But more  power to him and I wish him the best on his travels and having a whole lot of fun. Maybe  I'll go to France someday too. Who knows. But I have in so I'm here in place of Leo and we have also Jeff and  Stacey are both out today. But we've got an awesome lineup starting of course with someone  who you're probably already familiar with from earlier this week because it has been  the week of Ron. Ron Richards, my co-host on All About Android. How's it going Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good to be back three days in a row in the twit camp. This is this is my swan song  on the week of Ron. So thanks for having me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are we going to do on this network when Ron goes down to one day a week again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know man. I don't know. But you know I do love me talking some This Week in Google.  For some reason I seem to always end up getting scheduled when you're here Jason. Not that  that's a problem. I love that. But it's it's it's fun to talk about a little more than  just Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely. I completely agree. Also joining us and one of my favorite guests on  the show and I think I've already told you that in the past. Matthew Ingram is here.  I just love your perspectives and I love the work that you do. And it's great to have you  here today Matthew.  I love you too.  Oh shucks. It's a total Google love fest around here.  Which is kind of fitting because you know the show is obviously you know it's dedicated  to Google. It's in the title This Week in Google which kind of ties right into the very  top. Apparently five days ago it was a Googleversary. Google.com domain was registered 20 years  ago today if today were September 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this actually had me thinking when was do you remember the first time you became  aware of Google and or used it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And so because like right around this time 1998 I was or 97 right. I was a I was  a diehard Alta Vista guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds about right for that time. It was the Alta Vista. A lot of the yeah I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about Dogpile? Do you remember that?  I remember Dogpile.  Yeah Dogpile was a little later.  You could search a bunch of different engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember Wired had their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah at that time we came out you know like we're coming off of Yahoo in the mid 90s and  it was it was all curated and it didn't really have it wasn't really searching it was just  more curated right.  And then and then you're right.  Hop out from Wired and then Alta Vista and then Lycos.  Lycos yeah.  Yeah Lycos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually I remember thinking when Google came out I thought A that's a dumb name and  B I thought you know Alta Vista is pretty good.  Like how much better could the search engine possibly be like Alta Vista find stuff right  that I need.  It's not that like it's not rocket science.  How much better could this search engine be and well as it turns out a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do I do remember that as well.  Alta Vista was at the top of my list.  It was my go to.  I don't know if it was right about this time 20 years ago today but that seems about right.  God 20 years ago that feels like a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alta Vista was like the game changer for me because I'm like wow this is actually giving  powerful results.  And I remember playing with InkTomy.  Do you remember InkTomy?  Yeah right.  Yeah InfoSeek.  Yeah it was a it was a it was a wasteland of search engines out there in the late 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we just didn't know we didn't have the body of knowledge around what search could  be and now it feels so dominated.  I mean you know we've got some stories potentially in the lineup for today that are talking about  how tech as you know as an industry and especially the big four the big the big the major tech  companies are kind of at a point of inflection right now where suddenly all eyes are turning  onto them and saying hey wait a minute maybe you control too much.  Twenty years ago today search was a lot more innocent.  That's just all I remember writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the time I was writing financial stories for a newspaper in Toronto.  I was writing about the stock market.  I wrote about Google's IPO in particular because it was an unusual kind of IPO.  It was a Dutch auction if you want to know the details anyway.  At the time it was unusual.  Their shareholders letter like founders letter was unusual.  The fact that they were going to keep so much control is unusual.  And I remember writing a column.  The consensus was that this stock was not going to be that great because there were  lots of other search engines.  Google didn't really have that much to bring to the table as far as anyone could tell.  It certainly didn't have a business model at the time.  So everybody was like it sounds great and it's got a weird name.  And but should you buy it?  Probably not.  So interesting dumb move there historically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never really know that stuff back at the time.  But it also had a very simplistic approach and that's something I've carried forward  for a long time.  That definitely helped it back then because things were you know the Web was a pretty  noisy place.  It still really is.  But when it came to search that was one of the few places that you could go and feel  like you weren't bombarded by a million other things at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it was also I was just I also remember when Google first came out and what I first  discovered it had to have been I wasn't as early as 97.  I would be I would be lying if I was like I was there early on.  But realistically probably like late 98 99 is when I caught wind of it.  But the two things that attracted me to it was just the the plain white you know minimal  design you know and you just got you just got results and you know this is before they  rolled out the ad model and things like that.  And then also the gimmick of the I'm feeling lucky button that I think that was that that was  the thing that someone's like oh have you seen this you just hit this button it goes  anywhere on the Web and it's like you know and that was you know it's having a kind of a  fun approach to search that the other ones like Alta Vista while it was great was very  it was from digital it was I.T. driven you know like it was very you know bare bones and very  kind of boring.  So Google brought a little fun to the table I thought at least at that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well and at the time the Google the big criticism was sort of no business model but then  they quickly basically borrowed a business model from Overture and Bill Gross.  But it was that was probably the single best kind of accidentally like backing  into a business model that we've ever seen certainly in my lifetime.  The amount of value that that has generated is mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah it's crazy because he was really right around the IPO.  I mean I remember the flurry.  I mean we didn't see maps or Gmail.  Or all of the all the things that we associate with Google till the mid 2000s like 2003  right like around there.  Like I remember the flurry to get a Gmail account like you get a beta invite and all this  sort of stuff.  You know but at the time in the 90s it was just search and it was just that you know  ads against search and and for some reason it stuck out.  And I remember I remember I remember the day I switched you know to Google as my primary  search engine and when I switched from IE to Firefox as my primary browser those were  like two big days in like 99 2000.  I remember happening.  Now what about switching from Firefox to Chrome though Ron.  That was that was probably 0 6 0 7 maybe a little later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same time for me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mentioned to Leo the other day when I was on that one of the big moments for me Google  wise was when they launched Google Earth.  I'd seen before which they acquired but Google Earth was a mind boggling.  It was one of those moments when like even as a jaded sort of tech reporter I felt like  man we are living in the future.  Like this is you can zoom in.  It's like you're it's like science fiction.  I completely I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It made it made the world feel accessible which is exactly what it was doing right.  It allowed you to really just pick a location on the globe and say I want to see what's  happening there or what happened there at a certain point in time.  And before that it was just never that easy and never.  I think it was a really cool tool.  But it's still amazing.  Cool.  Yeah.  And Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean Street View.  Our show is amazing.  The newspaper newsroom shut down like productivity dropped probably to zero because everybody  had to go check out their street and their house.  Right.  And I had a woman I worked with who let out this scream and I asked her what was wrong  and she said look at my house.  And if you went by her house she had been getting her groceries out of the car when  the Google car went by.  So it was basically just her butt.  She had bent over into the car and she's like oh my God.  I said don't worry like a year from now they'll get some new shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No the Internet is forever but not Street View.  Yes.  They refresh those things.  You're OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before we before we move on I just I ran I just ran into a very funny Google esque  thing because I wanted to you know we're having this little nostalgia trip and I wanted  to pull up like you know when did stuff certain Google products come out and things like  that. So I just went to Google and wrote Google history and the search results I got  were welcome to my activity to find your search history and it's all about viewing and  controlling your account.  I can't actually find the history of Google because I'm getting all return results about  my history with Google and shows you how pervasive yeah how pervasive it's become in  our lives.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually in terms of the thing that makes the biggest difference to me sort of  on a day to day basis with Google it's not you know Google Maps is great and everything  but Google Photos changed my life in a lot of ways.  I mean just having everything there having it searchable all the time being able to just  type in my daughter's name and photos come up.  It's really it's simple but it did change things for me significantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also looking at it in the context of 20 years ago 1997 was also the year that Ask  Jeeves came out which is now Ask.com which at the time I had trained myself in using  Alta Vista to do keyword based search like realistically in this Google search for Google's  history I should have searched Google company history and that would get me better results.  But I remember at the time Ask was like you just ask it a question and it's natural  language and that'll never work.  But I realized a couple of years ago Jason I think we talked about this on another show a  while back.  More often than not I'm not doing keyword searches on Google these days I'm doing what  is the temperature in Chicago right now.  And I'm asking Google natural language questions and it's answering me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Google has formatted its business around that right with a system with Google Voice  Search and everything like that.  Their keep continues to strive towards a more conversational approach.  But yeah I remember that back then and I remember using Ask.com and going wow this is  really cool I don't have to like think of a syntax or whatever I just asked it a question.  It didn't always work the way you expected it to.  But but you can see where that hit where that led to.  I mean that's really where we're at right now with Google's muscle behind it.  That's what we have and it's super effective.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've noticed that the natural language questions work way better.  So if I'm if I just search keywords like record phone calls Skype Chromebook or whatever  which I was doing recently I don't get as good results as if I type in how do I record a  Skype call on my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And interesting.  Well Google we love you.  That's why that's why we're here and that's why we just spent 10 minutes talking about  your 20 year anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey nostalgia nostalgia trip sign me up for any time you know.  I'm surprised they haven't done some sort of like try Google in and a year you know and  it will change Google to look like how it did in 2000 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be really cool.  They should totally do that.  There you go Google.  Free marketing ideas.  There you go.  If Sundar is listening.  For their 25th anniversary just for the day even.  Well yes we know he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sundar is a big fan of Jason and I so we're a positive that he tunes in anytime we're  talking about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sundar is not quite a friend of the show by a technical sense yet.  We have yet to interview Sundar on the show but once we do he will and I'm sure it'll  happen he will become friend of the show.  Maybe it'll happen this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm willing to give him future friend of the show designation.  He's going to be a friend of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a little creeped out right now.  All right. So hey why don't we talk about I think this was the big news yesterday and  it's kind of a you know like here we are to spoil the party.  But droid life went on a tear if you didn't know yesterday if you were waiting for  Google's upcoming announcement of their new pixel lineup of devices we knew because  Google had posted a video teasing something happening on October 4th.  It was a short video kind of a little cryptic you know do you want better battery life.  You know do you want your phone to be smarter.  It asks all these questions.  Didn't really announce an actual event.  Well since then Google has sent out press invites for an official event that happens  on October 4th in San Francisco 9 a.m.  Pacific 12 p.m.  Eastern. And that's exactly a year from this time last year when Google showed off  its first generation pixel devices.  So we know what's in store particularly because droid life spoiled the party and  revealed literally.  Well I mean maybe they didn't reveal everything but they revealed everything that anybody  was waiting for.  And so we can go through these piece by piece but I think you know obviously the new pixel  devices is something that everybody's looking forward to.  They're called the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL whole variety of colors.  In fact this one the XL has like a two tone color with the glass on top and then you  know the white bottom part of the phone.  And so in many ways looks very similar to last year's models but with some changes.  But the cost I think the cost is pretty in line as well too right.  Like the smaller Pixel 2 which has HTC's involvement comes in around six hundred forty  nine dollars for sixty four gig seven forty nine for the one hundred twenty eight gig.  And this is what you're seeing right now the Pixel 2 with HTC and then the larger one the  XL comes in around eight forty nine for sixty four gigs or nine hundred forty nine for  one hundred twenty eight gigs.  So we are in premium smartphone territory.  Matthew what what is your phone.  What's your daily driver.  Is it an iPhone or do you have the Pixel phones or what do you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually just upgraded.  I've got a Samsung Galaxy 7.  Before that I had I had an LG I had an Nexus 6.  I liked the Nexus 6 actually and I do I kind of even though I have a Galaxy now they  were having a deal my carrier so that I did like having a Google phone.  I did like having like a lack of crap where from from Samsung or whoever I liked having  just sort of Google experience and I liked getting updates you know as soon as they were  pushed out instead of waiting for Samsung or whoever to push them out.  So I've definitely thought about the Pixel.  It's a little out of my price range like I'm trying to keep costs down.  I can't like I'm not Leo I can't buy every phone you know that comes out for twelve  hundred bucks or it just seems like.  Yeah and I was not I was like the X the iPhone and a 10 or X or whatever.  And I mean the cost of these phones is just astronomical.  I've got kids in university I can't spend you know two thousand dollars on a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah a thousand dollars every year because we are addicted to upgrading our phones every  year for some reason.  Yeah. What I mean what do you think Ron.  I know that you are kind of at a point right now you just got the Pixel because your.  Next bit Robin crapped out not too long ago.  So you got that second hand but are you thinking you might.  I mean sometimes Google has like a trade in value sort of thing.  Maybe you trade up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I'm going to I mean I'm going to keep it open mind.  I will think you know we talked a little bit about this last night and all about Android  and I was I was thinking about it this morning and I'm if these leaks are to are true.  I'm a little disappointed similar to how I was disappointed last year that these are  all high end flagship price level phones and there's not a three ninety nine version.  You know I would love I would love Google to take the pure Android experience and make  it more affordable for people.  Last time at the pixels they had a great financing option and it was exclusive of Verizon  which always has a subsidized phones and that sort of thing.  But you know I get that they want to show this is the best that Android can do.  But a part of me think it'd be great if they put out a one plus competitor or a you know  like that mid range phone as an option you know because honestly that's been you know  like the pixel I did I did get a second hand pixel and that's been the closest to a  flagship phone I've ever had.  Jason you know this I've always had kind of the middle of the road you know the kind of  you know what Google put out the Nexus five was three ninety nine.  So you know so while I think these phones are nice and new hot and sexy kind of new  models I wish there was a little more affordable option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I do too.  And I think they could do it.  I mean they certainly there's nothing stopping them.  I guess they just want to be you know they want they want to sexify Android phones a  little bit which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah they want to boost the brand image.  It really seems like because they have to.  I mean I think we even said this last year they have to justify the cost.  Why does your phone almost cost a thousand dollars.  That's that's an insane price price category for that to fall into.  And is that going to limit people buying the phone.  I mean do we feel like the pixel experiment one year in paid off for Google.  I think Google I don't know if their intention out right out of the gate was to be a  Samsung.  But I mean I've seen some out in the wild not in an overwhelming amount not nothing  close to what you see with Samsung.  But Google's done all right with that right from a marketing standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they have I don't know sort of revenue wise whether it's making a big  difference for them.  I've certainly seen lots of people talking about it.  I can't say that I've seen that many.  I mean I'm in Canada so maybe that has something to do with it.  But I do kind of wish the you know to Ron's point the Android phones have had kind  of a reputation that they're they're down market you know they're they're cheap  phones for sort of nerds and and I could see that they want to try to move up the  kind of scale a little bit.  But I don't see why they couldn't do both at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah agreed.  I think I think that a part of it is that I think it's the pixels have been a  success for Google because clearly they're doing it again.  I think they're not scrapping the program or anything like that.  And if the rumors and Jason we were talking about this over email earlier if the  rumors are true that Google might be hovering around HTC and purchasing their  phone business it appears as if it's so good that they are getting in bed with a  manufacturer.  And clearly it's working on some level.  But I don't know what the what the goal is internally inside Google is the goal to  just have a presence and be on the shelf at the carrier stores or is it to set the  expectation for the OEMs to follow or is it to compete with Samsung.  There are so many different ways to approach it and I know going back to future  front of the show Sundar I don't know what their goal with the strategies with  these phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that's why we need to have Sundar on and say what is the goal of the strategy  with these phones Sundar.  And he would answer and then we say thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we would get we would get the stock marketing answer to be like do we want to  make a phone that shows what and what the pure Google experience and all that sort  of stuff. I mean I could hear him saying it he said it at last year's event.  We've we've seen that.  But from a sales standpoint like I don't know if Google wants to compete with  Samsung. You know the sheer volume of like is Samsung being in the Android phone  business good for Google.  Yeah it is absolutely.  Yeah because increasing Android's market share right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it definitely does not seem like the goal for Google is to push all of its  partners out the door and be like nope we've got the only phone that anybody ever  wants. It seems just like like a part of me almost feels like Google's doing it  because they feel like they have to do it like we have to have hardware that has  our name on it. We're Google and we we make the phone system and you know we make  the system that it runs on.  And of course everyone expects for us to have it work.  We're like Apple. We have our hardware right.  But they also have others others doing it.  But you mentioned the HTC deal.  So why don't we just talk about that right now.  Google apparently might be in a position to announce an acquisition of HTC and  we've been hearing rumors about HTC.  Well we know HTC as a company has been hurting in a world of hurt just as you know to  say the least. Their shares have fallen 94 percent since their heyday in 2011 which  I've loved HTC's hardware early on especially in the early days of Android.  They were doing some really awesome things.  They were they were doing design and build quality and all this stuff before a lot of  competitors were. They were really focused on that and that really set them apart.  But they've really kind of fallen to the wayside over the last however many years.  So lots of rumors about HTC and its business and what's going to happen.  I feel like we've been hearing about this for two three four years now and then very  recently about the possibility of Google snapping it up when when we can compare this  to another time in the history of Google when it snapped up a hardware manufacturer of  Motorola and did that and then a couple of years later sold it off.  So we don't know this for sure though.  This is news that supposedly can come out soon because HTC halted its stock trading  in Taiwan today I believe ahead of what they say is an announcement later this week.  Could this be the announcement?  Does this make it make sense to you Matthew that this would happen that Google should  buy a company like HTC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I think it makes sense.  I mean to be honest I thought Motorola made sense but obviously it turned out not to.  And there were issues with Motorola that maybe aren't the case with HTC.  I think in a lot of ways it does make sense for Google to kind of be vertically  integrated that way as much as possible.  It gives them a lot more control over costs gives them a lot more control over sort  of margins and stuff like that.  So I could see it at the right price.  It sounds like HTC is probably going to be pretty cheap.  I mean 300 million or something like that.  What is that like to Google?  That's like you know they could find that in the behind the cushions of the couch  and send our office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Send our sneezes that into a tissue when he has allergies.  That's that's what that is.  She said that mental image just  I don't know where that came from.  He sneezes money.  Yeah that is kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was coins that would hurt.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although if I sneezed and money came out of my nose I'd be sneezing all the damn time.  Just say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it was if it was nickels you'd be like oh my god my nose hurts so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to take me a long time for retirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so close to one hundred and fifty dollars.  But if they if they are going down this route with HTC it's hardware go round  round too like we said and I'd be I'd be wondering what they've learned from the  Motorola experience that led them to sell that business to Lenovo.  And you know do they think they're in a better position now.  Rick Osterloh is now with Google.  He was a high up guy at Motorola in terms of the product side of things.  You know it seems as if the pieces on the on the chessboard are in a better  position for Google to take on hardware development than when they had Motorola a  few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah and it also sounds like HTC might not be selling off the HTC Vive division to  Google although I could totally see that working too.  Like why not have that.  Facebook has Oculus.  Google has its own kind of VR division and it's the smartphone level of VR.  Why not have a premium level VR with the Vive.  So but that wouldn't happen.  Also Evelix Evan Blass has a source that that makes him think that the brand the  HTC brand might not even be on the table.  So it would be kind of the hardware mechanism of HTC that comes over to Google  and not necessarily the HTC brand that stays behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's actually I don't think that's bad either because what you know when we  talk about me.  Yeah when we talked about Google and hardware we said OK listen they partnered  with folks to design and then to produce these things.  The reason why they went to Asus for the tablet tablets or HTC for phones or LG  for phones is because they lacked the supply chain and the manufacturing.  And that's what this gives them.  So you know so you know they don't need the HTC brand they just need the phone.  And honestly I like their I like HTC HTC phones.  I mean squeeze a squeezeable buttons aside.  I think HTC has done some pretty good stuff for Android over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well squeeze especially especially if HTC is you know what contributes all the  hardware for the pixel if they really want the pixel to be you know a symbol of  what Google can do with hardware and software then it makes sense for them to  own that whole thing beginning to end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah yeah agreed.  Well apparently we're not going to have to wait very long to hear what this  announcement is. I don't know what else it could be.  Maybe it's something entirely unrelated.  But we will certainly find out.  And yeah I mean like I said they've halted their shares.  They have a major announcement.  So it sounds pretty critical.  Sounds like a pretty big deal.  This would fall into line with that.  There are other things that have been leaked and we will talk about those.  But before we do that let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor and then we'll  get back to.  Well I'm really looking forward to this pixel book.  And I know if Jeff Jarvis was on he'd have a lot to say about it.  You'll hear from him another time.  We're going to talk about that after the break though.  So let's thank the sponsor which is Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE.  We've all experienced the effects of cellular network congestion.  It's no fun.  It just it slows you down in your tracks and crowded environments airports shopping  malls all all types of busy areas.  Your favorite apps can become barely usable.  They're just not working the way you know they should be.  That's why Snapdragon gigabit LTE was designed to deliver the fastest mobile  connectivity and help speed things up in crowded places with additional lanes for  your data to flow on and the ability to squeeze more speed from each LTE  connection.  Snapdragon gigabit LTE is like driving in a much wider much faster data highway.  Everything moves smoother and average LTE download speeds are up to seven times  faster than typical home Wi-Fi.  You're going to notice the speed difference.  It can turbocharge all of your connected apps makes things run seamlessly stream  360 degree videos in YouTube VR and 4K resolution with minimal buffering or  stuttering. That's kind of the dream right there.  You can access all of your files in the cloud nearly as fast as you would if they  were stored on your phone, which is the supreme kind of goal.  I think of cloud file storage is you want it to feel like it's a locally connected  drive and you get that with Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE.  You can download hours of movies or music in a matter of seconds.  Load Android instant apps almost instantly.  Obviously, it's in the name there.  But it makes it feel like it's an app that you already had installed because it  happens so fast.  Make the most of your unlimited data plan to learn more about faster network  connections in crowded places.  All you have to do is visit Snapdragon dot com slash gigabit.  That's Snapdragon dot com slash gigabit.  We thank Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE for their support of this week in Google.  Some of the other things that were leaked out by droid life and we can kind of pick  these apart here. Don't have to go too deep on the daydream VR headsets, because I  think they're just kind of like a little little spruce up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little it's a little  refinement of the design as well as a more expensive price tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently 20 bucks more.  So it was 80 prior.  And supposedly when this is announced in a couple of weeks, it's going to be right  around 100 bucks.  So they will have to yet again kind of justify the cost or maybe they don't have  to maybe they just because of coral.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So coral, coral is the new Google hotness, by the way.  That coral color is everybody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody. Yeah, they just like saying coral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I really think that this I really think that this price change is a is a  cost adjustment to I think that the the original daydream VR, they priced it too  low or based on the sales.  And I think this is a math thing.  I think that's why they're raising the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No internal tracking embedded inside of the headset hardware for 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in a sweat pant,  sweatpants material visor, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it has an embedded like headband for soaps for sopping up the forehead sweat.  Sorry, this episode is getting gross.  I apologize.  Google Home Mini is another another thing that we're going to find out about.  We had been hearing rumors about this and well, we still are.  But we have pictures to go with those rumors.  It's like a squished Google Home.  And it has four LEDs on top, little almost looks like a hockey puck sort of thing,  comes in a few colors, including, like you just said, coral,  because corals, the new harness, forty nine dollars for these once they are  announced and then released.  I feel like we're reporting on an announcement.  Nothing's been announced, but we have everything.  It's all rumors.  But, you know, 49 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just thinking if you're let's say you haven't kind of bought into Google Home  where you haven't bought into Google having services like that.  Forty nine bucks is like, you know, why not?  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing to sneeze at. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And then if you like it, buy a couple more like 50 bucks.  I mean, honestly, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's at that forty nine price point.  Forty nine dollar price point.  You know, take my money.  Sign me up. I'm going to get one for the bedroom.  Done deal. Yeah, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think that's exactly the purpose.  Right. Like I have a Google Home in my kitchen, the full size Google Home,  because that's all we have right now yet in the fan, the Google Home family of  devices, have one in the kitchen, one of the living room.  I can't I can't really think of another room that I have to have the full size  thing in that I would justify spending one hundred thirty bucks for.  But yeah, fifty bucks to just drop it in there.  Low footprint.  So it's not, you know, taking up a huge corner of the room.  I'd be down for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's going to could replace the alarm clock.  It you know, whether you get your morning briefing, you know, like it,  it having a spot in the I've already seen my sister's Amazon Echo family  and they put the Echo in the kitchen and then Echo dots in all the bedrooms.  So the kids, the kids are have their alarm clock.  They listen to music. They they use it as the intercom system.  Like having these devices in the individual  rooms in a house is a great application of this technology.  So I'm glad that Google.  I'm glad that this is the next step.  We wanted this when we went at I.O.  Remember, we were hoping for a a smaller, lower priced home device.  And I'm glad that we're getting it or or might be getting it if these leaks are  to believe to believe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that way, Google can record you in every room and then use your voice to  enhance its algorithms. It's comprehensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep a keep a running catalog of everything you've ever asked to asked it or said on  your Google account summary,  which you can get to very easily and listen to those recordings, which, by the way,  I think we mentioned on the show before is hilarious to do.  How many times they fired off accidentally.  You hear very random moments of your life played back for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just go back and search Google history and Google and you'll find it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should be your end of show tip, Ron.  That's how you get to it easily.  And because it's smaller, you have to imagine that means that the speaker  system on it is way is far less robust than what you get on the larger version.  So if you're thinking about every room can have a nice speaker for all of my  music, I'm sure it'll be able to be another point in your kind of matrix of  Google homes to interconnect for playing music and stuff.  It just probably won't sound nearly as good in those places.  So if that's a priority to you, I'm guessing you'll want to keep that in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it would I imagine it would be as good as like a Bluetooth speaker,  a small one. I don't think it's going to compete with Sonos or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I do love that feature about having  multiple Google homes playing the same thing in multiple rooms  simultaneously, you know, all synced up.  It's you know, it's great for for dance parties, which we have all the time.  I have two girls.  So of course we do.  And then finally, I'm really excited about this, even though it's incredibly expensive,  but I've been waiting for it and I've been waiting for years.  I know Jeff Jarvis has as well.  I'm curious to know what you guys think.  The Google Pixel Book, which is a Chromebook,  you know, they I think their last  Chromebook Pixel came out in 2015.  I'm still using the one from 2014 and I've had a hard time moving away from it.  Got it right here.  Hard time moving away from it for any of the other Chromebook options,  because I love the build quality.  I feel like it's it's been powerful enough to do everything I need for the past  four or five years, four years or so.  And so I've been waiting for an update.  Here you go.  One hundred twenty eight gigs for eleven ninety nine, supposedly  all the way up to five hundred twelve gigs for seventeen forty nine.  This is a Chromebook competing with regular, like full powered laptop on price.  Well, I don't know if that's competing on price price.  Similarly, I don't know if they're competing  because I don't know how capable it is compared to those.  But it does include the ability to use a pen.  You get it for another ninety nine bucks,  the Pixelbook pen that'll have pressure sensitivity, tilt support, no lag.  So I'm sure we'll hear something about how Chrome OS is is better.  You know, it has some sort of stylus support to go along with that.  And the whole thing folds into a tablet.  So you can run your Android apps in tablet mode and all that kind of stuff.  I know I'm getting one.  I'm getting I probably won't get the the premium five hundred twelve gigs one,  but I'll get the one hundred twenty eight gig one.  Sure. That's all I need.  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very expensive. It's very expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. I was going to say that.  I mean, I could buy a MacBook Air roughly the same price.  Yeah. I don't.  To be honest, I don't like I like the Chromebooks and I like I've been using one  for the past like three, four months and it's an old one.  So it's a little underpowered.  But I have no problems with it.  And I like the idea that these have better build quality.  They're not they don't feel sort of low end  or cheap.  But do I need somebody who turns into a tablet?  No. Do I need a stylist?  Probably not.  So then those things are going to be lost on me.  Are that many people really going to use  this thing and turn it into a sort of clamshell tablet?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think that and I said this last night on all about Android,  but for those who didn't watch that, I think that this is a lot of Google  competing with Microsoft and the Surface books,  what Surface has been doing with styluses and creativity and in the classroom  and making like Microsoft is making a run at Apple to to woo back artists  with the Surface Studio, those big desktops and things like that.  And and they've been they've really been pushing those surface convertible  laptops, laptop tablet combinations.  And I think Google sees Microsoft making  headway in that space and saying, OK, well, this is us competing with that  because ultimately Google wants to get in the classroom as well, too.  But at this price point, it's not realistic for, you know,  create creative types who are notoriously, you know, starving artists, as well  as education, where there's never enough money for education.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and it's not just that.  I mean, if if if you're a creative type and you want to do things with a stylus,  you're probably going to want to install software.  You're probably going to want all sorts of graphics, you know, software.  And there are cloud versions of those, most of them, but they're, you know,  they're not as full featured as the ones you can install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The original Chromebook Pixel launched back in the one I have right here,  launched back in 2013, you know, that thing.  And it's yeah, I love it.  But with an asterisk, which I'll talk about in a second, I was at the launch,  actually. Oh, OK, so there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean, we was working for Giga Home at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was in San Francisco.  And I mean, I'm guessing because the price point is the same.  Well, it's not the same, but it's very close.  Then the price point entry level was twelve ninety nine or you get a fourteen  forty nine with an LTE connections, nothing about an LTE connection on the new  version, at least in the leaks anyway.  So I guess we'll find out my asterisk, Ron, is that I didn't buy this.  We got it as a Google I.O.  handout  for one of the years of Google I.O.  So then I have to ask myself back then,  would I have ever put down, drop down the money for it?  And the answer would have been no.  At this point, I would put down the money for it because I've grown to really love  this machine and I've used it so much over the years.  And I realize that it's under power.  Like I realize that it's under capable.  What is the right word?  Not as capable as a full blown like MacBook Pro or whatever.  But that's not why I use it.  I use it because it's super light.  It does exactly what I need to do on the shows here and it's great for travel.  And having having one that I'm that that I feel, you know, the same kind of like I  like good design and and everything about the build quality of this of this laptop  makes me happy, I guess.  So I guess from to that degree, I don't mind spending a little bit more than a  thousand dollars on a new one that's going to last me four or five years, which  is what this has done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you ever found anything that you  wanted to do that you couldn't do on the Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, there are things that it obviously does not do, but I'm fine with  that because I have other solutions for that.  Right. Like I have a desktop computer at home.  And if I really need to do some of those  like video editing or audio editing, I wouldn't want to do it on a laptop anyways.  I hate doing that stuff on a laptop.  I like doing it on a desktop.  So maybe that's the trade off.  Right. I have another computer at home that can do those things or at work here.  You know, it's a desktop setup in my office.  So but this just gets relegated specifically to my browsing, which is like  ninety nine percent of what I ever do anyways.  And it's it's a nice one instead of having like a built out of plastic thing  where the trackpad feels all hollow when I tap it and everything like that.  I feel like it's a MacBook Pro, but with Chrome OS.  And for some reason, that works for me.  And that's that's only I mean, that didn't happen initially.  When I first got it, I was scratching my head going, why would I ever buy this?  But over the years, it's really won me over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've when I've been using since I've been using this Chromebook,  I have, you know, found it useful for almost everything.  Since it is a little underpowered, it has problems streaming, you know,  high quality video, for example, to the TV.  But that I can understand.  It's an old Chromebook.  It was my daughter's before we got her in there.  And it's but I have.  So I've been thinking next computer I get.  Why don't I just get the pixel, for example?  But there's like one or two things that I do that it can't do.  And so then I wonder if it's not going to be if I can't use it as my main computer,  like I can't figure out how to record Skype calls, for example.  There's no plug in that works.  So Skype works fine.  But for my job, I need to record those calls.  I couldn't figure out how to do it.  There appears to be no  easy way to do it except using a free conference call service,  which is all kinds of other hassle.  So then so then if that's if that's one kind of thing that I do a lot,  if I get a Chromebook, I'm not going to be able to do that.  So then it can't be my kind of main computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is this is a discussion that we always end up having, which is that,  you know, Matthew, you know, like I think, you know, we're power users.  Right. And, you know, personally, for me,  I need to be able to do do graphic editing and audio recording and editing,  much like yourself and every now and then a little video and all this sort of stuff.  And these are very processor intensive tools.  And we've been we've been raised on application tools and things like that.  But the average user is and might not need to record a Skype call.  They just need to use Skype to talk to somebody.  You know, like and so I oftentimes I wonder, you know,  the the pool of potential customers for a device like this at this price point are  like business travelers who are dialed into the Google network, Google ecosystem,  you know, much like, you know, people are dialed into the Apple iCloud ecosystem  or Microsoft Office or whatnot.  And, you know, this device might not be for us.  You know, we might still need a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air or whatnot.  You're right. You're right. Yeah. But but but but it does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does make sense for schools.  It does make sense, I think, for students.  It probably makes sense for, you know,  road warriors or whatever, if all you need is kind of if everything you can do,  you can access on the Web.  I was thinking of one kind of interesting target market,  foreign travelers coming into the US.  You could have a bear bear Chromebook, nothing on it, just basically a browser.  You bring it into the US.  They can't find anything on it.  They can't look at anything on it.  So you can do your work kind of assuming you can do everything on the Internet,  have your regular leave your regular computer at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Because it's so easy to set up a Chromebook.  You just log into your account and everything just goes and in like 30 seconds.  Everything is back there as if it was your laptop forever.  That's a really good point.  I don't know. Yeah.  I mean, the question that you pose, Ron, and that kind of that that you're talking  about there, Matthew, too, is I don't know if that's like Google's endgame necessarily.  Like, well, we'll target people who are traveling internationally and certain  business travelers like it is still a question that I have, even though like I'm  excited to get the the the Pixelbook if and when it comes out.  And even though I also say that knowing that it's very expensive and that maybe it  isn't worth it, I don't know, but I'm still going to get it.  I still have a hard time understanding who their target actually is on this  because, yeah, I mean, regularly, at least in the industries that we run in,  there are reasons that this does not make sense.  So it's so it's easy to kind of fall into the into the, you know,  so in a way, your point of like this just doesn't work for anybody.  It works for somebody. Who is that somebody in a way that they're kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  trapped in a catch-22?  The only people I hear talking about pixels are nerds.  Right. And yet, nerds are power users who want more computer, who want to install  things or screw around with the US or whatever.  And so they're not going to probably get them.  So they get them as a second or third computer.  So that's not a big market.  Right. And the interesting thing, when it when it first launched, I will say,  you know, that was a long time ago in Internet terms.  But at the time, what it said to me was, and maybe this was what they meant  by launching it, was it was a symbol of how much the future was going to be all  about the Web and all about.  So as long as you had a connection, you would be able to do just about everything.  And they at the time, there were lots of things you couldn't do.  Now there's a few.  So we have sort of kind of seen what they were talking about at the time,  which is that more and more stuff has gone to the cloud.  More and more stuff has gone to the Web.  So you don't have to have as much kind of on your machine.  And you can use a thing that gives you a connection to nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a really good point.  We will see.  I was also, as you were talking, kind of taking a look over the Verge's 2013  review, and I mean, it just ties right into what you're saying.  My how much things have changed since even 2013.  But then again, how much things have stayed the same?  Because when I look at the cons on this original device,  it was that Chrome OS is severely limited, that price is a deal breaker.  Price will probably be a deal breaker here as well.  And actually, what we were just talking about, as far as trying to find who this  would be marketed to, I just kind of assume that's why Google  apparently had stopped doing the Chromebook Pixel, right?  They did 2013, they did 2015, and then there was nothing.  And I was like, OK, well, maybe that was an experiment that just didn't pan out.  The only people that I ever really saw using it were Leo, myself.  And then if I went to Google, I saw it to people that worked for Google using them  there, but you don't really see them anywhere else.  So maybe that just didn't work.  But apparently it did because it's coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it seems like the Pixelbook changing the name.  They want to centralize everything around the term Pixel.  Forget about the term Chrome.  It's probably confusing.  Plus, it's not just a Chromebook.  You've got Android apps as well.  So Pixelbook makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  And then I think we can get out of the rumor territory.  Ron, you were talking about kind of a lower cost and cost entry device in the Pixel  line. This isn't quite that, but we do have the first Android one device  to launch in the US. That hasn't happened yet.  Android one, of course, is Google's kind of  I don't know, budget phone category.  I don't know if that's the right kind of way to describe it.  It's really been used in a lot of emerging  markets to give a lower end device with a lower price point that still has, you  know, very minimal UI alterations, has an update schedule that comes direct  from Google and, you know, other benefits like that.  Now Motorola with the Moto X4 is launching its Android one device in the US available  for Project Fi users.  And so that means if you are on Project Fi before you had only kind of like  premium device options to pick from, now it's opening up.  So you pay three hundred ninety nine dollars, which isn't bottom of the barrel  pricing, let's say.  And certainly it seems kind of expensive for anything we've seen in the Android one  category, but less expensive than some of the other options.  So maybe this is the middle of the road option that you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like I feel like I need to ask Google for a million dollars next.  And I'll get an email saying we've given you a million dollars.  I'm giving you what I'm asking for.  But but I think that the fact that, you know,  three ninety nine is a great price point, one hundred sixty five dollars back with  select trade ins.  Yeah, that's that that makes it even more interesting.  And  offering fifty dollars in Project Fi credit.  That's pretty cool, too, to help you save money.  And the colors are sterling blue and super black, which is which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no coral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, coral. No coral.  No blue. No kind of blue.  But but hey, you know, I've been I've been operating with a Moto  Z2 Force, my first Motorola phone in a while.  I've been I've been test running this for this month.  And I've been really impressed.  Motorola is making some nice hardware.  And we talked about the Moto X4, I think, last week and all about Android with its  weird camera design in the back, the dual camera lens that looks almost like a  manual camera focus knob.  But this this might be the middle of the road option.  And I like that they're rolling Android one out in the US.  It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll see, see how it does for Project Fi users.  But of course, if T-Mobile and Sprint merge, as has been rumored for a long time,  then Project Fi becomes a little bit less compelling.  That's that's a ways down the way.  And that merger will never happen, right?  That'll get squashed in regulation, regulatory analysis.  That'll totally never happen in today's day and age.  Crazier things will happen.  Let's see here.  What can we talk about?  There's other Google news, right?  Google, apparently.  So we had the EU  decision that basically said that Google had to pay two point four billion euros  in a fine to the EU and its antitrust case related to Google's shopping search  results and it placing favorable having favorable placement for its own  products in comparison to competing companies that were in the listings.  So that was that that along with that fine  came some requirements for Google to really kind of change things so that they  could address some of these issues.  Google is appealing this.  But in the meantime, it still has to kind  of make the effort to to stand up and make some changes according to the EU.  So apparently Google is proposing to auction off some of that space to its  rivals, you know, you guys think about this to list products for sale.  So if I'm understanding this correctly,  instead of Google showing its own products, it's saying, how about we auction this off  to you guys, you pay us lots of money so that we don't put our own products there.  Is that what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this this falls into the category of what I would like to call a nice try.  So, you know, why not?  Like they're appealing it anyway.  Why not kind of lob this out there?  There's no.  And in fact, if you look at that article that's in the lineup, there is no hope  that anyone is going to think that this is a solution.  And in fact, everyone who's heard about it,  including all the people who brought the action in the first place, this is not  going to work because their fear is Google will just.  So Google said, oh, we'll put a cap on it.  Right. So then, you know, it can't go up.  We won't be able to bid any more than the cap.  Well, they have to do is set the cap  ridiculously high and then no one will be able to beat it.  And even if they do, but Google makes way more money.  So it doesn't actually have the smell of what you would call a solution  to to the criticisms that like I have my  I'm skeptical of the criticisms that the EU is acting on.  I don't think that most of what Google does in terms of showing its own results  meets any real standard of sort of antitrust or or anti-competitiveness.  There are things that it that it does that I think do.  But just when I search for umbrellas and, you know, Google shows me its umbrella  results is that or travel, those are things that help the user.  The EU is arguing they're fundamentally  anti-competitive. I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  But I don't think they're going to get anywhere with this offer for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to give them points for your creativity.  That's for sure. An innovation. That's that's good.  I would expect nothing less from Google to try to figure it away for them to  profit from the slap on the wrist that they got from the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like it's like you getting you get  charged with an offense and it has like a six month jail term.  And you're like, well, why don't we raffle off specific jail terms for me?  And then, you know, we'll see who bids most.  And then that's what I'll go to jail for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, it never hurts to try, right?  You don't get anything if you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't find out if you don't ask.  Can't you know, can't hurt to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it shows that they're doing something that is not doing something that anyone  really, really thinks is an actual solution.  But hey, there you go.  Let's see here.  What else can we talk about?  We talked about this a little bit last night and the day before.  Sorry, Ron.  But I think it's kind of cool, this idea of so Google has a payment app  rolling out in India, and I'm wondering if we're going to see it in other places  or at least this this kind of technology coming to other places as well.  Maybe India is kind of like a test point for this.  But the app is called Taze.  I want to call it Tez, but someone I'm  trusting someone last night that said it's actually Taze.  So there you go.  And it's basically it's like it's a way  to use the app to link up to financial accounts and trade cash.  Essentially, India has a certain it's a very fragmented money market.  And so they're very focused on cash.  And so the government is doing a lot of things to try and help  people kind of break that and kind of dealing with the fragmentation.  So Google created this app to kind of work with that.  And what's what I find interesting is that  for person to person cash transfers, it doesn't use NFC necessarily to connect  between them, it uses something.  Did I put that in here?  It's basically it's like an audio QR code.  And so it puts out an inaudible beep that we can't hear to our ears.  Anyways, it's outside of the human hearing range, but that the devices can hear.  And that makes the connection.  And then you transfer money.  It's like the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's cool.  Yeah, it does sound cool.  I don't know enough about audio technology to know whether this is going to be secure.  Like, couldn't if it's just sound, can't something make the same sound  and effectively achieve the same transaction?  I don't know if that's the case or if that's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or on the other side, can you can I  intercept your sound and then use it at other places?  Right.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it has to have the payment, all the information encoded in the signal.  Right. Yeah.  Or at some point after the signal, that information is exchanged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Unless what it's doing is it's not trans.  I can't imagine it's transferring any sensitive data in the audio QR.  It's got to be transferring a marker that is saying, you know, beep, beep, beep.  And then the other side says,  and that is a handshake.  And then at the up on the server side, it figures out, OK, you're who you are.  I'm going to take your money from your account.  And none of it is happening on the application level.  That's really that that's how it's got to be working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because all you have to do is duplicate the handshake.  Right. Then all you have to do is make the beep, boop, whatever.  It would be fun if it made the same sounds as like early dial up modems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we really need to go back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it does.  It makes sense because as this article points out, a lot of people,  particularly in developing countries, don't have NFC on their phones  because they're probably got a flip phone, you know, that was handed down to them.  And so it makes sense to use some other type of technology.  It's not sure whether the sound is the way to go.  And again, I don't know enough about it to to criticize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I'm getting an AQR code right now.  It's ATDT.  Well, I just gave you fifty dollars, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if they do do this,  our dogs in the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I can't hear you over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are all the dogs in the neighborhood going to get upset if people start transferring?  Because we're taking their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've tried to we've tried to shoot holes in this, but I'm going to I'm going to play  I'm going to play devil's advocate.  There are very smart people at Google who have figured this out.  Yes, I'm going to assume that that any any scenario we've invented, they have an  answer for they wouldn't roll this out.  I can't imagine Google would be so brazen with a financial app like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it does feel like us in five minutes could not come up with something  that Google engineers have not thought of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, we couldn't figure this out in five minutes.  We are slipping.  Let's see here. What else do we have here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, what Chrome one and a Chrome story about blocking autoplay videos.  I thought was pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was circling on that, too, actually.  So apparently Chrome browser.  So Google's doing a lot of things right now when it comes to  making adjustments to Chrome to kind of make the the browsing experience better.  Some of a lot of this stuff seems to relate to ads, right?  They have their own ad blocking mechanism or setup that's apparently going to appear  inside Chrome. They also have their what is it?  The Google contributor that I think you've been doing right, Ron?  Yep. For a while.  So this kind of ties into that, I think.  Chrome browser is going to soon be able to mute the audio of any autoplay video  content that appears on a page unless the user has specifically said it's OK to play  that. So with Chrome 63, that's kind of where the changes will begin.  Users are going to be able to have the control over muting specific sites.  But then at Chrome 64, it's going to broaden out so that you will only ever  hear audio on any of the sites if you have explicitly told Chrome in some way  that it's OK. And I think part of how you do that or part of it, part of how it knows  whether it's OK to do it is like your interaction with the site.  If you like open up a tab to a site and you don't do anything on the page,  that's one indicator. And it says, OK, well, you haven't done anything on the page.  So why would why would I, you know, I Chrome expect that you would want to hear  this audio. But if you click on the page in some way or scroll around, I'm not really  quite sure to what degree of level that that will take place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or if you visit it frequently, maybe.  Yeah, maybe something along those lines.  Yeah. You know, this is one of those things and contributor and a bunch of the other  the Google sort of Chrome built in ad blocking thing I have problems with as well,  because from a kind of media industry point of view,  this this is a classic example of something that users will love  and media companies will hate because a lot of them have rely on autoplay video.  Is it bad? Yes, it's a horrible, horrible user experience.  And I know that because I go to a lot of sites that use it.  I worked for one that used it and I hated it every single time.  So it's so Google wins a lot of points by doing this because it makes for a better  experience for users. The problem is a lot of publishers, for better or worse,  use a lot of these videos and other garbage to forms of advertising to generate  revenue because they literally can't think of anything else to do or because they  have no other option or whatever.  So the problem with these types of measures and surely the ad blocking one  is an obvious one is they they increase the control that Google has  over the revenue generating abilities of media companies.  And don't get me wrong, lots of media companies do  terrible things to make money, and that's bad.  But Google and Facebook together already control, you know,  the vast majority of online advertising.  I think last year, all of the growth in digital advertising went to Google  and Facebook. If you took those two out, the digital advertising market actually  shrank, so it's centralizing that control in even more ways.  And then I'm sure Google has lots of other ways for you to monetize,  including contributor and and subscriptions that Google then handles.  So it's you know, you know, I'm saying it's a little bit of a yeah,  as a user, it's a fantastic thing.  And I think it's great  in terms of their relationship to the kind of media ecosystem.  It's it's troubling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, as far as Google is concerned, it's great.  You know, it's it's a great solution because it puts them in even more control  over over the experience.  You know, there are a lot of people that use third party ad blockers.  Google is not necessarily saying don't use ad blockers.  They're just saying use our ad blocker.  And, you know, then we've got control over the experience.  You know, not to mention this this whole  this this whole approach to ad blocking in Chrome, you know, kind of hinges on  Google making a determination based on based on  standards of quality that have been set prior, but makes the determination of what  is a good ad and what is not a good ad. And I don't know.  I'm just guessing here, but I'm I'm guessing that Google's ads are going  to be good ads because they're following those rules.  And anyone that doesn't have good ads  are Google's competitors that they're not letting you see their ads because.  And, you know, mind you, as a user, again, that's great.  I don't want bad ads in my experience, but that really benefits Google.  And is that I know is that too much?  I mean, does that cross the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this goes back to all those questions about Google's power and what that power  like if Google was, you know, a smaller company, did fewer things,  wasn't as sort of dominant in advertising.  All of these things would be fantastic.  And these it falls into the kind of category of things where if Google did it  five years ago, six years ago, when it was smaller, we would all be cheering, right?  Offering free email or, you know, maps and satellite views of the earth.  We were like, wow, these are fantastic.  And Google is amazing.  But the more power you get and the sort of more you become,  not just a dominant player, but the dominant player, all those things that you  do that would once have seemed innocent and helpful, you know, start to look like  you're kind of feathering your own nest in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somewhat related to this only because it's kind of the ad, the ad network side of  Google and this also, you know, bubbled up with Facebook.  I think initially, actually, it hit late last week in relation to Facebook.  But then eventually BuzzFeed dug into it  with Google and saw the same thing is this idea of ad targeting based on,  well, racist phrases is one of the examples that were shown.  BuzzFeed found that Google was allowing ad targeting for, you know, pretty, pretty  horrible phrases and everything that you can actually, as an ad buyer,  target your product or your message or whatever, your advertisement against these  phrases if they what if people are searching for them or whatever.  Facebook also kind of came under the microscope for this as well.  Their system was also allowing a lot of these terms to be marketed against.  And in their in their, you know,  to their benefit, they did address these once they were notified about this by  by BuzzFeed.  And I think it was ProPublica that that found initially what Facebook was doing.  But, you know, part of me just wasn't Twitter does this as well, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  They're actually you can do the same thing on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. There was there was news that Twitter was doing this as well, which I think further  kind of proves my my hesitation around this, which is like how I mean,  is this just part of the ad network world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is it's a great it's a great example of how of the flaws, I guess, in in  or the risks with a totally distributed model.  So all of these companies and I think Google was among the first Facebook later,  Twitter later, tried to kind of make their ad buying as user friendly as possible and  as sort of accessible as possible so that the amount of input you had to have  from human beings at that company was approaching zero, if not zero.  So self-serve, click here, type in your terms.  We algorithm gives you the prices.  Boom, boom, boom. You're done.  And in fact, Sheryl Sandberg wrote something.  I don't know if it's in the lineup, but she responded to these stories and said,  you know, we screwed up and this is terrible and we feel horrible and we will  take action to stop it. But her point was what made this possible was all the things  they tried to do to make it easier for small business owners to to get ads and run  ads about their businesses, no matter how unusual those businesses are.  So, you know, reused Frisbee rentals or whatever.  There's probably not going to be a category in a system.  It's going to be run by a normal advertising company.  So you can literally enter anything you want.  So what happened in these cases, as far as I understand it, is people just typed  in racist terms where it said, you know, what business are you in?  So that's a kind of yes, it's a flaw, obviously.  And for the system to not say, whoa, dude, that's totally racist.  We can't sell ads against that.  They they didn't do that.  Controls weren't there in any of these  companies to stop people from typing in those terms, whether  any ads were actually sold or run against those terms, who knows?  But but I think to me it's a it's just an example of how kind of  automated these systems are and how much they rely on you, the business person or  whoever, to type in things that make sense related to your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It reminds me it reminded me of Microsoft's  Tay, where they came out and like almost immediately, you know, everybody started  targeting Tay with with certain phrases and words and basically made Tay a racist  AI chatbot and two hours, you know, very short amount of time.  It was mind boggling how fast it happened.  But in retrospect, looking at that and going, man, I mean, like it's not  impossible to protect against that, so why didn't you think about that?  That's kind of how I feel about this.  Like I get the idea of a self-service model.  But it's also very easy to be like these two words when put together.  There's like no way why anyone should be able to buy ads against that term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not not to play devil's advocate to to to defend them.  But I mean, it's I think it's more I think it's more sad of the state of affairs  of the world today that this has relevance because of everything around and outside  the tool. But if you look at the searches that they, you know, like the obvious  expletives and horrible racial slurs and things like that, I'm sure already blocked.  And I can't I'm not surprised that someone at Google or Facebook did not sit back  and say, well, what if somebody searches for, you know, you know,  insert insert, you know, at no group, horrible phrase here.  Yeah. It's not even a horrible phrase.  White people ruin everything.  That was one of them. Right.  You know, like like things like that.  Those are strings of words that I can't say I would have thought of if I was  building that tool. That's true.  You know, and and and there the we've gotten to a point of, unfortunately,  people who potentially want to purvey hate in a way that they're getting creative  to work around the tools. And that's just that's that's game theory.  That's just natural.  That's people are going to figure out ways to get across what they want to do.  So I'm glad that ProPublica ProPublica and BuzzFeed and all the other posts are  being watchdogs because that's what we need the media to do and point this out.  And the companies are responding in kind.  But I mean, as when I saw this, I was like, oh, that's rough.  But then as I dug deep into it, I'm like, oh, I see how that can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is. It does feel more to me like a bug, you know, in a self-serve ad system than  holy cow, Facebook is internally racist.  You know, or.  Yeah. And so there are other things Facebook does that are way worse.  Let's put it that way.  So deleting videos about the Rohingya being massacred,  that's an actual bad thing that raises questions about what Facebook is doing.  The fact that you can auto generate an ad  related to some childish term that you just came up with doesn't trouble me that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, saying Twitter also has this problem.  We all know about the rampant problem with Twitter, with abuse and with trolls and  things like that. And the recent, you know, taking, you know,  two hour turnaround to delete a terrorist related theme tweet or something like that.  Like they've got to get better about this stuff, you know, and and the desire to make  it automated makes sense from a scaling issue.  But we're dealing with subjects and we're  dealing with things that require a human touch.  And so they've got to get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great point.  I mean, Facebook and Google and lots of other companies have, you know,  Facebook built this entire network based on the idea that human beings were  only had to be tangentially involved.  Human beings were the input of content, but in terms of running it,  because at one point I can't remember if Mark Zuckerberg actually said this or if  people figured he said this, but human beings don't scale.  So if you want to get to global size,  you can't have human beings doing everything.  It costs too much money.  So and this came up when Facebook started having problems with  racist content, fake news, whatever.  They've had to hire thousands like five thousand or something,  moderators, because some things and this is probably one of them.  Human beings are way better at recognizing those things than computers are.  And maybe that won't always be the case,  but it certainly seems to be the case right now.  Yeah, it's like human beings recognize that was racist.  You know, literally five minutes after the thing started.  And sure, that was a great symbol of Teh realizing that, hey,  human beings are racist, which is true.  But it was also a sign that Microsoft could probably have thought it through a  little bit more.  I mean, you know, we've had chat bots since the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And by the way, Matthew, reused Frisbee business.  I think it's going to be a hot trend in 2019.  A couple of years from now, it's trending already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got the domain already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any any last thing before we thank a sponsor and then get to our tips and tricks  and all that, anything burning stories that you had to had to talk about before  the end of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we've covered all mine.  The only thing I would mention is the sort of.  The there's the I don't think we talked about the the open markets group that's  that's going after Google specifically based around antitrust.  There's a whole, you know, internal politics around them branching off from this other  foundation and and Google asking for them to be tossed out or not, depending on how  you kind of read between the lines.  But there is a clearly a very significant number of,  you know, legal scholars and people with experience in government who are  going after Google specifically to redefine the way antitrust is thought of in the US,  whether they're going to be successful or not, who knows?  But I think for Google, that's a significant problem.  And because it it dovetails perfectly with what the EU has been trying to do.  And until now, it's always been, well,  that's just a bunch of Germans and French people and maybe some Spaniards and the  Italians and who cares, because it's just the EU.  And yes, they're all hot about this stuff,  but it's not that big a deal because it doesn't affect kind of our main market.  Well, this is going to the heart of that.  If if open markets and that group can get  a significant amount of kind of interest going in Congress,  that's going to be a significant problem for Google for sure, because it defines not  to get into too much detail, but it defines antitrust in a way in the past  for probably the last 30 years, US antitrust has looked at is the consumer harmed?  That's the number one thing.  So if all your stuff is free and everything, you know, works great and users are happy,  no antitrust problem.  So what open markets wants to do is redefine that to look at actual competition.  And that could be a significant problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like I was saying earlier, inflection point for technology,  because it's not just Google either.  I have a feeling like the tide is turning, so to speak, with with big technology  companies right now, and we've been really we've been amazed at just how much you can  do with the power and the scale of these of these technology companies working for  you. And now I think in light of a lot of things that happened last year,  people have realized just what what that amount of power can can scale up to,  like what the impact of that can be and continues to be more and more and more.  And that some of these rules, yeah, maybe they do need to change because we're in  a different world now when it comes to technology and information age than we  were 20 years ago. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of those antitrust principles were based around physical things.  Yeah. Physical objects, you know, trains,  oil, whatever like they weren't designed to understand the power of network effects.  And so, sure, anybody can use another social network.  They don't have to go use Facebook.  But are they going to know like lots of people didn't even stop using Twitter  when it was a trash fire.  So it because those network effects are what keep you in those networks.  And so then that gives those companies way more power.  But it doesn't always kind of.  If the analogy is not perfect between that and owning a bunch of railway,  you know, cars that then distribute oil, you know what I mean?  So that's the part people are struggling with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah,  agreed. Very fascinating time for technology right now and definitely for Google  as we kind of see the effects of what the EU is doing and how that translates into  the US and and other markets, big change ahead.  Real quick, before we do get to the break,  I failed to mention this is kind of, you know, it's today's news.  So we should mention it here real quick.  Nest, after so long of, you know, people saying, man, you know,  Google bought Nest and then they did nothing.  They really lack any sort of new production.  Today, they they announced a whole bunch of new stuff.  The Nest Secure alarm system is basically like a full security system for your home.  It includes like a siren, the Nest Guard,  that sounds a super loud 85 decibel alarm,  Nest Detect for, you know, attaching to your windows and your doors,  you know, when they open and close Nest Tag for putting on things like your keys  or whatever so you don't lose them. Sounds familiar.  And then and then, you know, a bunch of other things, including a baking  assistant, Google's assistant into things like the Nest Cam IQ camera.  And then also they announced the Nest Cam IQ outdoor camera.  All this stuff is really expensive.  I think the the full security system is, what is that, around five hundred bucks or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something. Well, well, the thing about this,  what struck me from this is that it's almost been like Nest has been the sleeping  dog that's been lying in the world of IoT, right.  In that, in that they, you know, the thermostat, you know, blew everyone's mind.  And then the smoke alarm had some problems.  And then they got and then they had a lot  of internal reorgan and structuring and, you know, Tony Fidel left and all the,  you know, like all these various stuff that was going on.  And then it seems like this is, you know,  what they've done is they took a step back and looked at the IoT market and was  like, oh, small tags to track your items. That's doing well.  Doing one of those. Oh, outdoor cameras or interfaces for outside your home.  We're going to do one of those.  And now they're marching back to kind of target every successful product that is  in the IoT play space and add both Nest and the power of Google Assistant behind it  to justify those high costs, you know, the more expensive products.  And my guess is they're probably going to do well because everyone loves the Nest  thermostat. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think they have a real chance.  I mean, like you said, this is a kind of wide open market in a way.  It's like the Wild West.  And there's a lot of stuff.  There's a lot of integration problems.  There's a lot of stuff that doesn't work that well.  If they can kind of nail the the integration,  getting all of these things to work properly,  having them all connect through the Google Assistant and connect to your Google  home or whatever, that's going to be a significant,  you know, that's going to have be a big selling point for people, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also have a doorbell camera, by the way, the hello doorbell camera.  I mean, yeah, they're touching all these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is very familiar, right?  I mean, a lot of the products that we talk about here on Twitter, right.  And these are all and if somebody has a Nest thermostat, you know, they're like,  well, I can control this all from the Google Home app or from the Nest app.  You know, why would I why would I want multiple people want to people want to  buy into a system, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long until next year when multicolor light bulbs, they're going to get into  the game. Oh, yeah.  We're surprised there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I do know, speaking of Google and power, I know a friend,  as soon as I mentioned this or send a link, they're going to be like, sure,  I want Google to have a camera inside my house and outside my house.  Sure. I want Google to control my front doorbell.  Yeah, that makes total sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Eyes and ears in every corner of the home.  That's you know, that's kind of the deeper meaning, apparently.  Help you. Yes.  Right. To make your life more convenient,  make our life better because we profit from it.

And we thank Felix Gray for their support of this week in Google.  OK, this is the tools, tips, tricks, whatever you got part of the show.  Ron, we'll start with you because I do see one in here for you.  I'm trying to remember if I've seen this before.  I don't know if you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know.  I don't know. Maybe this one's skirt and the edge of what's OK to talk about.  But I figured go with it.  Fall TV season is upon us.  It's my most favorite time of the year.  I got my entertainment weekly fall TV preview.  The Emmys were just on this past weekend.  New TV shows are coming at us.  And if you're like me, you like to watch TV and I live and die by Plex.  Plex is my kind of media center app.  It's fantastic.  But Plex doesn't do it.  Plex is great for putting stuff into it, but it's not so good for about telling  you what's coming. And so there's an app called Sonar,  which is a little desktop app that is able you're able to subscribe to series  that you watch and enjoy and it will use it accesses all the databases that are  out there on the Internet and makes a really cool integrated kind of interface  that allows you to see when the air dates for shows are.  And there's also a bunch of really cool little notifications, hooks and little  recipes you can put together to give me, you know, give me a notification when this  new show is on.  It also will go get the show if you subscribe to those types of methods to do  that. And that's what I'm not going to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're not allowed to talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not going to talk about that, but it's there if you're into that sort of thing.  But it's really, really handy for just like, you know, you ever watch a show and  then it disappears like, when is that coming back?  And then you realize, oh, the baseball players are going on.  It's going to be back in November.  Sonar is a great way to keep track of the shows you watch on on typical tape,  cable and broadcast TV, not so much for streaming side of things.  But it's a tool that I started using last year and I've come to I can't live  without it. I got it all dusted off and ready to go for  this upcoming fall season. So Sonar, it's that Sonar.TV.  It's a downloadable desktop package you can install for Mac, Windows or Linux.  And it's pretty nifty.  And I will leave the rest of it to you to discover on your own.

Transcript:  You can do good. You can do not so good.  Sonar with two R's, by the way.  So S-O-N-A-R-R.  R. Just talked like a pirate day the other day.  So that's too bad this wasn't then.  OK. Sonar.TV.  Matthew, do you have a thing, tip, trick, anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What you got? Actually, well, I didn't really have anything.  But it's interesting that Ron mentioned Sonar.  I experimented with Sonar not that long ago.  I also have I'm a big Plex fan and I have a Linux box that I use as sort of a media  server, Plex server, photo, you know, hosting, all that stuff.  And I so Sonar, if you like TV and movies and music,  there's a  they're not related like they come from different people.  But a lot of people use them together.  There's Sonar for TV, Couch Potato, it's called, or movies and headphones for music.  And I got all of these working and then  something happened with the box and they stopped doing the things they're supposed  to do because it's Linux, obviously, I probably have to recompile something  from the kernel or whatever.  But anyway, at one point it was working and they do exactly what Ron was talking  about with Sonar, they keep track of the things that you like and they tell you  when there's new things and then you use a variety of methods to get those things.  But it's great if you have a media server  and that's the kind of thing you want to do.  I won't go into the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.  See, you did have a tip.  It is it just it took Ron's tip to bring it to the surface.  That's awesome.  That's that's expanded information that totally adds on.  It's like a full media solution that you have now.  Mine has nothing to do with that, though.  So when you're done setting up your media  solution and then when you get Android 8.0 Oreo, which could take a really long time  to come to your device, but if and when that happens,  did you know that there is system wide theming?  So if you've got Android 8.0 and you want  to theme everything in your system, almost everything in your system.  Prior to Oreo, you had to root.  And that's one of the reasons why a lot  of people would root access to their device so that they could get in there.  They could mess with the files, alter the files in a way that would totally theme  the look and feel of their device.  And apparently in Android 8, there is a theming engine.  The folks at Substratum that had systems  prior to Android 8.0 that did this launched their app and their desktop app  set up to do this.  It taps into Android's overlay manager service, OMS.  Talked about this on all about Android a couple of months ago.  But the reason I'm talking about it now is because it's all out now and you can do this.  The app that you're looking for is called Andromeda.  Not to be confused with the once  once fabled Andromeda Chrome OS Android combination that never happened.  And you can buy it.  You see there it's a dollar ninety nine to buy the app to install it.  But once you have that installed and once you have their desktop client  installed, that desktop client, you know, you plug your phone into your computer  and that desktop client gets the permissions to make the changes on your unrooted  Oreo device, you do not need root yet.  You can use this to completely theme your device.  I haven't tried it myself yet.  I just realized that it's all good to go and it's now public.  So I definitely want to play around with it.  But you can theme the Android system,  the system UI settings, menu navigation buttons.  You can get in there and play around with it.  It'll survive a reboot.  Sometimes on these things, you know, you do it and then you reboot and it wipes  back to normal. So when you reboot, your your theme is going to stick around.  The permissions will not.  So you'll still have to plug it into the desktop app to make the changes,  even revert it back to the way it was initially.  But you can get in there and you can theme to your heart's content.  And you don't even need root to do it anymore.  Less and less reason to root your device.  And that's thanks to the folks at Substratum that put this all together for you.  So pretty cool.  But, you know, who has Oreo?  Not many people. So you might be waiting a while.  Hope you don't, though.  Once it happens, you have something fun to do.  All right. I think we did it.  We did it. We made it to the end.  And that was a lot of fun.  We had a lot of Google stuff to talk about.  And I'm really happy that I got to do it with both of you guys.  Thank you, Matthew Ingram.
