Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chicken pox, let's all get it  Well, you want to do it kind of you want to do it kind of when it's convenient as opposed to  During the school year as well  anyway  So Leo, here's my question for you. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I  Stood for 24 hours straight not that's a few things and I shaved my head and got a tattoo. He said well it could be sad  Were you really drunk he says no  No, you recommend a good shrink for you. Leo. No, he just said you'll get better eventually and he threw me out of his office  Anyway good to see you back from Davos. It's odd to come back from Switzerland have more snow in New York City

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I know and I'm jet-lagged now, but did you have fun and at Davos? Yeah, I didn't DLD before that in Munich  Yeah, it's it's a good week. It's an exhausting week. I have my roommate again. This year was Bill Gross nice  I like Bill a lot, which is which is Bill's bills the greatest. He is just as nice as kind earth  Yeah, I love him and a lot of interesting sessions a lot of talk about publishers and Google and all that  Any difference from previous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the World Economic Forum  And  What is it exactly? It's a bunch of as you call them mockers who got together

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 2,500 mockers and I sneak my way in I give them advice about blogging nine years ago  And they forget to disinvite you're like the court gesture gesture. Yeah. Yeah, we call it faculty  There to amuse and run sessions and things but you know, you just talk could you not go how could you not have once invited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you should go with Scoble there this year. No, it was weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was less less of the bigger there used to be the club hotel the club hotel  Used to be filled with Scoble's and and and other folks and they're not there as much more bankers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's so maybe they've gotten over their fascination with new media and now they're back to well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then again, you know, the forum is pretty amazing  It does everything in new media and everything about it started publishing on medium before medium asked them to it has stuff all over there  Pretty good at that any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anything new any new trends there among the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody asked you every year, you know, what's the mood of Davos? Thank goodness. I didn't hear anybody asked that this year. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Practically just did so sorry  What's the mood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Truck I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's not like they're all hot and bothered about something like HoloLenses or something they're not going crazy all over that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, but Nadala did talk about that and tried to I tried to understand what the heck of HoloLens would look like in  The world, but I don't I don't sure I cared. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, there you go, there's your report from  Really boring report from it was I think you're sandbagging. I think the Davos is probably like the best party ever  You just don't want us to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark, but he offers a great party on  Friday night to Google has a nice party with  Davos Benioff party the killers performed. Oh wow. Oh  My camera was the Google party because I'll forget and it was cold  and  Lot of talk about freedom of speech  after Charlie and though a lot of talk about you know, Google panic at DLD I met the new  Nga the new head of  Digital for for the EU and he's talking about reopening copyright all across Europe. That's gonna be a lot of fun a  Lot of about level playing fields and trying to  Disadvantage American companies that are now taking advantage of easier regulation  Well, and I say why not bring the regulation down for everybody rather than rise in it for everybody  Just that kind of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does I never ask you this but you travel more than almost anybody I know does your you use an xs6 now or  Mm-hmm, and does it work? Well, wherever you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, except this time I tried in an emergency the hotel Wi-Fi just just was as good as non-existent  I tried in an emergency to  And I have the of the T-Mobile free band T unlimited. Oh AT&T. Okay  AT&T and I couldn't  do the tethering I  Couldn't make a hotspot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're you wouldn't want to the cost of that would be prohibitive just for it just for an emergency moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to and I couldn't do it. It wouldn't let me do it which which upset me  Yeah, but we're gonna see we're gonna have a story about unlimited and then run down. We shall talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've actually briefly maybe not so briefly gone back to the one plus one  They had his deal last on January 20th to think that for two hours. You didn't need an invite  I said, oh what the heck and he bought another one  Another because I've given my old one to father Robert Jason still has his I you know  It's coming back to it. It this is a great phone and I love cyanogen mob  We'll actually be talking a little bit about CM 11 and maybe CM 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I find that the the the next six is better engineered on things like like odd things like Bluetooth connections

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One plus one was was flaky for me. Maybe yeah, I mean it's not official actually  Might as well talk about it now according to green bot cyanogen  Wants to take Android away from Google. We do a better job  Let us let us maintain  Android Kirk McMaster  McMaster  Wants to build a cyanogen which you know, so the the story the history of cyanogen is kind of interesting was originally a  Custom ROM that people would you know root their Android phones and put cyanogen on there and it was you know, basically  An AOSP version of Android that you would then I  Don't know quasi legally download the all the Google apps and make it a Google phone. Sorry Google. I wasn't talking to you  Oh, do you need something?  I'm ready  McMaster and so it's and I think you're putting in a one plus one gave it some real  Credibility because now it is the official  operating system on at least one  High-end Android phone and frankly those of us who used it Gina was always was always very complimentary  I know you were to really liked it  So Kirk McMaster is saying he hopes to build CM into a full-fledged Android rival  He wants its own app store a more open structure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's no sense to me  You're gonna fight against another app store developers have to build for another app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true  but but I do agree with him when he says that Android is really becoming a  commercial product favoring Google services and  While there is AOSP  Nobody want AOSP is the is the open source Android minus Google stuff  and no no no  sane phone manufacturers gonna do that Amazon is the best example of somebody who took AOSP and  Forked it and don't do without you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are the whole reason I use Android because it is integrated with with Google Plus and Google Mail with with  Gmail and and Google Maps and and so on that's exactly the selling point

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think for you  But if you were you know if you were in a developing country where you just wanted a cheap phone that work  Pretty much is the way the iPhone does but didn't come with that price tag  Then you might not care that it has to work with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now this cm11 on one plus one has all the Google services on it. Yeah, but yeah Danny

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do what you're not saving money if it doesn't work with Gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're gonna you're gonna save money if you're able to produce an inexpensive device  That is not Apple's device and yet it still can run popular app. Does it cost anything for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Samsung and others to make it a Google services compatible version of Android. They don't pay Google money

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they pay  Do you have to go but you have to go through and be like you have to get certified?  Yeah, but but that's that's what and I can't remember  I'm not gonna pronounce the name of the Chinese company. Is it Xiaomi Xiaomi? Thank you. But you know their strategy  I don't think is that they're running Android Google Android  They're just seem to be running their own vanilla version of Android  But it means that they can produce a device that costs less  But is like an iPhone in a market where  iPhones are popular but expensive hence the guy who you know comes through the airport with 800 of them strapped to his body

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well if I'm Xiaomi, I also  Want to make a version a phone that is more Chinese centric

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so, you know, and if you're in here in China, it's like I can't get Google search. Well, that's fine  I couldn't get Google search even if it was right  So I think that you know  I think there there is opportunity for those alternative systems and I think we're already seeing some of these countries have those alternative systems  But you know in the US I think it would be a huge challenge to try to say  Yo, we're gonna come out with Android and it'll be just like Google Android except, you know  None of this stuff you want. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've they're they're talking about deeper integrations in ways that Google doesn't give you access and that to me just screams  Forking in the same way that like you're talking to any work  Xiaomi I mean really what we're seeing right now, it's very interesting  It's suddenly in the past year, especially  All eyes are on developing countries and all of the money and all of the users that are there that aren't using smartphones yet  So I think what we're seeing here is cyanogen going from this  Hey, look what we can do with Android and turning into a company that is specifically targeting themselves  Towards those developing countries because there's a lot of money potentially in the long run to make there in the next five years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't care so much about that, but I care more about the put the political  Saying and McMaster says it he says Android today and iOS are essentially shells for Google and Apple services  Everybody else exists in these sandboxes with no access to the lower levels of the operating system  kernel  So he says, you know this we could make it more open  But the cost is you don't you don't get Google services and for Jeff, that's a non-starter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the cost of the ecosystem is that you get is a developer set you get you have another store developers have to develop for  Nothing. I think it's a high high risk for him now. We can create phones  Where you know, you're gonna quality software you're gonna have plenty of apps. You're gonna have a you know quality  environment, I think it's hubris I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't think it's hubris. I think it's a political statement  But I think it is like many political statements one that is fraught with peril and perhaps not even feasible  I think it's a correct political statement. I would like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good big bad Google shouldn't be promoting Gmail  How awful of you we're gonna we're gonna take your software that you created Google and we're gonna use it against you compete with you  Cuz you're so evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that they shouldn't be promoting it  It's just that over the past four to six years since we've had Android they have flipped it around and  Talk out of both sides of their mouths where they say Oh Android it's all open  But in fact, it's not open if you want to call it Android  I mean if you want to call it Android use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to complain about Android the other complaint about Android is that it forked in too many variations and the fragmentation was awful  So so people praised Google for bringing some control back to Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a difference between bringing control back into Android and another difference  there's a difference between saying we're gonna have a set of guidelines you should follow for good Android operating system and  Saying hey if you want us to license you out  So you can call yourself Android and then be able to have our Google Play services  You have to sign this agreement with the Samsung that says you got to put Google on the front page of this you got to  Put all this stuff over here and all these other things  As  Making sure that we had a consistent Android experience that was about making sure we had a consistent Google experience  But I don't know where I think you see some of the the frustration that comes in  You know  They want to play the open card as Google often does when it sounds good when they're  Competing against somebody who's not dominant and they've done this many times and then when they get dominant suddenly opens out the window  You've never ever seen  You have never for all the Google let's talk about openness you have never seen them say hey  We should have the open web index initiative where we have one big crawler  And everybody goes out there and gets this data and then anybody can build search applications on top  Because they could you know, they own that so they don't there's no sense of making that open

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think you're mixing apples and apples and com quads there. That's not a question if you just took with Android  You  Know what what I don't get is the attitude the cyanogen announcement a company makes something  We're talking about Apple this way Apple will they lose crap right or or if they do it's such a lower level  Of the of the toolkit that you can use but it doesn't doesn't have any of the value  I'm in the position of defending Google again. I don't always want to be here but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple never made any pretense of saying hey iOS. It's the open operating system. Everybody can use  You that it's more PR thing right that you know, it's a nice thing to poke at them  It's not gonna make much of a difference for you know, the typical person who's gonna buy a phone  I don't think they're going oh  I don't want to buy this Android phone because that was Google and they didn't tie it in with all you know  There's like what's the best phone that lots of people are using that it's affordable that it has the key apps that I want to  Run and in the US

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good attitude in the cyanogen announcement is the attitude of acting as if Google's bad  By by doing what's in its interest and now I'm gonna take the the OS that Google gives me for free  By the way, and now I'm gonna turn it against Google because school is somehow bad for promoting its own stuff  The reason I get upset about this is the same thing in Europe  Where the Google promotes its own promotes YouTube  Well, of course they do and spiegel doesn't promote focus and focus doesn't promote spiegel  But there's this different expectation somehow that Google and Android should should it if you want to fully open OS then make a Firefox  Phone make it make up make a Linux phone fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's a company what's what's so bloody surprising about this? They they are a company but it is a  Company that is inconsistent with its messaging to say you can't have our services on your version of Android  Right and that's what they do because if you if you're gonna create, you know, hey androids free everybody can use it  But if you're building a version that we think is going to be too popular or gonna threaten our version and the control we want  To have over ours. We will not let you have our services that is not crappy Danny or is gonna be bad  What if it's really great leave it to the users to figure that out if it's crappy the users won't buy it but  Just say I can't show me is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would know I can't get my hands on one, I don't know I think I could tell you it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  McMaster says we believe 35 plus percent of Android today is non Google Android  Obviously a lot of that is China, but we believe that trend is going to continue that 50% plus of the market will be non  Google Android  He wants to capture 20% of that we're making a version of Android that is more open  This to me this to me is what's interesting. So  Admittedly by the way, and I acknowledge this cyanogen built on a OSP which Google which we you know  Google created in effect. Yeah, I mean Andy Rubin created Android before there was Google but then Google bought it and it's been Google  It's from you know building it  So, thank you Google for that but I don't think that there's anything wrong with saying  That we're gonna take this open version of Android and  Make it and continue it and make it be better. That's all fine. Leo. I think that's all fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What got me and they know what was the attitude?  It was the attitude of saying Google's bad for morning Google's own products in its own product that we're also allowing you to use for  Free, I think it could I think it was ungracious. I think it was I think it was hubristic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at his statements. I think that might have been an analysis by other authors. I don't  Well, he does say Android today as I mentioned is a shell for Google services

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he wants to move away from Google. He's treating Google as bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all see the notion of what Google now is can be taken to the next level because we leveraged to other services  It can become complementary rather than just Google's services  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean it's fine. It's just it's just it's I don't I don't have a problem with a ford  I'm sensitive is this European thing that I'm just back from Europe where I hear all this crap about how dare Google  ever promote YouTube  You know, and of course if you go to ask for maps in Google, you'll get competitors maps right up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's just it's it's a ridiculous argument the issue and so people understand it is that unfortunately  While there does exist this AOSP this open version of Android  It doesn't have a very critical piece Google of the Google services  Which most apps rely on or many apps rely on to do what they do  So most apps won't work or many apps many of the apps you want won't work on AOSP without considerable modification  I think what cyanogen is proposing which would be great is to provide an alternate set of services  That aren't Google specific  So that developers who are writing, you know the next Siri or Instagram could  Have a choice and maybe and I if I were developer depending on how different it is if it's  If it's a similar API, maybe develop both versions so that there's an opportunity and you know, what he says is when you're a developer  You would like more options than just creating a stupid little application that inevitably gets acquired by Google or Apple  He says these companies can thrive on a non Google Android  Well, I also hear developers complain about having to write for too many platform. Well, that's a choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's because they feel like I mean that you can make look

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There there's Firefox OS. There are many other phone OS's but Android's a pretty good OS  And the only thing that makes it not open right now is that without Google services? It's not complete  and I think if they wrote as as  Luther in our chat room says an API compatible version of Google services  Maybe that would be it's funny because Oracle and Google are in a fight over whether an API can be copyrighted  This would be interesting to see Google on the other side of that fight with Cyanogen Cyanogen duplicates Google's Android API  Just as Google duplicated the Java API  And is getting sued by Oracle. I think that would be a good thing  I don't think nobody's making developers choose. It's just it's just providing an alternative for somebody who wants a true open source  phone system  Or mobile operating system. I like that idea  Boy, I didn't think this would be such a good conversation. No, who knew I was touching on that. I was gonna move on  Anyway  Anyway, I  Will see, you know, I agree with you. I mean no Amazon did nobody any benefit by creating its fork of Android  It's good for Amazon. But what if somebody did create a fork of Android?  That was more open and designed to be open. I think that would be great. And obviously  CM Cyanogen thinks there's a way to make money off of it, which is fine. I guess they're a business they have to  Um, I wonder what the open source's community response is to this maybe the open source communities who should be creating an API  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't there a case though where what was the what was the deal with india where you couldn't do cyanogen cyanogen sold exclusively in one market?  And they've talked about it shouldn't be on such a high horse. No, no, no, no, no, they're they're actually pissed off because uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apparently  um  They something happened they didn't expect  So the deal the deal was who is it? Who's the other company in this one? I can't remember jason howell the android expert expert

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see here. It was uh, well it was one plus and it was was it media tech or maybe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was an indian company and apparently what cyanogen said is what you know, we or one plus said is we didn't it was a timing thing  We didn't realize they were so close to market and so one plus got outed  ousted from the  Micromax micromax because micromax apparently had an exclusive with cyanogen, but cyanogen said well we didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This wasn't all i'm arguing is if you say you're open that doesn't go for exclusive deals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is a difficult thing for them because they're also a business right so maybe it should be an open source google  Yes, so is google and and business. Why is so why not their self-interest? So why should what's so wrong then about cyanogen doing a fork?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing just don't attack google for it. That's all i'm saying right  That's all i'm saying do whatever you want and good luck  And i don't think a fork of android is going to work terribly well if people have to develop to a whole new store unless you're going to  You know go into a developing country and really have marketing there to make it work good luck  But in the u.s. It's going to be niche of niche of niche of niche

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just i'm going back to 2007 to the post where they announced  android and actually what they announced was the open handset alliance and  The post is full of things like the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices  That through these deep partnerships of carriers and manufacturers developers and others  We hope to enable an open ecosystem for the mobile world by creating a standard open mobile software platform  We think this will be better faster pace that was 2007 since that time we saw google say things like  Don't use sky hooks location services use our location services  You can't have google play unless you do all this other stuff  Open handset alliance homepage the last what's new listing that they have on there is from 2011  right so  Yeah, i think i get what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There yes, well, or was it bait and switch it was no what they really did was give away something free  The issue was that it was free and that's what that was their business strategy. There's a difference between free and open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, absolutely. Absolutely. No, they have  A business strategy of giving away things for free and have had that for a very long time that continues

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have another business strategy of saying we're going to start some open initiative  Which they always do when they're behind in an area  And when they get into an area where they feel more secure the open stuff goes away  And they just go and they close it down and they do things that benefit themselves though google  And so and so I think that so I agree with you jeff, you know, what's there's no problem  They want to have android and they want to say android is actually all this google stuff and all these sorts of things  And the people who want to poke at them. It's amusing to hear them poke at them  It doesn't really make that much of a difference  But the reason google gets poked that way is because they set themselves up for it. Yeah. Yeah. That's good point. Good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although google would probably still claim that it is open because it has the aosp  The aosp so really what what happened here is google google forked itself  It it created aosp which is the open thing and they still claim we do have an open  Version of android but then they went in this other direction the google version of android which is what everybody apparently wants  Now so this is the other open thing is is less desirable, but they're jason jason isn't there also a quality issue here, too?  Issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That and and a fragmentation issue  So it's hard what we're asking about here is motive  What part of this did google do because was bait and switch?  What part of this to google do because the fragmentation was driving everybody crazy and there were quality issues around the android brand  And I don't know the answer to that, but I think that's what your that's what you're trying to grapple with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's a long-standing debate is how open is is android? Yeah  We've had lots of hours on this show about that  And i've actually changed my tune a little bit because I felt like well they're giving away source code  But what's become very clear is that aosp is a very weak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're talking android android if you're talking android android is not open because android is a trademark that google controls and google licenses  so  I you know  Aosp is not android it just happens to have the name android as part of the acronym  That's part of the confusion isn't it?  You know and and but and and it also gets confusing because google will use stats when it to their benefit  Google will tell you we don't control what the search is on android  When they mean android osp and they'll point to something like an amazon as an example of that see well  We didn't control that and they're kind of right  But not really because that's not really android google really and google's building on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The strength of google services and really wants you to use google services  And you know what most consumers like jeff want google services. That's what android means to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is fine and and and there's going to be some of those consumers who be like  I don't want your weird forked weird thing of android  I want this from google because you know  I know what i'm getting in the same way that they know that what they're getting when they get ios and that's what they want  As well, so, you know and i'm not buying a fire phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I do think there's room in the world and I encourage cyanogen mods for  aosp versions uh that have  The same feature completeness as a google services version  And uh and as an alternative to google what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be happier you see but for me who's not not you know geeky into the into the openness of the split  I liked having a one plus one that operated as an android phone  A one plus one that can't operate as an android phone because they've forked it. I've got no interest in  So I like the idea of having competitive handsets  Competitive manufacturers that's when I was applauding cyanogen for for for coming up with alternatives within the ecosystem  And now they're saying we're going to move away from that ecosystem. Well, god bless them godspeed  That's their business decision, but that takes me away from them because I have no interest in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's ironic because I one of I love windows phone, but I can't use it because it doesn't support google services  So, uh, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which by the way one last thing drives me batty  Because you know google is all about we're gonna again  We want to have our stuff where people can get things or whatever and yet they just will not do anything for the windows platform  With the exception of building a search app because heaven forbid people not be able to do a google search on their windows phone  That is what they need to get fixed and I find it so disheartening because if you're using google voice or other google services  You end up getting these third-party apps and it's like well my trusting my password with them or you know  What's happening with it?  And I think it's a security issue that google ought to fix and it's not hard for them to develop stuff. They want to do it  but  anyways windows windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it makes I think and I think you can make a strong case that it's an anti-competitive reason that google doesn't do it  They could say well windows phone's too small for us to spend the time on it. It's not it's because it's microsoft and you don't like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't like you. Skype on chrome. Skype on chrome. Skype on chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's that's microsoft doing something that's offering skype on chrome or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft will not do skype has not done this now making noises  They will but but the reason i'm on this chrome book right now is and i'm on google plus right now  Is because there's no skype on chrome because microsoft won't do it so the game works both ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you not do skype through the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope, he can do skype. He won't use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A mac or windows he's assisting on using chrome os, but you can't do skype through the web a web skype

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the thing that they're gonna do is a skype on the web  I think that is coming but google's really solved that with uh with rt, which I really like  Uh, what you might call it web. What is it web rt?  now  Rtc now rtc now i'm an acronym hell because i've been just did a microsoft show so i've got rt on the brain  Web rtc is that it? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me take a break and get my brain into the google land into google land  Our show today brought to you by  The source of my toner cartridges  I love these guys ld products the ink and toner experts  When you need high quality printer ink or toner cartridges go to ld products.com  You don't go to a car dealership to buy gas do you so I go back to the printer fact manufacturer to buy  ink and toner, especially when you know, they practically give away the printer because they're gonna  Rain you on the ink or the toner ld products offers a quality alternative at a fraction of the cost  In fact, some of these products are up to 75 off the oem price  They do sell oem cartridges and inks if you want to get them there at a very very aggressive price  But I love these these compatible choices.

Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, have you read zoe we're gonna try to make sense of this i've been trying now for a week  We talked about this on twitter. We've been talking about it on the mac break weekly zoe keating  She is a cellist  who uh  Amazing amazing chalice an incredible artist. She does a lot of beautiful music and she has been using  Uh youtube to for two things  Um, one is she puts music up on youtube, but the other is  There are thousands of people on youtube who are completely legally using her music. She encourages that  um  Uh as as background in fact the game of thrones special effects reel  Is uh is done, uh  With a background of zoe keating cello music so it's very popular  She she does that by turning on content id. That's the google  Uh automated thing that that listens to everything that's uploaded and says oh that's zoe keating song notifies her  and then uh, she  Decides whether she a if she doesn't like it  She says I only only issue a takedown if it's hate or you know something really horrific that I don't want to be associated with  most of the time  Uh, what she does is share in the monetization. So if somebody's got ads on their youtube video  She'll get some of the revenue from that. She says that's a significant value to her  She's sound most of her music income comes from stuff. She sells on itunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, let me just uh, I met zoe last year at davos  As part of a project i'm working on with the world economic forum on rethinking copyright at the next level  And zoe is a tremendous example of someone who finds new business models who doesn't just sell content and restrict access to content  Which is the old copyright model zoe says I want to have this kind of openness where people can use my stuff when I make  Money on it. She wants data about who her fans are so she can deal with them in in in valuable ways  Zoe is really a visionary not only in her music but also in her view of creativity copyright and business models

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so she  This by the way is a very complicated story the original post. It seems pretty clear  But then there have been google's responded and says the stuff she says is patently false  And she says well, please explain to me because i'm i've been negotiating this for a year  She says that google called her and said, okay  You have to sign on to the new youtube music services agreement or we will block your youtube channel google has since said no one said block  But she's very clear in her memory of that  Now this is if that's the case. It's quite  you know  draconian because  All of her catalog these agreements music agreement it means music key means that all of her catalog must be included  In both free and premium music services  Everything she does even if she does it elsewhere has to be included there  Um, even if I don't deliver all my music because i'm a music partner anything that a third party uploads with my info in the description  Will automatically be included in the music service, too  All song all songs set to monetize  She has no choice in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She seems to me that that's that's like a that's as if they're an old time studio  Saying you have to have an exclusive, but I don't know who's right on which side of this  But but that's what really got me most about zoe's post was no  I should have a full as an artist. She should have a full choice of saying what goes where

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she wants to say for instance release music on itunes first  And then put it on youtube. She wants to but you the agreement says you have to release it on youtube the same time  You release it anywhere else  Uh, and it's five-year contract  Uh, she says this this is onerous and I kind of agree with her now google's response  Uh, which has been quoted by um the guardian among others  Is that well no

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I don't know who to believe on this. Uh, what does google say in essence?  Well, I haven't read their response yet. Um google says we never said we'd block you  Um  Google says we never said you couldn't just have content id and opt out of music key  Um  Is they say youtube is this is the guardian youtube is adamant  It will not block musicians from uploading their music to its service or running a channel if it doesn't make this agreement  The company also says it is not stopping artists from releasing music on other platforms earlier than youtube  So there's some debate over what she whether what she says google said they said  She seems very clear that no they said this they said it more than one time  I've been talking to a sales rep now. I have to say we've had conversations with sales reps from youtube  Uh that have been completely goofy  Uh, so I don't know how well trained or well informed these these sales reps actually are  um  you know, I mean  The my experience talking to youtube we wanted to get on youtube live my experience with that was not  Positive at all. We just threw up our handset. Never mind  um  Youtube says musicians who don't agree to its music key terms still have control over their content in terms of copyright  They can still get videos videos that use their music without a license removed  But it's not clear whether they can still use content id for that. They might have to do it themselves  Um  believe me  If you have thousands of people using your music, that's not something trivial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the most disturbing thing about content id is content id wasn't designed as a way for  Google to somehow try to force artists into putting things on youtube or to somehow compel them into it  Content id is an anti-piracy thing and it's a it's a nice way  For people to say, all right  I don't have a problem people using my music and i'm going to make some money off of this  So you use your content id and you can figure that sort of thing out  And that really shouldn't be tied in with anything else that should just be something google's offering to anybody  Who has worries that their content's being taken and used on youtube without permission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right danny and it was it was it was a really smooth good way around the copyright fight to say go with  The flow and make money on it. Yeah, uh, and rather than taking issued or takedown notice issue a share notice basically  And I I agree. I think that's it's you kind of can't it's like it's like when the bank says  um  uh  You you have to use the automatic teller so you don't use tellers and then when you use the automatic teller  They charge you to use the automatic teller  You know, they're getting it both ways. It's like an airline. You can't have it both ways  Content id was a very clever and good way to get around the content fight. So leave it at that. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so keating has posted  A follow-up post she posted it yesterday with a transcript of her conversation with the youtube representative  Oh my confirming, uh now it's a transcript. It's not a recording  confirming, uh everything she said  She said she says for instance  Well if I wanted to just let content id keep doing its thing and it does a great job at it  I'm totally happy with it  And I don't want to participate in the music service. Is that an option the rep says that's unfortunately not an option  That's where the crux of this is. Yeah, assuming I don't want to then what would occur?  So what would happen? Um, well so in the worst case scenario  Because we do understand there are cases where our partners don't want to participate for various reasons  What we basically have to do is because the music terms are essentially like outdated the content this does sound like  one of my favorites youtube reps the  Uh the content that you directly upload from accounts that you own under the content owner attached to the agreement  So we'll have to block that content  But anything that comes up that we're able to scan and match through content id we could just apply a track policy  But the commercial terms no longer apply so there's not going to be any revenue generated. So the rep says  We will block your channel and you won't make any more money  You can still use content id, but you're not going to make any more money. She says well, that's pretty harsh  The rep says yeah, it's harsh and trust me  It's really difficult for me to have this conversation with all my partners  But we're really what we're trying to do is basically create a new revenue stream on top of what exists on the platform today  So unless zoe keating is lying and I take it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your experience or the rep is rep is misinformed and the rep could be freelancing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't know that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean this is a case where it would be great  Given the power of of the twit network is to bring together somebody from google and bring together zoe keating and say i'd love to do that  Plus, what's iron i'm out here. Yeah what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  she says I  You know, unfortunately her husband is very very ill right now and so she's focusing on that  She says youtube is not at the top of my priority list right now  So the fact that she's even been posting this is pretty impressive exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She pulled back entirely from before me because the tragic diagnosis for her husband  She said she did say I was relieved to see this that he's somewhat stabilized and somewhat better  And that's why she's doing this now, but this is the last thing she needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last thing I don't you know, it doesn't feel good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  either youtube has  sales reps who are freelancing  And putting pressure on people much the same way comcast has notoriously put pressure on its customers, which is a bad cultural thing  Which isn't good  or  Worse right the reps right and youtube's lying  In to the press about what their deal is  Either way, it doesn't look good for for youtube  No, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and youtube is just I think with susan wajiski there now  They're trying to get new senses of what the business of youtube is which is good, right?  I think there's new opportunities  But in the discussions I have with with publishers youtube is also an important thing for them and and and you've got to be able to rely  on getting good deals with these  uh, I mean  The case of you know, it's one matter to go to google news and say well  I I quoted your story or I mentioned your headline and that's not to my mind copyright theft  But in the case of a video and music it's very clear cut. It's copyright protected  And and there's no copy in there and there's no summarizing there. It is it either is or isn't  So youtube has to have pretty clear ways to deal with that  and as danny just said  Cut it id was their way out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a response to the dmca

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  That was a clever and good response. It was a great thing and look at the zoe was brilliantly saying, okay  I'll go with the flow  I'll allow people to create i'll allow youtube to grow. I won't do takedowns and I can make money  Cuckoo-cachoo group hug. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but I think this betrays to me a little bit of of one of the things i've worried about with youtube  Which is they really would love to entice artists to use youtube  but  Only to the extent that they can make money on it and they're very happy to parade the handful of artists who make a ton  Of money on youtube  But the truth is the vast majority do not youtube takes a very large portion of their revenue  We don't know exactly how much but something like half  And uh, and in this case they're leveraging content id  Uh to strong arm somebody into signing rights over to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the issue is if if google wanted to offer an exclusive deal with with with uh, improved  Shares and better benefits fine offer that  but but to to to strong arm  from position of strength  and say  It's exclusive or nothing. That's like an old hollywood studio. That's not what we want in this world  So I don't know what's true here  Uh at the end of the day, I think i'm sensing from the guardian articles that  No matter what happened in the negotiations prior to this  Youtube is starting to see that they're not necessarily in the best position. So maybe the good will come out of this  I think it will god bless zoe for for being open about this. It's wildly complex  Uh youtube should sit down and figure this out and there's no reason to end up at war with artists here  Their desire in the end is is the contrary their desire is to have tons of artists come on youtube  and succeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You nail it with the old media because the old media really sees content creators as uh,  A gold mine to be mined, you know as a as a field to be plowed  Uh, not as partners in any sense of the word  They're just you know, they're good for making us money until they're not there's always been and i've as a long time  player in old media  I know this there's always been this antipathy between  The owners and the content creators and if you know, they don't like you  And they're they're like you just long enough for you to make them money and after that they get rid of you as quick as they  Can and I would hate for youtube to be uh to treat uh creators that way  They've certainly made noises in the opposite direction, but then now it looks like they're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At dld I interviewed samir aurora who's the ceo of of what is now called mode media, which part of which is glam  And and i'll make this as short as I can glam has has become a seventh largest web property out there and full disclosure  I've over the time  advised glam  and  Samir did this really neat chart. It's on my blog, but it's really hard to see and hard to it's too complex  But just to summarize it very simply  If you add people to content if you add social to content  Networks to content you scale in ways that were never possible with old media  So the upper right quadrant highest media margin of his chart that he draws  is companies that  Do not pay for um content and do not pay for traffic  Then below that a slight bit is companies that don't pay for traffic  But do pay for content on a revenue share basis  Which is to say when it makes money and in that he puts youtube and glam they share revenue when it makes money  Then if you start going down the chart and go to the lower left you get to old time media  No, that's that's the bad chart. That's a very old chart  Uh, you get to a very old media companies. I think it's the third one down good because that looks like cancer  I don't like that chart at all. It's exactly this one. So then on the left you see places like time inc and um  Uh, you know old media companies where they pay for audience. They market  They also pay for content whether or not it makes money because that's what they have to do  And so the margins on the upper right are are far better than old media on the lower left  So youtube is up there trying to invent new models where you enable huge amounts of content  You don't pay for it except when it makes money  The the social nature and the viral nature of things you don't pay for marketing it markets itself. The audience does that  It's a very high margin business extremely high margin. It's a good business. It's a platform business  We like that so then you've got to operate like a platform. You've got to be open enough  Otherwise, if you start shutting down the platform, you're just turning yourself into  You know a walled garden an aol a time ink, you know pick who it is funny they used to be together

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i've never been sold on the youtube model. I've always felt like uh, this was really more of an old old media model

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In sheep's clothing that's where we disagree. I think I think youtube can it has been can be and can remain a platform  I would love that where  And it doesn't have to be blockbuster blockbuster

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh people can make money, but where there is is there a long tail on youtube?  Yes, okay. Sure. Sure. So so smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  titles can smaller guys can make something and then the other part of this is  Again, this goes back to the copyright work i've been doing with with world economic forum, which we now expanding to other industries  It's not just selling content. It's always a great example of this, right zoe says I want to sell concert tickets  I want data about my users so I can have a great relationship with them and they'll be loyal to me  I want to  Allow other people to use my music and thank you youtube you'll help me identify that and make money from that  Uh, what's what youtube and google should and and facebook at all should want?  Is content creators who do explore and can exploit new business models?  Because if they find themselves supporting only the old business model of owning and controlling content  Well, then they're back into the clutches of the old media companies that especially in europe are giving them hell  Yeah, so the more you encourage and enable multiple business models  Uh more flexible legal and technical frameworks the better off you are  So youtube in the long run I think is smart enough to see that they want zoe keating to succeed  They want many zoe keatings. It's better off if they have a bunch of zoe keatings in addition to some warner musics

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I would hope they're smart enough. They don't seem to be actually  Their actions don't seem to be living up to that but I would hope so and  We should you know the way this resolves will tell us a lot won't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I used to have an old city editor who had a tickle file as he called it and he put something in a file and  Say in six months i'm gonna look this up in three months. I'm gonna look this up  Yeah, this is a story where we should we should vow jason if you've got a calendar to put this in here  We should come back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two months and see what's happening with this one. I would hope this is not a similar case to the android conversation  We had earlier  Where youtube goes oh it's open it's free it's wonderful and as soon as they get you in their web boom  We gotcha  I would hope that this isn't a trend

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all right facebook just posted that they had three billion views per day of video as part of their  That's the thing. I mean there aren't isn't aren't there not that facebook wouldn't be any better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I I do think there are other choices. There's vimeo. There's other places  And that I would hope there be enough competition  I'm sure that's if google is being evil. That's the calculus. Well, how long do we have to appear open before?  To close down the other guys and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but that's where daddy's point is right facebook coming looming there with video plays, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What youtube youtube has a monetization structure, but it goes it goes to the then it goes to the broader issue of you know  If you're zoe keating do you want to be on facebook?  But you know google was a search company that was supposed to point you towards content right now google is a media company that  Wants to own and control its own content  And then it gets it is and it has we have this fight danny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff and I have this fight all the time because I agree with you. They don't really own the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They they own pages that they drive people to where they want to have people land  and so, you know, that's  That's that that they are in competition with other people in their own search engine  And i'm not talking they're in competition with yelp. I'm not talking the absurd argument  While they're fighting with other search engines. I'm meaning like if I do a search for watch game of thrones  I'm going to just do it right now and I get my ad that comes up. I get an ad and google play

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not making any difference. They're not making  Uh war of thrones to compete with game of thrones whereas amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is no, but they're listing themselves before itunes and they're listing themselves before amazon and they're in fact  They're listing themselves before hbo  You know or they want to have a music service and a video service that competes with these other services and I and it  Probably makes sense and probably inevitable that they had to go that way  But it's difficult when you're also supposedly running a search  Search for game of thrones. What's the first thing that comes up google play  99 an episode

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I search for google game of thrones and hbo.com log out of your log out of your customization  I see hbo too, but watch game of thrones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right if I search for game of thrones i'm getting just game of thrones the site that's coming up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I get hbo and they offer a service. I don't have any problem with them saying hey  You can watch it on play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if i'm searching for game of thrones hbo comes up first. Well, yeah, because that's the game of thrones website  Yeah, but if we're talking about somebody how about try buy game of thrones that might be a really good one  Let's see where I I can buy game of thrones number one amazon  Okay, then best buy then forbes  With an article then store.hbo. In fact, it's way down on well actually number one go back up  Is an ad is there's the ad but then this is the first result

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see over you see over on your right hand side the shop for buy a game of thrones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's all the google play stuff. Yeah, those for me, but that's an ad from google play. It says sponsored

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't matter that it's an ad for game of you know, it's still them. Look at it. It's google plays coming up  It's also prettier by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny go that's a conflict of interest Jeff land up there. That's a classic conflict of interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well hbo is not going to put homeland up  They're the they're a company they do what companies know because showtime makes it surprised with that. That's all again  I know i'm coming off like a fanboy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not because their business which they make most of their money off of still  Is providing people the ability to locate information across the web in a manner that's supposed to be untrusted  And it's supposed to be trusted and biased and not skewed and the listings are but they've always had ads  They have had ads, but they also have their own content that competes with other people and it's like it's not really google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean this is still it's not really content. They don't have war of thrones. They don't have their own show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if they don't own show and I would imagine this is just around the corner does as netflix amazon and others have done  And starts making its own content with that change your tune

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because then then danny's going to come back to me and say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  I was right and he would be right  I don't know. I'm right because they haven't done it yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I don't see a difference between them. We don't make the content and  We sell it the content right they they have destinations. That's the thing to me  Do they have a place where they're trying to send you that's back within the google network as opposed to sending you outside of google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when they started it would be cleaner have things it really would be you can't disagree with this jeff  It would be cleaner if google were just a search engine  That they do muddy the waters a little bit by having well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We would get into that leo right off the bat when I ask for an airline and they give me the airline data  Then the airline industry says, you know the saber and people like that say well you're screwing me  But google says we're getting you right to the information you want not forcing you to go through five other pages with five other ways  And as a consumer i'll take and give you but there's there's a difference and the difference is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you do a search and this is what I mean about the absurdity of search engines complaining about google competing with them as opposed to  Content destinations or brands or owners or people who own and operate stuff  If I do a search and i'm trying to find a flight  Presenting me with search results isn't is not necessarily good for expedia  But it's not taking away the ability for me to then still book the flight through the people who really matter the airlines  google's job is to connect me with  What I want and if and and to connect me to publishers and brands and people who have the services that I need  So the fact that if I do a search on google and I don't have to go then to expedia and then have to go through  Another step to get to the things is much different than if I do a search on google and  They send me off to google play where they make their own money as opposed to pointing me over to itunes or amazon  Where the same exact services do point me to amazon danny. They do point me to amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, the search is right there. They point me to amazon first thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Oh my my so much to learn from this video so much to learn  All right facebook's results are in what was the rev the profit was 10 billion for the quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Revenue grew 49 percent in the fourth quarter  Ended wednesday ended 2004 with 1.39 billion monthly users

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One wait a minute. Let's get that one. Let's get that one out right in front  This is their new three nine active monthly active user number  Remember when 86 percent of them remember accessing on smartphones and other mobile devices remember when it was like oh facebook  100 million users. Oh facebook 300 million users. Oh facebook a billion  1.39 billion  active users every month  86 percent mobile and almost all of them mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mobile ads account for 69 percent of ad revenue remember that was the other thing when facebook went public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they haven't cracked mobile. They'll never figure out how to make money in mobile. Oh, they can't make money  Wow  Uh, wow  That's pretty impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  86 percent growth was exceeded by its operating expenses which grew roughly 87 percent as a result of sharp increases in research and development costs  And marketing and sales spending and mark doesn't care at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope  That's fine  We're in investment mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's overall revenue rose to 3.85 billion from 2.59 billion in the year ago period  That's 54 cents a share versus the analyst estimate of 49

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're not making a huge amount of money, you know a billion a quarter  but  They're growing they're growing. It's the amazon world  Yeah  Hey, but it's better than amazon because amazon had many many many quarters where they made no money  Facebook's taking a little off the top each each month  Yeah, just to pay the rent  Wow, by the way, they have 11.2 billion dollars in cash  So their position is good for and nothing like apple, but their position is good for acquisitions. What's apple's cash? No. Oh, it's well over 130  Billions something like that. It's a big number. I don't remember apple by the way just  They announced their revenue last last yesterday and they they are now they've made more money in last quarter than any company in the history  of humankind  That's a license to steal wow  Jesus more money than they're they beat these russian  Gazprom the natural gas conglomerate from russia in for quarterly profits  They made more money than any

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Company in the history of the world last quarter. I see this now. They made more than god.com made more than god.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I you know facebook isn't that in that kind of you know profitability, but that's okay  Because they're making a you know, a billion a quarters ain't not not bad and they're and they're growing like crazy  Very interesting and they but the main thing to me is they licked that mobile thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which was which was really just and I think more impressive than than where google is on that was the advertising end

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, nobody thought they could monetize mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is part of what what samir at glam says that mode says too  What's the the next thing he argues is streams?  So facebook understands streams twitter understands streams  Google doesn't really have streams they tried to a google plus and I still like google plus laugh at me if you will  But that's the closest thing they have to stream  Whereas facebook is in streams or mobile and and streams with ads inserted  That's what's working for now. I don't know how long that's going to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's working for now you think facebook will ever have a revenue sharing system like youtube does  I mean here's an opportunity for you were talking about this daniel  There's an opportunity for facebook here for people like zoe keating if they offer them  uh monetization  Could facebook do that would facebook do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they they could you know, or it could drive people back to their pages  I mean the the difficulty is that facebook doesn't have like a kind of music service in the way that you know  Google does and I think one of the things that kind of saves facebook from the issues that google has had with youtube is that  You don't typically go to facebook. I think and do your searching for videos  In fact, I can't even I have to go back and see if video works, right?  You know people go to youtube because they think I want to hear this song  You search for it you find the song and you play it and facebook is much more about video discovery and  Pushing out the videos that they want so they could make zoe a star  You know if they decide they wanted to make her a star by saying great  Let's let's make sure we're pushing more of her things that are out there  But it's certainly giving you know people who are doing videos a new area to to be exposed  But I still think it's a bit different than the way people sometimes find things on youtube and of course  You have people who tune into youtube channels just because I want to hear this from a particular thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course zoe keating does have a facebook page and you can like her, but there's no rev share back to her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's purely promotional there is an opportunity there dany and I were at a conference called newsgeist  A few months ago where dany was brilliant  And one of the things we talked about there was putting content in containers so that you can embed it  And if you could embed something onto facebook and onto twitter and onto google plus  And keep your business model  at some level with that  Uh, then I think that opens up a tremendous amount for content creators across these services now where the services do it  One thing we talked to google about that meeting was saying well, you know google plus, uh, you know  So it's not taking the world over so you couldn't you could sorry my lights went off  You know you could use google plus as a way to kind of push facebook and twitter a bit and and and and do best  Practice with content creators. I like given the discussion we just had about youtube youtube being an embeddable  Content container with a business model attached it kind of is the model for that and what I would hope is it could be used elsewhere  Including even at facebook. What is this thing that you said they would use?  You and I talked about that. We were when we were at that session about what could google do  At news guys there was talk about basically embeddable content  Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Invented google plus my god, you're a genius

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yes, yes, I thought you were a nice guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wanted some google plus hate been a while. It's really trouble because uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Video just doesn't express sarcasm. Well, no, no, so uh, it's not your fault. No, america doesn't express sarcasm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, you know, it's interesting when when I go to zoe keating's facebook page and it's and her about it says her web page is  twitter.com  slash zoe keating  So I mean zoe cello so  Maybe maybe this is a lesson that we all should learn you need a website. Is that really old school old-fashioned? No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No for for goodness sakes  Everyone should have a website with your own domain name  It's like do you want to have your own phone number that you control? I it's  But actually she does because her her blog posts are all on zoe keating.com. So I take that back  Although she doesn't listed but you know, it's tumblr  Is tumblr like having your own website? Not if it says tumblr.com. It does your own name  So see so then like here's what happens in like five years  Tumblr crashes somebody buys it it goes all geo city and your your your home is gone  You need to have on tumblr you could be zoe keating.com and you should write because then you could redirect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could redirect wherever you want to go. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's also a lesson you're finding a lot of people start to realize where they thought  As facebook picked up they're like I just have a facebook page now and i'm just putting everything to facebook  And then like suddenly they're like, where's all my traffic from facebook gone?  And it's like well, you know you built your house  You didn't build your own house you you rented or at least somebody else's house, right?  so and they could take it away your own house and  Set up your franchise is where the traffic is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you danny, but there's another argument if you look at what andy carvin has done under the omitiyar. It's impressive reportedly  Reportedly he he doesn't really he's he's on twitter. He's on facebook. They're on twitter. They're on facebook  They're on medium and the closest thing they have I think to a home page is on medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know what people on medium are going to discover the same damn thing  They're going to go off on medium because it's all hot. It's all the new tumblr or whatever  And down the line they may be like, oh, I actually want to move to the next hot thing  Let me ask this if you have a zoe you kids what happened to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let me ask this if you have as zoe has zoe cello at zoe cello 1 million followers on twitter  Don't you always have a channel for saying? Oh, i'm no longer on tumblr come to this site

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean you you do but you've got people out on tumblr who then have to find you and by the way all those links  The people started pointing to your thing go away, you know, google kind of cares about you want those links. Yeah  So you it's it's not hard to have your own home in most places and it can live on tumblr  Just needs to be you can if you could still be on tumblr  You can still say I want to have my tumblr and i'm going to post over there  And point you to my main thing or or however you want to do it  Although you know I get that it can be a headache for some people at first  But I think it is a short-term headache that saves you from a long-term one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently she does have zoekeating.com. So we're not we're not singling you out zoe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, and you know, and that's that's the other thing too  It's like it's really easy to sit back and like say someone should do this someone do that  I am really a big believer in that you actually  Want to know why people are doing certain things some people want to be  Out on like I think you know search engine we have a tumblr  Because there's people out there and we're not worried that if that tumblr goes away  You know, what will we do? But it's not our main house, right?  It's like hey, there's a tumblr neighborhood going up. Well, we're moving in as well  And by the way, if the party gets big come on over to our house. We've got more room. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's one  Cops don't like ways they say  This could be dangerous that ways tells you there's a police officer on the road  Big bad google again, they call it a stalking feature  and  Which is ridiculous  I doubt cop killers use ways but  Maybe anyway, they're campaigning  To pressure google to turn off  Because google owns ways now the feature that warns drivers and police are nearby  It could put lives in danger

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basic lesson is you can't control information anymore guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll find some way to know where you are that information gets there because other ways users spotted a police officer  Usually the reason for it is  Because it's a speed trap or you know, they they just want to let you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should drive more carefully because there's also an indication that there's been an accident or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a cop there. Well, you have a button for accident too. I mean, uh, you do. Yeah, my experience is this is more like  Hey slow down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but but google's answer was the more people think there are cops all over the slower they're going to drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually better. Yeah, julie mosler  Speaking for ways says ways does work with the new york police department and others around the world by sharing information  These relationships keep citizens safe promote faster emergency response and help alleviate  traffic  congestion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's hard because you know whenever they do a dui checkpoint they're required by law to tell you they're gonna  Oh really there. Oh, yeah, they have to pre-announce where they're gonna be you have to know so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that seems why why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because people have a because people have a right not to I guess  You know get into a search area. I don't know. I don't know why it is and maybe it's just the california law  But they have to announce them in advance  Also when you come up to a checkpoint you have to have the ability to turn away from that checkpoint  If you don't want to go through it, really you're kidding  Yeah, I think I did a story on I think I did a story on checkpoints once not my neck of the woods out here  They block all the turns and then they're probably violating the law  And if you actually got a ticket, well, first of all, if you got a ticket, I'd probably hope that you did but sorry  you know, but  Um, but no you're supposed to be able to turn off and that that's part of the way the law works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is not the first time for us senators in 2011 asked apple to remove all applications  That alert users to drunk driving checkpoints  Which was nokia removed the sobriety check tracking function in one of their apps  Trapster was eventually discontinued at the end of the year  But the founder says it was because ways did such a so much of a better job  I understand police would be nervous about this. Uh, you know if you were gonna I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can totally understand it, especially what happened in new york  And you know my first initial reaction when I saw that was like wow  Yeah, that is scary and then on if you think a bit more  It's like it is not difficult for you to figure out where police are without having to you know  If you're gonna go if you're gonna go out trying to find a police officer  You probably don't need to rely on ways to figure out how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the truth is people don't just have guys who are on patrol in there  The truth is they're putting up speed traps, right?  And and then god help me again. Google has a point that that you know, you end up you end up slowing down  The cops don't get to zap as many people but if people are actually going slower, it's better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well when we get the auto driving cars, it won't matter because then you'll be speeding it all be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they'll report on all your movements and then we'll have a privacy uh, crisis and that'll be the world. I believe that's grizzle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is grizzle? I don't dare I ask parks and rec last night was so funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Grizzle is this big big google like company that's moved in and they're a site set in the future is like 2019  I love parks and rec. They there's like these drones appear and start delivering everybody gifts  Based on data mining all their searches and emails to try to get them to let them build something and it's like taylor swift  Yeah, it was very very close. Yeah  No, taylor sweet she would never do anything. She would never do anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's so much here and I don't want to  Belabor the point you guys have anything. Oh, I thought this was interesting  We talked I think last week about the thought that google was anticipated to launch its own wireless company  an mvno  sometime  this year  Uh, maybe in the first half of the year would be based  Uh on sprint and t-mobile and that's kind of the interesting  New information, which is that google would decide?  Where you're getting the better signal from wi-fi t-mobile or sprint and then the better price is  Well, that would be even more interesting and then just choose it  Automatically, so you would be if you were using google's wireless carrier  In effect the customer of all three or sprint and t-mobile plus wi-fi  Google did not have a comment on this, but I think that's fascinating. I think it really is  Uh, I would I would almost be tempted to say oh they'll you know sprint and t-mobile would never allow that and yet  sprint sells  us service wholesale services to mvnos  Where they're allowing them to undercut sprints own pricing. So I and so is t-mobile because our friends at uh as a tingle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ting  Ting thank you are gonna do I think aren't they gonna go uh, and don't they have now a um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T-mobile as well. Yes, m they have gsm. I thought that must be there must be it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? That's two things they're gonna do. Um  That and they're gonna do  Yes ting to offer gsm network good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I like this idea. I hope google does it  Because that'd be great, right? You just get whatever the because that's my concern about sprint in general here sprint's fine in some places  It's not great around here. You know, I see if it could switch off. Yeah, because that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who wouldn't want that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you go to india, every phone you buy there has dual sims for that reason. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not here  The other story there that I think is really really important and I since I have a grandfathered unlimited at&t plan  The ftc just said that unlimited means unlimited. It's enforcing the damn dictionary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says unlimited with throttling does not count

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now unless you get into the article unless you know you you made it clear

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell you i've gone into the stores and said wait a minute unlimited. Does that mean it's unlimited unlimited?  I can get as much as I want. Yeah. Will you slow me down at any point? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  totally fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At&t and verizon both have stopped offering unlimited data plans to new customers, but unfortunately they can't get jeff jarvis to leave  There are a lot of people holding on  Through all sorts of loopholes to their unlimited service  This came actually out of a case with track phone  uh, and in fact if you were a track phone customer who purchased an unlimited plan and was  Slowed down you could you may be eligible for refunds  According to the ftc the track phone generally slowed data service when a customer used one to three gigabytes and suspended data service at  four to five gigabytes  The case is about and it is the ftc let's face it the case is about false advertising  It's not about throttling. We're not challenging throttling in and of itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they should just do it because I don't I don't know how the fcc. I don't know how they can go through and say oh  Unlimited is not unlimited if you throttle unless you make it clear to people that you will limit their limited thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it's okay to still call it unlimited just means we're not going to limit the number of gigabytes you get no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No unlimited means you don't limit  It  By definition unlimited means you do not have limits it's like saying, you know  uninflated means  But only partially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it  Okay, if it's you know, I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's by the way what drives me nuts about t-mobile the most. I think they do these great  great  Advances to get people going off and to you know, and then raise the whole industry and then you can do all this like fine print  You're like, oh no, this is limited here. No, that's limited there. You know  So she's just just give us unlimited

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FTC should ban fine print let them use their five gigabytes and when they're done with using their five gigabytes then cut them off  and

Transcript:  Jeff you got a number for us  There's a lot of them this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fascinating column in the new york times seth, uh steven's devinowitz  Was looking at online behavior and sex  So I found lots and lots of numbers here a few of them he analyzed general social survey a classic source just to get a start off here  And found that heterosexual men said they performed 63 sex acts per year using condoms 23 percent of the time  That adds up to 1.6 billion heterosexual condom uses per year  Heterosexual women say they average 55 sex acts per year using a condom 16 percent of the time that has has up to about 1.1 billion  heterosexual condom uses per year 1.6 versus 1.1. Well, who's telling the truth men or women?  According to nielsen fewer than 600 million condoms are sold every year roughly twice the number of actual sales  Yes, wow, so then it goes on and it goes down to look at google's  Uh what google can reveal about american attitudes towards sex  And he said on google the top complaint about marriage is not having sex  Yeah  Searches for sexless marriage are three and a half times more common than unhappy marriage eight times more common than loveless marriage  Wow, there are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk  Um  Google searches for sexless relationship or second only to searches for abusive relationship  I don't i'd say they go together  Yeah, i'd say so on google  There are five and a half times more complaints about an unmarried partner not wanting sex than an unmarried partner refusing to text back  There are more complaints about a boyfriend won't have sex than a girlfriend won't complaints about husbands and wives are roughly equal  Um taken together the data suggests that americans manage to have sex about 30 times per year or once every 12 days  now, um  Google searches suggest one predominant reason enormous anxiety much of it misplaced  Start with guess what men's neuroses?  It isn't news that men worry about their genitals, but the degree of this worry is rather profound  From a google search alone. We cannot know the gender of the user  However, we can often make a pretty good guess he says i'm reading here for searches about sex and body parts like  my penis blank  Men google more questions about their sexual organ than any other body part more than their lungs liver feet ears  Whoa?  mind  Um  Side note one of the more common questions for google about a penis is quote. How big is my penis?  What men turn to google that a ruler with this question is in my opinion a quintessential expression of our digital era  What I don't know. Why would you google that?  I don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, and the irony is if you keep going  Yep, that uh more than 40% of complaints about a partner's penis is that it's too big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pain is the most google word used in searches with the phrase

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blank during sex you don't have to read the rest of these  He crying and farting round out the top five  Why are you people searching for this stuff?  This is what google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rot, however, only one percent of searches story. Danny. You have every search engine story there is you can miss

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That story i'm i'm just shocked. I am shocked very few people search for how to make your penis smaller  Interestingly only one percent of all searches

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that's that's there we are searching for sex i'm gonna have to read all this this is in the sunday review of books oddly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  enough at the new york times  Uh, seth stevens davidovitz writing. It's a really cool column. It's really funny. It's interesting and he got and you know  What's cool about it? He got it all by just you know looking up stuff on google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, where do you get this information? Where was he getting the data about men versus women?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Um, he he mentioned that uh, he just says analysis of google data  Yeah, he he has that in there of why why you can't tell in some cases men versus women  But he makes the result if you say my penis  Yes, that's why that was it. You assume that's that's a man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so but where is he getting all this? It's all says analysis of google data. Does google publish all this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh by by proportion. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So where would I go to look this stuff up?  I mean right there danny isn't that is that you danny would you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm he also does women. I think you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no not the men versus women but just the general google stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But even though he's saying stuff like men's top google concern about steroids is whether it might make their penis smaller  Um, just because they use the word my yeah, but I don't know where he's where would he get that?  Because it's like okay, you have to get a list of all the searches related to penises  Then you have to get it ranked by number

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you get all the search just you know for academic interest google might have provided or you can use things like google trends or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's all right. He may have he may have actually queried google  I'd have liked to listen to that phone call

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But see when he says like top 10 questions about my penis involves size average monthly searches for the phrasing  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could do that if you go into the google keyword tool and you're doing a search for penis  And then you're breaking it down by saying and then I suppose you can break it down with it from there by  Demographic so now i'm gonna have to go look. Thanks very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But i'm not gonna do that let's have danny let's have danny do his thing and then we'll wrap this sucker up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, you know what beat that danny beat that solomon. He has been I can tell go ahead  You know my thing was going to be semi-self-promotional. I suppose go ahead  The super bowl is coming up. Yes, it is every every year  We run a thing on marketing land called the hashtag bowl  We'll be doing it again on sunday where we look at all the ads that run on the super bowl  And we count up how many of them have hashtags or which social media networks are mentioned the most and at the end of it  We declare a winner last year facebook beat twitter by just like one one mention sometimes really  Yeah, it was very very close the year before that  twitter had won  And we also just kind of look at how often people are putting hashtags and then we will do follow-up coverage like about how effective was  Putting all this social media into the ads like if you did search for these hashtags  What did you get or where did you win?  So it'll be interesting to see you know  Will we get some breakouts like we'll have more snapchat in there what other kinds of things will come along or  You know  Maybe google plus will show a big surprise and people will show more with it and more integration with that, you know  Yeah, right. It has you don't let up. You just don't let up  No, you can see now first of all, you can see it's in our scoreboard  So we care about it enough that we actually consider counting it and it's third on the list. So there is  It's a distant third  Yeah, but there's you know, we're we're looking at what's going with it. But you know last year the numbers weren't weren't so big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, how's how's lo doing lo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this I like this. This is fun the social media  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Scoreboard during the game where we look at all the ads and then as soon as it's over we'll declare the winner  Of you know, which social network was mentioned the most does anybody do ads anymore without a hashtag?  Yes, a lot of them do like I think last year half of them either didn't have hashtags or didn't have um  Had they didn't either didn't have hashtags or they didn't have uh social media mentions  And it's very common too that they do these things and then they don't pay attention to search  So they put the ads up then you can go search and they've done a terrible job about helping you  You know find what the the official ad was or what the official information was and all that sort of stuff  So it's kind of fun to look at it. We're also going to give out an award this year where we talk about  who uh  Which official campaign which official advertiser we think did the best job during the super bowl with their ads and and social media tie-ins  And who was the sort of best unofficial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
