Hello, Jeff  Hello and to fill in for mr  Pruitt we've got somebody who's actually I think his ears have been burning over the last week  It's been the talk of the town a good friend Kevin Marx. Mr. Indie web is here from the UK  Hey there. Nice to see you all again just up the road from Wormsby Hall in  It's great to see you Kevin take a left at arms be  You you got a little up the hill you got hacker news  And then some for your blog post about Twitter's  decision to edit  tweets and in fact  Your post it was Twitter Twitter edits you and we talked about this now  I think Twitter's changed their tune about what's going on. So what's the latest on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, well do you need to explain what happened in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah better because otherwise the fix won't make any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so what Twitter and for a long time Twitter's had this ability for you to embed a tweet in your web page

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Which you could do you could always do by cutting and pasting the text or by screenshotting but Twitter didn't want you to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, so well this was Ben Ward came up with this in 2011  And it basically gave you a little thing you click in the top right corner of the tweet that says embed tweet and then it would  Give you a block of HTML to put in your page, which was a block quote with with a tweet in it and a link to the tweet  And then as a link to some scripts that would take that and flesh it out into

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh and he's frozen we'll never know here's the block here's the block quote  Yeah, so with the block quote it would have the text of the tweet in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, if you look it's got the text of the tweet in it right here. We're working and who said it. Yeah  Yeah, they are coding Twitter says a little bit confusing because Twitter and Twitter right but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But you'd also get the link the href but but most importantly you'd get this little bit of JavaScript

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so before you go on can I ask a dumb question? Yes. Ask a dumb question before you go on so that's when you embed  Which you know if I'm doing my my my WordPress blog in the old days with code  I would embed the code there now with medium and WordPress you just put in the address  Does that call on the embed code or does that embed differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, now that basically what the what they do is effectively do the same thing  so what they do is they I think they they actually call the  The own bad API that sort of provides which will give you that block of got it  HTML to put in your page. It's basically a shortcut to this. Yeah. Yeah  I mean, it's this is the same with the same the same problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin is about to describe and Twitter wants you to do this because for what they see you get the traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They control the content of the tweet and the functionality of the box is there too. You can click on yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, you retweet it and reply and copy and do stuff  Also, the other thing is this sort of it's a it's a mutual benefit thing because the other thing is them sort of fleshing out  The tweet into a real looking tweet is them saying yes, this is an actual tweet that somebody posted  Kevin didn't just make it up put it in the page  Which is you know fairly straightforward to do if you were just doing it's verifiable. Yeah. Yeah, so then they're saying yes  This was posted at the time by this person and if they got a tick mark is that it is the person with verified  So they're putting a certain amount of validation onto the tweet that you're quoting when you do this  now the problem was what happens when you delete the tweet when when the tweet is deleted by the  poster or Twitter suspends their account or they go private or  Twitter goes down or whatever. So what happens if there isn't  If Twitter can't verify it is it just falls back to the HTML and it shows you  Effectively the plain text of the tweak the block quote there would appear with the account the link to the date  But it will be starred whoever that is trying to start on your site

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Which is up to you. This is this is what it looks like and it's  It still has the a trip to the date. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's it's you know, it's gonna yellow box because that's how I do block quotes

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So that yellow is provided by you not by Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so this and I could style that I to look more tweet like if I wanted to write that's a right  That's an CSS thing, but the BF a shift. I keep it fairly plain on my side  So what would happen was?  That would be the full bank case  But recently they changed it so that if you if the tweet was deleted you'd get  a big white box

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Instead like kind of like this  Which has the Twitter logo has a button to go to Twitter but has no

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There was something here  I'm not quite sure what messages that's supposed to send. I mean the  It's like but you know you're  You're saying that there isn't a tweet there, but you're not actually saying what I've quoted  So you what it what it basically does is it's rewriting the text of my post and if you write a long post where you  Quote a bunch of tweets to make a make a case  They will disappear and the text that you've pasted in has gone and you just get white blobs

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I have to have to point out I was looking for an Instagram post  When you embed an Instagram post on the web it used to have the image. This is what you get now you get a  Big old piece of your page gone where the image would go and a simple link that says view this post on Instagram and  this is Instagram's kind of hostile thank you meta way of  Taking away that ability to embed a an image from Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want to view it you actually have to log in sometimes to your actual Instagram account. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Really hostile

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I haven't seen that one because I haven't embedded Instagram's like that, but yeah, that's it's a similar thing  It's them saying oh, no, this is I now under our control. Yeah, and you know the response from Twitter was that  Which we're doing this to better respect when people have chosen to delete their tweets and it'll have better messaging soon  According to the PM who was involved with it who hasn't tweeted since so I hope she's still okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Geez maybe she's just worried. Eli will get a get wind of her. She's hiding

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the but the challenge is the thing that gets tricky is when you've got if you're writing a long article where you're quoting some  Tweets and talking about them and going back and forth. It really messes that up  I'm sorry. I had an example of an old blog post I wrote about it. But also if you go and look at  news stories about the former president whose tweets are all now invisible or  If you go to like BuzzFeed, which regularly quotes  disappear  You what you find is basically Twitter is leaving white holes all over the web or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's a real import if you're doing a news story about the president former presidents tweets  And just as you point out calling James Comey a slimeball and the tweets are gone because he's been deleted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you go and like you want to write a book or like I mean Twitter is a is it a first source?  Jeff you might know this but like if you're actually like sourcing things officially for academic or  Right, it could be a primary source if it's you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put notes with  With tweets and I have like I added Jackson because it was part of the book. I'm working on. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but also they I mean they made a big fuss about  Archiving at the Library of Congress and things, you know, that's right  Go back we were talking about that when we were talking about your article

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We said but doesn't the Library of Congress which has the firehose don't they have it all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And what should they still do so yeah, so  That's the challenge is you then go to go and find somewhere else talk and there are sites that archive that will archive things for you  There's archive ph and archive org  Both you know archive will crawl things  Optimistically, you can also say please archive this and archive ph was explicitly designed for you to  Preserve a tweet in case it was deleted so you can link to that copy  So there are sites that will do that but you have to sort of proactively do that at the point  I'm about to put it in your site rather than just going to the Twitter thing do it because because Twitter is well  Twitter says users can delete their tweets, which is fair enough. The Twitter can also delete your account on you  And then then they tweet disappear  But also if you take your account private then these tweets then the tweets will no longer appear as embedded

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But this was our debate last week, which is an interesting debate is what is Twitter's responsibility is Twitter is Twitter a primary source?  Is it a social media of record?  Or is it like just you know an ephemeral spot where things come and go and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I know it has changed because it was originally a lot more ephemeral because they came in as text messages  The the archive on the site didn't show many of them and the search wasn't very good  And then it got better at that and so now they are you know now people will go back and find your tweets from  15 years ago and say what needy you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As an author of a tweet don't you feel like you have you should have the control to kill it and it stays killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  well to some extent but  That's the point so the compromise that they had was they wouldn't validate it if I deleted it  So they would just fall back to the  You know Jeff says Kevin said this and you just see the quote you wouldn't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The verification by Twitter kind of like I'd said that copied and pasted it or done a screenshot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so you know basically, but I could have edited it  It's straightforward enough to make someone's tweet say something else you can just you know  Chrome and editing yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacy you're gonna pop in no. I was just gonna say I mean I  Look at Twitter like if you would look to talking to a journalist right you're on the record  I mean, there's nothing secret about tweeting right  so I feel like once you say it as a user you may want to disavow having said that at some point, but you said  it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know  It's Dana Boyd's context collapse problem as well because a lot of the time once we do you're talking to some people and you're not  Really thinking about you're talking to the world  and yeah, those of us who work in media are sort of more used to the idea of being on the record and so on but  a lot of times people are just  responding and going back and forth and then suddenly find that their tweet has been made into a core celeb and or  Being sent a pile on by somebody with a bigger account  Who didn't like them and they're gonna get abused for the rest of the day and so on so there are yeah  there are some sort of messy issues with it and  Certainly people should be able to hide their tweets and hide their accounts and so on  and that's that's it get that's part of what gets tricky as well because Twitter now because Twitter has blocking and  Semi-public accounts and also you can delete your account and then under eat it again  It is first three or four states you can put Twitter into that will mean people can't see your post  You know, I'm I'm blocked by Chris Dixon because I argued with him about web 3 or whatever he calls it this week  Which means if I want to read his post I have to go and open them in a incognito window to work out what he's complaining  About so on so there's there's there's sort of these trade-offs like that that you hit all the time  and  then there's  So there's this and then there's the nuance of how to read displays the conversation itself because there will sometimes show you  conversations with bits missing because someone's blocked you or  Someone has blocked the person who's quoting them and that gets a bit like this gets a bit ambiguous as well  You know, I will sometimes see Chris Dixon's post if someone I follow us some I follow has quoted them  But only sometimes so that is they haven't fully  You know, it's all solved the problem because it's actually solving problem is hard in transclusion is hard. It's a hard problem  So, you know, I've got something with Twitter for trying to  Deal with this but I think the original thing that they did the bended years ago of  Will give you the text the tweet is a block quote that will be in your page and that you know  If Twitter breaks or a thousand years time that it'll still be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's not just Twitter if I embed a YouTube video and that video is deleted  I'm gonna have the same problem and we've shown you Instagram. They actually do that stuff that hasn't been deleted

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now that's that's true  I mean the thing about Twitter the Twitter is Twitter is released  Initially was text and you can quote the whole thing straightforwardly  It's harder these days because there are big there are there may be large images embedded in certain as well  And you don't get those in the block quote. They'd have to give you a lot more stuff to paste in for that to work  So  It the the environment Twitter has changed since this was first invented. So you

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know in a way a battle over what Twitter is a debate over what Twitter is  Yeah, so your complaint was that Twitter debate of what the web is as well. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, so Twitter was saying okay, we can the bargain we made with Twitter  when they've put this out and  It's still quoted on their website is what happens when all three tweets  The Twitter which is described just it will not despair fully render tweet the tweet no longer exists on Twitter  The fullback block quote 10 tweet information we've is on the page. And that's what that that's what the how to use this thing says  So that's been the sort of the contract if you like  And the reason to use this for a long time and if you are doing a sort of  You're doing a buzzfeed compilation or if you're doing a sort of here's what six people say about this thing  And here's what I think about it and doing those kinds of you know, quote response type posts  Then that that the quotes will still be there for you in your text even if that even if the tweet has gone away  Which is which is I think that's the right compromise. That's the compromise that  It so it makes sense at the point they said it but that's what Ben Ward told

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Ariel Waldman  Eleven years ago when she asked him the embed code is a block quote containing the tweet content  This is from your page if it's deleted or one thousand years in the future  note  The text remains so there is kind of a promise explicit promise

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That one hasn't been fleshed out. It's fresh start for me. Maybe you've got the other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You may have a script blocker that's blocking this. Oh, I do. I have lots of script blockers on yes  Nothing. Nothing works. Well on my site. In fact, I don't see your images or anything  I don't know what you're doing on your page. I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know where you nice internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, if you if you yeah, so on the right hand side of my post I've got I've got the I've got these

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, you might expand the idea. I'll shrink it down to a normal size. You see all these tweets. No images. Yes, nothing  That's a blocker work, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's it's hot linking the Twitter profile images directly in there. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So which is it's a third part. I think my scripts are blocking third party embeds probably something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, well, I know you probably I think putting specific problems  Oh some of them because the stats script is a third party embed too, but I'm maybe I'm directly injecting it  but yeah, so I've got those comments on the side our  Web mentions that I'm embedding in the site  Through some any web things and they are coming from Twitter through Bridget. Let me turn off you block origin and maybe we can

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We can get this page  I thought I thought you were slash dotted. I thought the hacker news had had destroyed your your page. No, it's still not  Yeah, that was you block origin. So Firefox might be doing it. I run a lot of protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, there's lots of there's lots of ways you can block it. I mean, yeah, I can show you my version if you want to know  I believe you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't look that it's like I can build a web page y'all let me show you but that's what's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is what an indie web is all about and all of these protective things that I have going on are because people are doing  nefarious things with stuff that should really be the kind of foundational capabilities of the web to interlink  But I have to protect against it, unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's also an issue we have with web mentions as well  So with web mention when someone links to you and comments on your side  They can send you a mention to say I've done that and we can I can pull that their quote in and put it on my side  But we also have a way for that to deal with deletion too  So if they delete it they could web mention me again and return a 410  Which is HTML for for gone or HTTP for gone  And then then it's up to me to delete it from my site as well or if they edit it that we can show the edition  version so we have that  mechanic in Indie web as well  and the dynamic way for removing the content so  Potentially we may hit a similar issue with people are starting to edit pieces out  But the point of web mention is is more that we're explicitly  They're explicitly pulling in this the response to our thing rather than actually quoting it  So I think there is distinction between I'm quoting something here and therefore I've editorially  Found it and written written down what it says as opposed to I'm dynamically pulling in a response to my my post here

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We are I've reloaded it in chromium and it works just fine  Fire fire Fox I had strict blocking you had to stick things out

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so basically you can see I've got some likes at the top and I've got some responses here and these are  minutes  Is anywhere mentions, but they are mostly poor from Twitter. I think okay, but here's the Hacker News

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, all the bots that I love web mentions. I've been trying to get it to work forever  So yeah, this looks okay now I'm seeing now I'm seeing what's going on what's going on so  Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry, yes, so, you know should see bends and aerials quotes back in fleshed out and yeah in an actual Twitter style

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  This makes a lot more sense now  But I wanted to fail nicely and it did in a way I just didn't have the images and I didn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so you were getting the file back the fallback case that you were meant to get right  Which was the other point of this is it's like if JavaScript fails whatever you still got some useful text there  Yeah, if you're reading it in links or something or a screen reader the text is still there. Yeah  So yeah, so what happened was I wrote about this  Hacker News wrote about it that the verge wrote about it  technique wrote about it and so on and so it's got some circulation some pickup and I think some of the media organizations started asking Twitter about  It and Twitter were like, oh, yeah, that's more complicated than we thought it was  then Mark Mark Jacketh built a tool to  Fix it. So basically some scripts you run that would  Stop Twitter removing them from your page as well. So I embedded that too and then over the weekend  On under I spoke to Tech News Weekly about it on on last Wednesday

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  In fact, thank you for embedding that on your page and I promise we won't delete it  Here's his interview at the bottom with the tech news with Micah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Long isn't it? Yeah  So now raised between whether the column on the right and the column left gets longer where I bet this show  Anyway, the point that but the point is over the weekend. They suddenly stay they said oh no, we changing our mind  We've reverted that they didn't mention it to me. I just noticed that the post appears again  But the verge got them on the record to say yes, we've changed our mind on this and we may do something else in future

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So that's good is it's good. Okay, is this how it's supposed to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's good in that they've gone back to what I think with the right answer is and yeah  I potentially had more influence on Twitter than you know must did this week, which is fun, but  In terms of actually changing how it works  But the other thing it is a thorny problem and they need to think about it a bit more and sort of as a first-pass  Leaving white blobs all over the internet is not really an ideal way of approaching it  So if they want to try something else, I'm very happy to talk to them about it  There's ways you could do this and again, we have the web mention model for for effectively sending edits and deletions around  But this is this is a slightly the embed thing is slightly trickier because you don't actually want to  You don't want to delete the text of other people's web pages, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think that seems a slight is the issue that edit button or I mean it happens even if you delete an account  Are you are you go private? Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean anybody would also add some complex to this as well  Because if you can edit the tweet then which version of my embedding the one that I saw at the time or the one that right?  Appears later

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So it really comes down to this again this question of is Twitter a primary source  That should be preserved historically because people say things or is it just is it water cooler conversation?  and nobody should be held accountable and  And that's kind of Dana Boyd's issue and I think others have talked about this is that it's like a water cooler where stuff gets  Preserved forever. It's kind of the worst of both worlds  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a function of Twitter is that a function of people just not understanding how to use it?  I mean part of this I feel like  Well, I mean I feel like I know exactly when to use Twitter and how and why and what I mean  I never casually approach it and I'm like, you know, let me just say my whatever  so I feel like  It's incumbent upon us to teach people  The rules of a new space if it's a new what is it this town square?  You know, we have to develop the rules that in people understand and agree upon the rules that work in that town square  And I feel like but the challenge is there are different

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But there are well, they've changed over time  This this is that this is part of it because originally the sort of the rules of Twitter were very different initially  because  They didn't have they didn't notify about replies. They didn't put replies under the posts  There was a whole sort of range of things that have changed over time and also that they didn't preserve much of a history  You couldn't scroll back very far on Twitter. He would just time add and fail on you. So the notion of it is  persistent is something that has  That was built up later  Okay, and then the nurse is the place you go and shout at people is also a thing that built up over time as well  It's it's so it's both  It's the void you scream into and sometimes screams back and if you're the president United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You get the benefit of both  It is a thorny thing and I think it's part of the problem. I don't know. Can this be solved?  Is this just a sociological problem and ultimately can be solved? It's not a technical issue. It's a sociological issue, right? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Indeed and when it's a sort of community management issue and collective action issue as well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So are you happy that they reverted should they stay the way they were?  What's nice is your blog post now works where you know you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, but that's but that's the thing I know I think that what they've what they've done is is better than what they did  But there's potentially they could do something more subtle

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But we want Twitter to be what do we want Twitter to be  Stacey what should Twitter be should it should it be the water cooler? Should it be the the Journal of Records? What should it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's I think it is kind of the town square  So maybe it's the water cooler, but it's the water cooler work  So you need to be aware that people who overhear you are not going to be your best friends. Does that make sense? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But there's also the an additional  Issue which is that everybody's Twitter is different depending on who they follow and for some people  You know you always bring up Jeff black put black Twitter Twitter is a cultural phenomenon of its very own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's completely independent of other Twitter's right and I so I think Stacey's right that we this is about a norm  We've got it. We got a set of expectation and and and follow  I think that if you had a Facebook post and you couldn't delete it people would go back s right  Yeah, but of course Twitter's architecture is different and it's out there in the world and people do delete their tweets regularly  There's services to do so they get rid of all their tweets for the last year some fools like I don't know the  Host of a famous podcast just puts Twitter every once in a while  And and I think you need to have I have come right to do that. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  to a  Detente with Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But as Stacey said if somebody overhears that  Then it's out of your control  So if I whether it's by a screen grab or me  Quoting or and retyping or whatever if I hear it that knowledge is now mine  You can't kill that out of my brain or what I say  You can kill the substantiation of it on Twitter and I think you should have a right to do that  If you should have a right to kill your blog or right to kill anything else you've done  But if I've heard it and either by retyping it my blog or by having a service  Hello, Donald Trump that pulls all the tweets you've done so you can't kill them from public record  That's that's hey, you said it in public. That was the brakes  so I think there's a combination of both where you have to be  Taught to be aware that once you've said it you've said it people have heard it  You shouldn't put anything on the internet. You don't want to be in the in stone forever  That's the deal  Your substantiation of yourself on Twitter you should have some control  Yeah, this gets more complicated though when we get to the edit button  because  If I also think that I can change a tweet that's now out in 25 different places

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You can gaslight me you could say you didn't read that tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I this is what I said or on the other side of it. I think as an author of the tweet that I'm  I'm  Updating and correcting the tweet and I am doing so on twitter.com  But not everywhere, but maybe I'm not on your client or somebody or in your mind in your in your mind

Love having you on the show whenever you can sitting in for  and Pruitt Kevin is a  As you've probably gathered by now strong proponent of the open web  And Indie web org is a great place to read more about that and I'm always trying to  To live the Indie web life  And his blog is Kevin marks calm our show today brought to you by new rava  You know, we're coming back to work. We're in this new hybrid work situation where some people are in the office  Some people are at home. We still have to have meetings. That means that huddle room that conference room suddenly is a mess  Is a mess because you you want people at home to not feel disenfranchised  You want them to be able to hear the conversation? We want to be able to hear them  Do you bring in some fancy AV company to put in cameras and big screens?  you know big Cisco systems and spend thousands of dollars and have wires and microphones and and it's you know in  flexible mess that has to be  configured and  Calibrated constantly no  No, you don't need that traditional system  Because we've got a better way great audio simplified with noreva and you are  Evie a they have a patent on something they call microphone mist technology with this patented technology  All it takes is one or two  Integrated microphone and speaker bars. It looked like sound bars  If you go to the website, they look exactly like sound bars on a on a wall  They can fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones. No, no dead zones  Everyone everywhere in the room can be heard clearly  meeting participants  Class members can talk can move naturally in the space can face any way they want  Can socially distance if they need and still be heard by remote participants and vice versa. It's remarkable  And not only is it much less expensive than those traditional systems. It's much easier to use  Continuous auto calibration means your rooms are always  Instantly ready with optimized audio. You don't need to bring in a technician to calibrate. In fact your it department gets a console  That makes it very easy for them to monitor manage and adjust  Your rooms no matter how many you have  From anywhere no need to go to from room to room and the installation  Well, if you've ever put up a sound bar, it's literally that easy a 30 minute diy job  That's incredible big savings on time cost compared to traditional systems  But you are going to love it  And if you're still using that spider that sits in the middle of the conference room table, please stop just  Stop the suffering stop the insanity go to nareva.com  N u r e v a  Nareva.com ask yourself  Do you want to go with a costly complicated traditional system or make the leap to simple and economical nareva learn more at nareva?

Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're muted

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did we mute him? Did he mute him? No, I muted myself because I was pouring water he muted. Um  I it's just plain html. I mean that wait what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You edit it in a notepad  uh  I did I did visual studio code now, but yeah, you're kidding. You edit in vs code. It's not even marked down. It's just  Hey, why would he use markdown?  Wow, it's html. Wow. So if I've used source, it's going to look exactly like it looks to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yep, that's that's marvelous. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, I've got it. It's served through heroku static pages because I always think oh I'll do something dynamic  Whatever do so. Yeah, it's just a bunch of handwritten html. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's old school, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then I've got it  So it's in it's in github. I check it into github and that redeploys it so that I can edit it locally and then hit

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Sinking. Um, I use a static site generator called hugo  But uh, so i'm writing i've yeah, no, I like hugo is good. I like that because it's static and then it's just it is  It's generating the html for me, but it's static  And I actually do I check it into github. So github can serve it too

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so that I mean I'm I keep meaning oh I should go I should convert this to hugo rather than  keep editing it by hand because then i'd get like tag pages and things but  Um, I can never quite get around to it and for your web mentions. Do you use bridgie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What do you use for your web mentions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What are you so web mentions is web mention.herokuapp.com which is written by voxpelli  Um, and it's a it's an app that I link in  And I set that as my web mention target and then it injects that right sidebar

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And of course, this is really sweet. So instead of a comments if people mention you on  Hacker news or on twitter  Uh looks like some other places as well. They'll go right here some direct sites. They turn up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So some of these are sort of actual pure web mentions most of them come from twitter which comes through bridgie. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that used to pop up in the comments of your sites, right? I mean, I like it as a sidebar here  It's kind of cool. I like it as a sidebar too. I just was like that's something that we used to rely on a lot  Yeah, no you can you can use it so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, there's I mean there's there's there's ways to do it. But what we what the web mention model is  Um, if I write a post to my site and link to you  I then send a web mention to you to say i've linked to you and it can appear there  um  And what we've done with um, bridgie bridgie will check twitter for links to that url  When it finds one it'll add it to the page as well. So that's that's that's a trick  So you can see that they've all got  K-v-mode's call and twitter edits you in there or so on. Yeah, it's actually a bit more subtle because if I  If people reply to a tweet when i've posted the links to it, it'll come back there as well. So you get  I recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  switched to uh  Using mastodon as my comment  System, so it's similar to that except instead of using twitter it uses, uh, the you know, that works

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And twitter is  Mastodon is marked up with microformats too, right?  So if you you can if you send a web mention from the mastodon post it will show up properly in here  But it doesn't send them by default  So yeah, you'd have to call the api to put them in. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  it's uh, yeah, i'm just i'm  I'm such a strong believer in the free and open web. I just feel like  Whatever we can do to kind of preserve that  Uh is is great  Um  so  Let's catch you up

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  On the saga of a little old elon musk

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There should be a ballad the ballad of elon musk  Sit right back. Will it tell you a tale the tale of a billionaire who wanted to own twitter?  So he as you know, if you've been paying attention  Over the first three months of 2022 has been slowly they say paying cash  Which sounds like he's actually like  Licking his thumb and spitting out bills for shares of twitter got himself all the way up to nine point two  percent  Delayed mentioning that by the way now he's being sued  Because the sec requires when you get to five, I think five percent five percent. You have to you have to report  He got to five percent by march  14th  But didn't file till april 4th  And so there's a an investor lawsuit saying and I think the sec should probably also do something. I think they're investigating  Saying hey you essentially kept the price artificially low by not telling everybody you were buying up twitter  Of course as soon as he filed on april 4th

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter stock price went up 27 percent right which proved the point prove the point better evidence better receipts than that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, so anyway, uh, he is now a nine point two percent shareholder  Which at that point gave him I guess enough stock that twitter said well, we better ought to listen to this guy  Even though he's kind of obviously a troll  Offered him a board seat  Now this is where it gets interesting  And invited him to speak to the staff for an ama  The ama has been cancelled  And so has elon's board seat  But we're not clear on what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly why I didn't want him on the board in the first place  He's just a troll who runs around doing his own thing and with rules get in the way he  backs off and

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is exactly what we thought would happen. So I mean there I mean, I think it could be  I don't know. Do you think agro agro wall said?  No, never mind. Do you think elon said no, never mind or did some lawyers what I hear, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what what do you hear? I hear his lawyers said, uh, you know  You can't do these things. You have a fiduciary responsibility, right?  And you can't go around telling the public what's going to happen with the company without knowing it or before it's known

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He did delete a bunch of tweets over the weekend that were offensive stupid childish  That's nothing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think he realized someone probably set him aside and said look  You can do all this when it's your own companies when you come in and do this to other companies  This is a problem and then I think also twitter's lawyers probably were like, you know, really  Is this really what we want? And I think probably everybody woke up next to each other and was like, oh  Yeah, no, this isn't right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He was putting up polls  It's kind of facetious polls at one point. He said should twitter delete the w and twitter for its name  Which is just perfect for his like a nine-year-old joke  Yeah, i'm for a joke by a fourth grader  It turns out according to the timeline from the washington post that on saturday morning  He told twitter he would not be joining the board  Now there's another thought I had because remember when we said  Maybe one of the reasons I think you stacy said keep your friends close keep your enemies closer  One of the reasons twitter offered him a board seat is because board members are not allowed to own more than 15 percent bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but also that then they have fiducius duty so he would have to  Shut up  Yeah  No, because because you're given non-material information and therefore if you say it publicly you are violent

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's never stopped him in the past and the sec has barely slapped his wrists for these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, i'm not. Yeah. No, but that's you know, the  When does that stop them is my question  Well, because because he has beneficial ownership of his own company so he's not going to sue himself whereas twitter could sue him for doing yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So so the lawyer said elon you're gonna have to uh muzzle yourself. He said i'm not doing that  Uh, also elon you can't buy any more shares past 15 percent  I still think elon. I mean, it's not he's got the money if he wanted to buy twitter, you know, just do a  Hostile takeover he could buy a 51 percent stake. I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where he and his friends could yeah. Yeah, I was like he doesn't have to buy the whole 50 or two could buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  another

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  15 percent what would be the first thing we would do is invite president trump former president trump back  Probably you think yeah, I think that's what the I suspect that's why the  Staff is is nervous. Well, explain the stock market

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  response to me because because all right, so when he  Buys that much the stock goes up because oh it could be in play or whatever, right?  He leaves the stock went down, but then it went back up again. The market is confused about what to do with elon, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The market's confused was be probably sufficient in that sense. Yeah  Yeah  I don't know what the market what the market's thinking. Uh, there's certainly some people in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Bought shares when elon was a massive  Shareholder just because why do you buy shares if you you know  If you're speculator because you think they're going to continue to go up  So buy some shares there's going to be a move to buy more shares

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry about that. What is it now with 39 to 50 on april 5 and right now it's at 45 85 45 85

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So it did go back down a little bit  Yeah, that's not uncommon though. Yeah. Yeah, you buy what is it?  Buying the rumor selling the news  I don't know what the news or the rumor was it's still way above its april 1st price of 39 31 before the elon announcement  So it's still up a significant amount  Up 38 percent in the past month  That's that's still some good money  So I would say overall the stock is is bullish on twitter. The stock market is bullish on twitter with elon's involvement

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're just bullish on the fact that  There's chum in the water  like I I feel like I feel like being a stock market investor now is based solely on like  Stonk behavior, I guess I I just don't even know anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, I think you're right, but I mean so traditionally the  Vast amount of stock movements come from institutional investors  pension funds things like that people who presumably you know are are  Solid and uh steady and uh and informed investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I even with even though robinhood and public.com and all these I was gonna I was just gonna wonder if it becomes a robinhood stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think that do they move the market enough to really make a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon behaves that way and can move the market. So that's what it feels like to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I feel what we know is tweets. I mean basically are pump and dump sometimes when he says, you know, I'm going we're taking  Tesla private four twenty dollars a share financing secured  Then it turns out that was a lie stock market loves it buys it up  There's a lot of nihilism makes you like running around the richest he is now the richest man on the planet except for Putin  Yeah, so maybe it's just to be hundreds of millions stock is going down  At one point he was because of his you know, basically  Secret ownership of Gazprom and all of the other  Russian enterprises he was thought to be by far the richest man in the world  well, anyway, uh  Elon's 300 billion nearly 300 billion fortune puts him pretty much at the top of the list  Um, so it worked  Whatever whatever he's up to is working  And by the way, the gas price is going through the roof helps tesla their sales are through the roof  They're they can't make them fast enough now

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's behind the war isn't it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, that's up even more. I think I saw 26 increase in orders  over the last few weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, well that makes sense. I mean i'd want an electric car now too plus there's I mean everybody's  Honda just did their announcement to not produce gas powered cars. I mean sure it's by 2040 tons of choices  Yeah, yeah, we're we're basically hitting the the inflection point for electric vehicles in tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're gonna buy a new electric car right now, which would you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really don't know. I like i'm i'm waiting for things i'd look at the outie maybe but it's pretty expensive  And I really want a subaru. I want the electric subaru that doesn't exist yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the toyota subaru one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There there isn't one subaru is not making well, there's going to be car yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With yes, but yes the toyota stupid name car is going to be a subaru too. Wait a minute. What now i'm confused  That's two different companies. Yeah toyota. I know that but the toyota. Yes the toyota  B4z1568 whatever their stupid brand is for it  Is a super  B4z is also going to be a super

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Not a supra a subaru a subaru  Uh, oh, yeah, you're right. The brz is a toyota it happens. I can't be right. What happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, it was okay. Well, there you go. There you go  Um, the bz4x what a brand  Yeah, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  A little tear out toyota owns 20 percent of subaru  It also is five percent mazda so tesla I was wrong I I underestimated tesla  It's estimated has seen a hundred percent increase in orders in some areas of the u.s. As gas prices  sore  So that's how lived. Yeah, whatever elon's doing. He's doing doing it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But there's still a huge waiting the market wait for those isn't it? Yeah. Oh, yeah, the weight's getting longer and longer and longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, that's all right, you know  They're taking the orders  Uh, okay. So elon now is back to being a private citizen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a great is he gonna buy twitter. Is he gonna do what you think or is he gonna get no

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He's bored already. He's already bored  I guarantee you  We should check his tweets  Yeah  Yeah, yeah the latest twitter lives and dies though by these guys right when trump was big  Twitter on twitter that made twitter's for four years twitter was the place to go to find out what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I go I go back to my black twitter example. It's it's the longest of long tales  Uh, the most popular person on twitter is a tiny proportion. Oh, this is interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Elon has not tweeted in four days. Is he dead? Is he okay?  Ha ha ha  His last tweet was april 9th right before the news came out that he wasn't going to be on the board saturday  um  very  Interesting. He hasn't tweeted at all since then  not to talk about  Dogecoin not to talk about space x not to talk about tesla  How often does he tweet normally like a hundred times a day?  You want to see all the tweets from the last day he tweeted. This is april 9th  Okay, ready april 9th april 9th april 9th 9th 9th april 9th april 9th april 9th april 9th  Okay, yeah, but when he's not on a weird pump and dump scene. Oh april 8th  april 8th 8th 7  7 I guess somehow he's tweeting in two different time zones. This is my this is my favorite one  This was the one I bet i'm gonna guess got him boot bounced from the board  We talked about this on sunday twitter's next board meeting is gonna be lit. He tweets with a picture of him  smoking a blunt on joe rogan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I have to say is it's so frustrating to see people act like this when I know  That as a woman if I wandered around acting like this, no one would take me

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Remotely seriously or they give you a reality show called

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they wouldn't they it just drives me what's what's the kardashian's reality show  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They've got a new one, yeah, I know they they retired and now they're back  Uh  But they don't higgins bottoms I think would be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't treat you the kardashians are still a running joke in the culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Whereas elon musk can get there may be a running joke in the culture, but they're rich running jokes  Keeping up with the higgins bottoms

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not something necessary at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  All right, let's move on to more serious matters the war in ukraine rages on  Uh apparently thanks to e-cit a security company  Uh one of our sponsors and microsoft  Uh, I think they do something in the technology sphere  Uh the ukrainian power grid  Which was going to be taken down any minute now was withstood a russian cyber  attack using  They believe it's sandworm a russian military group  Using kind of an old school  Malware  Uh, but microsoft and e-set discovered it the electrical outages were going to be friday evening  But having discovered it, uh, they were able to pull down I guess the botnets  And to avert the blackout that would have taken power out for two million people in ukraine  So this this cyber yeah, yay good guys good guys win

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Researchers at cyber security companies e-set and microsoft identified and neutralized  The malicious software used in the attack

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it but it was it was a new software just done by an established agency, correct? No in destroyer

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Which was a malware used in 2016 to do the same thing knock  Substations off in keve  For about an hour remember that  And we thought this is a little probe a little test of uh of their capabilities. So that was the mama  That uh created the variant that they were going to use this time  dubbed in destroyer 2  Oh, okay the conjuring  uh sandworm is a uh  Part of the gru the russian military intelligence agency. It's also accused of causing blackouts  um  In uh, I think 2020 or 2021 in ukraine  so  And here is the wanted poster  Gru hackers destructive malware and international cyber attacks conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states false registration of a domain name  Oh, man, that's got to have a penalty  uh  Conspiracy to commit wire fraud wire fraud intentional damage to protected computers and aggravated identity theft  So these guys better not go into us post office anytime soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I think they're safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Um, so there's also this is interesting a um  There's also a malware called caddy wiper  Being spread around ukraine designed to delete data on infected computer systems  This wiper was also used to disrupt the u.s  Satellite communications provider via sat on the day of the invasion. You may remember  Anyway, so so even though there haven't been any catastrophic cyber attacks  It's a it's going on right now back and forth back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that makes sense. I mean you wouldn't expect  I mean they're losing the  War on land or they're struggling. I I wouldn't say losing

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to say anything about it, uh, except that it's  horrific

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, hey let's talk about like tech that isn't going to make us tick tock

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Tick tock that doesn't make you sad. Well, wait a minute tick tock. Oops  Here's the problem  This is so we've been talking a little bit about sanctions and how they're not necessarily in some cases  It's to make the company look good rather than to further ukraine's  uh  welfare  tick tock  Kind of banned  Uh in a way banned russia suspended new video uploads and live streams  from russia  Um  And walled off this is the thing they did they walled off russian users for seeing posts from outside the country including ukraine  And according to the post effectively creating a second censored version of its platform  But as a result  Uh  Because the block on russian content has not been effective a lot of what's on tick-tack in russia now is pro-government propaganda  They're not seeing the story  Of what's going on outside of russia?  So this is a this is an example of sanctions gone wrong, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean these are blunt tools and so it makes sense that  We're gonna have to figure I mean in a sense you'll see actually there's another story. I think on algo speak  People have to get creative people will get creative. But I mean when you're trying to love this story you want to talk about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm just yeah, it's just  This is taylor laurence doing great stuff. This is she's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Freed from the new york times. She's doing great work. Yeah, she's now at the post

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh, I was looking forward to doing this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So if you use tick-tock, you know that the tick-tock algorithm looks at things you're saying and so  In order to get around the tick-tock algorithm and talk about what you want to talk about  uh tick-tock creators have started to use  um  But she calls it algo speak but euphemisms for instance instead of a vibrator you might have a spicy eggplant  Uh instead of saying dead you might say unalive  Uh, she's got a whole a whole series of stuff when tick-tock started started banning  Covid-19 misinformation people started referring to covid-19 as the backstreet boys reunion tour  Or calling it panini  Or the panda express  When young people began to discuss struggling with mental health they talked about becoming unalive  Sex workers call themselves accountants  And instead of using the word favorite  Instead of using the word porn they use the word corn or the more better yet the corn emoji  So if you see an accountant who's into corn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It ain't what you think it is  We've all become chinese, right? This is this is all the tricks that the chinese had  That's why winning the pooh years and years

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's why winning the pooh  That's why they ban winning the pooh. Yeah, they caught up. That's the problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But this is you know, this is this is you know, dana boyd again was explaining how um teens have been doing this  Social networks for decades. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, it's very much like you you you use an idiolect that other people don't understand to talk about what you want to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  P. O s I remember when you were when we my kids were doing icq they'd write pos  And I didn't know what it meant. It's for parents over shoulder  And it was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who is also a pos? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Any vaccine groups on facebook do this too. They change their names to dance party or dinner party  uh  Vaccinated people were referred to as swimmers

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I just it's a great story just because I love I so for instance instead of uh saying lgbtq

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They use they say they're members of the leg booty community because  apparently  Uh, that's what the voice synthesizer turns lbgtq into his leg

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hilarious. I didn't realize that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Instead of nipples can't say nipples obviously nipknops  Um  If you're going to talk about crackers, you can't say crackers because the algorithm thinks you're talking about  S- white southerners crackers. So you have to say saltines, which is really ironic if you ask me  Twitch considers the word cracker a slur. It is a slur actually  Uh, wow, thank you a taylor lorenz for  Oh, yeah, this is that's also here's another one the tic tacs text to speech  uh  You can't say lesbian  So what they write is le dollar sign b ian, which the text of speech pronounces le dollar bean  So they just started writing le dollar bean  But you're right. This has been going on. It's probably going on since uh, you know, the surf saw that the lord coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Said pol. Oh, yeah. Well, it's kind of fun because i'd be very curious to see how quickly  It spreads with social media, right? So like that's true  How long what's the longevity of your much faster slang or your what did you call it?  Idiodiolect  So yeah, that would be a fun thing to research and is it different on different platforms?  Where older people are, you know versus where younger people are. I just don't know but it's super fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He read gretchen mccollox book on this  No, that's really good. Um, i'll control it

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think it's i think yeah, I think it's on my list from uh from uh, jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like jeff. Do you read all the books on your bookshelf back there or I listen to because because internet is called

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because internet what a great name for a book understand the new rules of language  Yeah  And it's really good because she basically she's a she's a linguist  And she goes through and talks about all these different linguistic constructions that turn up on different groups and subgroups loves that and also things like  different ways people use punctuation depending on  Um, oh, yeah, sorry. Oh my kids mocked me for using punctuation on my text messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my daughter thinks we're all yelling at her  Full stop period like if I put a period she's like they're yelling it and I was like no no people our age  We end senses with periods the right way to write and she's like no, it's so harsh

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So we used to think it was typing in caps right now. It's not typing caps is simply using punctuation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, don't use punctuation. That's the moral. Come on. So i've got a question for you all  Yeah, so at a journalism school, right we we taught  Proper grammar and the ap style book and all that and if we take what I say about serving communities where they are  Um  We I think need to accept and value many different  Linguistic styles even in a journalism school, of course. Yeah. Well, I think that's fine. It's controversial though in some quarters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I think it also depends on your your platform. So like in the new york times or in a print  paper  I feel like there's probably you know, like use eighth grade level english when you're writing for  You know your local daily, right?  Whereas you may do something a little more highfalutin for a magazine and maybe for the tik tok account  You're using different language and emojis and I don't think that's weird. It's unreaded a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There are a lot of non-english speakers. So I often, you know cut some slack to people but there's a lot  You see this a lot. I seen  I seen the waymo or I see a cruise car be pulled over by the pd. I seen it  And at first i'm going well, that's just you know ignorant and ungrammatical and now i'm realizing no  I have to be less judgmental. That's just that's language evolves, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was editing a chapter of the guttenberg book yesterday and I came across this section that I actually wrote  I didn't forget I'd written it  It occurred to me that that when montane wrote his essays  He raised the bar  On being able to join in the conversation because you had to be a writer. Yes, ever since then  We've all how many people do we know who are scared of writing whether it's a memo. It's kevin mark's fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I can't keep up with his public school  poncy education  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you would you adopt different, you know, you adopt different idyllic experience you're talking to you you you have  It's code switching as well. But it's also  You you I would speak differently to you guys about stuff because we've got a bunch of shared vocabulary and context and I would speak to  You know my son's about it or yes or someone i'm meeting the street because yeah  It's just a question of what's shared and what can be done  But the the the gretchen is what is interesting because she says a lot of it does show up in weird thing  He does show up in with things like punctuation. She says you can tell old old people because they always put um ellipses in their texts  For some reason I love ellipses

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're old  Yeah  And the m dash i'm just looking at my text my text from my kid  And they are definitely very different than my text. I have to look at my text for my kids now

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  See my daughter who's 30 is probably more older than  Old now, right? She doesn't she doesn't count  Oh, yeah, no capitalization. No periods. No, no, there's no punctuation. It's just a lot of exclamation marks  exclamation marks, yeah tons of tons of yeah  Uh, what are those called with my son?  He capitalizes the first letter of the sentence probably because apple does it for him exactly  Yeah, and that's the last time it's capitalized wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And lots of in ironically mine doesn't maybe it's because she's on an android phone, but she doesn't use a lot of emojis  She just uses um

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, no, my henry uses no emojis  And and abby does use emojis quite a bit so that's just maybe what is it called when you use the letters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it leap? No, not leap speed emoticons emoticons emoticons. There we go. You're old forget ellipses emoticons  Shruggy guy, huh? Yep. Yeah. No, they're not that complicated  They're like the little but she does she does the little hearts and the I think it's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I love language. I love i'm gonna i've just added the maculloch book to my um

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  my audible no, I recommend everyone to read that book because it also it helps a lot when you're  You're reading other people's texts. You're like, oh right. Yeah, they're writing in this style. Okay, I get very judgmental

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm not sure I can write in those styles, but at least I can read them  Yeah, and I just I have to train myself but kevin mcwarder has been great on that too, which you introduced me to uh, jeff  Uh, he's really been good on on showing me that you know, he's linguist as well  It's just you know, it's it's that's how language evolves. It's normal. This is where pardon me gutenberg moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is where print came in is that is that I think it's a berto echo who said that uh, a a  Dialect is a language without an army. Oh, I love it  And and so when print came in a whole bunch of dial I mean when luther chose to publish in german  That was a momentous decision the vernacular because he was then speaking to a public number one and number two  He started standardizing german and so a national identity  Long before the nation was created a national identity of germans  Was created from that moment and so so the technology had a huge impact  So now we come around and and and now you don't have to be montane. You don't have to be  Um literate in the sense of your grandparents  You can change the language and in fact use things that aren't in our view language  You can use emoji and you can use memes and other non-verbal non-textual things and I find that very exciting  But it scares the hell out of people who define literacy  Around the text that they the rules they knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a form of ignorance  And you know when my kids are growing up they would always say  Me and my friends did something right and I would always say no. No, it's your friends and I  It just bugged me or between I really hate when people say but between  You and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just drives me nuts. Oh that versus which drives me crazy. Yeah, have you been a copier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's all kinds of things but that's just terrible. That's just we're just that's just terrible. We're terrible people  intolerant intolerant  You have just posted in in our irc  Mr kevin marx robbish's piece the mystery of  A  Unicode character of unknown purpose, which it looks like a a line graph gone wrong  Is what it looks like to me where the arrow is off the axis is pointing left and down

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  A lightning bolt on the on the on the right axis. Yes. Yeah right angle with downward zigzag arrow is the unicode

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  description of it  Did they ever figure out what the what the  Jonathan chan set out to uncover its mysterious purpose  Here's jonathan chan's blog it's a unicode 23237c

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's the opposite of the the gartner

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Upper right cordon. Yeah. Yeah, it's not a gartner quadrant. It's anywhere but the gartner quadrant. It's where things are go wrong. Yeah. Yeah  Uh, I like those tessie. Wow. This is a fascinating. Did you read the chan article kevin? I don't yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I read I think I read that the original article. Well, I read I saw it through twitter and it's like where did where did  What is this similar where it come from and it's been copied from like list of symbols and list of symbols

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Nobody knows actually what it's for it comes from. Uh, it's inherited  from the association for font information interchange afii  Which has was long dissolved in favor of unicode over their glyph registry  um  Anybody at the time could register a glyph with the afii for a fee of five to fifty dollars  Oh, I missed the opportunity  And then when unicode came along they just they just absorbed them even though there was no it was somebody paid five bucks to put it in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, unicode had a initially unicode was like, okay  We've got lots of space now. We're just going to agree everything  um and then  It's it's got a bit more um organized now and you have to make a case for things because there are symbols

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was the intero bang a late addition to unicode or was it something that came along in that in that clump?  I'd have to have a look. I mean there's there's you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you can go back and look at the history, but I mean there are symbols that look a bit like that for angles and things but  um  Yeah, but that one was apparently added at the beginning of the article  Apparently added at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Even though no one ever used it for anything. I'm gonna start putting it in all my text messages of my kids see what they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  but there's also there's it looks there's a there's a sigil um a  A magical symbol that looks a bit like it with a linking sigil  Which has been um  As that is is this where it came from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Did someone put this in as a it could be a magical you say sigil I say sigil you say jiff  I say gif. I don't know which is right. But uh, yeah  Yeah sigils are there are lots of mathematical symbols that are very strange. Yeah. Yeah  You know, it could well be some you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Some satanists put it in there a long time ago  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you know? Yes that from the second century to the seventh century  All scribal text had no spaces  So there's a mistake scriptura continue on  Yeah  And it makes no sense until somebody it's one of the books I read said the guy who wrote a whole book about the space  Uh said that you know, if you're a child you don't put spaces in it's just a continuous sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's why um my like my daughters when she was in  Kindergarten, they actually taught them first to write in cursive  And they would just her writing was in cursive and it was just all never ending, right? Yeah  Yeah  Fascinating let's take a little break now. She's like the only what is it 15 year old who knows cursive good for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for her communicate with y'all. How's her handwriting stacey is typing ruined that or is it held up decently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she she has I mean her cursive writing is atrocious, but I mean she learned it when she was five  But her print is fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Okay. Hey, at least she learned it. That's all that matters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She can read mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Our uh, let's take a little break. I want to talk to you. Let me show you i'm so proud of this  Lisa, you know every morning she says what's your sleep score and I have to say oh 60 50  40 let me show you my sleep score  Today that's a you see that 90 cheating. No, that's the real deal 93  And uh, I owe it all to see the name up there my eight sleep  Magical eight sleep mattress cover the pod  Pro I first learned about eight sleep from uh, kevin rose who said have you tried this? I said, I know what is it?  He said well, so what we had for a long time. We had a mattress  Electric mattress pad that would heat the bed up, but that's it was one direction was heat the bed up  He said no, no, no, this doesn't heat the bed up it alone. It cools it down  It can range from in the 50s to in I think the hundreds  So it has this huge range  And it turns out this is  Evolutionarily what our bodies want so imagine if you will  Way back when you're sleeping in a log hut or something  You go to bed put the fire out. It's warm. You get in bed  Maybe you use one of those I used to have one of those colonial bed warmers  You put the coals in a bronze pan on a stick you you rub it around and you're you get in there nice and toasty cozy  But over the night it gets cooler and cooler and cooler your sleep gets deeper and deeper and deeper  And then in the morning you wake up. Well, that's exactly what my eight sleep does. Actually. It has a modern advantage  It starts warm. It's toasty cools off through the night  So I sleep deeper and then I've set it to wake me up at 8 a.m  It gets warm and warms me up and I get it's nice and toasty. I jump out of bed. It is incredible  Good sleep is the ultimate game changer. It's nature's magic  It's the ultimate game changer. It's nature's best medicine  Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues  Decrease the risk of heart disease lower your blood pressure  There's even studies that says it reduces the risk of alzheimer's and yet so many of us struggle with sleeping  Well, especially as we get older  More than 30 percent of americans struggle with sleep temperature one of the main causes of poor sleep  Well, I could tell you i've got the proof right here  From from the low 60s to the upper 90s  I am falling asleep in record time. I love getting in bed. It's cozy  Faster than I ever have before all thanks to my eight sleep  Pod pro cover after kevin told me he  It was a show with amy webb was on she got it. She said she keeps saying get the pod pro  So I finally got this we got this some months ago  Uh, it there's you can get a mattress from eight sleep, but I think that for most of you who have a mattress you love I do  Uh, the pod pro covers a great solution. It just goes on it pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking  So let me i'll show you this screen again because this is this is kind of cool  Uh, it's got autopilot on here and the caliber it says calibration complete. It's actually monitoring  It's monitoring my sleep and it's changing the temperature based on what it observes. So if i'm  Restless it turns the temperature down. So the autopilot is on  And it's automatically calibrating  Let's see what my sleep was yesterday. Let's see if we can go back in time  My sleep fitness score  Uh, let's see 93 was that yesterday?  Let's get the graphs  Day before 98 look at that day before that 100  So  I have to say I have never felt better you can go as cool as 55 degrees as hot as 110 degrees you get two  Temperatures, so we're you know, lisa and I are sleeping in a king bed  She she likes it a lot hotter than I did last night. She said i'm turning it all the way up. I'm at 10  So really it's gonna be kind of warm. She loves it. She loves it. It kind of soothes her muscle aches and stuff  Uh, I don't like to start so hot. Um, and and but I have to say  As it cools down my sleep gets deep  The temperature of the cover just east side of the bed based on your sleep stages on it does biometrics  It also checks the bedroom temperature and it reacts intelligently to create the optimal sleeping environment  Eight and by the way, I I really think so right now it's still cool out but it's starting to get warm  This will be the thing to have in the hot summer those hot summer nights where you sleep sticky. It's awful  Imagine it's basically air conditioning for your bed  I'm going to be sleeping in a bed  Eight sleep users on average fall asleep 32% faster  And reduce sleep interruptions by 40% and overall get a more restful sleep. I've never had 100 sleep score. That's amazing  With 30 more deep sleep  I know i'm feeling better my body and mind are moving through all the sleep stages the REM the deep sleep  Sleep  I love my eight sleep  And you're going to love it too. Go to eight sleep dot com spell it out. EIGHT eight sleep dot com slash twig  Check out the pod pro  cover  You'll save 150 at checkout  Eight sleep currently ships within the u.s. Canada and good news kevin the uk eight sleep  dot com slash  twig  Uh, I admit I was a little skeptical. You remember when I put it on I told the story of putting it on backwards  Do watch the video

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They tell you how to put it on  I just i'm one of those, you know, I just I guess I can do this  I don't need to watch the video. I could clearly see how this works and then was wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Uh, so watch the video you put it on it doesn't take it takes me maybe an hour to get it all set up  You it uses water actually what runs water through it's not a water bed, but it but that conducts better  So it uses water and it's just incredible  eight sleep dot com slash twig  Honestly, there's you don't have to wear any sensors cj's asking. How does it get the biometrics? It's in the mattress  It's got centers set or in the cover. It's got sensors in the cover. So you're right on it  So it knows your heart rate  It is it knows when you're moving and tossing and turning it knows when you get up that kind of thing  and it adjusts and i'm not sure that there's they describe it i'm sure on the app, but  Uh, it somehow it adjusts and it's great  It's great love it what does 100 sleep even mean I don't know but I just know i've ever gotten there in my life  It's the first time ever  Uh, I didn't actually when I went back I had not looked at this so I did not know so i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, your heart rate looks really low. Yeah, you must be very healthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, that's  It's incredible. I I i'm a i'm a you noticed that did you you noticed I did yeah  Seven hours 43 minutes asleep  Uh wake up consistency was was a little low i'm working on it 99 time to fall asleep 14 minutes  Times to get up five minutes  It's uh, it's this thing works. That's all I could say  the statistics prove it  All right, uh on we go. Yeah, you're in a better mood these days. Have you noticed i'm not  Maybe it's because i'm not sitting on the saddle with a stick that that has a point. Yeah, that's  Yeah, kevin. I got this seat that's supposed to make you like but it's really just like a bicycle seat on a stick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so it's it's extremely uncomfortable. It was the shortest show we ever did ever it was like an hour and a half

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, that's the opposite of an eight sleep for your butt. That's the complete opposite  Complete opposite don't don't I don't recommend it  Peggy noonan is still around amazing  Was she a speechwriter for reagan nixon nixon? Oh  Nixon jesus nixon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, wow, here's a story a mother of a large virginia family who raised her kids closely and with limited use of social media  The mother took her children to shop for food  The woman at the checkout counter who had been observing the family asked the mother  Do you homeschool your kids?  The mother mother wasn't sure of the spirit of the question but said why yes, I do  Why do you ask the checkout woman said because they have children's eyes  Not the thousand yard stare of the young always scrolling on their phones that's peggy newton's proof  Proof people should not be on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I actually think so again. I'm just going to go from limited sample of my child and her friends  she's been  Aware of the internet, but she's also we do I think we do an okay job talking about  We've done a good job talking about what it means to post online and we also did a really good job of not posting  Stuff of her online as well. So and we talked about all of that and I feel like she's actually pretty  She doesn't spend a lot of time on social media and she seems pretty sane. I was really worried about uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  henry and video gaming  But at the same time I wasn't going to stop him because his peers did and he was going to do when he went over there  And I thought this is the culture he's growing up in so i'm gonna let him do it  He doesn't do it anymore and he didn't do it to excess now some kids will of course  but but  I didn't make it a big deal that he couldn't do it. I didn't say limit your hours  And he naturally regulated  Uh, of course, he's a tiktok star now. So his attention span is about this long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he can make a living out of it maybe that maybe that's not the best example

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got to edit those videos down. Yeah, some of those tiktoks have some tremendous 30 second tiktok might take him eight hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Absolutely to cook and to cut and all that stuff content creation is not for the weak good lord  Uh, here is peggy newton's understanding of how the internet works by the way case you're  Okay, I don't know. How old how old is she jeff? She wrote for rick I think I talked about  She well, she must have been very young when she wrote for rick. She was  She was always 71 70. Well, she's not that old. She's only five years older than me, but she sounds like this for some reason  so  So i'm gonna have to really be careful about my ageism i'm suddenly realizing this isn't gonna work this is gonna play so well  Uh, she says all right. This is her and this is her understanding  Of uh of how big tech works  Uh  The nature of the beast is opaque and fluid. How do you audit an algorithm?  It's a moving river changing all the time and the algorithms are proprietary  But constructive regulation must be based on clear information true that  Speaking as a child as a young person word  I asked a speaker if I was thinking correctly when I imagine algorithms  I see them as a series of waves  Not necessarily in sequence difference in size pushing my small skiff in this direction or that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not a terrible. I mean, that's actually not a bad. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Analogy algorithms are like the waves pushing you along the ocean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In different directions. I mean she's describing basically dark patterns or just patterns sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But she was wrong. Apparently the speaker said no  The algorithm isn't the wave. It's the water. It's the thing upon which you sail  To go to a site is to choose to cast off  She's she's this is all aimed at her group, uh, who apparently are avid sailors  Uh, they're all wearing it's very top siders and polo shirts and uh, they understand this they understand this and uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's an opinion columnist. We don't go to opinion columnist looking for  Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't credibility. Here's the problem  You take kids off the internet until they're 18  Uh, they are disadvantaged

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you ask me, oh, yeah, if they're disadvantaged because they'll figure it out, but I I do think  I do think it's ridiculous to say I mean it's just a silly idea to lop children off from the internet  That's not going to happen. So, I mean, it's kind of like let's have some faith in our kids  Yeah, I think people just don't want to have to deal with this. Yeah, this is related to our conversation about uh linguistics earlier

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's very easy for us of a different generation to say well, that's that's no good  That's not how I grew up go outside and play by the way  Does your daughter go outside and play?

Yeah  And and so they picked the most annoying they recognized how hated he was. Yeah, the most annoying was hated  He was hated and is not much missed  Uh big tech pouring a lot of money. This is an article I saw today in the atlantic into carbon removal  This is interesting. This is uh, basically investing  Google and facebook more than 900 million dollars into a technology that doesn't exist  With the hopes that if they pour all this money into it that somebody will invent it  Like an nft. It's kind of an nft yesterday an alliance of prominent silicon valley companies google meta  shopify stripe  Announced its purchasing 925 million dollars in carbon removal  over the next  Eight years, that's a huge amount of money  Uh the purchases which will be made by a new stripe owned company called frontier is the largest  ever almost a billion dollars  uh, but  As you may or may not know carbon removal right now is kind of a pipe dream  Uh, so there are a lot of carbon removal projects  14 different startups that will be funded by this including carbon built  Which is trying to sequo trying note the word to sequester carbon by capturing it in concrete  The future forest company which seeks to accelerate the natural process of rock weathering  I'm not I don't know. There's a link project vesta which wants to line beaches with a carbon capturing mineral called olivine  Um there is there is a kind of a  Uh a precedent for this in 2010  The atlantic says a set of donors committed one and a half billion to buy doses  Of vaccine for streptococcus pneumoniae before it hit before it had been invented  It's called an advanced market commitment and it spurs and you know if it works the rapid invention and deployment  Of a product in this case a pneumococcal vaccine  Which has since saved 700 000 lives worldwide  So it worked in that case

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But um, i've been writing about carbon sequestration since I was in college working like an internship at business week  So some of these are like, yeah, sure. Maybe one day  um, you know  They've got a lot of money to spend. This is a big deal  I mean, no, the government's not funding. It might be greenwashing. Yeah, I mean it might be real. Yeah  I mean we need to do it. We don't have the federal budget going into a lot of this stuff and I think  I mean would I like a more organized response than like private companies finally deciding that this is what they should do  Yes, but we don't have that so

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is different from carbon credits  Or I guess it could be a kind of carbon credit. I don't know if that qualifies we buy for instance at twit  We buy every month carbon credits to offset the carbon we use with our lights and you know all the all the power we use  um from a firm called I can't remember the name of it, but uh, actually I think I have it here terrapass  Terrapass and so I think they do a variety  of different projects, uh  To offset carbon whether it's plant trees, although that's often been  Carbon credits are a little bit of a scam. Yeah. Well, I know they're but I want to do something, you know  I mean, maybe I should buy, you know, maybe I should buy these carbon sequestering  Technologies, I don't know. Um, well, I mean  Who knows how we're gonna get there right? We feel like we least and I feel like we've got to you know  This is the least we can do it might be literally quite literally the least we can do  Um, it's more than plant trees though. They do local projects. They have a  Large variety of things that they  They do I picked this one because the yale school of forestry recommended it and I figured well, okay  You know, they must they must know  Or they must have gotten money to recommend them. No, no, no, no, it wasn't it wasn't in a  Context like that. It was actually  An interview with somebody in the forestry department. They said well, what do you do to keep the world green?  She said well most of us  When we travel we'll buy carbon credits from tera pass and they mentioned another company, I think  So hey, these are foresters  They do this company does a lot about it. But at the same time I I understand completely it's like  A drop in the bucket try it all let's try everything. Let's do everything do stuff  That's why lisa I drive all like your vehicles or we have solar panels and we could stop doing as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_14

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow, there we go  Yeah, that sounds that sounds plausible. That's about right. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably when he started appearing on on our show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did you know that yeah off the top of your head because I I met him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was one of the first people I met after I joined gigaome and I joined gigaome in 2008

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I remember because he came to san francisco and I was like great let's let's let's chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I was like, oh my god. I'm meeting kevin marx. Yes. I was the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was kind of kevin has worked every week. He's worked at apple  He's uh, we've interviewed him on triangulation back in 2011  That was but I think we did we would had john even on the day that steve jobside. Yeah  Oh, that's we were talking to you when that happened  Yep. Oh, wow  November 30th 2011 you're absolutely right. I remember we had to interrupt the show  But fortunately you had it having worked at apple you had lots to say too  Uh, oh wow. I forgot about that. Yeah  Wow, so what's your pick of the week this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  um  So this is a site that i've been  Um, I looked at and I now look at it all the time  It's the electricity map. Um, and what it shows you is  um  Effectively you click on on an electricity organization you can california that'll be light green  So if you click on it, it gives you information about what is generating the electricity  And also how it changes over the day and over the night  Oh, this is great. If you if you scroll up the left hand side a bit you can see a um  Yeah, a graph of when it's when it's when it's green when it's brown. Yeah, we just clicked on somewhere very brown one

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, that's turlock  But if I go back to our area the california independent system operator

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can see it's green at the moment because you've got a lot of orange sun there, right?  um  And but there's a bit of there's a lot of purple gas that takes over at night and so it goes brown at browner at night

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  fun  And it's and it's great and the other thing if you look and you can look around the world and see europe and different  um countries as well, so  Look how green quebec is holy cow. Yeah, so the northern ones are they're basically all hydropower. So they've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And then there's uk very green  No, no, sorry, it's sort of muddy brown muddy brown. I was that was confused by scandinavia

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Scandinavia is very green because it's it's mostly hydro with with some geothermal and things. Yeah, the uk is let down my gas  Um, we have we can't really do solar. Um, we can do a lot of wind. Um  But we we fill in with gas and we've and our nuclear has been declining some but and france is is extremely nuclear  That's it's very green  So but it's the fascinating thing is you you do see the difference composition of the different countries and how the basically the natural experiments  What's going on? So yeah, that's basically  France is more than half nuclear. Whereas germany is  They've decommissioned almost all their nuclear. Yes, because they're fools and they've and they're mining more coal and poland is very cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're using more russian gas. Yeah, interesting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  interesting, but anyways, this is this is one of those you know, i'm  paying attention to  Environment and electricity and this is this is just it's very interesting to look at it and work at it over time and look at  Every day, so it's just something that's not you know, I pay attention to so I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I really like this  electricity map.org  Very interesting and it shows you where the power comes from it shows you carbon intensity over time

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, it also shows you flows if you click on one little if there's if they're feeding power to other areas  You can see errors between them as well. Yeah, really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, this is fascinating. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is it's one of the things you just keep I just keep looking at it  But as we talk more about the energy stuff and things about that you look at that and you start to think about it  Yeah, my my  My reaction to it was looking at it was yeah. It's great to get you know  Sail is great if you're in the right part of the world wind is great if you're in the right part of the world like the uk  Is but the challenge is what you do when it's it's dark or the wind's not blowing  And the thing that actually would make sense there is is pumped hydro  Which the uk does a bit of but if you if you it was designed to do intraday smoothing  Um, it was originally designed to move because you run coal and nuclear powers full blast  It was designed to you you pump the water uphill at night and then let it out during the day  um, but if you scale that up, um and pump the water with the solar and the and the wind when you have it and then use  The water when they're not there  You could use a lot less gas because the moment everyone is basically burning gas to to fit in all the gaps between the  variability of everything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Fascinating and you see the difference between you know, eastern south america and western south america  And I guess that's governmental policy primarily. It's fascinating. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and yeah, I mean you see australia is is like just all coal  Ah nasty, oh actually not in the south there. Yeah, look just uh, just south australia

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But it's yeah, tazmania is doing great good on you tazmania

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think tazmania is hydro again  Yeah, but you know if really just you see the the boundary between the different organizations and and what they what the choices they've made. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  electricitymap.org  And of course we want to promote indie web  and the homebrew website, uh  Trying to save the web one page at a time

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, so this is this is another thing. This is a little bonus one. This is some something made this this week. It's basically  Um, it gives you a random indie web page. Oh nice click on the button and you get a random

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  stumble upon for the indie web  Yep, I like it

Transcript:  But that's that's quite fun. Is it a web ring? Will I find another button at the bottom? No, it needs to be a web ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, we know it uses the we've got an indie web ring. It uses that as well. Okay, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's really cool. So random  blog posts what makes you an indie web blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Um, we've we've fairly got a loose  Definition basically if you if you have if it's you on your own side, right? Um, we've got a set of things that you could add  to it we've got all these different protocols like web mention and  Micropub and so on that that could make it easier for you  But the basic thing is have your own website, right? There's lots of ways to do that and we're not you know, we're  Catholic about that or agnostic about that depending which way you want to look at it. Nice. Um,  We will because there's lots of ways to do it  But the point is if it's if it's a website that you you have control over that's important  It's I mean that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And if you're looking for a group of people who are working, uh along these  Lines the homebrew website club  Which is on the indie web.org page  Has its meaning next meeting tonight  In about an hour.
