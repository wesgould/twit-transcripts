This week in Google, the show we cover the latest  in the Google verse with Jeff Jarvis,  professor of journalism.  Wait a minute, let me get my crib sheet here.  The Leonard Taub Professor for Journalistic Innovation  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism  at the City University of New York.  Hello, Jeffrey.  Hello, boss, how are you?  I'm good, you got a whiteboard.  Have you been teaching from your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I did a, whatever, I did a event on journalism  with education with South Africa at six a.m.  And who knew that the sun rises just that way?  Oh, now we know.  So I had to put the whiteboard there this morning.  I've been on Zoom nonstop since then.  I'll get rid of it some place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you get Zoom fatigue?  I got Zoom fatigue the other day.  Which today I do, yeah.  Oh man.  It's awful.  Also with a Stacy Higginbotham from stacyoniot.com  and the IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle.  So do you get Zoom fatigue, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do, well I get talking fatigue.  So like today I'll do this show.  But it never happens to me.  I'll do my show.  Yeah, I'm an introvert, hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's funny because maybe because of the way  we do this, I don't get fatigue from doing this.  I mean I do this all day for the last 15 years.  But the minute I'm starting to,  I did three Zoom calls on Friday.  We had a college reunion which was really fun  with about 15 people from Trumbull College.  That was really, really fun.  And then, but before that I had a family meeting  and before that I had another conference call with,  with for Twit and it was like by the end of the day  I was like exhausted.  Yeah, oh yeah.  And it wasn't as much talking as I do  probably in a normal day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's very hard to do eye contact  and you are thinking a lot more about how to connect  with people and you're also, like when we're talking,  like if we were in person, I wouldn't be always looking  and focused at the screen.  I would probably be like doing other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you get that when you were doing the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do, but that's just because I don't talk that often.  Right.  My husband and I can actually have an entire meal  and not say a word.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that.  Would you rather have a Zoom call  or an old fashioned phone conference call?  A Zoom call.  Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  I love talking to people on the phone  because I can walk, I can process better.  As long as it's interactive.  If someone's just talking at me, then I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is pretty easy for me  because I'm not looking at you, I'm not thinking.  I'm not really doing anything.  I don't know, maybe it's just because it's my native habitat  but I'm just very relaxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also, Leo, I think it's about the distance  to the screen and the camera.  That might be it.  Because if I were sitting looking.  You've got a whole room in front of you.  You have that thing right in front of you.  Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was so surprised and I feel bad for people  who are living on Zoom these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I care too much, I think.  For this show, I'm like, no, I have to make my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't care so much.  It's very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a podcast.  Don't care so much.  So if you were a Twitter employee  and you had the option,  would you choose to go back to the office  or would you choose not to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting as we are starting to come back out  of our pause in many parts of this country.  The big tech companies  have had different reactions to this.  Right.  Jack Dorsey said, you don't ever have to come back.  If you're working at home and it's working for you,  stay home.  Apple has already started to bring people back.  Saying, no, no, no, we want you to come back.  Google said, you don't have to come back  till the end of 2020, till after the year, till 2021.  I think Facebook said the same thing.  So there is this, obviously there's some jobs  like Jeff who's running our board, our engineering staff.  They have to be there.  But there's a lot of jobs we do here  that can be done from home.  In the past, we haven't liked it  because we feel like, well, we don't know what's going on.  We like everybody to be in the office at the same time,  but I'm not in a hurry to bring people back by any means.  We've already told people,  even if other businesses are coming back,  since we're able to do business  without subjecting you to health risks,  we see no reason to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a weird question.  Well, probably doesn't work  because business is so different right now.  But do you think your efficiency is better, worse,  similar to what it was when it was in the office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday I had to yell at people  for putting too many animated GIFs in the Slack.  I said, guys, I can't, there's all this stuff.  I can't, this is an important channel for new information.  I need to see, I can't, there's too many dancing.  So they knocked that off.  We do have channels though in our Slack for fun.  Cause you know, and so people,  and I think people really need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You killed it in the main channel, yeah.  Killed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, now there's all these Leo is the Grinch GIFs  running around that you just don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I deserve them, I admit it.  But we have like a staff lunch  where everybody gets on the Zoom and eats their lunch,  which is, I don't participate in that.  Thank God, I'm busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So can I mention my favorite story of the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The fact that Google employees had to be warned  not to charge their lunches at home to the expense account.  They don't know what life is like having to buy lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, that is funny.  Oh, this is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that the best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, that's a little bit of chutzpah  to charge your home lunch to your expense account.  Well, I'm working, but it is, they are working, right?  And they used to get lunch.  They used to get lunch for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why they're doing it.  But wow, the real world is so hard on tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, yeah.  So there were gifts around the office of people.  People, as soon as they're back, they're going to eat 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my goodness. Wow.  So I will say, having worked from home and virtually since 2004,  I would never go into an office if I had, like I am remote for life.  Remote for life.  I am less productive.  And the best tools that we have had were Slack was excellent  and allowed you to feel connected to your people.  Right.  I would go on reporting trips, and I think I would never give those up.  Like I could, there's so much you do in person  and you wouldn't still want to go do.  But being in an office is I am so much less productive when I'm in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, another thing, Stacey, I was thinking today,  so last time I was in San Francisco, I got to see Jack Dorsey.  Right. Well, now I'm going to be in San Francisco.  Is Jack around? No, actually, Jackson Tuscaloosa.  He doesn't come in anymore. Right.  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah. The people you used to be able to meet with because you were in town  may not be in town anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we just I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That actually means that you could have events that gives actually  a good rationalization for events. Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You haven't seen your own coworkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so we would always and I think this is really important.  If you're going to do remote work, you have to bring people in  at least once or twice a year.  And that's really essential to and when you do it,  you know, we got together for events, obviously, because we did events.  And then we also got together for like corporate retreats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's it going to take to feel safe flying again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A vaccine? Yeah.  Heard immunity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think so.  You've seen I don't know if you've seen these pictures of like  plexiglass defiders, like cones of silence over every seat  and all sorts of crazy ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw a restaurant that has already installed shower curtains between the tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not that's not really why go to a restaurant if you're going to have to  sit in the shower booth.  That's not fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not fun at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of like the the little greenhouses they were building.  The Amsterdam. Yeah.  Yeah. But that was very hot real fast.  And yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, we just have to.  I think the best thing to do at this point,  and I've decided just to take it one day at a time.  I can't. I don't know.  I don't know. And, you know, the only responsibility I have is to our staff.  And I think we've already decided we're going to encourage them to stay home  as long as they feel like they can do the job at home.  And that's good for me because I do come in.  And, you know, I feel like I actually have a luxury because this is a luxury  because I can use this studio and I can use my studio safely.  And I continue to.  But one of the reasons I could do that is I don't let anybody else come in.  None of the other hosts.  They all have to work from home.  I might be going crazy right now if I had to work from home.  I don't know if I could do it.  Some shakeups in the pixel division, this story from Nick Bestone on the information.  The apparently the pixel four was such a disappointment  that Mark Lavoie, the guy we saw on stage, the photography guru,  left the company last month.  This is the first that exits been reported.  And Pixel general manager Mario Kuros  also left, both declined to request for comment from the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mario did Chromecast before he was in charge of the pixel.  He was a long time Googler. Yeah.  Yeah, he was big. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's strange that Google would blame those executives for the pixel four.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the camera on the pixel four.  Was there? No.  The problem with the pixel four was the price. Pure and simple.  Am I wrong?  This was more than a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe the shakeup was related to it, like they didn't want to work  on something like this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe. I don't know.  We have the four a coming out a little bit delayed, but imminently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, because this right now would be Google I.O.  We would have had the Google I.O. keynote yesterday.  And I would have had a phone in my hand.  And you probably would have had a four in your hand.  You'd be down there, you know, complaining about the lack of pixel books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true. But I did join the noshes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Google I.O. is a fun conference to go to.  No Google. They didn't even say we're going online.  Microsoft's doing it for a while.  They did. And then they said and then they stopped.  Microsoft's doing its developer conference next week online.  Apple is going to do its developer conference in June online.  A lot of them are still continuing on.  But Google said for reasons I don't know, hey, we don't even want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook I.O. is mostly product launches.  And then on the back end is the developer stuff that most people  don't really cover the cool fun like that.  And I think the real stuff.  I don't know if you have developer accounts, but is Google still  sending out information to developers for online training sessions  and that sort of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  This would be one for our all about Android team.  I should ask Jason, etc.  By the way, they had a great show yesterday with the head of Google Music  and now YouTube music explaining what's going on there.  So Lavoie was the guy who talked.  Remember last year, we were kind of underwhelmed by the presentation,  except when Mark Lavoie stepped on stage.  He was a computer computational photography pioneer.  In fact, he met Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were grad students at Stanford.  Joined Google about six years ago,  but he had been working for Google, doing projects at Stanford like Street View.  He worked with Google Glass and the camera for its headset.  Quero's had been or however, I'm not sure.  I'm saying that right. Quero's had been at Google since 2005.  15 years.  He was the pixels general manager from the very beginning.  So it's unclear. Are these punishments?  It's nobody saying  apparently, according to information has such great sources  at a hardware all hands meeting in the fall.  Rick Osterloh was afraid that the pixel four, but this before it was released,  would be panned. He said he did not agree with some of the decisions made about the phone,  in particular, disappointed with battery life.  Google would not let the information talk to Rick.  So maybe I don't know.  Is this this might be a change in what the pixel four or the pixel phone going for?  Is there a pixel five or no? Maybe there isn't even going to be a pixel five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google's really hurt. I mean, the hardware for Google.  I feel so bad for these people because they have such good ideas.  They have good software and they throw it out there and it's just.  They can't be Apple. Shall I whine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you picture your head or your earbuds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, drive driving.  Don't still disconnecting when you move about disconnecting.  It got worse. I did everything the server then.  Then one side of the bat, there's other other people complaining that discharges  and and the charge suddenly I hardly used it.  It was all in this little case plugged in.  Still one of the things battery ran out.  I went back and forth.  I went ahead and decided to do an exchange, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because Jason Howell has them and he has not had any of those problems.  Nope. He emailed me.  Oh, no. That. Yes.  I asked him the other day and he said no.  So it must have just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was on a phone. He was walking.  It's oddly it's when you're in motion  and he was walking on a phone call and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, who doesn't walk on phone calls? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's why you're wearing these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the point.  Wearing these is so you can walk on the phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a bad habit.  Have you ever walked too far away from the phone?  Because I forget that the phone is there and I'm going  and I go outside and go, hello, hello.  So carry my just my little tip to all of you, carry the phone with you.  And when you go walking.  OK, well, I'm sorry that you're having that problem.  I will let us know if the if this exchange fixes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you have you worked out with them?  Do you get it with music playback or just when you're talking?  OK, have you listened to music while walking?  Or do you? I'm just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I I walk as fast as my old body will take me every evening.  That's when I use them.  And it was true on both audible and music. OK.  That's thank you.  And I think it has something to do.  So there were so so I sent them all kinds of every every every symptom I can find.  I would scratch my nose and the sound would go on.  I would scratch my nose again.  Let's try to recreate it.  Someone go out five minutes later, I scratch my nose.  Sound goes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's telling you not to touch your face, Jeff.  Oh, I know. Feature.  It's a feature.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're probably then with not happy with Google naming  these updates, the pixel buds, the feature drops because  your pixel buds are getting audio dropped.  The sound drops exactly.  But they're going to update these just like they did the pixel phones  with new capabilities from time to time.  I think one capability is to fix the fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, unless I was I was ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was ready.  Oh, is that common?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I looked there's not even though last time we were on, I showed the Reddit  thread, which was a lot of problems.  But general search on Google is not finding a lot of problems.  So I'm hoping this is just a lemon unit.  Or maybe Google's censoring the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've never had it happen with the Galaxy Buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never had it happen with the AirPods, although people have had other  problems with the AirPods Pro.  I've never had it happen with my job.  Those things are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I love my I have two sets of jobbers, which are very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking I might as well get the Galaxy or the jobber because I don't  really care about having assistant on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have to be the Google one.  We can still get the you and you can set up assistant on your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can set up assistant on your job.  Bras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, really?  And I work out which job you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have the sixty five tees, but that's what I have.  The seventy fives are out.  And if I I'm trying to break my sixty fives so I can get the seventy fives,  but they're not breaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beautiful. They work really well.  The sound quality is excellent.  They're a little pricey.  The Galaxy Buds are cheap.  Oh, really? What is the price now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're only like ninety nine.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, but they're I love those things.  And me too. I have the sport the sport model as well, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're ninety nine at Best Buy.  Sorry. That's a good price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would get them. Well, the seventy five T is one hundred seventy nine.  You get the sixty five. They're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no noise. That's what I have.  But your Pixel Buds don't have canceling or do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. And if you're not using the translate, then.  There is a built in puffer that's puffer.  Puffer puffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's French for puffer.  It's French for puffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Puffer puffer.  I think I'm going to think I can.  Can I carry that off? Can I pull it off?  No, no, I don't think so.  I think it's just Stacey. Yeah, that's Stacey Automata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey Stacey, I don't know.  Jabra 65 Elite.  Let's see if you've got Google on them.  That's the only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I tap them, I think I hear a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, if you pay your job or device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, you should be able to get Google a system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this gets us back to this problem with the people leaving at the Pixel Group.  I wonder if there is hardware problems at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, my 3A is a wonderful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the 3A and I think that's my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm mad the 4A is not going to have an XL.  That makes me unhappy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I should. I don't know.  It's not none of my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much was the Pixel?  Like, what is the goal of the Pixel?  Let's ask that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's I think where the yes, I think that's where the confusion is.  The Nexus line originally was a low cost line of pure Google hardware and software.  Right.  For developers, we thought.  And also to demonstrate what a pure Android experience could be.  And then they started to get aspirations when the Pixel line came out.  They got more and more expensive each year.  And people started to say, well, what are you trying to do with the Pixel line?  It is no longer a low cost reference design to show you how great Android could be  or for developers to use develop Android apps.  It's it you're trying to compete with Apple and Samsung.  And that's the real problem is Google has not at all kept up with either company sales wise,  product quality wise.  The only thing. So you don't think that these phones are as good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think a lot of features on these phones.  Where I mean, are comparable to Android or sorry, Android, Apple or the Samsung fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the only place it excels is the camera.  Well, that's what people are leaving.  And it is that's the most important part, isn't it?  Google's always had trouble with audio clicking, weirdness, quality issues on all of their  Pixel phones drop out a lot of complaints about those battery life is subpar compared  to Samsung or Apple.  So given that they're charging the same amount as Samsung and Apple charge for their flagship  phones, I'm not surprised they're not selling that well.  It is I mean, I far prefer to use pure Android than I do Samsung's version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, I will buy an Android phone over a Samsung phone every day of the week  just to avoid the bloatware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the bloatware and the different way of thinking about the world.  It's a different. Here you go, Carson.  Veltan shall. Veltan shall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also felt on show.  Veltan shall. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also which is worldview.  You also get updates more, I think, on time, more and more promptly.  I don't know if you get them for longer.  And that's the other thing Google's done that I think really has cheesed people off,  but not nearly as much as people are pissed off about the new Motorola phone, which will  get only one update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jesus.  Whoa. Not bueno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the Motorola Edge, which is a very or the Edge Plus is a very expensive  phone is beautiful.  It's great hardware. Oh, wait a minute.  Sorry. Got to take it back.  Motorola says, no, we'll do two updates.  Two.  Yeah, two.  So actually, if you do one a year, that's pretty much the same as Google's promising,  which is two years of updates.  Still, I think Andra's got to do better than that.  I mean, you could buy an Apple phone and get it updated as long as the phone, you know,  can keep up with the operating system, which is usually quite a few years, four or five years.  Two years.  Yeah.  Two years of updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dos años.  Dos años.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe they even said just one year at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, props to them for like warning people in advance.  If you buy this, it's only good for a year.  Yeah.  And how long do we have any recent data on how long people are keeping their phones now?  Because I've got to think.  It's more than two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's, you know, the two years was conditioned by the carriers and the two year  contract, because in Canada, where it's typically three years, people were perfectly happy to  keep their phone for three years.  And given the price of these flagship phones, I don't have a number, but I'm going to guess  it's more like four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I would think even now with COVID and all of the economic uncertainty, we're going  to see that number stretch.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's running out to the store to spend a thousand dollars now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus they're not using their phones as much.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're using their phones a lot.  Voice minutes are up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We're starting to see some stats come out over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything.  Internet usage, streaming usage.  The only one that's not up is Quibi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  April 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm surprised, surprised, surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeffrey Katzenberg said, it's COVID-19's fault.  To which I reply, I think COVID-19 is your fault.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's a little truth to that.  I mean, it is designed as a commuter service where you're like hanging out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  A strap hanger though, because if you're driving, you're not watching it.  It's only for people on the bus or waiting in line at the DMV.  It seems like a small market.  Not people that he knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody I know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And waiting at the dentist's office.  I mean, all of that sort of thing in the line at the grocery store, although that's  the most antisocial.  But Jeff, Wi-Fi calling is up 78% and voice calls are up 29%.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That makes sense.  That's a lot.  Because you can't talk to people, so you're going to call more.  I do a lot of face, a lot more FaceTiming, zooming, all that stuff, but I don't think  that would show up on those because I don't usually use my phone for that, but you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now, now we're all going to be on Meet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you want to show that?  Should we do the Meet?  Oh yeah.  Let's.  So Jeff and I have been sitting here on a Meet.  Now we're going to find it.  I got it.  You don't have to find it.  Just talk.  And we have turned on at the request of our esteemed colleague, Stacy Higginbotham,  we have turned on captions, which you'll find there at the bottom.  And Google is using its really good engine to do captioning.  And I have to say it's doing a great job.  Now, why can't I get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why aren't you?  I'm seeing it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It spelled my name correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It knows Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's spelled Stacey Higginbotham?  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it did.  And it spelled my name correctly.  It added an E.  Once you added the Higginbotham, because at first it was S-T-A-C-Y.  So it knows how you spell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it must be, I wonder if that's because you're in our contact list.  Or just Google knows.  So we've tried various things like swearing and it does the last risks.  If you say bad words, we've also tried German.  To which it translated my stomachs with wrecked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about a common word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like how Germans translated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is the Bonhoeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like two sausages and sauerkraut, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How the Google Voice Assistant works, right?  I mean, it's about the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can talk at the same time too, which is amazing.  Which is really kind of crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how it knows, but somehow when Jeff and I both talk at the same time,  it gets both of our words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no one's going to join the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so much better than like Google Voice.  When I still get my voicemails from Google Voice, they are terrible.  Why haven't they?  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the quality of this is so much better than the quality of the  uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want spaghetti for dinner.  Short spaghetti for dinner.  Sell the spaghetti stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Short it.  Anyway, I think that's pretty cool.  So we didn't know about this.  Apparently it's not a new feature.  We're just we never turned on.  Frankly, we're using Zoom.  Although I have to say at Twitter, Google does a funny thing because when we make  calendar appointments, which we do a lot for all kinds of stuff internally and externally,  it automatically sets up a meet with a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can turn off, but then it comes back on sometimes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's almost like, well, I might as well use it.  It's actually very clever on their part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've had cases where half the meeting is in Google and half the meeting is in Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had that problem too, because if you want a Zoom meeting and you put it in the  meeting note, it'll still make a meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll still make a meeting.  So an ambassador has to go over to Google land to say, cross the bridge over here to Zoomville.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, whoever makes the calendar invite has to turn that off.  So if you're making...  I know, but it sometimes turns it back on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People forget to, you know, they don't even know it's happening and all of that.  Hey, Jeff had a great interview, by the way.  With the Unabomber, Nathan Alabeck, who is also, as it turns out, little known, the voice of Stacom.  No, he just has a very aggressive beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a wonderful guy.  He's a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was hired as their media guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that really a beard?  It's a marketing company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't that look a little fake?  The beard?  No, no, he was pulling on it.  Okay.  So he calls himself a nerd.  He's a nerd.  Yeah.  No, I like it.  And he's good.  The company Alabeck had been doing food marketing stuff.  And like three years ago, Stacom came and said, you know, we're for old people like Jarvis.  It's been around since the 70s when people like that ate cheese steaks at home.  And so he said, let me take over the Twitter account and give it a kind of a voice that says,  gee, even Stacom says that.  And a voice of sanity.  This is pre-COVID.  It's three years ago.  This is three years.  So along comes COVID while every other advertiser is running away.  And to hell with them putting no COVID content on their forbidden list.  They ran toward it.  And he has this voice of sanity and reason and science from a frozen meat product.  He's also extremely honest in this saying, hey, folks, don't forget, I'm a marketer trying to  sell you frozen meat product.  It's funny.  It's ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've talked about it before.  It's really one of the best brands in the face of COVID of anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I talked to him about a bunch of stuff.  But what I found fascinating, which you guys will like, is that he really understands  social community.  He goes in and he figures out, he looks at a librarian Twitter and media Twitter and  weird Twitter and Stan Tritters of K-pop.  And he listens to them and he reads them and he sees what's missing and he knows how to  enter in.  He knows how to have a conversation.  He listens first.  The reason I talked to him is because it struck me as instructional for my journalism  students in social journalism.  And he really kind of gets that gospel of listening to people, understanding with them,  empathizing with them.  One of the interesting things about him is that his name is out there.  He's Nathan Alibach and his Twitter account is out there.  So he can't really be himself because people are going to say, oh, that's the Stakehams guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just like the Comcast guy, Comcast Frank.  Comcast Frank.  He kind of made it hard for him.  But okay, I got a question.  So in the days of Comcast Frank, Frank really did very well for Comcast by making them  appear to be responsive to customer issues and complaints, something they've since given up.  But it was a moment in time when it really worked well.  He was brilliant at it.  Fast forward though.  Does it matter if a brand is on Twitter these days?  There's some ancillary coverage you get, but most people, normal people aren't on Twitter.  And even if you are on Twitter, no matter what tweet, it goes by, right?  It's not you have to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't disagree.  Look at another brand.  Look at what Taco Bell, my favorite.  Yeah, but I'm on Twitter and I don't see Taco Bell because I don't follow.  It doesn't matter because your friends will talk about it or the cool kids, but the cool  kids will talk about it.  There's now a Taco Bell literary magazine.  Do we tell you about that?  I think it's irrelevant.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Taco Bell quarterly.  I think you're interested because you're interested in Taco Bell, but I don't think  it meets new customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taco Bell quarterly.  Do we read this last week?  No.  Did we do this?  No.  Go there.  Tacobellquarterly.org.  It has nothing to do with Taco Bell.  This is fan fiction, right?  This is people came up.  So volume two has Taco Bell poetry and fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God, Jeff, this is where we can write our queso.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The quesarita requiem.  Eating you, your voice rings my heart.  A language turned into light waves traveling at a pace to crack one's soul.  It is pretty crappy.  And spitting at times and swallowing and brushing my bristled chin.  The light now flamencoes mirror to mirror until it becomes noise again, bending and  loud and rhythmless.  Okay.  Well, nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So all of this notwithstanding, does it sell more tacos?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It engages the people who like you.  I mean, brands love this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty obvious.  If you're already a fan, then you're following Taco Bell or Steak'em or whatever.  And so you can talk about this and blah, blah, blah.  I just don't think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I come along out of nowhere and I retweet Steak'em,  and somebody says, what the H?  What's going on?  They discover Steak'ems too.  Then they'll go to the store and buy Steak'em.  Yes.  I have tons of friends because they want to reward it because it's so good who are buying.  Now the problem here is that I would kill for it.  My wife, like you, doesn't...  Like your wife doesn't let you go to the store and she doesn't want me to have Steak'ems.  So I can't get me Steak'ems.  There's better meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're going to get...  I want it.  I want it.  You want a fully cheese steak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Little provolone and grilled onions on a roll.  That and Taco Bell are the two things I miss.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Badly.  All right.  I will accept your...  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are having meatball paninis tonight and they're going to be delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you homemade or are you going to get them out from the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  I homemade meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The local Bainbridge Meatball vendor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that would be nice.  No, I always keep meatballs in the freezer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our son for unaccountably has suddenly got a Jones for meatloaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's great.  Meatloaf is the easiest thing in the world.  I know.  Okay.  Yes.  Comfort food.  Do you put ketchup on top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you got to, right?  After.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I put A1 steak sauce on mine.  It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you fancy meatloaf.  Oh, that's fancy.  Yeah.  You gourmet meatloaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's French meatloaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Okay.  I just was curious because it's actually an internal conversation we have.  We have a very good, very active social media presence on Twitter.  We have Jerry Masako and they do a great job.  But I feel like that's nice and I guess...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a difference, Leo.  What your social media presence does is promote what you already have.  Right.  What Steakhams does is create a persona and a voice and an empathy with people and irony  and humor and intelligence.  And Taco Bell is different but it's very similar.  It created something.  Taco Bell was not cool.  It was ridiculed.  Now Taco Bell is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taco Bell was always cool.  Taco Bell is always part of your drunk eating...  Oh, okay.  I got ridiculed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Drunk eating cool.  That is.  Maybe in Texas but I got ridiculed forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's because you're a grown man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because you're a grown man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Jeff.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you were eight years old, it's understandable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but it's for drunk college kids and high school kids.  That's what Taco Bell's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to be young again.  You want this meal.  Daisy won't let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you could be young, Jeff, if you want to turn back time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Admittedly, the cost of one Alan Back tweeting is less than one ad on a network television show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One story I read said they basically had gone through their budget  and they said, what are we going to do?  And Alan Back said, hey, why don't we try this?  And they didn't expect.  I mean, they didn't go into this thinking this is going to turn viral.  But boom, one day and it did.  Yeah.  And and Stakeham says happy.  Oh, I asked him too about the relationship with the brand because I said, you know,  what what they got to be nervous sometimes.  They said, yeah, you know, you there are things that go on.  Maybe you don't want to do that again.  But generally, he spent three years developing trust with the brand, with his client,  and also developing trust between the brand and the public.  And so it's kind of brilliant.  He's he's just a nice guy.  He's a musician, songwriter who decided when he got married, he said, I got to have a job.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and he is he has done the thing that you really want to do, which is he's created a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He really has.  He's also on Twitch, by the way.  He's a gamer.  What does he stream?  I don't know.  Can you can you look him up?  No, no, he does not.  Okay, well, I guess maybe.  Well, if you go to his if you go to Nathan Alibach's Twitter account, you'll see his his.  So it's Twitter slash Nathan Alibach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He he was last live 16 hours ago.  And what does he do?  The history of media polarization and prominent political identities.  So I guess he just comes on and talks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's he's he's a bit of a autodidact called himself.  Yeah, he calls himself a nerd.  So he just chats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a great dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a great dog.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's not a great dog.  That's somebody else.  That's another person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's a dog.  Do you not see the dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the dog.  Yeah.  I thought that was an elbow.  Foster's dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a good guy.  So let's say no, no, I'm not knocking him.  No, no, you're not.  I know.  Bless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just like the guy a lot.  Here's your dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A moment for you, Stacey.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Puppies.  Okay.  That's a guy to love.  Yes.  Puppies.  More puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Puppy contents always good on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's the best.  Look at that.  Love happy dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at that tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guys are so easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I seen that.  Okay.  This is not at all Google related and we probably should get back on task.  Never mind.  I'm not going to digress.  Let's talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's your dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's your dog?  You're like Lamar Alexander, Stacey.  Did you see that?  He likes Stakeham.  In the hearing, he was off to the side of the screen just like Stacey so that you could  see his dog behind and think more highly of him.  Pretty disgusting.  I think it was exploiting the poor pooch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My dog is exhausted.  I'm exploiting her so much.  She's just back there sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siva Vijanathan, article in Wired talking about the Facebook regulatory or I guess  not really regulatory and that's part of his problem.  Self-regulatory.  Self-regulatory.  Well, even that.  Their review board, Facebook and the Folly of Self-regulation, the company's new review  board is designed to move slowly and keep things intact to play on the  Facebook slogan of move quickly and break things.  I'm sure you've read this.  Yes, I love Siva's book.  Siva's book.  I can see reviews of it.  We do now know who's on the board and it's a very prestigious board of people.  Indeed.  I think his contention is that they have no power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he makes some good points but we don't know until they start going.  I think what we're going to see from that kind of board is they might surprise us and  come out with pronouncements.  They'll ignore the rules from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says this review board will provide a creaking, idealistic, simplistic solution  to a trivial problem.  The stuff that Facebook deletes creates an inconvenience to some people.  Facebook makes a lot of mistakes and dealing with the Facebook bureaucracy is next to  impossible but Facebook is not the whole internet, let alone the whole information  ecosystem and Facebook is not the only way people can communicate and learn things.  True that.  Although, and you would agree with that, right?  We're putting a lot of responsibility on Facebook.  They're just part of the problem.  Although having come back to Facebook, I can see how easy it is to get channeled into  a stream of stuff you believe.  Very easy to do.  He also says the problem with the review board is  Facebook hasn't given them the power they would need to really change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we've got to see what they do because what they're going to do is they're going to take,  they've said this in the press conference that I listen in on,  they're going to choose cases that speak more loudly.  I don't imagine the former Prime Minister of Denmark and the former editor of The Guardian  sitting down, well, should she have said that that makeup was bad or not?  That's not what they're going to be picking.  That's not what they're doing.  They're going to do things that speak to principles.  Yeah, one hopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe Facebook will just ignore them, but at least it will raise an important issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then it's transparent.  Then we can all judge them and they will judge.  I don't think we can know either way.  I think Siva's good points were about diversity, which they know,  but you have one person from India to understand all the culture of India, his heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  His last line is the problem with Facebook is Facebook.  He doesn't like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is Siva's argument.  This is where he and I fundamentally disagree.  He thinks that connecting mankind is bound to be a disaster and I think the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if he would say it that way, would he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He kind of does.  No, he kind of does.  He kind of just says it's just a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It poses some intransigent problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The funny thing about Siva is he's probably the best person I know at Facebook.  Isn't that funny?  His Facebook feed is brilliant.  His Twitter feed is brilliant.  He's really good at social media even as he decries its mere existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe he's maybe more aware of it because he's doing all he can to make it a good stream  of stuff and it ends up being crap anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he's just too smart.  He can't help himself from being smart.  That's Siva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we'll watch.  Yeah, we will.  The board is complete now.  No, it's not complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's 20 people and then those 20 people will choose the next 20 to make up 40.  Got it.  And they will operate in five person panels.  Yes, right.  And the board itself has views of the diversity and so they're going to battle that out and  figure out who needs to be there, who's missing.  But they're going to go through some training and bonding and they have to,  as I mentioned in the last show, they have to get equipment to get access to Facebook's own  moderation systems.  So it'll be a while.  A few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can't do ropes courses right now with COVID.  No corporate bonding right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And that's a good thing.  God, I hate that stuff.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  In high school, I was going to tell you about my secret ropes course history.  Yeah, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I worked with kids who were danger of failing and we did ropes courses with them.  I was one of the trainees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have obeyed you.  Yeah, you were telling me what to do.  I would have said, yes, ma'am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that's good.  I think that that actually works really well with high school kids.  A little less that with business executives, but definitely works well with high school kids.  You know what I hate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Icebreakers.  A lot of things.  I hate icebreakers.  I despise icebreakers.  I want to run away and tell them freaking icebreaker is over.  This is pretty much why I'm leaving my ice frozen for you.  I freeze harder if you tell us what you mean by icebreakers.  Why don't we all say,  um, uh, what was our favorite game as a child?  Tells me nothing about you.  I don't didn't have favorite games as children as a child.  I feel inadequate from the start of whatever meeting you're having.  And I really start to dislike everyone in the meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God, I love it.  It's like going to a don't break my ice Dorothy Parker or something.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  We should go back to Google you guys, because we have lots of actual Google.  Lots of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would you like to talk about?  Yes, go ahead.  You start sidewalk is done.  Folding as of Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They exited Toronto.  Did they fold sidewalk?  No.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this was this very, you know what, when you look at the picture of it,  it's a relatively small development on the key side in Toronto, which is right now just  a warehouse district.  It's a compass is a few apartment buildings and stuff, but it's all censored, lots of  cameras and stuff.  And the idea is a model city.  And in this case, really just a model neighborhood based on big data.  The city of Toronto wanted to do it.  Google sidewalk, which is an alphabet company, has the technology to do it.  The people of Toronto, at least some of the people of Toronto,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the media of Toronto  hated it.  And, and moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  No, no, stop.  Google in its typical googly fashion went out and said, we have this great big plan.  We're going to change the world.  Trust us.  And people said, I am a citizen and I have input here.  So I'm going to use that input and ask you a lot of questions.  And Google said, we're going to do something amazing.  Trust us.  They actually put out a multi-thousand page answer to these questions that didn't answer  any of them.  So I'm going to say that Google shot itself in the foot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're both right.  I think Toronto shot itself in the foot because they got all nasty about it.  And, and, oh my God, the big horrible company is going to do horrible things.  I don't think so.  And I think they were both wrong.  I think they were both way wrong.  And they've lost an opportunity.  They both lost an opportunity.  But you know what?  This is like the Amazon extra headquarters, you know, come to Newark, Google.  It's right next door to New York.  They need you.  You could do amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the parcel, by the way, that they were going to develop, which is really just  wasted space and could have been really beautiful.  And look, you have other developers vying.  Toronto skyline is laced with, with horrific condominium complexes.  Oh God.  Yes.  That were overbuilt in the last 20 years.  This would have been a timber based skyscraper.  It was a very interesting project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it also included another parcel, I think a 50 acre parcel that then would it, that  the city was giving up just to Google.  So there was a lot about this that was not fully explained well.  And I will say, here's what I'm going to say about both of these things.  And Jeff, even your comments about moral panic.  I think moral panic is something if you want to believe in it, if you want to call it moral  panic, we have to address this and companies have to tech companies have to be a little  less arrogant and they have to be willing to do the work.  Every other company, like if you talk to a construction firm, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or a developer, you've got to get by a lot of roadblocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but, but often, but yeah, I'll agree.  I agree with you, Stacey.  I absolutely agree with you.  But let's also see the process of development locally is often corrupt.  And it's and it's a game and it's played by people like Jared Kushner.  And, you know, we see the fruits of it.  So I think that if Google wanted to accomplish something, I repeat, I love Toronto dearly.  It's the other place I'd want to live.  New York, Berlin, Toronto, my favorite cities.  I think it's a great place.  But Google should have picked some place that really could have used them.  And they could have collaborated with the city better and done something in a place  like Newark or Camden or Trenton.  God, it could have made a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.  And, you know, what's weird to me is Google did such a good job with Google Fiber, if you  remember, with working with the communities up until people started, you know, until they  started actually digging up people's lawns, which everyone's going to get pissed about.  So it was kind of surprising that.  I just don't think in this gets to like I wrote about this.  I think this gets to one of the core problems with Smart City efforts is we don't actually  know what we're buying and selling here.  And I think you when you do civic infrastructure, you have to be very clear on what you're  offering people and the value of that, because my God, like we're not going to be able to  like we're democracies.  Right.  And yes, you have to sell people on the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.  I don't.  Here's the interesting thing, Stacey, post covid, we don't know what cities are going  to be.  Right.  I'm very worried for New York.  I'm very worried for every city, especially cities with public transit and the things  that we need in a society.  And so what does a smart city look like then with the kind of data we could have, things  that can protect people's lives around data privacy, claxons going off, certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that Google was so problematic with is they didn't talk about  how the city could access and use the data.  That was one of the big complaints is Google was going to have all this data, but they  didn't want to make all of it available to cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they were very scared of saying, oh, Google's handing over data to the city.  So it was it was it was a delicate dance.  I don't think I'm not disagreeing with you.  I'm not disagreeing with you that they didn't do enough to say here's what could benefit  you, Toronto.  But they get smashed on the other side of their head.  Oh, my God, they got data.  So the more they talked about data, the worse off.  So they get allergic to that.  But I'm agreeing with you, Stacey.  We're agreeing with you.  They could have done a much better job.  Toronto could have done a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's I don't get why Google is so terrible about communicating.  I mean, they're terrible about communicating on every level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's probably an arrogance.  It is difficult to do this kind of development every time this happens in any city.  And I've seen it here at Petaluma on a much smaller scale.  The developer is you know, there's a constant push and pull from the developer and the and  various civic entities, not just the city government, but but locals and so forth on  the I mean, we're so far from it.  I don't know what the real issues were.  Maybe Google was asking too much money from Toronto.  Maybe the issue was Toronto wanted data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google know the issue was that Google when they proposed this, they had the Keyside project,  but then they also had a whole plan for another development that wasn't part of that project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That the city was also giving to them.  And then there were also issues about data usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of that's negotiable at some point.  Yeah.  I mean, I know I wasn't willing to negotiate on it and they weren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  talking about what they were going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of like Amazon walking away from New York saying, well, fine.  Okay.  You don't want it too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit of take my ball and go home.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I also think maybe a little bit.  I do think that they realize that this is a stupid thing to pursue in the wake of like  sheer economic catastrophe.  That may also be the and city catastrophe too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And city catastrophe.  I mean, how do you get from that complex?  How do you get to your job?  Subway.  And you have to go a distance to get to the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just, I'm looking at this parcel and it just, it's not a particularly attractive  part of Toronto.  It's a part that really could use some redevelopment.  It seems as if it would have been nice if they could have figured out a way to do it.  I love, I think it's going to take some of these tech companies to step up and say,  let's try some different ways to do our cities.  Let's plan some different ways.  This is the full 800 hectare designated waterfront area.  The quayside part was just that red part, but the purple is of course the whole Eastern  waterfront.  And I don't know how much of that they were proposing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now we have, as we talked about last week, Eric Schmidt brought in by Cuomo to rethink  technology and local government.  Right.  It is an opportunity and a need.  Stacey's primary point is right.  The arrogance is a problem, but we should be figuring this stuff out together now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if we will, but we'll see.  It's not just arrogance.  It's also a willingness to tell people what the concrete value is.  I'm going to say tech is really bad at this because, actually tech broadly is bad at this.  Companies like Apple are very good.  I'm not a huge Apple fan by any stretch, but they do a good job of explaining how a brand  new chip or a brand new technology is going to just change your world in an amazing way.  And I think tech companies tend to either over promise on that and not deliver, or they just say,  woo, magical chip or magical radio protocol.  And they're like, you should get excited because they're excited.  And they'll be like, it can do all these things, but they don't deliver it to people in a package  that most people can consume it.  And I think, and you've really got to do that.  And not just smart cities.  If you're thinking about re-imagining cities and you're bringing technology into play,  there are a lot of really amazing technologies out there, but it's really hard to say  none of those are actually deliverable yet in a package.  They're actually something you need systems integrators.  You need a lot of help to pull together.  And I think that's going to be really tough to communicate and build  because it's such a fragmented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also human.  It's human centered design thinking is we'll try it once, then we'll see,  and then we'll iterate, and then we'll try, and then we'll iterate,  which is the way the world does operate.  But they don't promise in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I would love to hear from somebody on the other side who can explain what was wrong with this.  Bianca Wiley.  I'm reading the master plan.  It sounds like at least they were trying to listen.  They did a lot.  I would have liked to live there.  That's probably really where it comes down to for me is that's cool.  I want to be there.  Beats living in Disney.  I don't want to live in Celebration, Florida.  Right. Exactly.  But this looks pretty kind of cool and interesting.  And as I said, it's an improvement over the way it is right now.  I know that area.  I've spent some time there.  But I would be very curious to know what it may be.  It may have been purely COVID.  That's what they said it was.  It's just the economic climate is not right to build all of this right now,  especially if there's pushback from the city.  But it seems like they were making some progress.  I know it's easy to say, oh, it's privacy advocates tanked this.  And I don't know if that's the case.  I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was not a happy end.  It was not a happy marriage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot of back and forth.  But I can tell you, every single development,  we got a development going on in Petaluma right now.  People don't want it.  It's going to add another stop to the train, the smart train,  which people also don't want.  But it takes a lot of cars off the road.  This is normal.  This is the back and forth that goes on.  It's the back and forth of local government.  It should.  As it should.  I certainly don't know what happened.  Maybe you want to do a whole piece on it,  think piece on it, Stacey, for GIGO.  For my newsletter?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I no longer work at GIGO.  I haven't for five years.  This is why we need journalism.  Yes.  No, I've done, I wrote actually extensively about it during the fighting.  Oh, good.  And I had people on the show to talk about it.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you do know a lot about it.  Is it all a loss to Toronto that it's not going to happen now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, yes.  I think it's a loss because I do think there were good things about it.  I think it could have been a really interesting project.  It would have been good to build something like this.  I think that Google probably could have done a better job explaining some of that  and acknowledging what it was going to do with the data  and answering some of these questions, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what, too?  I think that if they tried this five years ago,  it would have gone through a lot smoother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  But I think that's because we've started learning about how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm also going to say it's also because in the meantime, we've had more panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think there's a very legitimate case for saying,  hey, we're letting these companies have a lot of data and they're using it in very...  They're sometimes using it in ways that are not comfortable for us.  And we're also seeing how when you start building AI based on this sort of data,  there's no accountability for things like redlining or other things that...  This is a really important point.  Cities and governments, their job is to protect those who are most injured by our society.  They're the safety net.  They're the last stop.  And if you look at it that way, they have a very different goal than a private company does.  And sometimes those things are in conflict and I don't think there's ways to resolve some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I'm saying, Stacey, too, is that the atmosphere now about tech,  we're in the tech clash, it's very negative.  I think that has to factor in.  So it's politically, especially in a place like Canada, which remember I love,  but they tend to be more European than American by a long shot.  Robertson Davies always said that Canada is actually Scandinavia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh good, because I love Scandinavia.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Canada, I love Scandinavia.  But they have a different cultural view and there's more skepticism.  It's another story in the rundown.  And this is probably another example of not doing it right.  I've argued that part of what the platforms have to do, too,  is start to defend the internet and defend the freedoms that are there.  And I'm scared of what's going to happen.  So what does Facebook do?  Facebook is starting a one report said dark money, I think it's a little strong,  but an effort to kind of boost tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's the way to do it.  This is that new, is it a political action committee or just a lobbying group?  The edge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't tell if it's purely lobbying.  I think it's obviously part of it.  It's called American Edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the idea, dark money merely means you don't know who's donating to it, right?  It's a nonprofit.  But we know what's Facebook.  It's Facebook.  They can raise money, blitz the airwaves with ads without the obligation of disclosing all  their donors.  They call it a kind of like a social welfare group, American Edge.  Facebook says, the US leads the world in technology.  We should be proud of that fact and promote it.  We're working with a diverse group of stakeholders to help build support for our industry  while we're leading an effort to start this coalition.  Now is a good time because I think people are a little bit more positive about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  But it also just to Stacey's point, I think what you're saying is behave better and maybe  it'll get better.  And I think the example of that is Amazon, right?  Amazon should have an aggressive structure to treat its employees better in the warehouses.  They're going to pay $2 an hour more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But only till the end of the month.  I like Amazon and I use Amazon and but they could be doing better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, deliveries according to Amazon will be returning to normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a little miffed because I bought my mom a Kindle Paper White and it only was delivered  today.  Yeah, it takes a while.  Well, she got it today though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How long did you order it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I ordered it on Saturday and I paid more money.  They put it on sale on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I ordered a damn miracle that lets you read on a device that gets across the country and  out of nowhere.  And it took three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How dare they?  I ordered it Saturday the 2nd for delivery on Mother's Day the 10th.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wanted it on Mother's Day.  I understand.  All right, you win.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She got it a couple of days after Mother's Day.  She was very happy, right?  That's actually a really nice Kindle.  I love those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, hers, she was on the second generation Kindle with the keys and everything.  And she was telling me, she's like, it's not broken.  It's just, I have to charge the battery after like an hour.  And I was like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are moms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It works fine, honey.  Amazon took several.  I don't want to learn anything new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My mom's like that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She learns new things all the time.  She actually is an active.  Oh, yeah.  She watches the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But she refused to give up her iPhone 6.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mom, she was raised by depression-era parents.  That was her thing.  I think that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what our kids are going to say?  I was raised by COVID-era parents.  That's why I wash my hands 10 times a day and can still wear a mask.  Amazon said they hired 175,000 people.  Took several weeks.  Wow.  It's kind of amazing.  That is unbelievable.  Yeah, it's kind of amazing.  The scale that Amazon operates at.  So they say, according to Time magazine, it's back to normal or will be back to normal.  We were overwhelmed in April.  We were overwhelmed in April.  Many shoppers saw long delivery times and shifted their purchases to pick up curbside  options offered by Walmart and Target.  This is according to the chief executive of PriceSpider.  I tried, but Walmart and Target seem to have the same long, lengthy weights.  Still can't get disinfecting wipes anywhere.  Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, well, Amazon's not magic.  I don't know if they're going to be able to get you disinfecting wipes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm running low.  Amazon did announce a new $90 Amazon Fire tablet, the Fire HD8.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  32 gigs of storage.  The Fire 8 Plus has more RAM.  Six-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited.  That's $109.99.  They start shipping June 3rd.  Which means you should be able to get them in time for Mother's Day next year.  Or Father's Day.  Or Father's Day.  Actually, that's right.  That's right.  I think, though, an Oasis is better for reading than a Kindle because it's paper-wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Father's Day is the 21st.  Y'all have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got time.  You got time.  Order now.  Amazon, one of the big winners in streaming, by the way.  Number one is Netflix, clearly.  Then Amazon, an average household minutes for the month.  This is according to Seven Park, which tracks this stuff.  Beating Disney and other big media companies.  Is it the fact?  Is it the shows?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's everybody who has Prime automatically gets it.  If you haven't looked at it when you're in quarantine, you're like, I'll look at it.  I'll watch.  I've been watching.  Oh, I had that.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been watching.  We started the Lindbergh show based on the Philip Roth novel.  That's...  Is it scary?  It's not scary.  It's just that it's an alternate history in which Lindbergh beat Roosevelt to become president in 1940.  It could happen here.  Yeah.  It's a little maybe too close to home.  And then, yeah, America first, right?  That was Lindbergh's slogan.  That's pretty good.  Bosch is pretty good.  I don't know.  Upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just started that.  Isn't upload interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did we discuss on Netflix?  Did you do Babylon Berlin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Babylon Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and I started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trying to watch the new season.  It's hard.  I don't know why, but I need lighter fare for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What we do in the shadows.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good.  Yeah.  You know what?  Season two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It tees me off.  What?  Well, so the good news was it was tearing a lollipop out of my mouth.  Good news was I never saw Hamilton.  I didn't go to see Hamilton.  I'm so excited.  So wait, wait, wait.  I'm going to be mad first.  Then you happy?  Then we met.  Good news is they moved up the movie version of the stage play.  A year and a half.  The bad news is Disney plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can spend 10 bucks and get Disney plus.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't even complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You also get to subscribe and then you're going to remember to cancel.  I don't want Disney plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll make a UHD DVD or something of it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, then you can just wait.  Don't complain that Disney put their money show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with Stacey on this one because it was not going to be until October 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  But the problem was it was whiplash.  I got all happy and then I got all pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get the free trial.  I'm a Verizon subscriber.  I get it free for a year.  I'm thrilled.  I haven't watched anything on Disney plus,  but I will be watching that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  That's exciting.  That is such an inconsequential thing to be mad about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't tell me what to be mad about.  I'm going to be mad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, that's like they're giving us free cake.  And you're like, but it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Marie Antoinette, how well would that work out?  Speaking of revolutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to have to fight someone on the chat who said Thor Ragnarok was not the best  of the Thor franchise, but I'm not going to fight them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that the one directed by what's his name?  Taka.  Tyco.  Taka.  He's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also does what we do in the shadows.  I'm just going to throw that out there.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  I love Jojo Rabbit.  I thought that was incredible.  I did not see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's an amazing movie, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just amazing.  Yeah.  I can understand people would be reluctant to watch it because it's about a young boy  growing up in Hitler's Germany whose imaginary friend is Adolf.  So and he's Jewish.  No, no, he has Jewish friends.  It's a little the premise is a little.  It's it's it's really weird, but it's so well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really cute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, cute may not be the exact right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  What we do in the shadows season two is that and people seem to really be loving it.  I watched a little bit of season one.  I went, okay, I get it.  I wasn't that excited about it, but you say season two is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, okay.  So I thought season one was funny, but it is a certain type of humor.  So you do have to put like episode four of season two has this whole thing where  he gets he checks his email and it's been like a certain number of years, like a lot.  And he gets a chain letter curse thing and they all think they're cursed.  And it is so funny.  I just like it's it's just fantastic.  Can you pick up season two or do you have to watch season one?  Oh, no.  But season one was really hilarious.  It's very low stakes, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do realize I do need some funnier, lighter fare because I've every like  the plot against America is, you know, like, oh, yeah, that's not.  Yeah.  Oh, no, that's hey, Uber, Uber was trying to buy Grubhub Grubhub stock through the roof.  They actually had to halt trading yesterday.  This has been going on for a year.  They can't agree on a price.  Grubhub wants to be sold, but they want to be sold for more than Uber is willing to pay.  Shares of Grubhub were up 38% yesterday before trading was halted at one o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That feels like an antitrust thing waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Uber owns Uber Eats, right, which is the same business as Grubhub.  But there are others.  There are many others, aren't there?  In most markets, don't you have DoorDash and Postmates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Postmates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A brand that never made sense to me.  Postmates?  Yeah.  What does that name sound like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like it's something you get in the mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Postmates is actually it's not just food.  Isn't it like anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you get cigarettes.  But even then, ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, maybe not anything, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's like Cosmo.  Cosmo.  I was just going to say, what was the name of that bicycle service in New York City  where they brought you cigarettes and ice cream?  Cosmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was a partner in a startup years ago called Daylife,  which was basically Google News as an API.  But the brand sounded like a day spa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Daylife.  Welcome to Daylife, where the music is low, the lights are calm,  and our lovely ladies will bring you...  No, never mind.  No, that's the wrong kind of spa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also said today, Jeff's Zoom Room sounds like a bad strip club from the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no champagne in Jeff's Zoom Room.  So what about Apple News?  Is it apparently, and some publishers are confused about this,  they're trying to get the rights to do audio versions of all the stuff on Apple News+.  What do you think about that, Jeff?  Why would a publisher not like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they don't like Apple News a lot in the deal that it has,  but they love the huge traffic it sends.  Right.  And if they make a little more money and they get more audience, not a bad thing.  It's an interesting thing that, you know,  is this mean that audio, they're betting on the future of audio?  I think everybody is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think everyone is.  Look at Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They spent half a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On podcasting.  Podcasts.  And, you know, just these platforms are everywhere.  When you think about wireless headphones,  and I said this with Apple's when they came out a long time ago,  having something like this always in your ear makes content accessible in a way.  It's kind of like the quibi of news, right?  Except it works.  Except it works and you might want to listen to it.  I will say, just speaking of audio, because you guys are audiobook fans,  did you see the story in the New York Times about the number one audiobook narrator?  Jeff, I thought it was cool for you because it talked about,  and I'm going to try to find the name,  the story actually had him reading parts of the story.  You mean Eduardo Ballarini?  Thank you. Eduardo Ballarini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The voice of God and Canalscard, Wittman and Machiavelli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scroll down a little bit because this was, I just thought, super fun.  There you go.  Should I play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need my audio?  Crash from the front of the bar.  Let me play it again because they didn't have my audio up.  Suddenly I heard a loud crash from the front of the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Appears we've stumbled into some kind of class joint here.  I don't think I've ever heard any of his books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so I just thought it was both an interesting thing,  just talking about this class of celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there are. I mean, you must, you listen to audio books?  No, because I read so quickly.  I love audio books and there are definitely narrators that you go,  oh, you actually choose a book because of the narrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I reject them. I go berserko. You're going to be mad at me if we get mad again, Stacey.  But if you have a World War II book and they don't know how to pronounce German,  I just can't take it. I just can't.  You got me into Audible, Leo.  Oh, good.  I knew it was there, but you really got me excited about it.  And the other thing I love about Audible is the fact you can return a book with no problem.  Yeah, they're very good about that.  You can even-  I'll give it 15 minutes. If I'm not going to like it, it's no risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And actually when Daniel Suarez came in, he's been in several times,  were big fans of his books. And I think one of the early interviews,  he brought the guy who reads his books, Jeff Gerner, with him.  And it was so awesome because it was really a dual interview. I'm interviewing  Daniel, who I love. He's become a good friend.  And then we turned to Jeff and he reads and when you hear it, it's like, yes, that's it.  That's the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, in this article, they had some author do a book talk.  But then he had this guy there to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To read it because that's the voice.  And it is such hard work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've done it. It's very difficult.  Randomly hard work. Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially when you talk like I do and half of it's a mush mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I speed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do not know that I would have you read my books, Jeff, unless they were angry books.  If they were angry books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you like me to read your book?  Actually, your book, they'd have a female narrator.  They're pretty good about getting the narrator to match the sex, the gender of the author.  Or the voice in the novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was about to say, what if I wrote a book and the point of view was a man?  Then it would be a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then it would be a man.  So they always want the reader to be, if it's a first person book, always it'll match the gender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's distressing. That limits my choice of audiobooks.  If I wanted to read audiobooks to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could. You have such a good voice.  You have a good voice.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really wanted to do that sort of thing for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you still could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now.  Even from the comfort of your home.  I did read for The Blind. There was a charity for reading for The Blind for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to be on the board of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my great aunt was too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to have to listen to some of Ballerini's reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are some of the other books he's done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did the six volume.  Carl Ove now scards My Struggle.  That's a struggle.  Yeah, I missed that one.  135 hour monologue took him more than 200 hours over the course of five years to record.  You'd have to really like a book.  Stuck. Wow.  I'm listening to a war and peace that is not great, but it's interesting.  In fact, let me play it.  I think I can play it if I log into my Audible account.  That's one of the nice things Audible does now is you can play back from the web page as well.  But it's an old it's it.  This is the old style of audiobooks.  Some more.  Ballerini is more of the new style, which I think is good.  He's more he's more bringing it to life.  This guy.  Let me see if I can find it.  This guy is like like a 1940s actor.  His name is Frederick Davison.  Here, I'll play a little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can hear it's on the contrary, brimming over with excitement and impulsiveness.  To be enthusiastic had become her pose in society.  Oh, the time is even when she had indeed no inclination.  I don't know if I can do 61 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have constipation.  Yeah, I know.  That's audio constipation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does the female voices really well, which is hard for a male narrator to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was enthusiastic so as not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her.  The affected smile which played continually about.  Speaking of perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be.  I feel like he should be reading Pride and Prejudice more than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did we play some time ago the Stephen Fry about Harry Potter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did.  It's the Harry Potter books in the UK.  We got so Jim Dale in the US.  Exactly.  Jim Dale does more of the characters, which I think is wonderful.  But gosh, I think Stephen Fry is magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just put it in the chat.  It's hilarious.  If you want to take two minutes, it's hilarious.  Let me see if I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's on Facebook.  Oh, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's fine.  Let me click it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I can now actually visit Facebook legitimately having an account and all.  Stephen Fry on a Harry Potter pronunciation pickle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nineties.  My agent called me up and said there's a children's story.  Would you do an audiobook of it?  It was called Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Unless you're American where the word philosopher would terrify you.  And it's called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in America.  I read it and I thought it was rather good.  It was about this boy who turns out he's some sort of wizard.  And he goes to school and he's taught all these spells.  I thought this is good.  So I went along and I met the author who introduced me as Joanne Rowling.  And I met her and she was really nice.  We shook hands.  And I started reading it and it was good fun.  And then on the second day, second half day when I finished,  I said to her, do you know what?  I think this is pretty good.  I think it's going to do well.  She said, well, actually, I've already finished a second one.  And I said, good for you.  The way she tells it, I'm a lot more patronising than I like to remember.  But by the third one, this had become something of a phenomenon, as you can imagine.  And by the fourth, it was insane.  The second one was the Chamber of Secrets.  The third one was the Prisoner of Azkaban.  But I remember in that book, and this is the thing about reading,  when you read a book for recording,  I can usually go fairly well without making too many mistakes.  Some actors are slower and some are quicker, but I try not to.  Yeah, thank you.  I'm not saying this to show off, because actually, I come out of this very badly.  But there was one phrase, and this is what happens, that tripped me up.  It was just three words.  It's ridiculous.  Three words.  And I couldn't say it.  And the three words were Harry pocketed it.  I still can't say it.  Harry pocketed it.  I can say Harry and I can say pocketed and I can say it,  but I can't say Harry pocketed it.  And so we were doing it.  I was going Harry pocketed it.  And Joe Rowling wasn't in the studio, because this was the third book, I think.  The Azkaban book.  And there were the Dementors and everything.  And everyone started laughing, and the engineer in the studio.  I said, look, I said, can we come back to Harry pocketed it?  At the end of the day, maybe.  I'll just try it.  So at lunchtime, I call up Joe Rowling.  And I say, Joe, now she had very, I think, wisely,  from the beginning, even when it was just one book,  she had wanted the audiobook to be complete, unabridged,  not condensed in any way as sometimes audiobooks are.  Because she felt that if children were reading it and listening at the same time,  they would be annoyed if it was different.  So it was very important that we got it exactly right.  So I called her up and said, look, do you mind?  I can't say Harry pocketed it.  Would it be OK if I said Harry put it in his pocket?  And there was a big pause in the line.  Then she said, no.  In her best, which his voice.  And I could just hear the smile in her voice when she said it.  So I managed to get it out.  But this is a mark of the woman.  The phrase Harry pocketed it appears in every subsequent book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She kept writing it in because she knew Stephen will have to read each.  I love that.  One I was very fortunate because in the early days in the second book,  she was still touring.  And she did a book reading in Sonoma County up here in Santa Rosa.  I took my daughter was only about seven or eight at the time.  I said, remember this because she's going to be very famous  and you're going to have seen her.  We got her autograph.  And she said the one question she gets all the time is,  how do you pronounce Hermi one?  It's Hermione.  Americans apparently don't know how to pronounce her me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that is not an American name.  Not in her.  For sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To this day, when I see the word epitome, I think epitome.  Epitome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too.  There is somebody on Twitter.  He's a grammarian who goes around correcting stuff.  He tweeted at me.  It's popular.  There's a way to make friends.  Is this dryer?  No, no, no, no.  I wish it were dryer for a dryer.  What about as for an autograph?  Yeah, he said, Leo, it's epithet, not epithet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Epithet.  All right.  I do say epithet for some reason.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the German word.  Like bubba fet.  Have Lovener's face out of keeping as it was with her faded looks,  expressed as spoiled child's continual consciousness of a charm.  61 hours of that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  That one's going to be returned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  What else?  Let's take a little break.  We come back.  We can do the change.  Like, how about that?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody didn't feel like it last week.  You weren't up to it.  You just didn't have the mojo this week.  You got it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This change log sucks too.  So, but it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to sell it.  It might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a teaser for you now because it's going to be terrible.  We're going to do the change like in just a second.  But they're trying.  They're trying to help me be the best I can be.  Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Worldwide Technology.  You know I'm a huge fan of Worldwide Technology.  We actually was the last.  It'll always have a soft spot in my heart because it was the last  trip we took before all this happened.  Early March, Lisa and I went out to St. Louis to visit their Advanced Technology Center.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was so impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Worldwide Technology is a vendor of enterprise technology, a consultant.  They help people.  They do software.  It's one of the top technology solution providers in the world.  They deliver business and technology outcomes to big companies, private enterprises, public  organizations all over the globe.  Their business really is digital transformation.  And we're in the midst of that for business worldwide right now.  It is phenomenal what's going on as people move to the cloud.  One of the ways they support organizations with this transformation is helping them adopt  a multi-cloud architecture.  That can be challenging, but there are disadvantages as well as advantages.  But they know them all.  They've been there.  They've done that.  And they can help you make that transition.  And they stay with you every step of the way from the vision and strategy to enablement,  migration to cloud optimization and management and everything in between.  They have great cloud consultants.  They'll sit down with you.  And this is one of the things that is the hallmark of worldwide technology.  They will, before they do anything, they will really get to know what your vision is,  what your long-term strategy is, because they know that those investments in enterprise  technology, especially cloud, only pay off when they're aligned to your business goals.  So that's the very first thing.  They're going to do.  And then through briefing and workshops, that's the other thing.  They give back.  They pass out knowledge all the time.  WWT has all of these ways that organizations can unravel the complexities of the cloud,  unlock business opportunities.  We did an event with them in St. Louis in March.  I hope to do many more over the next few years.  They are experts in cloud migrations and application development.  They have an amazing app development team.  They can create a secure landing zone in any cloud for your organization, for your business.  And that advanced technology center is amazing with on-demand labs that can give you access  to tools so you can try stuff.  You can pilot stuff.  You can see if it works, if it makes sense for you.  Things like microservices, cloud-native development.  Once you're up in the cloud, WWT helps with management and optimization,  because it's a continuum.  You don't just put it up there and set it and forget it.  Being in the cloud requires constant attention to detail, but they're there to work with you on  that.  Whether your strategy calls for cloud-native, hybrid cloud, or even on-prem resources,  because that's what they've done for years, WWT works closely with Intel to optimize for  the latest cloud smart solutions based on Intel technology for security, for performance,  and of course for agility.  And they also feature Intel's Optane Persistent Memory and other Intel technologies.  Workload optimized to deliver affordable, large capacity and data persistence for solutions  supporting everything from VDI to data analytics.  WWT.  Don't just talk the talk.  Walk the walk with worldwide technology.  Find out more at www.wwt.com slash twit.  And don't forget, if you create a myWWT account, you'll be able to access all sorts of resources  at their advanced technology center, ecosystem papers, white papers, labs.  You can even do your own on-demand labs from anywhere in the world.  You don't even have to go to St. Louis.  WWT.com slash twit.  Their time is now for WWT.  Worldwide technology delivering business and technology outcomes throughout the world.  We're so happy to be partnered with them.  And the minute we can go back to St. Louis, we're going to do it because that was a fantastic trip.  Really appreciate their support.  All right.  Now, Jeff, are you ready?  On-prem?  Play.  On-prem?  You've never heard on-prem?  I've never heard of on-prem.  You don't talk the talk, man.  On-premises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It means your servers live in your data center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could have them on-premises or you could have them up there in the cloud.  I figured it out.  I just never heard.  Oh, yeah.  I talked at an enterprise talk.  You're so cool.  I talked at an enterprise talk.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Google changelog.  The Google changelog.  Oh, it's the most exciting Google changelog since last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where he couldn't bear to do it.  He was so down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know how many people thought that I was gone?  There was a whole thread started up in the Twitter community.  Thank you.  We appreciate you, Leo.  They thought I was just going to get up, walk out the door and never come back.  You know what?  Here was my thinking there.  I think we all go there's ups and downs throughout this.  Yes.  We all go through this cycle.  Most on-air personalities, it's our job to project a positive upbeat persona.  We don't always feel that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the plastic vision of this.  But I'm a good actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can do that.  But I thought, you know what?  Maybe I'm feeling the pain.  I thought it would be good for you to see that we all are going through this.  That's all.  I still feel like crap.  Oh, fuck up, fella.  Oh, yeah.  I got a lot of those too.  Somebody in our Twitter community said, if you ever do that again, I'm never listening again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, that's a way to buck you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny.  There are people in the world, and I guess I understand this,  who think if they email you or tweet or say something like,  that's it, I can never listen to you ever again.  I'm going to go, oh, no.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  What can I do?  It's like, OK, fine.  No one's making you, and you shouldn't listen if you're not happy.  I certainly don't want anybody who doesn't enjoy the shows to listen.  That would be a mistake.  I don't listen to shows.  I don't read books that I don't like.  I don't listen to shows I don't like.  If I'm watching a TV show and I don't like it, I stop.  Don't suffer, please, on my behalf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're going to enjoy this change, look.  This is going to be particularly juicy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to cheer me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's true.  All right.  I'll tell you.  Guess which stories I'm excited about.  I'll find.  OK.  We'll make it into a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll raise my hand when I think it's a story you're excited in.  Google Lens Lookups now include inline search results.  We already did that one, didn't we?  Copy to computer text shortcut.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, here's a big one.  Alphabet's balloon powered loon internet comes to Mozambique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is your hand raised?  Yeah, I'm so excited.  Is this one for you?  No, my hand's not raised.  Is this one for you?  You excited?  Yes, I'm excited.  Loon in the world is very fun.  They've got a local carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are giant balloons that fly in the stratosphere to give you internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're bringing internet to Mozambique.  Although I don't know if Mozambique has it.  I wouldn't have guessed that one, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't have guessed that one.  Really?  You have a more exciting life than that.  It is fun to say Mozambique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't even know if I could put my finger on Mozambique on a map, to be honest with you.  If Mike Pompeo came to me and said,  you don't even know where Mozambique is on the map,  I might have to say you're right, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it next to Kenya?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's next to Kenya.  Very good.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If the map had no countries on it, though, I would have a hard time.  Or like no other names.  Okay, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe you're right.  It's in West Africa-ish.  By the way, this is not the first place Loon has deployed.  Puerto Rico?  Puerto Rico, that's right, after the hurricane.  Kenya, just next door, I hear.  I've been told next door to Mozambique is Kenya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I have to look up where Mozambique is just to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Peru, which of course is not next door to me.  Oh yeah, Mozambique is on the west coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is actually...  West Africa, yeah.  Kenya is not here.  It's next to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Malawi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Malawi, thank you.  Malawi.  So Peru, of course, mountainous, so very difficult in the Andes to provide internet service.  So I would guess...  And Puerto Rico, of course, flattened by hurricane  so and having power issues and infrastructure issues.  So these are places where a big balloon providing internet might be really a good idea.  I thought Google had kind of given up on Loon, so I'm glad to see it being...  See, this is why I thought it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I just have to tell people to the north of Mozambique is Tanzania.  Yeah.  And to the north of...  Tanzania is the city.  Back.  Oh, how is it?  Tanzania.  And north of Tanzania is Kenya.  Yeah.  It's Kenya.  North of Kenya is Somalia and Ethiopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually kind of central West Africa, not northwest Africa, Kenyan, Somalia.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there was a Facebook executive who was having hellacious internet connectivity  and asking people what to do.  And I stopped myself from saying it, but I said,  just have Mark put one of those platters up in the air over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aquila.  I think Facebook did give up on Aquila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it was so big nice to Google.  Maybe they'll put a Loon up over Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Meet now free.  We talked about that last week too.  We talked about that.  Yeah.  Oh, forever.  Yeah.  Well, not...  I mean, forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, moving on.  Let's do some things that are interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This post is from May 12th, so I don't know forever.  Google Duo has added group calls...  So we've talked about it forever.  Oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not for forever.  No.  Google...  No.  We can keep the story going long enough to really frustrate Stacey, you know.  And me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't forget me.  Google Duo adding group calls.  With up to 32 people.  I feel like we did this too.  They shouldn't call it Duo anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the word for 32?  I don't know.  You know, Apple had...  They had 32 people on FaceTime,  but they did this really awful thing where they would float the person talking.  You'd see all these bubbles of people and then they'd float the person talking forward.  It was so disturbing.  They just...  They stopped.  They stopped doing it because no one wants...  No!  Don't do it.  Google will kill...  This we found out, by the way, yesterday,  because we had the person in charge of YouTube music on.  Google is going to replace PlayMusic this year with YouTube music  and they will offer a migration tool  because many of us uploaded music to Google Play Music so that our library...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried to migrate and it said it wasn't my turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  I just started using YouTube music because you get it anyway.  And I like YouTube music, actually.  It's dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't cause a conniption fit by Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wasn't listening.  He was looking.  Google podcasts, by the way,  can import your PlayMusic podcast subscriptions as part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Google podcasts.  Wait, so you have to import...  You have to do a dual...  A split import.  You put your music onto YouTube and your podcasts onto Google Podcasts.  Yeah, that's annoying.  Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google...  Google...  Just use Spotify like every normal human.  Newman!  Newman!  Finally, this is actually the one I'm going to raise my hand on.  For a long time, I told people,  please don't use Google Authenticator.  Use Authy for your authentication tool  because Google Authenticator had a fatal flaw.  If you change phones,  you had to set up all of your two-factor all over again.  There was no way to export it out of Google Authenticator.  Thank goodness.  Now there is.  You can transfer accounts between devices.  So, this will eventually come to your phone.  But who's still using this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the first time that happens to you, you're like...  Never again.  Yeah.  Bleep, bleep.  Never again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Authy is great.  It's free.  It's from Twilio, which is a great company.  Stacey knows all about them.  You can ask her if you're not...  It is a great app.  ...if you're concerned.  And in fact, I talked to the guy.  He came to visit our studio a few months ago,  who does Authy.  So I said thank you,  because you offer a really great free Authenticator  that has this one feature, which is an account,  so that you can log into your Authy account anywhere,  and there's all of your authentication codes,  which is really nice.  Google Authenticator is going to do that too.  From version 5 to version 5.1.  Look for it.  Soon, Google's Nest cameras will be used to  monitor coronavirus patients at Mount Sinai.  Two cameras in each room.  This way, nurses can stay seated.  You would think they'd have cameras in the hospital rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You would think, but privacy...  One of the cool things is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can use the Nest camera to talk and listen,  because they have microphones and speakers.  So one of the cameras will be used to communicate with the patient.  The other one will be pointing at the screen,  where their vitals are showing,  which I think is really great.  And it'll be streamed to a console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to help actually a hospital system in some place.  Illinois, I feel like.  Figure out how to do this with Amazon Echoes.  It's actually quite a challenging problem.  To do at scale privacy.  Maybe think about doing it with Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because even though this is the first time Google's done it,  they said they plan to provide 10,000 Nest cams  that are specifically designed for this kind of monitoring  to hospitals around the country.  Raise your hand.  That's exciting.  Raise your hand.  I think easier to do that with a Nest.  I use the Nest cameras all around our house.  As I mentioned before,  replaced a ring with a hello camera doorbell,  but I also have Nest cameras around the outside.  I really think they do a good job.  I'm very happy with them.  The quality of the image is good,  and the notifications work well.  It's not cheap, because you have to buy a Nest subscription,  but that's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's changing too.  Is that on your list?  Is it? Tell me.  The Nest subscription changes?  Yeah.  Is that not in here?  No.  Oh.  Should be.  Google is changing their Nest Aware subscription plans.  So now, let me look this up.  Okay. Keep going, and I'll come back to me on this  when I have the exact information,  because I don't want to mess up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good. It seems fair.  It seems only fair that you should help,  since you're making me do the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so brutal.  Okay. Now I have it.  Here we go.  Goodness. So cranky.  All right. So what they're doing is they simplify their pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Nest Aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. $6 a month, or $60 for an annual subscription.  That gives you 30 days of event video history.  Oh, fantastic.  But that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's for everything.  For all the cameras, speakers, and displays.  And I have a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, if you only have one camera, this is not a bueno deal,  because you're going to be like, oh, suck.  It's going to be more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incentive to get more.  I have one, two, three, four, five.  Actually, one doesn't have a camera.  It's the mini hub.  But I have four with cameras.  So that's a good deal for me.  Six bucks a month.  That is, because I think it was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it $5 a month for-  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Each camera.  Oh, I forgot. I have two here.  Also on my subscription.  There's one right there.  SMBs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually think they have a 24-7 video history one  called Nestor Work Plus.  That is 60 days of video history and 10 days of 24-7 video.  And that's $12 a month.  And I would think if you were using it  in a camera purpose for a business,  that might actually be better for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's- We have one in each studio as a security camera.  But we also have real security cameras.  These are just mine.  So I can see if anybody's at work.  Because if somebody's here, I don't want to come in.  I only come in when everybody's gone home.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I must have to upgrade it because I was a little annoyed  because Amazon said they had delivered something  and they didn't.  And I went back.  I gave them five or six days, you know,  in case they made a mistake and it never came.  And then I went back and said, well, let me-  I can probably check the Nest camera  from that period of time and it had already erased it.  So I got to get the- 30 days should be enough, right?  That's plenty.  That is a lot.  That's a lot.  Google Play launches Change the Game Design.  It's a challenge for students.  This is kind of cool to submit ideas  for original mobile games.  Starting today, we're accepting applications  for our 2020 Change the Game Design Challenge.  And this is a good thing for kids who are, you know,  at home from school.  If you're between the ages of 13,  and 18, you can submit an idea for your original mobile game,  along with a statement on why you're passionate about gaming  or what changes you'd like to see in the gaming industry.  May 11th through July 31st,  they'll hold online workshops starting in June,  running through the end of the summer.  If you're selected for the workshop,  you'll be grouped with a few others  for a four-session crash course  on game development hosted by Girls Make Games.  So if you, you know,  I know there's a lot of 13-year-olds out there who say,  oh, I really want to learn how to do game design.  I'll get Michael to get involved in this.  One of Michael's friends keeps coming to me and say,  help me make a game, help me make a game.  This would be perfect.  This is Google Play's Change the Game Design Contest.  And it's at play.google.com.  You can submit your idea there.  It sounds, looks like they're focused on young women,  which is cool. Game changers.  I love this. Thank you, Google.  What a good idea. Yes, we can.  Google's 3D Animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you're right. This is a pretty dull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on. This is the best part.  30-plus augmented reality critters that can be on your phone.  It's a new zoo.  You can even have videos of these and other cool 3D objects on you.  Wouldn't you like a tiger in your tank or in your swimming pool?  Just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, hold on. There's got to be something better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kids can learn at home with Read Along by Google.  Kids, would you like to read?  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, dude, are you raising your hands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is exciting.  I'm going to beat it in a second.  I'm going to beat it. You keep going, but I'm going to beat this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is this? It's for kids five and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or kids that are trying to learn how to read, basically.  Right. It was first launched in India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it Bolo there, and it did so well.  They're now introducing it into 180 countries in nine languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is cool because what it's doing is it gives you, and this is not unusual.  A lot of reading apps, learn to read apps, let kids read along,  and it has little bouncing balls and things like that.  What's cool about this is Google's listening to your kid and ties it back  and says, oh, you said this word correctly or you didn't.  So people who go epitome, Google would say, no, it's epitome.  And you'd be like, thanks, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no. You know what?  That's what made me as erotic as I am.  Mrs. Thompson's class in third grade, we had to sit and we had to read out loud in circles.  If you made the slightest little error, little Steve, that brat, Mrs. Thompson,  I believe Jeffrey made a mistake.  Oh, I hate that kid.  Made me scared to read out loud for years and years.  You know what would make you feel better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find out what Steve's doing today.  Steven Gravat.  Yeah, go find out.  He's probably going to find out.  He's probably that grammar guy who corrected me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm going to beat that, Stacey.  I'm going to make you happy.  I'm not done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to say you can do this without signing in and no data is sent to Google's servers.  The voice data is analyzed in real time on the device.  So if you're concerned about privacy, so is Google.  This is a really good idea.  Look for it in the Play Store.  It's called Read Along.  Of course, you have to have an Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think that's a concern about privacy thing.  I think that's a children's DCM.  Yeah.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CCDBDBDBDB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I put something to beat this in the chat.  Okay.  I'm not done yet.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With that story, it's a beat that story.  It ties in with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To that story.  Okay.  Yes.  So I will do this one.  I'm going to make her more excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kids are reading to therapy dogs on Zoom.  They can't pet the pooches, but the sessions book up fast.  You want to watch?  This beats Steven Gravat.  Yeah.  But I bet Steven would say, you can't even dog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you shouldn't be yawning when I'm reading to you.  Oh, children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you can't have it.  Isn't that nice?  See?  Isn't that nice?  That is nice.  Who's doing this?  This is a really good idea.  It is a good idea.  This is part of the PAL program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They used to do that.  I mean, they do this in person beforehand.  I know that your dog can go to the library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My daughter used to read to the cat.  Do dogs like to be read to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they like it when you talk to them.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My daughter used to read to the cat and it was just the sweetest thing.  And that's for years she did.  Cat loved it.  My daughter loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So go to peopleanimalslove.org, which is PAL.  And you can, if you have kids who want to read to the dog,  hey kids, now you can respond to a PAL dog from home.  They do this as you're absolutely right.  They do this in person normally, but now they're doing it on Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can show my dog and have people read to my dog.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's kind of cute.  No, but you're going to correct them.  You're going to say, no, it's epitome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mommy, is that dog dead?  Mommy, I think the dog died.  Mommy?  Mommy?  Does the dog?  She's just like...  Nothing, nothing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's just like, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God, I don't even want to do the rest of these.  That's the Google changelog.  You can't get better than ending with people reading to dogs.  That's perfect.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, there I gave you your route.  It has nothing to do with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a drummer.  We got it.  I know.  It's not Jeffrey's fault.  There's something, there's some sluggishness in the Tricaster.  They got some goop in the veins and it's just moving very slowly.  It's not Jeff.  Normally we would do a restart, but we'll do that after the show.  This I think looks like something that perhaps Jeff Jarvis added to the  Mick's excellent Ben Evans piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this your...?  Ben's really good.  Yeah, that's fine.  Talking about rolling collapses, so he starts with rim and says, you know, rim...  You mean the Blackberry guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not dead yet.  The competition came along and they didn't die right away.  It took time, but they did die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they have an IoT software platform for cars.  And it's actually in a lot of things and they now have an IoT security platform.  But the phone part...  Go on, tell me more how...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he calls it the Wiley Coyote effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the edge, then it falls off.  He shows searches for BBM for iPhone, BBM for Android and how it went.  So he's talking...  He just uses this as the way to talk about waves of disruption and how with COVID,  things like e-commerce, he starts with newspapers.  He looks at...  US is massively over-stored.  We have 24 square feet per capita for retail in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And see, the problem with the Wiley Coyote thing is that thanks to COVID,  you've got all these cliffs that all of these businesses are running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what he's saying.  This is going to push them.  So it was an interesting post for folks who care about this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine indoor malls surviving this.  Can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because there were dead beasts anyway.  Department stores were unnecessary anyway.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  US pay TV subs are down 20% and falling.  Cable companies suffering big time.  As Netflix, which is the gray bar, goes up, Comcast and the others go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For all my newspaper people who scream about how Google stole our money,  more than two-thirds of Google and Facebook ad spend is from advertisers  that were never in traditional advertising at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the big story thanks to Australia.  And a real debate going on right now because of course,  and we talked about this a little bit last week,  Australian regulators look like they're about to make Google start paying  for the snippets that they include in Google News and Google Search.  And a lot of people are saying bravo because it's all Google's fault that journalism  and I knew that you would be grurring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I did it a lot.  So Ben Smith, the former editor of BuzzFeed News,  now the David Carr or would be David Carr of the New York Times,  wrote a column which was pure Murdoch company line  in favor of that Australian stuff.  Right.  And I went through a Twitter typhoon there about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  A Twitter typhoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just a storm.  It was a typhoon.  What is doom scrolling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So doom scrolling, I found this, it's kind of cool.  So people are complaining that, oh my God, we're all just doom scrolling.  We're going through all this news about COVID now and it's driving us nuts.  And we're awful.  Well, of course, when these things happen, just like any good one.  Looking for information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to know what it means.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So during World War I, there was much complaint that people were,  had too much thirst for war news.  Right.  In the Saturday Review in 1915, talked about the part that newspapers played  the first two years of the war with cruel, ignorance for news.  I'm sorry, cruel eagerness for news.  Tortured everybody.  When even the poor spent their pence recklessly,  as if pennies and half pence were coined in every household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As if newspaper reading had a tendency to throw some people off their balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was a cool little piece.  And so I went from that, I went, I went to doom clicking  and then found great stuff about, about how books of course were presumed to be terrible,  especially for you women, Stacey.  They're going to cause vapors, romances were very bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  The novels, we were novels were terrible for.  Novels.  Well, actually, no women were only supposed to read smart novel or like novels as opposed to like  policy papers and things for men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were magazines for women early on in the history of magazines.  Yes, there are now, but they're early on in the history.  It was the first kind of publishing that was directed at women.  So that was that doom scrolling.  I thought you'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're all doing it.  It's not that it's bad to look for that information.  It just can make you nuts.  Right.  You get over.  Well, as the world, the world itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel about everything coming out of the White House in this administration,  all their press releases.  I'm like, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of hard not to watch the press conferences.  It was so funny yesterday.  That's kind of hard not to watch.  And by the way, I know you're going to send me emails saying I'm never listening to the show  again if you bash our fine president.  How can anybody at this point be thinking?  I have to think you're a Russian bot at this point.  If you think that this is that that eighty thousand people dead is in some way a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's still be it's China's fault.  Oh, it's all.  Yeah.  China, the Kung flu.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's not talk about politics.  No, no, no, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not because I want to talk about podcasting.  Luminary has now raised another 30 million.  Who would give these guys more money?  They've raised 30 million dollars not trying to build their business, just trying to  shore it up as it collapses.  They have now raised their 160 million dollars to do this podcast network.  Former HBO executive Richard Peppler, who's quite famous.  I mean, he's you know, he put HBO on the map.  Also, the NEA and Sinai Ventures.  Raised 130 million dollars.  They want to call it.  They wanted it to be the Netflix of podcasts.  That was the elevator pitch right there.  That's all you had to say.  Oh, it's the Netflix of podcast.  Here's 130 million dollars.  Didn't know only 80,000 people who tried the app have still pay are still paying.  They're losing money hand over fist.  So they've raised another 30 million, but it's not because they're doing great.  It's because they're doing terribly.  They're burning four million a month before the coronavirus outbreak  while generating less than half a million in monthly revenue.  We make more money than they did.  I mean, our revenue was higher than theirs was, but I didn't lose four million dollars a month.  I actually made money at it, but that's.  And you never took any money.  Yeah.  Thank God I didn't take any money.  So listening is still growing, according to Bloomberg.  The decline is beginning to level off.  And you asked me before the show, I don't know what our numbers are.  I don't.  I'm not paying attention to that.  I'll tell you, that's not really in all likelihood.  I wasn't curious about the numbers so much as trends.  That's not really the issue so much as listening numbers.  I'm sure they're going up, but it's advertisers because we're headed into a great depression.  And I don't blame advertisers.  They're very skittish and they're reluctant to spend money.  Even if they have a product like Zoom that's doing really, really well,  they don't need to advertise.  I don't think they're buying any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll go to a number I have.  Rasmus Kleist Nielsen at Oxford's Reuters Center for the Study of Journalism,  or news journalism, I think it is, said that he predicts the print circulation revenue  will be down 10 percent, print ad revenue down 30 percent,  digital circulation revenue up 20 percent.  But digital ad revenue down 20 percent.  Working from that, he figures a decline of 24 billion dollars.  That's the same as the decline from 2013 to 2019 in one year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So audiences going up, revenue going down because...  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the advertisers are...  The advertisers are having it.  What do they have to sell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what we're trying to do is there's plenty of companies that are booming on all this.  And we're trying to focus on them.  I mean, the companies like Zoom and Netflix don't need to advertise.  They're doing just fine.  So you're trying to find smaller companies that, you know,  maybe see this as an opportunity.  Work from home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the great opportunity, the thing you've always done in this network is to change habits.  I never thought of buying a razor through the mail.  Oh, OK, I'll do that.  Right.  I never thought of buying a mattress through the mail.  Now I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, here's the way.  But you got to figure these companies are going,  but are we going to have...  What's our business going to do?  And I think many businesses are declining.  I don't know.  But I just...  And there's just uncertainties, the worst possible thing.  Their business may be going up, but they're uncertain.  So that's the problem.  And I don't think it's only Luminary's fault.  I think it's a tough time.  Actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, have a little shot in Freida.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Katzenberg says, you know, Quibi would have been a big hit if it were for COVID-19.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's one that's going to give you a heart attack.  France.  Oh, no.  And I love...  Just leave that there.  I love France.  France has decided that platforms will have one hour to remove pedophile or terrorism related  content or be face a fine of up to 4% of their global revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a GDPR number right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big number.  Companies like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat will have 24 hours to  remove manifestly illicit content.  But not manifestly illegal, manifestly illicit.  What's the difference?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One's prescribed by law and one is just social mores, right?  If you don't take this down, your ass is grass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's clearly illicit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do not smoke marijuana in France.  We drink wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's probably more like we don't let you sell or show off Hitler and Nazi paraphernalia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the one hour is for hate speech and pedophilia.  And Justice Minister Nicole Bellubé told Parliament,  people will think twice before crossing the red line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they know there is a high likelihood they will be held to account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, France, you made me do it.  You made me do it.  I read the entire, just the last three days, it took me three days to get through it,  the entire Areopagitica by Milton.  You did that because of France?  It was England.  It was when there was an effort to do licensing.  And Milton was arguing, don't insult us.  And I'll give you my favorite quote from it.  Give me the liberty to know, to utter and to argue freely according to conscience  above all liberties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's right in the Marine Le Pen's pocket because she's, of course,  the far right National Rally Party president,  said the law is a serious violation of the freedom of expression.  So it's, I don't know what's going to happen, but 4% of your global revenue  in an hour seems a little fast.  An hour is kind of ridiculous.  Wow.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think about the incentive to develop technology.  If it could be developed, that's a big incentive to get you to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know it can't work.  Look at China, where they have extremely expensive, extremely efficient censorship  mechanisms, and people find ways around by creating new languages.  Right.  It will always happen.  Always the case.  It's like trying to keep you from reading novels and having the vapors, Stacey.  It's always the history.  A new mechanism of speech comes and there's an effort to control it.  That's all that's happening now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  E-commerce sales like nobody's business.  It's like it's Black Friday.  US e-commerce sales jumped 49% last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't go to a store.  How are you going to get your sourdough or your bread knives?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from Adobe's Digital Economy Index.  Online grocery helped drive the increase in sales with a 110% boost in daily sales  between March and April.  Electronic sales up 58%.  This one you'll be both happy about.  Book sales have doubled.  Yay.  Yay.  What are you doing at home?  What are you doing?  You're reading.  You're reading more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you know what you're doing, Leo?  You're stocking your Zoom bookshelf behind you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet a lot of it is that.  I bet a lot of it is that.  There is a bookstore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a bookstore.  Book by the foot.  They're offering that as a service.  I think it's in Boston, Brattle Books, and they will curate the books to be behind you  to make you look good.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, I don't buy physical books because they're too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're just going to fail at Rate By Skype Room.  In fact, Stacey, you know.  This is not a great one.  I'm sorry, but you're about a four out of 10 right there.  Wait.  The predator is still on the scene.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Check out my picture.  Let's see.  It's not even hung.  They were hung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sitting on the file cabinet.

Transcript:  Wait till late two months.  Yeah, you're moving.  Look at that.  That's fair.  Loose.  Is it loose lips?  No.  Keep mum.  She's not so dumb.  It's feminist.  Oh, I like it.  And keep mum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not so dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's kind of cute.  So I just put in the chat so you can put it in the Brattle Book story.  That is good.  That is good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last week I had flowers too.  I like the keep mum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not so dumb.  That is pretty awesome.  By the way.  Why don't you hang it up?  I have to.  She will in the new place.  She's going to hang it.  By the way, I have to say Rate My Skype Room.  It's very first 10 out of 10.  Dr. William Hazeltein, infectious disease expert who not only has a full skeleton, but he's got a giant little  giant Saturn V rocket ship and it looks like some sort of Egyptian pyramid plus bones.  This is the best.  Highly polished.  By the way, I have that jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a Nehru jacket?  No, it's not Nehru.  That's a Bavarian jacket.  Is it okay to wear it, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Bavarian jacket.  Let your fleet flag fly.  10 out of 10.  Is that his house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's his office.  I don't know whether it's his house or not.  Crikey.  I'm very jealous.  He's brilliant.  Hazeltein is brilliant.  Clearly.  He discovered great things that save people's lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He discovered great things that you're at the test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I discovered some more.  He's not German.  He just wears the German jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's known for his groundbreaking work on HIV AIDS and the human genome.  Oh, good for him.  He was a professor at Harvard Medical School where he founded two research  departments on cancer and HIV AIDS.  Man, I love that room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also has the bookshelf but is carefully positioned it so you can't read it anyway.  So there's no status.  But what the hell is the giant rocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's a giant room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who doesn't want a Saturn V rocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His grandchildren like it, he said.  Oh, man, I like that rocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have seen one of the original ones at the big NASA facility at Houston.  Nice.  I have pictures of me next to it.  Are you just this little tiny person in a giant giant rocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, yes.  That's Stacey Higginbotham who is a giant in my mind.  She is the host of the IoT show with Kevin Toffle and does a great newsletter, Stacey on IoT,  at staceyoniot.com.  She's at Giga Stacey.  I am sorry, I got take ups.  I'm sorry.  She's never happened to me.  Wait, did we not do pics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you made him do the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's trying to get out of something.  He's tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now, ladies and gentlemen, she is going to give you her pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I unfortunately did not bring it upstairs.  But if you know, I can.  I'll go get the August.  It's the new August lock and it's smaller.  And I thought you guys might like to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, you could have just let it slide.  You could have just let me finish the show.  But no, you said, what about my pick?  And you don't even have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I was going to bring you all downstairs on my computer and show it to you.  Do that?  Yeah.  Oh, let's do it.  Now you're going to lose my good audio.  Karsten, is that going to be okay for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten somewhere in space.  We don't hear Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's crying in silence.  He's on the chat.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want to start while I go wander downstairs.  Jeff, why don't you give us another number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You already gave us one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was all happy that we were going to do this.  And now I got to do it.  Geez.  You already did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that kid's name that you hated?  Timothy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steven Gravat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably I get sued.  This can't be real.  What?  This number about the ants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, go ahead.  1.8 million people are pretending to be ants in a Facebook group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Does it make them happy?  I think it's cute.  It's kind of boring.  I signed on to it so I could see what it was.  It's very boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  That's our number of the week.  I have a pick for a change.  Well, should we watch Stacy Wander?  I'm there.  Oh my God.  There's the August lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the new August lock.  That's me manually doing it just because here I am.  It's actually much smaller.  I have mine at a higher level because of this wood trim.  It was a little difficult.  What you'll see, it's smaller because it has new batteries inside.  It's not for AAAs or AAs.  Are those hard to get?  They are.  You're going to have to keep those in your house.  I like the magnetic plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other one had that too.  And what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also subtle.  It doesn't look like anything.  It just looks like a knob.  Is that a sensor?  What is that on the face of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll light up in a second.  Oh, it's a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here we go.  Ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And does this work in conjunction with your existing?  Because you have a lock on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is more like a deadbolt turner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got it.  Do you have an existing?  Oh, look, it's going to do it.  The red eye is awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns green when it's unlocked.  That's nice.  What does it look like on the other side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it show on the other side?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what I was saying, it's a regular lock.  So on the other side, your key still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this would be, you would use this to open the door remotely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, it auto-unlocks with the Bluetooth in your phone.  So if you're walking up to your door.  Yeah.  They also, no.  They also have...  Oh, poor dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mom, you opened the door.  Come on, I want to go out.  Oh, can I read to her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can read to my dog.  She's not going to like it, but...  Yeah, I'm sitting here kneeling and she's like,  why are you so close to me and not petting me?  It also has an auto-lock.  So if you walk away from your door, it will lock.  And it locks also after a period of time if you have that setting.  I do not because I walk outside in the backyard a lot without my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was an existing deadbolt on there.  And because it's a rental, you'll be able to remove that  and restore it to its original state without any effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, let's show you how that works.  There's these little wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, neat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it goes right on top of where the knob would be,  where the bolt, the thing would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is a custom August plate,  but you just swap out this for the original plate.  Easy.  This is what actually turns your knob  and every door knob has a different shape right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not the shape of my knob, but it's okay.  I get the idea.  The principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you just pop this guy back on.  It's really easy to install.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's really just like a robot knob turner for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  That's exactly how you should think of it.  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's from August.  How much?  Thank you.  My pick of the week is something for Jeff Jarvis  because I know how he feels about profanity.  Finally, there is a font that won't print profanity.  Scunthorpe Sans.  It's a joke, but it really works because as some people know,  fonts aren't really just pictures of letters.  They're programs typefaces.  And this is a nice font called Aileron.  It's public domain.  It actually has some intelligence to combine letters into a single ligature,  which is a black mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, ligature is like F-I or F-L where it puts two letters into one.  But they can do it for U-C-K or H-I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's clever.  Isn't that good?  Clever.  And it's named after the town of Scunthorpe,  which for obvious reasons, it really wishes it had a different name.  But the good news is it doesn't actually block Scunthorpe  because as the authors of this font, vol.wtf say that town has suffered enough.  So you can literally use Scunthorpe Sans.  You download it.  That's pretty funny.  It just looks like any other font.  But go ahead and try to swear we should use this in our chat room.  And you won't be able to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that would be very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would just pull the Chinese kind of censorship thing and you just use different words.  You do exactly what Jeff tells you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our chatters are way too smart.  They wouldn't fool them for one second.  Hey, this was fun.  I feel so much better now after that great Google change log.  And the pics.  And really good pics.  Thank you guys.  Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.  Jeff pocketed it.  I can read that for the entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  That's the important part.  That's the important part.  Thank you, Jeff.  It's great to have you.  He blogs at buzzmachine.com.  And Stacey, I already mentioned Stacey on iot.com.  Together they make this show.  I'm just the meat in the Jeff and Stacey sandwich.  I'm the Vegemite in the Stacey.  Hey, don't forget, speaking of things that are coming up,  we have a wonderful event for you tomorrow.  A last pass event with Steve Gibson, Jerry Buchelt, who's the CISO at LogMeIn,  and my friend Andrew Keene, who is kind of a digital naysayer.  They're all great.  We're going to talk about the future of identity.  It's a special event for last pass.  Now, normally we'd be doing this at a venue or a theater,  but obviously we're not going to do that.  So we're going to stream it live to you starting 1 p.m. Thursday the 14th.  That's 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 20,000, 2,00, 2,00, 20 hours, UTC.  It's going to be a fun event, and we will be streaming that live.  There'll be an hour of conversation.  We'll also have a Twitter tag that you can use to ask questions.  We'll answer those questions also.  And if you can't make it at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern tomorrow,  please download it from the Twitter events feed.  It'll be up there shortly thereafter.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  I can't wait our second last pass event, not our last.  We do Twig this week in Google every Wednesday,  1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, 20, 30 UTC.  Want to watch us do it live?  Believe it or not, you can.  All you have to do is go to twit.tv slash live.  There's streaming audio and video there.  So you can even ask your Google or your Amazon voice assistant,  hey, play Twit live.  And in most cases, it'll actually just start the live stream.  There's always something going on in Twit.  If you're listening to the stream, you should probably be typing in the chat room,  which kind of follows along at irc.twit.tv.  And if you ever get a little lonely, there's somebody there 24-7,  because we have listeners all over the world in every time zone.  So nice people.  Jeff pocketed it.  Nice people at irc.twit.tv.
