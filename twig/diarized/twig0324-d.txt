Don't let that name fool you.  We cover whatever the heck we want to.  Because when you have Professor Jeff Jarvis, the star of the journalism school at the City University of New York,  if Jeff wants to talk about anything.  Hey Jeff, from Berlin.  Guten Abend.  Guten Abend. Is it late at night there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is 9.45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh. So it's your bedtime, but not that.  It's bedtime. It's bedtime.  And that's Matthew Ingram from Ottawa.  He writes for Fortune.com. Toronto, whatever.  Same thing.  North of the 49th parallel. I don't know what the hell it is.  It's all the same up there. No, of course I know the difference.  Toronto. I don't know why I thought you were in Ottawa for some reason.  Because I'm close to Ottawa.  Okay. That's where your lake is.  And that's where the new Prime Minister will be soon.  Is he already seated? Is there a lag between election and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a whole ceremony with virgins and stuff.  The coronation.  I don't think that's actually taking place.  Stone of Spoon.  He's the number one reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big reaction seems to be how good looking he is.  Everyone's like, wow. It's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well they've been staring at Stephen Harper for 10 years now.  Yeah, exactly.  Who looks just like me, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The funny thing was his father wasn't actually that good looking,  but his wife was so beautiful that it kind of brought him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pierre was dashing.  He may not have been good looking, but he was dashing.  Right.  He had a lot of charisma.  So you're about my age, Matthew.  So you were an adult when Pierre Trudeau was the Prime Minister, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was a sort of...  Young adult.  Yeah.  I definitely remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he must have been exciting at that time.  He was a very jazzy Prime Minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the only thing was I lived out west at the time, and so the west hated Trudeau.  Oh yeah.  With a deep and abiding...  Well I didn't know you lived west.  Oh, in fact, who do you mean west?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Alberta.  You never lived in the cow country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  You lived in Alberta?  Yeah, Edmonton.  Wow.  And Winnipeg, although no one really cares about that.  But oil was a big deal and sort of...  And that's why Harper was Prime Minister for 10 years, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The asserted power of the west, although all the population is on the east coast and they've  just reasserted their power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and if you look at who voted, if you look at a map of who voted for the liberals,  it's Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, and BC.  And in between, it's just this vast area that did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, Matthew?  I loved looking at the colored map because by size, it looks like one tiny bit of the  northwest territories is bigger than all of Canada in voting power.  It's huge red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But nobody lives there.  So Jeff, what are you doing in Berlin?  I know this is part of your... you're on some amazing global tour.  This international goodwill tour.  Apparently, the treatments have decided to cut him off.  He must be in East Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before he even got started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They realized it's about Google, so they shut the show down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shut it down!  It's a show about Google!  No more Google.  Shut it down.  There he goes.  You were about to explain us something, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm at the European Broadcasters Union News Exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did I do it again?  No.  I'm frozen now.  They just trade news with each other?  What's that all about?  It sounds like maybe a news service, like a cooperative news service kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's all the state broadcasters get together and talk about how important they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Should be fun.  Sounds like fun.  And then from there, you go where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lagos, Johannesburg.  Why?  Lagos for a bank, Johannesburg for African business meeting in Miami, for a Latin thing,  and then back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you try to tie all this stuff together so that it's all one big trip or this was just bad luck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it just happens that way.  Everybody wants to hear from you.  I want to keep my United Global Services status next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I went to YouTube this morning just to see what I could see and look low and behold,  because I subscribe to YouTube, to Google All Access, used to be called All Access, now it's just Google Music,  I've got YouTube Red.  And it's true, if I just play anything, it's kind of hard to believe.  The videos just start.  There's no pre-roll.  There's no banners.  It's the strangest experience I've ever had of YouTube.  You just don't expect this.  It's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how long you have to watch one of those videos to get a share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's an interesting thing because I'm just playing one second of each.  So this is the $10 a month service.  I can't imagine any, I don't know, maybe a chat room, you let me know.  Is there anybody in the chat room paying $10 a month to get ad-free YouTube?  I think not.  And YouTube really sold this all wrong because that's what they sold.  But really what they should say is if you pay for Google Music, you will also get ad-free YouTube.  That is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When they first announced it, I thought, well, why would anybody pay $9.99 just to get rid of ads on some stuff?  And someone said, yeah, but you get Google Play Music for free.  It's like, OK, that actually makes sense.  Yeah, those two.  That's a pretty good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, we were a little worried because ad-free kind of to me implied maybe none of our ads either.  But they don't mind your ads, right?  They don't apparently care.  They don't care.  No, it's pre-roll.  It's Google supplied.  Pre-roll and the banners and all of that stuff.  So I'm thrilled.  I mean, this is a great experience.  Now, see, notice I'm seeing promotional stuff like Order Lindsay's new book is up there still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're actually going to get another music service as well.  You know that too, right?  No.  So, yeah, so you're going to so soon there's going to be something called YouTube Music.  So you'll get that for free as well.  Well, so I tried to figure this out when I was writing about it.  So you get Google Play Music and you get YouTube with no ads.  And then you'll get something called YouTube Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, because now when I when I subscribe to Google without video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, no, without video, really wouldn't be YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, somebody's saying if you use YouTube as a way to listen to music, then this will be that except without ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  I think I did get something when I got Google Play Music that was ad free video, like maybe it was Vivo's or something ad free music.  Yeah, it could be.  Could be Vivo.  And then you could do a playlist.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is Vivo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is Vivo?  And then you also can download, which is I don't know.  Let me actually look at this because I I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can download for offline and you can also you can play in the background.  Yeah.  So you can keep it playing while you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Couldn't I always do that?  Is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't think so.  Oh, at least they said that was.  Yeah, no, they mentioned this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can play in the background.  You could definitely do that, but I'm not sure about offline.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, but they did sell this as background play, but I'm not.  And somebody said in the chat room, oh, I'm loving the background play.  I don't really know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the background play for the last year.  Feels like that's something that's always done.  Yeah.  So I don't.  It's so confusing.  Or maybe not full year, but definitely had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they promoted that as one of the things you could.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, the download, I'm still not sure how to download here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do offline on the website itself or if that's  going to be too mobile when you have access to the music.  Not quite sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your stats for nerds.  I never saw this one before.  I think it's stats over over Adele's music.  So copy video URL, copy video URL, current time, copy of bed code report.  No, that's not the download there.  I don't see anything here.  Maybe in settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you try searching Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you do that?  How does that work?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What would I search for?  How to download music from YouTube?  No, that's going to give me all the things like tube sock, all the third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's mobile only.  Oh, maybe it's on the mobile.  That's what I'm wondering.  Maybe it's mobile only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also on the mobile app, from what I understand, have the ability to choose to only stream  audio and leave the video behind if you want to save your bandwidth.  Like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do like that.  That's what you were saying, Jeff, but I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So incidentally, the I mean, maybe we're going to get into this, but the things like downloading  music offline is part of the reason why, as far as I understand it, ESPN's videos have  all disappeared and all his channels have gone dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a rights issue with the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because in some cases, they don't have the right to a specific game or event or offline  or download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can stream, but not download.  That would make sense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  And yeah, they don't seem to have in any way deprecated or hidden our stuff.  So I'm very relieved.  This is good.  Very happy about this.  Yeah, we can't get it.  It's US only.  Of course.  Yeah, for now.  Don't blame.  I wouldn't blame YouTube on that.  That's a rights issue, of course.  And a lot of people were already doing a roll your own YouTube red just by running an ad  blocker on YouTube.  But, you know, I would guess that YouTube will figure out a way to get around those ad blockers  at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting how the there was a huge, well, not huge, but there was an outcry about,  you know, Google basically forcing content producers and publishers to to sign up with  YouTube red, basically.  And, you know, I had a bunch of back and forth with them about because there were a couple  of blog posts about, hey, why is Google forcing us to to do this?  I mean, from Google's point of view, they they're trying this model because they're  hoping it will generate more revenue for them and for people whose content is on there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's also a response to ad blockers.  It's and I think it's also a step toward YouTube being a destination for more premium  content.  Right.  Isn't this what they've always wanted to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, their own shows, their own content and more premium stuff.  Not just three minute clips of.  Right.  People catching on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so if you're going to watch, you know, meet the press on YouTube or whatever it is,  having those silly pre-rolls and and pop ups and all that stuff, that wouldn't really  help the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And let's face it, that stuff is garbage anyway.  I mean, no one, no one, no human being, I think, watches, you know, 99 percent of those  pre-rolls.  Everyone, we all.  Yeah.  Click skip ad as soon as they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been told and I don't know if it's true or just a rationalization that maybe, Jeff,  you know, advertisers actually like that kind of a signal.  Remember when Dig had people voting up or down on the ads and they said advertisers  like that, they don't want to show you an ad that you don't like.  So they kind of would like the information about people skipping.  And then, of course, the challenges for them to make ads, which I don't think is a bad  challenge, that are unskippable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've talked about this a bit on the show.  I think that what we're seeing is the beginning of new ad standards where Google and AMP has  set up minimum standards for irritability.  The Internet Interactive Advertising Bureau has done the same.  Yeah.  But we have to go way beyond that and push to a level of quality.  And we're not there with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen the Geico ad that you can't skip?  Yeah, no.  This is actually funny.  They say you can't skip this ad because it's already over.  Watch this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank the savings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't skip this Geico ad because it's already over.  Geico 15 minutes could save you 15 percent or more on current shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The family's frozen, but then the St. Bernard comes in and starts eating dead spaghetti.  And the spaghetti's moving.  It's apparently just the actors that are frozen.  Oh, my God, the dog's eating that girl's meatball.  She's having a hard time staying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's moving.  She can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, well, there's a giant dog eating my food.  Is spaghetti bad for St. Bernard's?  He's skipping the salad going right over to the...  Oh, my God, he's making it.  Oh, man.  So this is what I'm saying.  If you have skippable ads, it just incents advertisers to make better ads that you don't  want to skip.  And this is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you were talking about one.  There was an ad where it said, don't you hate not being able to skip things?  So it was a guy watching an ad and he kept pushing the button and it didn't work.  And then the message was, you know, when you can't when you don't have control over  something, it's frustrating.  That was a good ad.  So funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And one of the comments on here is one of the first comments is from Todd Naska, who  says, I'm the dad in that ad.  It was so much fun to work on and the kids did an amazing job.  It was difficult to keep a straight face and not laugh with the dog named Bolt in your  face eating all the food.  The only thing we were allowed to move while frozen were our eyes.  Geico's ad team is very, very, very good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The unskippable ad.  We need more of those women.  Here's another one.  You want to see another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah.  What are you saying?  I say savings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't skip this guy go ad because it's already over Geico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fifteen minutes could say, by the way, another incentive to make short ads, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold the door.  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shaking hands.  They've frozen completely.  She's puzzled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love this.  It's great.  Okay, I'll just do it myself then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many takes do they have to go?  Oh, it must be so fun.  I love it.  I love these.  Here's another one.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Geico.  Now, by the way, that's the other thing that will happen is other people, your ad will go  viral, right?  Isn't this what you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is what happens.  You do it the first time and then you realize you want to watch all of them.  So they get maximum bang for their buck, right?  Cleaning crew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't skip this guy.  Cleaning crew is frozen.  Geico.  Fifteen minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guys pointing his duster at the guy with the vacuum.  The vacuum escapes.  Now I'm running amok.  It's hit the wire.  Short circuit.  The lights are going out.  You can't.  Oh, it's going again.  Oh, now it's going.  It's wrapping itself around the guy's feet.  I have a feeling this isn't going to end well.  Smoke alarms are going off.  They actually they just began that one.  That one.  This must have been an early, early edition.  You know what?  There's a ton of them.  I didn't know this.  It's a whole genre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know.  I haven't seen those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are great.  Now, this is the funny part.  Here's an article about it in Adweek.  Viewership rates for YouTube pre-roll ads are generally poor.  Part of the problem is very few marketers, specifically Taylor ads, to pre-roll.  They just take their TV spots, put them there.  And of course, it's five seconds and it's over.  I'm not going to watch the rest of it.  Geico understands this.  They're rolling.  It doesn't have results.  The ads run 15, 30s and even longer spots.  But the point is that it's the five seconds is the ad.  And then what happens after the five seconds?  Which there's no message whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Geico has always done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the message, the Geico ads, the 90% of the ad is humor.  And then there's a little payoff at the end, which I think is brilliant.  I know it's Geico.  It's sunk in, right?  I know they sell insurance.  It works.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Have you ever bought Geico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  High five.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should play that.  High five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  High five.  I should play the high five one.  All right. You ready?  Here's I'm getting requests now.  That's how good this game is.  So Jammer B says I should play this one.  This is the high five unskippable ad.  Let me go back.  Savings.  So two guys, they jump, they say high five.  And now they're in the midair frozen.  And then you see the strings and they're hanging on the strings.  The guy's got a barbecue.  He drops the hot dog from his tongs.  And now the barbecue is bursting into flame.  And now the other steak.  Oh, his shoe is burning.  Oh, my God, the humanity.  The poor guy.  He's just sitting there.  I think this is, you know what?  Great ads are great.  Great. And I don't mind giving a plug to Geico.  They deserve some kudos for that.  And the agency especially.  Hey, here's good news from Google Play Music.  We got the news yesterday, but actually we've known about it for some time.  We've been under NDA.  Not me.  They wouldn't tell me because I leak like a sieve.  Because your wife knows.  But my wife, yeah, Lisa says, don't tell Leo.  Tell me.  I can keep a secret.  Podcasts are coming to Google Play Music.  And in fact, we were one of the first they signed up.  We're right there on the announcement along with the Nerdist and how stuff works.  And startup from Gimlet Media.  And they say this is not going to happen right away.  They're reaching out right now to podcasters to submit their feeds.  But eventually this is under the guy who does songs.  He was in songs.  It was a great acquisition.  I think Google Play Music.  It's when you first launch your Google Play Music, it says, you know, it's a Thursday afternoon.  You want to what do you want to do?  It gives you different playlists for different moods.  I love that.  I love songs.  And I was really thrilled when they added it to Google Play Music.  Apparently that's what they're going to do with podcasts as well.  You're in a bad mood.  Want to be cheered up?  Here's a here's a playlist of podcasts.  It'll make you feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was as a Raskin songs.  Yeah.  Jeff Jeff Raskin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, it's Jeff Raskin's son.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  He had an operating system that was very interesting.  Oh, yeah.  Very.  I didn't know that.  That's who songs it was.  Jeff Raskin.  People may not remember the name, but they ought to.  He was the guy who thought up the Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Old people remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And was fired by Steve Jobs because Steve wanted it.  But but he always wanted Raskin's plant.  And I remember interviewing him many times.  I thought he was just a wonderful guy.  Really loved him.  He's passed away since.  But he his idea was to make a computer for the rest of us.  What a thought.  What an idea.  He was a genius.  He really was.  So as podcasters were thrilled because there has never before been a Google supplied podcast  client on Android.  Well, no, there was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Google.  What should we call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen.  Google.  What should we call it?  It was.  I forgot about Listen.  Listen wasn't really a directory necessarily.  It was more.  You subscribe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you would subscribe.  I don't know if they had how much discovery they had.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember being much about discovery.  This is a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It upset me because even more than Reader, because that stopped.  I was pretty much stopped using RSS, but I was using Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that's so funny because every mainstream media story said Google's never had a native  Android and I bought it.  Of course, listen.  Yeah.  So this will be installed as now.  How are they going to do this?  Will this be installed on?  It'll be part of Google Play Music, right?  So here's the songs of buttons.  It's Wednesday afternoon, play music for I keep getting entering beast mode.  You get that too?  Or is that just for me?  Entering beast mode.  I see an Alan.  That's just for you, Liam.  Keeping calm and mellow.  I don't know why.  I've never wanted to enter beast mode.  Not once.  You should try it.  You should try it.  Head banging classic rock, greatest aggro anthems, rockest punk and garage rock, heavy menacing  metal, speaker busting heavy rock.  This is not me.  By the way, you then go deeper and you get a playlist to several players within that.  So it really goes quite deep.  You are tattooed.  You don't know, Leo.  I do have a tat.  Google knows I have a tat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's god damn.  So you must like Slayer.  I do.  I love Slayer.  How about the early years of grunge?  Handpicked by the members of Pearl Jam.  I don't know.  This is so I had to click five times to even know that Pearl Jam has made a playlist for  Google Play Music.  That is bearing the lead a little bit.  But nevertheless, this is a great service.  So I'm excited.  It will be part of this.  It's not all Pearl Jam.  I don't think there's not got much Pearl Jam in it.  So this is kind of neat, but it's Pearl Jam ish.  I really like Google Music and I think for 10 bucks a month you get that.  You get ad free YouTube.  You get ad free music videos on YouTube.  That's that's the compelling story, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty I mean, it seems pretty big.  I thought if it was just a ditch ads, no one's going to pay that.  But you get a whole lot with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Recommended for you thick radio similar to Robin Thicke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That means it's similar to everything else that's ever been made.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking Alan Thicke.  I thought it was Alan Thicke radio.  That's different.  That would be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The joke is even better.  Similar to Robin Thicke makes being similar to Marvin Gaye.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Good point.  Well, this is even worse.  OK, similar to the Beatles because they don't have any Beatles.  I get the Beat Alls radio.  Wait a minute.  Here's songs by the Beat Alls.  This is a Beatles tribute band.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got the you've got the actual players down there also in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is kind of look that's the real George Harrison.  This is even that's the real ring.  This is this is what happens though when when an artist says no, I don't want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you get your solo stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You get your solo stuff.  And I bought, of course, the monkeys.  I own all the boys.  I have all the Beatles music, so I it will show all of Ringo's music.  No, no.  For that, I have Google Play Music.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting.  The monkeys were like the Beatles.  Yes, they were.  I think that's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should be.  But I but they were.  And frankly, if you if you're if you're brutally honest.  What's back off Boogaloo like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, love, peace and love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't you can't help but love Ringo Starr.  He's the Stephen Wozniak of the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That guy has zero apps to give.  Zero apps to give.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a he's a the kind of teacher you'd like.  Anyway, I like Google Play Music.  I actually love Google Play Music.  There are some restrictions that bother me a little bit.  And it's all from the music industry, of course.  The biggest one is that it's tied to your Google account.  So you can't share with your friends and family because then they can access Gmail and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they have a family plan that's coming up and the family plan will solve that.  Thank you, Google.  Fifteen bucks, I think.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I will definitely do that.  And then the other one is that there are a limited number of devices.  They're fairly stingy and limited number of devices.  I can't remember.  It was like five.  So you don't have that problem.  And this is the same problem with iTunes.  They artificial limits on killing devices like you only kill a couple of devices a year.  It's a big problem for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And not normal people, not normal people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I have a new phone every few months.  And in fact, I'd run right up against that.  I had five devices authenticated, none of which I can currently use.  And I couldn't unauthenticate them because I'd already authenticated the Max.  And I was complaining about it on this show.  And full disclosure, somebody contacted me from Google and said, we'll whitelist you  because you're an unusual.  Nice.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they do that for some folks who actually live in the industry.  That was nice of them.  So I didn't want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I am getting something for free from them, which is the ability to activate other devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you review a lot of devices, that's not a normal use case.  It makes sense to whitelist someone who's going through multiple phones a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm not listening to more than one Google Play Music.  I'm listening to more than one Google Play Music stream at a time or anything like that.  It's not like I've given it to all my friends and family because you can't because it's your Google ID.  You don't want to give that out.  So those are a couple of limitations.  Some people might bug.  But I think all in all, they're doing a great job on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think the recommendations are pretty good.  That's one thing that I kind of look for.  Like, I like the human curated stuff, but I'm mostly looking for...  I uploaded all 80 gigs of music I have or whatever, and I'm looking for Google to say,  here's some stuff we think you might like.  The recommendations are pretty good.  Aside from the Be Alls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Do you use Google Play Newsstand?  No, what's that?  I like it. I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, the Newsstand. No, I use that as a news app.  That's like Flipboard.  You know what's interesting is I've been really trying to use Apple's news on the iPhone,  and it's excreable.  It's terrible.  Yeah, it looks awful.  It's terrible.  There's...  You know, I think part of it is because Apple doesn't want to spy on me.  Like, they don't know anything about me.  I was getting Detroit weather for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that makes it worse. You're right.  Spying helps.  Please spy on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I want you to know what I'm interested in so you'll make reasonable recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually set up Newsstand for my mom.  Newsstand is nice, yeah.  Yeah. Newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And at first you think, well, this is really all about subscribing to magazines.  Like, they're selling newspapers and magazines, and that is part of it.  But it will also just recommend stories for you.  And if you have a New York Times or Wall Street Journal subscription,  it'll lift that 10 article a month restriction and all that.  I think it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually something that...  Like, I'm a big fan of Flipboard as well.  I like the UI. I like the design.  I like what they do with...  It's just a beautiful thing, especially on an iPad.  But one thing they're not particularly good at is recommendations.  And, you know, I think they're trying to get better,  but they're going up against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing I will mention, as far as discovery goes...  Let me see if I can get it working.  Spotify has excellent discovery.  They have a Discover playlist.  Have you... I don't know if you're a Spotify subscriber.  But every Monday they generate a new Discover playlist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And some of those are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's weird. It's a mix.  And I have to think it comes a little bit from stuff I'm interested in.  In fact, the album art is me.  So that tells me it's my personal playlist.  And it's old as well as new.  This is some really old stuff.  And then some really new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of the holy grail.  And this stuff is not easy to do.  I mean, data-wise, you know, it's almost as hard,  or maybe even harder, than something like voice recognition  or handwriting recognition to get something.  Because music is so...  The emotional value of that content is so much a part of why you like the song.  It's not just that it has tubas in it or that it sounds like some other thing.  That's the problem with the Music Genome Project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't really get deep into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very limited.  So you know that it's like this other piece of music,  but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to like it  just because it's got the same tempo or the same instruments.  It's really hard to do that type of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This Discover Weekly playlist blows my mind every Monday.  I was like, be my baby by Bette Midler's in here,  Jimmy Buffett, Margaritaville.  And then I get this by Vincent Valliere.  On va semer encore.  I don't know why, but I think it's because I have some French music in my playlist.  I mean, my collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and your name is French.  Oh, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't...  French pop music is...  I don't know about it. I don't know. It's just strange.  But I like it. No, I'm not...  And I like it.  The Weepies, The World Spins Madly On,  and then Tears for Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World.  See, this is... I know a computer is doing it,  but if you feel like you're listening to a really eclectic, interesting DJ,  and that's what you're going for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's... I mean, with Google Play or Apple,  there's a real tension between...  because they've got... Apple has DJs, celebrity DJs,  and so there's a bit of human, a bit of algorithm,  and both of them have pluses and minuses, pros and cons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually pay for both Google Music and Spotify,  and at some point I'm going to have to cut bait with one of them,  but I just... I don't know which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got Spotify free for two years from my cable company.  Oh! That's awfully nice of Rogers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is pretty cool, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't know that...  Well, I pay them like $11,000 a month or something.  Yeah, free!  It's the least thing to do.  I should be washing my car and doing my dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Enough. I don't know how we got...  Oh, because of the podcasting.  Anyway, I don't know when they're going to launch that,  but we're pleased to be part of it,  and I think that that's a nice thing.  All of them are doing that. We're on Spotify, too.  And they're doing that because it's such a lousy business  to be tied to the record companies...  It's terrible.  ...for your revenue.  And just look at Pandora, whose stock is down 45%.  Yeah.  That business...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wrote about them and about Deezer,  which just pulled its IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no. Really? Oh, I'm disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, if you look at the prospectus,  it becomes quite obvious why they pulled their IPO,  because it's a horrible business,  and no one in their right mind would invest in it,  because it's just basically money flowing out the door  to record labels.  So any money that comes in, I think 91% of their revenues  are paid out in licensing to record labels.  It's just so...  Because you're not even working on it.  The structure of those deals is so onerous.  In some deals, Deezer confessed in its prospectus,  some deals, they have to sign a bulk licensing arrangement  and agree to pay a certain amount,  regardless of how many plays that music,  so they can actually lose money.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's part of the problem, is that essentially  the record industry gets to decide  whether these people live or die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And most of them are not.  I mean, even Pandora, that's horrible.  Spotify is somewhat better,  but this business is just structurally designed to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think Spotify knows that.  I know Apple knows that. I know Google knows that.  That's why... I know that's why podcasts and other content  are being added to these services as fast as possible,  because you can't rely on the record industry.  They could just kill you at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And ad-free YouTube.  I mean, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's a better model than YouTube?  Millions of people every minute give us videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great way to keep your music service numbers up,  to include that along with it.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry to hear about Deezer.  Deezer is a French company.  Doesn't mean I don't like them.  But I thought they were doing some really...  Because you like French music.  I was making a joke. I was making a joke.  No, and I really...  They were doing CD quality streaming and stuff.  Some interesting things. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been around for a while.  Not quite as long as Pandora, but they were one of the early ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also, in an attempt probably to do the same thing  as Spotify and Google,  they bought Stitcher,  which is a big podcast platform for us  and for a lot of companies.  And Stitcher was integrated into Deezer.  Man, it's tough out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also mentioned that they're...  So they had, I think, six million paying subscribers, they said.  But in the prospectus, if you dig into the numbers,  almost half of those came because they did a bundling deal  with phone companies.  And so you would buy a phone and it would have Deezer on it.  So technically they got paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about being rockin' a hard place, Matthew.  Right.  Between telecom companies and record labels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you might as well just go in the backyard  and set fire to a big pile of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And frankly, how much do you think Rogers is paying  for your two-year free subscription to Spotify?  Probably pennies, right? Nothing.  Tough out there for a pimp.  I was going to play it, but then I thought, you know,  I probably shouldn't.  On the other hand, Alphabet's doing just fine, thank you very much.  This is the first quarterly earnings report from the new Google.  Revenues of $18.7 billion, growth of 13% year-over-year.  For all the big reporting companies,  the companies that do a lot of international business currency  was a big problem because the dollar gets stronger  as the euro gets weaker.  And that means that, you know, unless they're doing some hedging,  which I gather all the big companies do,  they're going to be hurt a little bit by currency fluctuations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, don't forget they keep a lot of the money outside.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But without the currency fluctuations,  their year-over-year growth was 21%, but they only report 13%  because of it. So that just shows you it hurts.  Oh, yeah.  Operating income of $4.7 billion in the quarter.  You know, I don't really know how to read balance sheets,  so I don't really have much to say about this.  Traffic acquisition costs for the three months ending in 2015,  What were they?  Is it millions? Yes, in millions, 3.5.  So where is Yahoo?  No, I'm sorry, 3.5 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A billion dollars in acquisition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. That's your biggest cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo last week was, I think, 250 million in acquisition cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  3.5 billion for Alphabet, and Alphabet is, in this case, Google, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What that tells you, though, is that they're in an arbitrage business,  to that extent.  What does that mean?  They're making a penny.  That means that they're buying traffic to make a penny more  on what they consume on it.  And it's not legit traffic to them.  They have to acquire the traffic to feed the ads,  but they're paying out a lot of money, but they're just making a margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I mean, news publishers do the same thing, right?  Buy traffic from Outbrain and Taboola.  Which is ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a break, and then I want to talk to you about  Jonah Peretti's Buzzfeed memo.  I have a feeling you guys will have something to say about that.  Both of you are former newspaper men.  Once a newspaper man, always a newspaper man.  That's right. It's hard to get the ink stain off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get in the veins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, Matthew Ingram, I'm Leo Laporte.  This Week in Google continues after a word from Blue Apron.  Blue Apron is for people like me who love to eat,  but also love to cook, but rarely have time to do the shopping  and the prep involved in cooking a great meal.  Blue Apron solves that by delivering everything you need  to cook an amazing meal to your door.  Half an hour later, you'll have a dish that you've never made before,  and you'll feel good about it.  Your family will go, wow, great for date night too,  for less than 10 bucks a meal.  And you get everything, all the fresh ingredients you need,  including vegetables, locally produced, farm-fresh vegetables in season,  the meats, the fish, always fresh, never frozen,  no trips to the grocery store, no more sad takeout.  Meal planning is done for you.  You can tell them ahead of time what your dietary preferences are,  approve and disapprove individual meals.  You say, you know, I'm not really into kale.  You can say, no kale meals, whatever.  But look at what's on the menu this week.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  You'll see the dishes like baked Sicilian-style rigatoni  with laccinato kale.  I don't even, this is one of the things that's great.  You get produce that you would never, you'd never have heard of,  who existed.  And if you like it, wow, yeah, you know where to go.  And ricotta salata.  Or they do some amazing Asian,  there's the rigatoni, that looks good,  Asian dishes like the ponzu tahini soba noodle salad  with yellow beet cabbage and chard.  And the thing is, you would never make this really.  You really wouldn't.  But once you make it once, then it's easy.  Then you know exactly what to do.  And the next time you hear the story, you go,  you know, I might do that ponzu tahini soba noodle salad I love so very much.  It's like a little cooking school in a box.  Refrigerated box.  You arrange the deliveries to work with your schedule.  You'll be cooking with amazing ingredients,  some you've never used before like watermelon,  radishes and farro and purple potatoes.  All the recipes healthful and five to seven hundred calories a portion.  So there, I mean, there's, if you eat out a lot, you gotta stop.  I keep saying this.  I love to cook, but I never have time,  so we end up eating out and then I always regret it.  Because it's rich, it's fattening, and it's probably not what you want to eat.  But wouldn't you love a meal that's like a gourmet chef made it?  But it was you, cod cakes and roasted potatoes with coleslaw and dijon mayo,  Mexican chicken and rice casserole.  This must be the family stuff. Is this family?  This looks good. Yeah, this is the family plan.  They have kid-friendly ingredients and larger dishes, of course, for the whole family.  Roast pork and delicata squash.  Oh, with warm farro and kale salad. Oh, man.  It's good for your kids, too.  They can cook with you. They can learn to cook.  And they'll try stuff and it'll broaden their horizons.  It's just, it's great all around.  Go to blueapron.com slash twit. Your first two meals are free.  Oh, fresh mozzarella.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  First two meals free.  It is so much fun. And even if you think, I don't love cooking,  probably what you don't love is planning and shopping and figuring it out, what you need to do.  This does it all for you and makes it fun.  Blueapron.com slash twit. We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Jonah Peretti said, I guess he set this out to staff earlier,  but decided to publish on the BuzzFeed blog for the rest of us to see.  Pardon me?  He does it all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's the guy who said, I don't think unions would be such a good idea for employees.  They wouldn't like that.  But his most recent blog post I thought was really opening the kimono in some ways.  Wasn't it to how BuzzFeed does its business?  And I only knew that because of, frankly, because of you, Jeff,  he's talked about how BuzzFeed was moving away from the old model of a homepage  and people go like, go to the New York Times page and you read it like you would read a newspaper  to putting their content everywhere, Facebook and Twitter and where people are,  a cross-platform global network, he calls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, they were very early with that strategy,  although others are trying to do the same thing, Vox, for example,  but BuzzFeed was one of the first to have, I think it was over a year ago,  they set up a specific unit called BuzzFeed Distributed.  And that's all it did was create content that lived on other networks or platforms.  No links back to the BuzzFeed site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do they monetize something like that?  They have to build the ads into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, because what they're really doing is they're selling the skill set.  BuzzFeed says to advertisers, we can make our crap viral, we can make your crap viral too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We understand how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, Vice says, we can make our crap cool, we can make your crap cool too.  And we and the rest of the media industry say, well, we write stories,  we'll write your stories too, we'll fool people into thinking they're yours,  which I think is wrong.  And you got to, Jonah's brilliant, he's absolutely brilliant.  The problem is, I think, and I've said this before,  I think media companies make a mistake thinking that that's the model.  I even think one thing in his letter that I don't have the data to know either way,  but I do not buy people come for the cats and stay for Libya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't buy that.  And he tries to argue that.  But instead, what he's done is made a business out of making stuff distributed for advertisers  for this new world.  And he understands that a home site and environment are meaningless.  And that's really forward thinking.  That's very Jonah.  But let's face it, if he's...  My fear for news publishers is that if they think that they can subsidize their news that way,  I don't think that...  I have my doubts that BuzzFeed's news is sustainable in any way on its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may be a model for BuzzFeed, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a model for every other publisher.  Exactly.  But what do other publishers do?  They pick up the wrong lessons.  Right. Or they try and duplicate something that they don't have the skill set to do.  I mean, Jonah Peretti built BuzzFeed as it started as a lab to understand how content works online.  I mean, the guy is like Albert Einstein of how content goes viral and gets shared online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we would grant that they know how to do viral.  They know how to make a story that has a fairly good shot at going viral.  Five billion monthly views.  Five billion monthly views.  Five billion a month.  Wow.  So that's a good skill to have.  Right.  And I was trying to figure out what is it that bothers me about BuzzFeed.  And by the way, then they have money to go out and hire somebody like Matt Honan to break news  and it always surprises me, but Matt's doing a great job.  And I go to, I see it's on BuzzFeed. Matt Honan's got this breaking, you know, really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Leo, my fear is always that when BuzzFeed goes public or gets bought by private equity,  they're going to look and say, this part of the business is sweet. We love it.  Right.  That new stuff, why are you bothering?  It could be that Jonah owns this forever.  But I think...  And it has serious efficient poison forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think if they're...  To me, it feels a lot like I made this argument before.  It feels a lot like what newspapers did.  I mean, newspapers, 85% of the content was entertainment and garbage.  You did come for the crosswords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Matthew, but you did come for the crosswords and you stayed for the news.  It was in a package that was truly subsidized.  BuzzFeed is not a package. It is by its nature distributed everywhere.  And you just hit one piece of it.  That doesn't mean you hit the rest of BuzzFeed and the old myth of mass media that you charge all advertisers for all readers is meaningless in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if they can use the same skills to make a piece of news content shareable and go viral, then that helps the news, right?  Presumably more people come into contact with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not really, because there's no advertising attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares if the news goes viral?  No, but the rest of the operation pays for that. Just the same way it did for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but why? Again, I feel what I'm trying to say is, but if I owned it,  if suddenly I'm Donald Trump and I get bored and I buy BuzzFeed, then I say to the news people, you don't bring anything value.  I can get rid of you tomorrow and I get rid of cost and I don't lose anything in the benefit of what BuzzFeed is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, even if they doesn't sell that, eventually somebody's going to make that calculus.  Because the only value to the BuzzFeed right now, to the prestige news coverage is just to their reputation, to burnish their reputation, right?  It doesn't add to their virality. It certainly doesn't convince advertisers that they know how to make stuff go viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, reputation does have a market value, right?  That's why lots of newspapers publish the things they do and want to win awards and so on.  That's true.  Because it generates revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't say a Pulitzer makes you more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it did. I had a discussion with the BuzzFeed executive in London last week where I was in the audience talking to people  and I said, well, we thought that in media that environment had value, right?  You want to be in Vogue. You want to be in the Globe and Mail. You want to be in these classy places.  And the BuzzFeed executive who was there said, that's dead. That's gone.  In a post website world, environment being a classy branded environment is meaningless.  And so you can't even make that argument either.  If you look at the universe of BuzzFeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're having a little trouble. I have to apologize because Jeff Skype is so latent.  We're having a very hard time going back and forth.  So just say over when you're done.  Okay.  Speaking of all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over.  But I mean, if you look at the universe of BuzzFeed content, if you look at those five billion monthly views,  news has got to be a rounding error.  I mean, it's not like you're going to actually save that much money, right?  If you have a few news people here.  I think a lot of people are over.  Yeah, they do.  Over.  I don't know. That's the big, the big, well, let's face it.  Their approach is custom designed for the environment that we're in right now.  I mean, I just finished writing a post a few hours ago, Facebook and Twitter,  and how links are disappearing.  Content exists where it exists.  People consume it there.  They either share it or they don't.  No one's going to click on your damn links, especially if Facebook disappears them because it's an instant article.  And Twitter hides them under a menu in Twitter moments.  So what do you do in an environment like that?  How do you survive?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's also kind of a limited time success, right?  Because, well, I see a couple of problems with this.  One is, viral's great, but maybe it's not just me, but I feel like it's manipulative.  And people feel manipulated a little bit by 26 problems only anxious people will understand.  And at some point, that's what happened with Upworthy, right, on the Facebook feed.  At some point people just get angry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That stuff is not working as well.  But the thing, the genius about BuzzFeed is that they, all they care about is triggering some sort of emotional response.  And in the same, they apply exactly the same kind of algorithm to advertising as they do to their regular content.  Does it provoke an emotional response?  Hate, love, fear, you know, just a strong emotion that makes you click on it or interact with it in some way.  It doesn't necessarily matter what the emotion is.  And you will do it even if you feel uncomfortable.  In some cases, feeling uncomfortable is what makes you share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, although Facebook realized that this was a real problem for them because people were feeling dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They felt manipulated.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then so that stuff, they started down voting.  There's some risk there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At best, it's a limited time strategy.  Jeff, is this credible when Peretti writes question, he makes up his own questions, then answers them, by the way, in this post, which I don't like.  Question, why are we building it?  Answer, to have a positive impact on people's actual lives in the world.  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much impact do you think it has on your life?  I don't know.  Right, Dad? I got to call back.  No, you're not dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a title, show title.  You're not dead.  I'm just thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks the same.  It looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he believes that.  I think he believes that in the same way newspaper publishers believe half of the stuff they say.  I feel like Buzzfeed is extremely cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it's an extraordinarily cynical effort that it really is all about how can we get as many clicks as possible.  And now that you tell me how they monetize, which I didn't understand, it makes it feels even more dirty and cynical because they're basically selling a native, you know, the notion that they could do viral native content.  Which they can, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And in some cases, their content.  I watched a video ad that, say, Frank did called Dear Kitten or whatever.  That thing was hilarious.  It was an ad and I knew that.  And I watched the whole thing.  I've watched it several times.  We just watched four Geico ads in a row.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's, I think seeing it as a manipulative, if you understand sort of what makes people click on things and then you orchestrate your content so that that happens, is that manipulative?  Newspapers have been doing that for a hundred years, trying to get people to buy newspapers by, you know, coming up with goofy headlines or images or making stuff up.  It's not that this is anything new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a peculiarly moralistic point of view.  I might be a Puritan because, for instance, you know, I know that game designers know how to make their games insanely addictive by playing upon well-known psychological tricks.  You know, Skinner Box type, Skinnerian kinds of conditioning.  And just because you know how to do it, whether you're Jonah Peretti with virality or game designers with Skinnerian reflexes, doesn't mean you should or it's okay if you do.  It's manipulative and it's wrong.  It's like Joseph Gebel's.  Yeah, he knew how to do propaganda really good.  That doesn't mean it's okay to do it.  But is that Puritanical to me?  Apparently it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, a little bit.  I mean, I find it hard to compare to compare Buzzfeed and I like to get Godwin's law into every show at some point.  But what's that law about?  Hitler comes into the conversation.  Godwin's law.  Yeah.  So congratulations.  But is it manipulative?  I mean, is it any more manipulative than what newspapers are trying to do to you?  Jeff, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oftentimes, no.  I'm going to try him on a different computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to call you back.  Stand by.  Yeah, stand by, Jeff.  I'll give you a call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But just because newspapers do it, Matthew, doesn't mean it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm not saying well, and if they were manipulating, I'm a lot more concerned about Facebook algorithms manipulating my feed to try and get me to vote for a specific party.  That's creepy, too.  They've admitted they do.  Buzzfeed just wants to get me to read something and feel something and share something.  I don't see that as being a devious...  I don't see it as having...  I'm doing it.  I have free will.  So when you write a headline...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you write your own headlines, Matthew?  I do, yeah.  So when you write a headline, you think about the SEO, the clickability, the virality, the shareability.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to.  It's part of the job.  In fact, we write several headlines.  Really?  Once an SEO headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do A-B testing on your headlines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we have multiple headlines that are shown in different ways.  And so some are designed for SEO, some are designed for social, some are designed for the tiny proportion of old people who still go to the actual vertical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, what do you do for old people?  You use big words?  What do you do?  Big words and yeah, lots of adverbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very cerebral.  Whereas the SEO is basically stuff all the keywords into the headline.  Yeah.  And if you can have something like click here, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I guess I am a little puritanical because I feel like that's wrong.  That like what you should just do is do the best damn content you could, write a headline that describes it accurately and let the chips fall where they may.  But I obviously in this day and age...  Which is what you do want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Which is what you do want to do.  But if you want what you write, I mean, there's my personal view and then there's sort of if you're a publisher, obviously if I write something, I would like lots of people to read it.  That's the whole reason I wrote the thing in the first place.  And so if I can get more people to see it, that's good.  Up to a certain point.  Not by tricking them though.  To a certain point.  Right. Up to a certain point.  So then at what point do you feel like you've manipulated people?  I mean, everyone has their own...  You know, did you not mention something in your headline?  Did you make it sound like something had happened that didn't actually happen?  That would be wrong.  It could happen.  You wouldn't do that.  Right. Except it happens all the time.  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. And I find that annoying.  To me, that's a strike against an organization when they do that.  Maybe I'm keeping track more than others are.  Maybe I'm not keeping track as well as I'd like.  But I kind of pay attention to the source before I click a link when I see an upward headline and intentionally don't click it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It comes back to the economic basis of the business.  If you're being paid based...  Your company is making money based on eyeballs and paid views and clicks and impressions.  You have to get as many as you can.  And so then it's a kind of slippery slope down which you don't want to slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I admit, for instance, when we think of a show title, my general instinct is to just do something fun and funny.  That will make people want to click because it's funny.  But then I also note that I'm always aware of, gee, it would be good if that happened.  The thing that we're...  First of all, it should show up in the show, obviously.  It shouldn't be ahead of nowhere.  And I like it if it shows up later in the show because that might encourage somebody to keep listening.  To watch longer.  Until they hear the title.  So that is a very kind of mild form of manipulation.  It's a little manipulative.  But probably I would be more successful if I were more willing to do more of that.  And I don't even like to market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a slippery slope because at some point you are going to do things where a substantial proportion or even a majority of your audience is going to think,  you know, that's a little...  Over the line, across the line.  Right.  But everyone has their own line.  So you don't know exactly when...  The problem is once you pass it, those people are gone.  Right?  They're probably going to be like, this is too dodgy.  And so then you can't get them back.  That's the hard part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm very judgmental.  I just...  I'm getting old.  And I feel like I don't like this new world where virality is celebrated as if it's a virtue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know what you mean.  I know what you mean.  And I certainly don't like the fact that every publishing model's...  Well, most of them, other than the kind of artisanal, you know, Ben Thompson, strataquiri model,  every model seems to be based on getting as huge impression numbers as you can.  All of those numbers are bogus to begin with.  You know, they're all based on...  I mean, you can juice your impressions in any number of ways that don't actually involve people looking at your content.  Right.  Or even being interested in it.  But I mean, you know, the same thing's happening on the video side.  People are...  So Facebook counts a video view of someone watches it for three seconds.  You know, is that...  Is anybody actually getting anything out of that content?  And yet they have a gazillion video views.  And then ads are being sold on the basis of those.  Oh, we've got a one second pre-roll.  You know?  It's crazy.  It's a bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  For sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll come back in a second.  Did you hear my doorbell ring earlier?  I love my ring.  I love my ring.  Not only does my doorbell ring, my watch goes zzz when somebody's at my door.  That's because I have this.  The Ring Video Doorbell.  It's the best thing ever.  They just got a $28 million investment from Richard Branson of Virgin.  And the story is hysterical.  Branson was on his private island, Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands.  And he invites people down there.  They have conferences.  And somebody was down there.  And all of a sudden he saw the guy take out his smartphone and start talking to somebody.  He said, what are you doing?  He said, I'm answering my door.  He said, well, you're answering.  You live in England.  Yeah.  I have the Ring Video Doorbell.  I'm answering my door in England.  And Branson says, well, show me all of this.  Invested $28 million.  You know why?  Because this is one of those ideas you go, yes, brilliant.  So here's the thing.  You can take, if you have a wired doorbell, which I do,  if you unscrew it, it's an easy thing.  There's two screws holding it in.  You get two wires coming out of your door jam there.  Here we go.  This is all you need now to set up your Ring Video Doorbell.  You put the mounting plate on there.  You connect up those two wires.  You put the Ring Video Doorbell on top of it.  You pair the Ring Video Doorbell with your Wi-Fi.  That's a quick and easy process.  Now, suddenly you have a doorbell that still rings your chime in your house.  Ding dong.  Or la cucaracha, or whatever your chime does in your house.  But it also has a wide angle fisheye camera on it.  So you see people at your door.  In HD video, it has a speaker and a microphone on it too.  So you can talk to them.  Whoa.  Now things are changing.  Because suddenly you can answer the door anywhere in the world.  You could say, hey, I'm in the bathtub, which is great.  If it's a burglar, by the way, ring in your doorbell to see if you're home.  Suddenly you're home, even if you're not.  If it's the UPS guy, you can say, just leave the package there.  I'll be right there.  It is awesome.  It also has a motion detector built in.  So it doesn't, not just people ringing your doorbell.  It's those kids coming on Halloween.  You could scare them.  Moo.  Through the speaker.  It's so much fun.  Ring.  Ring.com slash twit for free FedEx shipping in the United States.  That means you could get it by Halloween and have a lot of fun from it.  I tell you, this thing, it's like caller ID for your house.  It's security.  It's convenience.  It is the best thing ever.  And it's very affordable.  200 bucks plus free shipping when you go to ring.com slash twig.  T-W-I-G.  By the way, works on your smartphone.  The Ring app on iOS or Android is awesome because you just, I can take it out and see when people arrived at my door.  When my daughter got home in the middle of the night.  All of that stuff.  Ring.  Abby, I have the video right here.  Look at that.  Date stamped.  Ring.com slash twig.  You're going to love it.  Give it a try today.  Google has a new algorithm.  The RankBrain.  That's replacing, well they haven't replaced the algorithm in a little bit, right?  A year or so.  We don't know a lot about it, but fortunately there's always Danny Sullivan and he's done a FAQ.  Here's what we know about RankBrain.  It's using a machine learning artificial intelligence system to help sort through search results.  Hmm.  Bloomberg broke this story.  So this is a little different than what Google, than PageRank, than what PageRank's been doing, right?  This is machine learning.  It's getting better, presumably, over time.  This doesn't replace PageRank, but it does work within PageRank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it says it's designed to focus on the types of queries that don't fit because they're either unique or they, so they're not, it's hard to relate them to previous queries.  So it works on those ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's goal always to get better search results in the sense that give you something closer to what you were looking for when you typed that query into that window.  The Hummingbird algorithm is the algorithm that Google's been using since the middle of 2013, but this will be added to Hummingbird as a part of it.  There's other parts.  There's Panda, Penguin, Payday to fight spam.  Pigeon improves local results.  Top Heavy designed to promote ad heavy, I'm sorry, demote ad heavy pages.  Mobile friendly.  That's such a boring name.  What do you think it does? Rewards mobile friendly pages.  And pirate designed to fight copyright infringement.  So thank you, Danny Sullivan, for explaining all of this.  This is just crazy.  Google, he says, has spoken of having more than 200 major ranking signals that are evaluated and in turn might have up to 10,000 variations or sub signals.  In other words, there's a lot going on, or at least it's in Google's interest to make you think there's a lot going on.  What are the first and second most important signals Danny says Google won't tell us, even though we asked twice.  It's annoying. Please, please.  Pretty pleased with sugar on the top.  It's annoying, Danny writes, and arguably a bit misleading that Google won't explain the top two.  The Bloomberg article was no accident.  Google wants some PR about what it considers to be its machine learning breakthrough.  But to really assess that breakthrough, it's breakthrough would be helpful to know the other most important factors that Google uses now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but Google hates talking about that.  It's like the recipe.  Right. And every time it says, can't talk about that, because then people will figure out how to game it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's enough gaming that goes on already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Having been forced to use Bing for a while because I got a new Microsoft service book, I really appreciate what Google does.  Bing's not bad.  It's just not as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google, there's some, and this is from day one, the first time I used Google was more than 10 years ago, 15 years ago almost.  It was immediately and apparently better.  Just like you'd been using AltaVista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was actually orders of magnitude.  Yeah.  Like it wasn't just a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was clear.  And I think maybe it's not so much of a golf nowadays, but there's something ineffable about Google search results.  They're just better.  Plus they want to keep it ineffable.  Yes. Yes. It's ineffable forever.  No effing.  No effing effable.  Are you ready?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Jeff could talk to the German publishers.  He probably is while he's there.  I think he's probably doing that.  Because they're still fighting with Google about whether Google should have to pay to display news articles.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what are we doing?  Are we, as Jeff Kaput, as they would say, auf Wiedersehen?  I'll tell you what.  I'll show you Google Frightgeist.  You've heard of Google Zeitgeist.  Well, this is Zeitgeist for Halloween.  Enter if you dare.  This is not that.  Oh, top costume in Fairbanks, Alaska.  Pirate.  Top.  I wonder what the top costume is around my neck of the woods.  Poison Ivy from Batman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Las Vegas is Harley Quinn.  Star Wars in my daughter's costume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is she?  She's Harley Quinn.  It's going to be Harley Quinn.  Yeah.  Wonder Woman.  Well, trend.  These are these are.  Oh, and Alpine, Michigan.  The number one costume is Daenerys Targaryen.  The master mother of dragons and in Presque Isle, Maine.  Clown.  They don't have a lot of.  Oh, number one is Harley Quinn.  Your daughter wins the prize.  There you go.  What does Harley Quinn look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just do a Google image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I probably could just click this button, couldn't I?  You have a frighteningly high chance of seeing a Harley Quinn costume at a party this year.  Look at the trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My daughter went to one of those Comic Con things and there were like 800 Harley Quinn's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, this is very Google because lots of numbers and graphs, but not one picture of Harley Quinn.  You just should know.  My daughter always wanted to be a fairy of various variations of a fairy, a witch fairy, a superhero fairy.  But there was always a fairy in there somewhere.  There is a good go to.  There's a lot of comic book stuff here.  Harley Quinn, Star Wars superhero.  By the way, superheroes trending down.  Pirate trending down.  Batman trending down.  Minnie Mouse, which is number seven trending down.  Minions trending down.  Joker trending up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a second here in North Platte or whatever it is, it says it's superhero.  Well, what the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Generic superhero?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like I'm going as comic book character.  What is superhero?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That doesn't mean nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jinkerbell is hanging in there in Twin Falls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is based on searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see for costumes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For costumes.  So people are typing in.  Superhero.  I don't know which one I want to be.  Just give me a bunch of them.  Superhero.  Okay, so it says type to summon a costume.  Harley Quinn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Juneau, it's Chucky.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's stuck in the past.  It's sort of disturbing.  Oh, see, still no picture.  All right.  North Platte, Nebraska.  Harley Quinn costume is.  Oh, are these in real time searches coming in?  I wonder.  This seems to be dropping into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoa, Gulfport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's cave woman.  Cave woman.  Gulfport, Louisiana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I've lost it now.  Cave woman.  They're bouncing around.  It's hard to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hippie in Grand Junction, Colorado.  Are you sure those are costumes?  Are they just trying to find out Doc?  Who's Doc McStuffins?  Yeah, good question.  Disney character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Greenville, Minnesota, nerd.  Yeah, that one went well.  Nerd.  Yeah, they don't have a lot of nerds there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nerd.  Star Wars superhero.  Star Wars bat girl.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tinker Bell's big in Twin Falls, Idaho, apparently.  There's a picture.  I see a picture of Jeff Jarvis on the screen.  Does that mean anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm working on getting him a call.  We're having a hard time with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tulsa, Oklahoma, it says owl.  Owl?  Yeah, didn't see that coming.  Owl.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it Woodsy Owl or just General Owl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, it just says owl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So apparently Google, I didn't know this, but according to Engadget, Google's doing a second hunt on Hubrouter.  The first was built by a Taiwanese company called TP Link.  This one's going to be built by another Taiwanese company called Asus.  Very well known company.  It'll be $219.99.  It's still a tall cylindrical device.  But this one is more tapered.  And it has something called wave control.  Apparently you can wave your hand.  Yeah, does that work?  Does that work?  Over the top of the hub to boost the speed to a particular device.  What?  So you're like, you're getting the, you're making, waving the Wi-Fi over to the device?  This way, this way.  Over here.  Come here, Wi-Fi.  Come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess you set which device you want that command to refer to.  And then you wave and it boosts the signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so you use the app, you select the device and then you go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to think if they don't incorporate something like Alexa into that, someone is not doing their job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want Alexa.  I decided not to...  I can't talk to it eventually.  I decided not to buy the OnHub because my friend, Ron Amadio, I think it was Ron, who did the speed testing on it, said it was slow.  Really?  I bought a ASUS AC3200 router.  So maybe ASUS will do a better job than TP-Link.  I don't know.  We should have Jeff back.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis.  I'm sorry, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not dead, he's thinking.  I'm just thinking.  You got a show title there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have the OnHub router because I didn't return it in time, so I'm stuck with it.  Have you set it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did Jake set it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jake tested it and said it didn't really make any difference.  It would make a difference in my office.  It would be harder to work because we have more than one router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to spend 200 bucks on a router that doesn't make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought the trend in routers was to have like 45 antennas and look like...  Mine has six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like an upside down spider that died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Google just decided, screw it, we're going with no antennas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And very few lights.  The lights on my AC3200 are so bright that they're actually quite distracting.  So I ended up downloading alternative firmware that allows me to turn off the lights.  So now it just looks like a dead black spider in my living room.  A giant.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could have just put tape or something over it, but you had to download new firmware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Firmware.  I'm all about the firmware.  It's all about the firmware, man.  Imagine that thing.  And then there's... look at this.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  There's like 10 lights on it.  They're blinking furiously and they're bright white LEDs.  So I know I had to disable those.  That was crazy.  But it's a very... I will say it is a very good router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, mine only has three antennas, I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, you're not working hard.  This is a tri-band router.  So somebody in the chat room is giving me the link.  Is this to the new OnHub?  On.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all it does is you wave it and it can change devices.  It doesn't sound like it's worth another 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really puzzled by the OnHub plan here.  I don't get what they're up to.  Why do they need another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same software on the phone.  It keeps getting better.  Future friendly, always improving, stays secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it says it has multiple antennas.  They're just arranged in a unique circular pattern.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the other one was supposed to have multiple antennas too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No blinking lights, Leo. It says.  Yeah, they specifically address this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's dimmable lighting.  And no spider-like antennae.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it auto-updates, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's something Google pioneered with Chrome.  And I think that's a good thing.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I'm very happy with my spider-like antennas.  Antennas.  But waving is so strange.  That's weird.  I think that that's completely superfluous.  So what's going on with the...  We were talking about this while you were here, Jeff.  The German publishers and Google.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're keeping the war on,  where they're going to go after this copyright thing,  and they're going to go into court.  And I don't know that they have a very good case, actually.  They're just trying to continue the war.  Ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say, according to Google,  that this is Google's Central Europe chief, Philippe Justus,  said on Monday in Berlin,  altogether we pass on half a billion clicks a month  to German publishers.  That's a lot of results that the publishers are risking losing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and here's the funny thing about it.  So, Axel Springer, which is one of the two leaders of this,  Axel Springer and Berger are the two companies,  Axel Springer did join in with Facebook Instant Articles,  but they're not trying to charge Facebook anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  Springer said a two-week-old experiment to restrict access by Google  to some of its publications had caused web traffic to plunge for those sites,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  leading it to...  Yeah, that's why it seems so dumb.  I mean, they already know what's going to happen.  They know.  Or, like, Springer said it was something on the order of 40% of their traffic.  And Google has shown...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google has shown that the publisher is going to go after them for antitrust.  They're going to try to say, well, they're just too powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Google has shown their willingness to step away,  as they did in Spain.  I would worry if I were them a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, can you pronounce the ancillary copyright law?  Oh, yeah, he can pronounce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leistung should correct.  Maybe you don't know, Matthew, there's an entire reggae song...  There's a recording of this.  ...based on Jeff's pronunciation of Leistung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you can't see me live, you can hear me.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would. And now I can see it ad-free on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You become a meme. That's when you know you've made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a meme. Well, it's not the hugest meme ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Speaking of memes...  Yes?  I have two of my quotes ended up on some meme maker.  And so now there are all these fake Twitter accounts  that do nothing but throw up the meme,  and they throw up my address on it.  So it clutters my mentions feed. Is that happening to you?  What's the meme?  Well, it's just like the two quotes that I did.  I don't know what they were.  Oh, here's one. One just came up.  Where some see a new world disorder,  others see the opportunity to bring organization.  Not a very good quote,  but it's some coctamined maker,  and then there's fake accounts that throw them in there.  Another one is,  the only sane response to change is to find the opportunity in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So these are kind of nonsense quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not nonsense, God damn it.  I said it and I know it.  It's not completely nonsense.  Watch yourself, little boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the bird there? Nonsense quotes.  You're all French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So these are random snippets of...  Out of context snippets of Jarvisisms.  And it sounds like spammers might be using this.  I've seen this before with spammers,  where they just take random tweets  to make them look like a real account,  so that the Twitter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is basically the same thing.  What they do is they go to these meme makers,  I presume are the spammers,  and they throw them in there until they all have a fake account  that quotes all kinds of crap,  and it just quarters things up.  And again, how much of Twitter's usage is this junk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, bots are a huge part of Twitter's volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the sad thing is,  they can't even manage to grow that population very much.  We could do a whole show about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's...  This is a chart of US users.  And in the last 15 months,  I think Twitter's US user base has grown  like a fraction of 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The stock market has been punishing them this week.  The shares fell 11%.  And I think a lot of it is  that they can't keep the TORID growth up.  They had reported 320 million average active monthly users.  That's up a mere 4 million from the previous quarter.  Revenues are not bad.  Revenues, $569 million.  That's up 58%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And quite healthy growth.  The problem is that they went public,  and people expected certain things,  like you're going to be the next Facebook or whatever.  And so just showing healthy growth in revenue is not enough.  It's sad, but it's not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you saw that Jack gave away some of his stock employees.  Yeah, I gave away a lot.  Yeah, 200 million worth.  And in a sense it's a generous act.  In a sense it's kind of saying, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's still worth a billion and a half or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They ran their first TV commercial last night  during the World Series.  Do you want to watch it and listen to it?  It goes very fast.  And I don't know if it's as good an ad for Twitter  as frankly the McDonald's ads.  Have you seen the McDonald's breakfast ads?  I don't know if you have this in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  McDonald's? Yeah, we have McDonald's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  McDonald's three or four weeks ago decided to add breakfast all day long  so you can get your McMuffin in the afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's done well for them, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's done very well.  And the ad campaign for it is brilliant  and frankly is probably the best Twitter ad.  Let me show you first the Twitter ad  and then we'll compare it to the McDonald's ad  which Twitter didn't have to pay for.  Maybe they did, I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Glass, baby!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, if you're listening, you're seeing nothing.  It's just a bunch of basically, I would say,  viral videos associated with tweets around baseball World Series.  And I'm sorry about the blue jays.  Well, and Farhad Manju tweeted...  Was that one of my tweets in there?  It goes so fast, you can't even read them  and apparently that's the kids.  The kids love that.  Now let me show you the McDonald's breakfast ad  because I think it's a much better...  Wait a minute, hold on a second.  This is something else.  I don't know what I'm getting now.  These are the all-day breakfast ads for McDonald's.  If I can find them.  TV ad.  TV commercial.  Google, you suck!  All right, here we go.  This is from ispot.tv.  Is this the one?  I don't think this is the one I was looking for.  I'm looking for the one that has all the tweets.  Let me refine my Google search.  I'm not real good at the Google.  Just give me a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should watch a show about it.  It might help.  It's pretty new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish there were something on this.  Yeah, because they announced this on October 6th.  So it's only been a few weeks.  They have three ads.  Yeah, here we go.  But can I play them?  Yeah, here we go.  I think these are better ads, frankly, for Twitter than the Twitter ads.  Maybe Twitter helped pay for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's time for hashtag all day breakfast.  Smiley tongue face emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm guessing the McDonald's thought this would be good if we could get a viral.  That is pretty good.  And it's a better ad for the value of Twitter, the social aspect of Twitter than anything Twitter.  The Twitter ad was terrible for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my fear with the Twitter ad is that it's going to be it's just so confusing.  Like what am I supposed to be doing?  And it's overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Twitter ad is trying to tell you that this is a new and better way to use Twitter with mentions.  Right.  Twitter looks even more confusing than it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an ad for the new feature of Twitter that nobody's really that interested in, which is Twitter's news.  It looks like chaos, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Moments?  I'm so overwhelmed.  Right.  But we're old.  So maybe it's not designed for us.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, the McDonald's breakfast, all day breakfast is such a success that it's actually making some of the franchisees go bankrupt.  Because they have to keep the grills going for two kinds of meals and they're pissed.  It's actually costing them a lot of money.  However, I think a huge success from the point of view of their customers.  Yeah.  And by the way, you can't say that for Twitter's moments, which I think we all agree is baffling.  I mean, and that's what the ad was for.  The Twitter ad was for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the thing, the thing I mentioned about that concerns me about moments that I put in this post, I did was it's great.  So you look at the moment, you're like, oh, that's cool image.  And that's a great whatever vine or something.  But if you want to find the underlying link to the thing, you can't.  It takes like three clicks to go to the little dots and then you have to go to view tweet and then you have to write and nobody in there.  No one is ever going to do that.  Even I didn't want to do that.  And it's my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My my first reaction looking at it was, well, this is to solve the onboarding problem that Twitter has, which is that new people come to Twitter and have no they're not following anybody.  So there's nothing compelling at all on Twitter.  And they go, what's the big deal?  And then they nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And one of the interesting things about moments is you can follow them.  And then after the news event or whatever it is, is over, you you unfollow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know that.  Oh, yeah, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's say you're following the Benghazi hearings for who knows why.  And then so you follow the moment and then you get updates from that.  And then once it's over, you sort of unfollow it.  Will you get tweets?  Will you get the moment in your tweet stream or what will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so you from so updates to the moment.  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I remember that at the beginning, but I think they've taken that out.  I don't see the follow button anymore.  Where is it?  I want to follow that runaway blimp.  But all right, here's this is some.  Oh, I see it.  There's one follow.  So it has to be something that's current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, which is actually a handy feature.  But and and I think they're trying to follow the GOP debate, though.  That's trying to lower the barriers to entry.  Right. So so if you want, if you're interested in X, then you find a moment about it and you follow it.  You don't have to find all the underlying accounts and follow them.  And I could see the rationale there.  And I assume they're hoping that people will get kind of sucked into it and then they'll go through the process of actually following individual accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's a puzzle.  So I'm looking at today's moments on my feed.  And by the way, it doesn't matter because it's the same on everybody's feed.  Right. It's not in any way customized.  I see one one follow button for the World Series game.  Let's go to news. Any follow buttons? No. The GOP debates coming up.  No follow button.  That's probably something I would want to follow is the tweets around that Mets Royals is the only there's one story in all five pages that have a follow button.  So what's that?  It used to be all humanly created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. All supposedly.  It's all created by Twitter staff.  And so eventually I think there are partners they're working with who are going to like The Post, Washington Post, who are going to create their own moments.  But the one thing the one thing that's missing for me is a little bit of personalization.  Like if they could show me moments that well that had links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the same problem I have with Apple's news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess following should be that level of I mean, it's like Circus should be that level of personalization.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to pay.  Oh, the follow are the follow buttons paid.  Somebody in the show said you have to pay to get a follow button.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe the customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe they only do them for partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what happens to Twitter?  The stock is tanking.  Growth is slowing.  Jack Dorsey's come on.  And that was for a while.  You know, he was the white knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he's got you know what the best thing would be?  What is if someone took Twitter private?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if what's the market cap now, it's getting less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  T.W. T.T.R. Is that the stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was 20 billion, I think.  T.W. pricey for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  21 billion.  Yeah.  And that's the problem.  The way it's going to go private is that Facebook or Google, I think, was waiting for the price to come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, Apple's got 200 billion dollars in the bank.  They got to do something.  That's 10%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, mentioned is better than Apple News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think Apple can't use Twitter, but maybe Google could.  Maybe Google could.  Yeah.  We've talked about that before, and I thought maybe that's why Omid Kordestani went to Twitter to be their executive chairman of the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a story that's not on the rundown today, but just amazed me in terms of the value of data.  You saw that IBM bought the non-GP assets of weather.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  What? What did they buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought all the sort of data.  Assets of the weather channel.  Analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They bought the weather.  But they didn't buy the weather channel.  They bought everything but the channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody wants that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  David Kenney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  David Kenney.  David Kenney was a brilliant guy.  He was the CEO of Akamai.  He was a major league ad executive at Publisys.  And he took over the weather channel.  He was like, what are you doing?  Who wants what's weather?  But he really made it into a data company.  And so that's what IBM just bought.  Yeah.  With all the sensors and the analytics around that.  Pretty amazing.  So data is the new content.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and weather prediction in analytics is a huge, huge...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $2 billion acquisition.  That wasn't the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was not.  Is that what they're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what CheckCrunch says.  Or actually, I'm sorry, the Wall Street Journal says the weather is worth $2 billion.  They bought weather.com, their digital assets.  Oh, now I'm being blocked.  Okay, here we go.  IBM...  But not the cable network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the cable network.  Who wants that?  Nobody wants it.  You know, it's funny.  It's a fire sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NBC Universal acquired weather in 2008 for $3.5 billion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you looked at...  I looked at some recent TV numbers for things like ESPN and, you know,  in terms of loss of subscribers.  And at the top in double digits was the weather channel.  Oh.  It was like 26% or something.  You know what's going to be worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next big hurricane, which will probably be this winter,  it's going to be worth it.  Mm-hmm.  They get...  Weather's so many other places, though.  These are some numbers, Jeff, you could use for your number of the week.  The Weather Company is the fourth most visited mobile app in the U.S.  26 billion inquiries daily to its cloud-based services.  Wow.  The crap.  Four gigs of data a second are generated.  Four gigs a second.  IBM will use Watson to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not so sure it's a fire sale in the sense that I'll bet the channel...  Yeah.  Listen, having carriage is worth something.  And they've got carriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they didn't take the channel.  That's the thing they didn't take.  Oh, you're saying NBC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course not.  I'm saying that you add the value of the channel,  plus the value of what was sold.  Maybe you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Three billion weather forecast reference points,  40 million mobile phones,  50,000 flights per day.  I don't know what that...  That's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40 million mobile phones?  Does that mean they use...  Does the Weather Channel use sensors?  What?  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I have a weather app that asks me,  what's the weather like right now?  And then I tell it.  It's called Sunshine.  40 million, yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I must admit I was a little confused when I saw the news.  But then the more I thought about it,  the more people we were talking about it on Twitter,  it makes sense because weather is such a huge date,  source of data.  That's what IBM...  So presumably they were working with the weather company before  to license that data.  Yes, they were.  And now they just own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And weather companies license it back.  They're going to license back this data for some long period of time.  And the other thing that the story said was that IBM will...  This is not a weather play.  This is an Internet of Things play and a sensors play.  And that IBM will move into new areas like this  out of this acquisition.  New industries.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big data, baby.  That's what it means.  The more you know, the more you can sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a good point about Twitter though,  which I think was Jeff's point, that it has a lot of data.  I think that's one of the reasons why Google wanted Twitter  to come back to the table and do a deal with it,  which they did just recently after years and years of not getting Twitter data.  One of the reasons they wanted it was that real time sort of intent,  you know, people tweeting about, I'm going to do this or I'm feeling that  or I'm looking at this.  That's hugely important.  Whether it's worth 20 billion, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's data about seven years of Google Chrome,  launched in September 2008 from the Google operating system blog.  Wow, it's been that long?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It says,  Chrome's market share went from 0 to 53% in seven years,  i.e. declined from 67% to 15%.  Chrome is now, according to StatCounter, the dominant browser, i.e. in Firefox,  continue to lose market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any of you use Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Steve Gibson does, but he's a contrarian.  The green line in this graph, I know it's kind of hard to see,  the green line in this graph is Chrome, the blue line is i.e.,  the orange line is Firefox, the red line is Opera,  the gray line is everything else.  Safari is a gray line, I'm sorry.  So Safari climbing a little bit, everybody else going down,  except Chrome, which is growing very steadily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did have someone tell me that they were moving back to Firefox from Chrome  because they found Chrome was crashing a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I go back and forth, and a lot of people do,  because sometimes one uses a lot of memory and the other one doesn't, vice versa.  But I'm so invested at this point in Chrome.  It has all my bookmarks, it has all my extensions.  Me too.  If you use Chrome OS, as Jeff does, you're really invested.  I mean, all your apps are in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Chrome does not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, Chrome, having the login, this sort of came in handy.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it comes in handy because everything I go to,  I tell Chrome to remember the password.  Of course, the downside is someone gets access to your Chrome.  So when I was in Italy and my bag got stolen,  the first thing I did was change my Google password,  which instantly logs you out of every instance of Chrome that you have,  so then no one could get access to all those passwords.  Important little tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you have syncing protected by a password, which I do,  when you change your Google password, it does not change that syncing password.  So my sync password is my old Google password still.  I didn't know there was a password on set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Look in your Chrome browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little tip there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would your password protect the sync?  For that very reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  My friend, you don't want it to just sync randomly to anybody who installs Chrome under your account.  That would be a bad thing.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lightstone is over.  It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It clicks over to Settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now, ladies and gentlemen,  the Jeff Jarvis meme machine is in.  You know who made it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know who made it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, some guy.  It's called Reggae Me, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  German reggae is not a genre that I think...  No, it's a little too perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The lightstones should strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let's take a break.  Your picks of the week, your numbers of the week, whatever else you want to do.  And final words as we wrap the show up.  But first, a word from our sponsor, PagerDuty.  I love the tagline on the PagerDuty website.  Your SaaS is on the line.  By SaaS, they mean software as a service.  If you're running an app, a website, infrastructure of any kind,  you know that there's somebody on PagerDuty, right?  They may not be wearing a pager, but there's somebody on call,  one hopes, 24-7 in case your stuff goes down.  Wouldn't you like some software that not only makes sure that the on-call people  get called in an appropriate fashion on time,  but also that you get analytics back that help you be more reliable?  That's exactly what PagerDuty does.  I think it's not a stretch to say almost every business  relies on software and services that always need to be up.  PagerDuty is the hub of your operations.  It connects all your systems into one view  where you can see critical events across all your monitoring tools.  Over 100 ready-to-use integrations, including Nagios, New Relic,  that's what we use for our metrics on the website,  Keynote, AppDynamics, and or Roll Your Own.  They've got a great API too.  A lot of people do that.  When an incident occurs, PagerDuty notifies exactly the right team  and member based upon on-call schedules and personalized alerting preferences.  If alerts are missed, PagerDuty automatically escalates to another team member  until it's responded to.  And by the way, team members love it too because alerts are deduped and filtered,  making sure that only actionable alerts are delivered.  And of course they can use whatever method they choose,  not just pagers but phone calls, SMS, email, push notifications.  It's great for the people on call and it's great for the manager  who has to decrease the noise, improve reliability.  PagerDuty's analytic tools will identify common problems  allowing you to proactively make system improvements and prevent future outages.  So it's great in both regards.  By the way, they're relentless when it comes to reliability  because of course if your pager system goes down and your servers go down,  that's a problem.  PagerDuty is fully distributed across multiple data centers,  multiple hosting providers, multiple contact method providers for every method.  So you'll never miss an alert.  You can even customize it to fit how you and your team work.  Many, many, many companies use PagerDuty including Microsoft, GitHub, Boeing.  I can't think of anything that's more mission critical  than building a jet airplane.  Nike, Pinterest, Box.  Go there right now, pagerduty.com slash twit.  You get a 14-day trial for as little as $19 a month.  You can increase your uptime.  PagerDuty, I love them, dot com slash twit.  There was somebody did a tour of one of the subway control centers.  It's still using hardware from like 1910.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fascinating story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where was that? I saw that.  Oh, I'd like to see that.  I'm trying to find it.  Was it the Times or was something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was the Times, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Really cool.  I'll have to find it for you and Matthew and send it along to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same technology that runs the Internet here at the Radisson Park Inn in Berlin.  It's a steam-powered engine behind it, and they run out of coal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it feels like that.  Well, we're glad you could join us even through the magic of the...  Well, I'm sorry to be a hassle of that.  No, you're not a hassle. Jeff, you're worth it.  Jeff, you are worth it.  Seriously.  Do you want to give us a number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, sure. Well, so I've got an announcement today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're moving the show to Tuesday mornings, and I'm going to work for Facebook.  Because it'll be just like what you're experiencing right now.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Every Tuesday is going to give the staff opt-in 2G Tuesdays.  When they check in to Facebook, they can see what the world sees Facebook like at 2G.  It's too bad it's optional.  Which again is not like the Radisson Park Inn Hotel in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Too bad it's optional. It should be required.  Yeah, 2G Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one story out there that said it was required, but no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't make everybody do that.  Yeah, but that's a great idea because I think a lot of websites and certainly apps are designed for the high-speed internet.  I've been on 2G using T-Mobile in Europe, for instance, and you really realize those things are very heavy.  Facebook does have a low bandwidth Facebook Lite app, apparently, that they offer in areas where bandwidth is slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember who, someone forced their staff to use the mobile version of the site.  Was that Facebook?  Facebook did, yeah.  Which is a great idea, just to experience it the way someone else would on a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes you happy to get back and get to your high speed, I gotta tell you.  2G Tuesday.  Matthew, do you have anything you'd like to recommend or suggest?  Any Android goodies or Chromebooks tools or anything like that?  You don't have to. It's not a requirement just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't really have anything. My gear is all sold. There's nothing to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Old gear, kind of like that subway.  All right, well, I think this is a good time to wrap things up. It's late at night in Berlin.  Jeff has to go to the Kit Kat Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And George Pataki on the TV with the early debate. Who knew they were still running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, Pataki's still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so funny. It's so funny. But Ben Carson is going to be our new president and I couldn't be happier.  Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York. He won't be back though for a few weeks. He's traveling. He's a traveling man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait, one news item which we didn't talk about.  Alexis Ohanian is reportedly dating Serena Williams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Yeah, in the category of matches that you didn't see coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did not see that coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whose report is that Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Us Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Us Weekly, yeah. Exclusive.  Exclusive. They met at lunch. It's new.  Yeah, he's learning tennis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was dating Drake.  Did not see that coming.  Now she's dating a nerd.  Says an onlooker, he called her babe and they held hands.  Not bae. Not bae.  Bae. No, that would, no.  Alexis, I love Alexis Ohanian. Good for you.  He's a good looking guy, Alexis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have you ever met Alexis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we interviewed him on the triangulation. We had a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so you've seen him physically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's not exactly. In fact, he's saying he's picking up tennis now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, he was sitting down when I interviewed him.  I get that all the time because of the show.  You're lanky.  True.  And he'd ask me, they'd say, oh, I didn't know you were tall.  Yeah.  Because of the size of a little luputian on their screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you laughing?  I'm confusing everybody. That was the last show.  Oh, it's very confusing.  Everybody gets confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because then I will, and I know I will, get emails and tweets saying,  what are you crazy? UTC doesn't move.  No, but we do.  So we are going to be UTC minus eight starting on Sunday.  So that means all the shows next week will start kind of really at the time you expect them to start.  The real problem so far is that since Europeans have fallen back,  that we're we are they missed the first hour of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Sparked by Robert Garland, a Pittsburgh industrialist who had encountered the idea in the United Kingdom.  It's a terrible idea.

Transcript:  I'm proud of the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it wasn't year round until FDR did it.  All right.  In other words, it's a relatively recent thing and we could certainly get rid of it.  I think we should just get rid of time zones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to do real metric like Canada.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

It causes more auto wrecks.  Actually it's the auto wrecks that go up appreciably on Monday.  The heart attacks start on Sunday.  It's a terrible thing.  Let's get rid of it.
