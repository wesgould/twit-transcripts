He's on our coast, west coast out here.  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm at the headquarters for Idea Lab, creator of about 100 companies.  It's a wonderful place.  Bill Gross is the head.  He may pop in if he can free himself up.  But they create all kinds of great companies here and have over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love him.  He's great.  He created one of the very first incubator companies.  Just fantastic.  Also joining us right now, Kevin Marks.  Hi there.  Very important.  As always to have on this show.  Kevin is now at Salesforce, but he has worked at the Google as well as Apple, British Telecom,  and I'm sure I'm leaving many companies out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technorati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technorati.  I always forget that.  That's like that old game show question, dead or Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one of each in here.  So whatever happened to Technorati?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They changed.  They pivoted as we call it now.  They're an ad network now.  They dropped the number of blogs they're indexing from 100 million to 100,000 and focused on  an ad network, which is working and making the money.  But it isn't the company that it was when I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember going to Blog World and they were handing out your Technorati ranking on your  name badge, which I thought was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should apologize for that.  I've realized how pernicious all these rankings are.  You can look at the Google Plus ranking stuff that's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well as long as we're talking ranking, the rankings changed dramatically this morning.  And somehow I came out in a virtual heat for a second with Robert Scoble.  But that's only because the real key guys opted out.  Now this isn't official.  You have to go to a site called socialstatistics.com.  But apparently these are the same people who do the Twitter counter and they scrape Google  Plus to get the rankings.  You have to add your Google Plus account by number to their database.  Previously Mark Zuckerberg was number one with well over 110,000 people following him  on Google Plus.  He's disappeared along with Larry Sergi and Vic Gundrotra.  They're all gone.  But I want to thank them because it means that me and Robert can be right up there at  the top along with Kevin Rose Felicia Dayt.  Tom Anderson, he's not opting out, former founder of MySpace who says he's enjoying  being retired.  He actually is one of the most interesting people to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He really is.  I've been amazed.  He comes in and leaves very good comments.  Tom has been kind of good.  I wish if he'd been a real friend back at MySpace maybe he'd still be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was everybody's friend.  He was the guy, you all, when you joined MySpace.  He's the guy who was looking like this at a whiteboard.  That's still his picture by the way.  I love it that he uses the same picture on Google Plus of the guy looking at the whiteboard.  For all we know he looks nothing like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He didn't lie about his age on MySpace as well.  Did he really?  He deducted 10 years from his age so that he could stay youthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we don't know what happened but Slashdot said, oh Mark Zuckerberg pulled his account  but I went and checked.  His account is still there.  Still as blank as ever.  And still followed by we presume hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more because  it looks like Google Plus now has opened up invitations and there are lots of people in  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I've now given up.  I was going through, everybody who followed me so I could find friends, I've given up  now.  Oh you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't.  You're followed by 16,000 people.  I mean that's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah but it's the same with Twitter.  I turned those notifications off on Twitter a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah you know, that's not, I like the asymmetric following model that Twitter and Google Plus  use as opposed to the symmetric following model that Facebook uses.  You follow, everybody who follows you on Facebook.  Right.  So there might be some changes to the way circles work if we're to believe Vic who  posted on Google Plus, let us know what changes you want to make and he allowed people to  vote up and down on the changes and the top plus one changes all involve kind of modifications  to circles including some, I think some really useful modifications to circles.  This is not going to be the Google Plus show, don't worry folks but we do have to talk about  it because it is taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus I met with Bradley this week.  Oh good.  It seems to beâ€¦  I was up on Google giving a privacy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to be moving faster than any social network in living memory except maybe Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really amazing and they're very open.  There were some things that he asked me about that were you know under the NDA because he  just wanted to get some response just to some things that, well that's not what I'm  talking about, the things that I hit him up for.  I said the problem to the raking of Cron with the comments, I said my solution is just give  me the separate feed of latest posts and until you have that by the way it's not  going to be very good for news and he said, I don't know if I believe him or not but  he said oh I hadn't heard that idea before, it's a good idea so maybe we can get that.  I also pushed for the idea of more links, ability to put more than one link in a post  that otherwise it's kind of irresponsible in the blog world, not to do that.  And then third I begged him to support the standards that are starting to come out there  now things like the hashtag.  That by support I mean put it in search and fill in hashtags and do all the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search on Google Plus would be nice to start with and a hashtag.  Yeah that would be nice to start with.  It's kind of a specialized form of search, kind of a pre-populated search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Abandoning the Twitter search was also a shame.  The real time search.  The real time search has gone away from there and the story was that Google and Twitter  their fire hose agreement but it wasn't very clear who decided not to renew it and where  that went but that means they pulled the real time search just when you would need it for  Plus which is kind of a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you might think that Plus will end up taking Twitter's place as it grows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah but the point of real time search was that it was searching more than just Twitter.  Twitter was the bulk of it because it has more public stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because actually I think Leo, and I'm here full disclosure at Idealab where they have  over media and I am a nano micro little tiny investor of that.  But as I was thinking about it before I got here I kind of realized that we actually now  have something that I'm calling the tchotchke cloud.  Right is that Twitter used to own that.  Twitter was the only one where we made tchotchkes.  Everything else was something else and then Google Plus changes that overnight.  And now you have little tiny posts and then I guess I would now throw Tumblr into this.  And the interesting thing is what can you do across that world.  Right.  Right and that's why I wish that they would support a hashtag because then you can start  to see what people are saying about news of the world across Google Plus and Twitter and  Tumblr and so on.  And each one can still be its own service with its own pluses and minuses and its own  differences and you can choose to be which ones you want to be in.  But when you want to find news of the world news I really want to be able to and not get  the noise the pure search would give me.  I want the hashtag.  So those kinds of conventions Google I think needs to support.  You're right.  Search is the first thing but then enable it in new ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any reason to think that the you know I mean look at this is it's week two  kids kids.  Yeah.  Is there any reason to think that the Google won't add all of these obvious features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah I think that they're they're working like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure I'm sure they want to do that.  The challenge is that with all of this stuff is how the stuff is connected and it's it's  interesting to see that there is similar flood problems that we had on friend feed and on  bars on plus which is that if Leo or Scoble or someone someone with the many followers  turns up in a post suddenly you'll swamp with everyone else's comments.  And that's the piece that Twitter got right through not actually having a threaded comment  but also having a much less explicit conversation.  It has this notion of overlapping publics and the decision they made with the app replies  to only show the app replies to people you're already following.  I think was actually one of those critical ones that we complained about at the time.  It was actually very wise in retrospect because what it means is by default your feed is only  showing the conversations between people that you already know which dampens down that flood  of followers effect.  And you know it's it's it's tricky enough with when it's when it's Leo or Scoble with  20,000 followers but once it becomes Neil Gaiman or you know actually Lady Gaga with  millions of followers that that stuff will break down radically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying to understand what what it is that bugs people.  Is it that the comment threads go on and on and you see them all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No it's not it takes the breaks the cron is that you get it.  Oh it's the it's the fact that the heavily commented stuff surfaces up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's both. It's both.  It breaks the breaks the chronological order.  It also enforces a chronological order to see millions of me tooish comments.  So the challenge is you know if if you if you ask a question on Twitter you will get  a whole bunch of app replies and you can look at them quickly and decide which ones you  want to respond to.  If you ask a question on bars those turn into a giant threat you know conversation thread  because you've brought in thousands of people and there's a positive feedback loop that  amplifies it and makes it makes it more annoying.  And it also makes it easier to to for people for trolls to take over the conversation  because because everyone sees the entire conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect Google thought as I kind of do that all if as long as you provide an easy way  to mute this which of course I can't mute my own comment.  Let's mute this one that then I don't see it anymore and it's gone and it's so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sort of a question of what the default feels like.  Does this default feel like there are people I know here or there are people I don't know  here.  What happens with Twitter is by default the first view you see is the people you've chosen  to follow.  You have to actually click something to see at replies unless you're running a different  client and you have to you have to make it an extra effort to see that see that the second  degree stuff.  Whereas on this it's pushed back at you.  So if you if you make the mistake of following Robert Scoble suddenly your entire view of  this is through his lens because he's feeding so much traffic into it and so many people  responding to him.  And that's that's a sort of subtle thing that one of the reasons that Twitter does work  for ridiculously famous people is they can still decide to have a conversation amongst  people they want to have and have lots of people asking them they can go and dip into  when they want when they when they feel like being more magnanimous.  But it doesn't that doesn't actually cause a problem for everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if Lady Gaga joined and got you know a thousand comments on every thread she would  always be at the top is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not necessarily at the top.  They fixed that a bit.  So they made it.  It doesn't seem like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If someone knows but the thing is once someone does you know I follow enough people who follow  what who follow Lady Gaga and may comment on one of her threads because she's the phenomenon  and that would then pull the entire thread in and the other you know hundred thousand  little monsters you know making hand gestures and saying rah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well but that would be OK.  So that but I you know if it's a good thread I want to see the other people's engagement.  So that's really more of a problem with Lady Gaga and the noise of her followers than it  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It comes in truncated and you can choose to explore it or not.  So that's OK.  It'll show me you know top two latest to something.  It'll give me a sample of two comments and then it's up to me as to whether explode the  seal or hundred or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I seem to have followed something really not what I wanted to follow by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think it's a great story about Lady Gaga I just heard here at IDILAB.  I arrived in L.A. as they are having what they're calling here the the.  So now we're going to get the word of the but they're closing the four or five freeway.  Oh yeah crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of a comic editing thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comic editing.  Comic editing and they're going absolutely berserk here.  It's hilarious.  It's as if the city is having a bypass operation.  You have to take Sepulveda for crying out loud.  Oh yeah.  Yeah yeah.  This loss and cutoff gets back right.  And they're going berserk here.  My launch companions told me that they that they the city asked Lady Gaga to tweet this  so that more people would find out.  Wow.  Think about that.  That what happened was Lady Gaga has more followers.  She's repulsed Times.  She has replaced the civil defense system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember when we used to have on radio to go put off a tone and this has been an alert  of the civil defense.  That's Lady Gaga now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just that.  She's also the Los Angeles Times and television.  She goes Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my Gaga.  We are 405 is close.  That's I don't know if that's a good comment or not on our on our society.  That's really.  So now if I see I wish I could search for Carmageddon on Google.  I kind of can because I can go site equals colon plus Google dot com and then Carmageddon.  But it's kind of it should be it should be internal and then a hashtag should be implemented.  But I think all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll come.  They're working hard on it.  And the fact that they're enlisting and doing all that I think is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see how hard this is though because just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No but the thing is that this this there is this problem that following you know people's  audiences are not normally distributed.  They're expansion expansionally distributed.  You have Lady Gaga at one end and then sort of at that same high end of the curve.  There's Leo and people.  Scoble and people who have a lot of followers and then way down the other end there's a  large mass of people who are talking to a handful of people most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you will never see them at the top because they have so few followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And the thing is there's you want different things at different phases of constructing  one of these things.  So at the start up phase you do want to demonstrate lots of engagement.  So you do you clearly do want to bring people into this.  There's something there phase that we're seeing with plus.  After a while you overshoot and you get to the this this this flood is unmanageable.  Right.  And then people back off and it's a classic.  So it's fixable.  It's fixable.  They probably are doing this on purpose.  They may have been initially doing on purpose to amplify this but but it'd be tricky to  actually get that the thing that Twitter sort of stumbled into.  Right.  Because it is it is a different presumption about what a common thread looks like.  Right.  And I think that YouTube has this issue too.  YouTube has some videos with millions of people on them and the comment threads are completely  useless and it has some small ones that are you know somebody's art film the comment thread  is actually useful.  There was the somebody did a response to YouTube's copyright thing that explained what fair use  actually was rather than the YouTube copyright school saying if you copy anything you must  be breaking the law.  And with the cute pirate cats and things and did a nice reply to that.  But the comments to that one are very sensible discussions of what actually fair use constitutes  what what corporate is because it's a you know it's a it's a narrow thing.  It didn't he's linked to it earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my problem with that is I saw it.  It went by in the stream.  And I can't find the sucker.  Yeah.  I mean this is the other problem is that there's no good way to kind of pin stuff or you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  favorite things which is a Google function they should put on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we have a worker.  Which is you create a circle with only you in it and then you should you reshare whatever  you want to save to your right circle.  That's what we're trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get that.  They'll come to that.  The thing I one thing I don't understand watching the two weeks here is the I'm going to say  this the wrong way.  Find it.  I can call it to your posts.  The quality of posts is what I mean by that is that why are animated gifts taking over  because we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We couldn't on Twitter and we can hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but but even Tumblr doesn't doesn't look you can have a you know a cat picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a single animated gif in the first 10 or 20 posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then Chris Perl would do it.  And even though I will I unfollowed him did know but now everybody re shares right Chris  Perl animated gifs or those those kinds of pictures you have right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mind these.  Is there all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 20th time you've seen it.  Well look it keeps it keeps coming.  Exactly.  That's the problem.  I see every reshare of it because there's a comment on it.  It's creating the kind of low quality noise in a way that they have to be do not just  of your work for problems is the retreat retreat retreat.  You see you see the same thing over here was retweeted and I was thinking be do that here.  I think you were a deed do the shares because every time it shared it was to that.  But I also want to do the media behind it.  Yes.  Jeff you've already seen that funny.  It's not a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these are all things that can be fixed.  I think we I don't want to spend like an hour talking about feature requests for Google  plus because God knows I'll be I'm sure rolling out a ton of them they bet they've been very  slow in the first two weeks.  They only you know only a few little changes here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of funny.  That's kind of funny that not doing huge changes in two weeks is now considered slow.  I think it's good.  I think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're probably wise not to jump to every request.  However you know there's a guy who did an analysis which I thought was quite quite ingenious.  He attracts the how common surnames are and by looking at the growth of particular surnames  and then comparing them to the overall commonality in the US of those surnames he's able to kind  of fair.  I think it sounds fairly accurately project the size of Google plus at least in the US  because he's not doing it outside US.  He estimates 10 million users by this weekend.  Does that sound off to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds high.  So the I guess what will make it believable to me is how much they emphasize international.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of international.  There's a hell of a lot which is which is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.  I also told them I quoted Gina and three or four meetings there that they don't have enough  women and not just have women but also have people who are going to have different kinds  of problems with the service so they know it.  And I said you should put on all of glam and all of log her overnight and that would help  you a lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But the other thing is that they haven't got anyone under 18 on there which I think is a  massive mistake because that is you know they said share this with your family and I thought  great I'll invite my sons.  They said no you can't they can't come on they're under 18.  So that is a massive piece of usage.  I'm sure they'd love it and enjoy dealing with it and it's a group that will test this  in ways that they haven't thought of yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of that I think we see of course all the public engagement and probably at  least you and me Jeff post publicly for the most part.  But I'm wondering how many people are using it in the other way.  You could absolutely use this a la Facebook and just post to particular circles.  I've tried a little bit with work posting to the Twits circle.  That's not worked well because there's so much other noise they don't see that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they could click on you need that.  Then you have to have synchronous circles.  Your staff has to agree that you all have a twits circle and then have to know to look  once in a while which would be a hassle to manage.  I think that's something where you could.  I would like to have potential there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's something there that is different than Twitter which is it can be used in a  variety of kind of ways that are not Twitter like it could be used to just talk to your  family.  I tried using it as a DM system and of course again the noise kills it because the DM I  sent I'm sure scrolled way off the page before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's just I've been notifications.  Those ones do.  So if you actually ping someone they'll show up there.  I have so many notifications.  I guess I'm unusual.  I can't keep track of my notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always nine notifications at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish we could.  One of the features that I use on Twitter now is I watch my media blog list more than  my Twitter feed and I like that I can publish that list.  It would be nice if you could publish a twit list to your fellow employees and say, you  circle and follow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about Kevin Rose who says I'm going to redirect KevinRose.com to my Google Plus and  I'm not having a blog anymore.  Is that just a showboat or is that a?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a dumb idea right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because blog does two different things.  Right now it does multiple links and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well one of the advantages though is you get all this engagement.  I mean even a big name like Kevin Rose probably gets 10 times more people seeing everything  he writes on Google Plus than he does on his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I mean you know this is believe me this is my publisher is salivating over the possibilities  to promote the book on here.  I won't bug you too much folks but I will.  Soon September.  Public Parts.  Public Parts Simon & Schuster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simon & Schuster not a News Corp publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No not a News Corp.  I left change the News Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was interesting.  I didn't know that about you.  Yeah.  I pulled the book.  Is that because you write a lot about News Corp in the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I'm talking about open and closed companies and institutions and News Corp is the most  closed institution I could imagine in media by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you had a deal with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a deal with them but I had not signed the contract.  Interesting.  And so I pulled the book from Hyper Collins and News Corp and frankly with all the current  kerfuffle and hoopla I am glad not to be there.  This News of the World story is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we're going to get to that because I do want to get your take on that absolutely  and Kevin's English so.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can speak about this in the proper accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not for a while now.  It's a site I go to on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but still you've got to say it right.  So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  I think we'll talk a little more about Google Plus and there's a lot more about Android  and all sorts of stuff going on.  Gina Trapani not with us.  I know she's right now.  She's going through withdrawal even though it's the middle of the night in China.  I feel I should be doing something.  I hope she's having a great time in Shanghai but she'll be back in a couple of weeks.  This is the second to last by the way this week in Google will be doing from the studio.  The old cottage next week will be here two weeks hence we will be all.  And I had a major like all hands engineering meeting yesterday and all I kept saying is  are you sure we could do it on July.  Are you sure July 24th.  You know that's you know that's only 11 days.  Are you sure.  And they said yes we're sure.  So we'll be doing the show in the new studio soon.  You know what's going to be in the backyard.  Yeah we might.  Who knows.  You know it's gonna be cool though is that instead of being in this Hollywood Square  thing we're going to we're going to decompose it deconstruct it and you'll each of you have  a seat at the table with a monitor.  It might look so weird that we have to do something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The nerd character on Sheldon Sheldon.  What's this thing.  What do you call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah he has this remote thing where he want what rolls around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's the name for that.  They have a name for it.  Is there a name for that.  Yeah because that's what all the guests will be now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah they will be.  So whatever that is that's what we're we're going to make you be.  I'm watching.  We don't.  Apparently doesn't watch Big Bang.  Gosh that's surprising.  Virtual presence device.  I thought it had a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it did.  All right.  Never mind.  Sheldon.  We're all Sheldon's.  We'll call it a Sheldon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not.  That's good.  I like that.  On our Sheldon today to my left Jeff Jarvis to my right on Kevin Marx.  I think that's it.  Exactly.  Hey before we go on though I do want to talk a little bit about our good friends at Squarespace  the secret behind exceptional websites.  Goodness gracious.  Make your blog be just a Google Plus blog.  But I think you really should have a presence on the web that you control that you own that  you have.  And this is it.  This is the place to do it.  Squarespace dot com.  Actually Kevin Rose dot com was a Squarespace site.  He's got he can regret this.  First of all plenty of bandwidth.  You never run out.  Can you do this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I thought I was safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to get them all in.  I got jet lag.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're in Cali right now.  It's possible Bill Gross will pop his head in.  If he does we'll say hello.  He's actually posts fairly actively as well.  He's very gross.  He's loving.  You know who else?  Richard Branson just started posting.  Allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think it's not him?  Well we haven't seen a chain of.  We can't verify.  For anywhere else have we?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who I think it was the girl in Who's the Boss verified.  Is that her?  Alyssa Milano verified using Twitter.  She tweeted.  Yes.  That is my Google Plus account.  So now we know.  And of course we can all verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually have a new job we can verify using Scoble.  Because Scoble knows everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scoble verified Zuck for us.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we can verify me.  We do have a way to do this properly which is Roll Me.  There is a way to actually do this by connecting science together with Roll Me is to say this  is me and this is also me.  That's the way you're supposed to do it.  Oddly Google isn't actually amplifying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish they would.  Well they're kind of rolling that out.  In fact.  They're doing it as part of the Roll Author stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's the author thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you do just for people who want to know.  Here's my website.  My canonical website.  And what you need is a page per author.  So I have this is my bio.  And in the code of this bio is author is the is the HTML.  Rel equals quote me.  End quote.  Is that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  And then in every post.  So if I go to a blog post also in the HTML invisible to humans but not to the Google  is the code rel equals quote author quote.  Is that right.  Yes.  And then by doing so.  In theory when I search for myself on Google that the articles that I wrote or the pages  that I authored I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have I.  There's a Leo.  There's a Leo.  Right.  So this is this verification.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that's this.  Yes.  This verification by.  It's just true verification.  This is the same as the social graph API stuff that we did way back when.  It's the XFN standard is XFN.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And XFN has a number of other things.  Wait a minute.  Here's Bill Gross.  Let's say hello to Bill Gross.  Hey Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi.  Thanks for having me.  Well we're thrilled to have you.  I really enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is Uber media going to continue doing the Twitter stuff or I know you're very positive  about Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You commented on a bunch of the things already today.  How great the engagement is on Google Plus.  It's just fantastic.  So I'd love to figure out ways to work with that as well.  And you a few different things you brought up.  First I also took the leap like Kevin and pointed my blog over.  You said it was kind of dumb.  You did that.  Really.  Yeah I did that.  Well I did it because of the engagement and the ability to write something and get so  much positive feedback and actually talk with people.  The engagement was so much higher and the spam from my WordPress blog was so much worse.  It was unbelievable.  I really couldn't talk with anybody but the fidelity and the signal to noise ratio being  so good at Google Plus.  Now it'll be interesting to see if that can hold up as it opens up wider.  You know the rumors of between four and a half million and ten million people right  now it's probably in that range.  What happens when there's 50 million people or 100 million people?  Will the signal to noise be as good?  I think that Google because of their algorithms probably can do a better job of that than  most people so maybe that will hold up.  We'll see.  You brought up one other thing earlier.  The insight that you had about the clever way that Twitter only shares the comments  with other people you're following.  That was a very good insight when you talked about that earlier.  That might be something that's necessary to really filter out the comments stream from  being so huge.  Right now a huge comments stream is a plus.  We'll see if that turns into a minus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's a transition point on particular streams as well.  I think when there are four or five comments on there you're happy to see them all but  when it hits a thousand you clearly want some way of reducing that.  That's a really strong signal that would make sense to you and it's one that works well  on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You brought up the issue of the changing of the cron.  Something has to be done to maybe your idea, the one you suggested to them of give me a  choice.  Either one in chronological order or I want it bumped up.  I trust Google more than almost anyone to come up with a clever algorithm to try and  make that work out that they did it this well in a first release.  What they're even calling a point one release not even a 1.0 but even as a 1.0 it's a brilliant  product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was your take on the real time search going away Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'm really curious.  I don't know whether it was prompted from the Twitter side or from the Google side so  I really don't know.  I actually thought that the tweets being integrated into Google searches it was starting to show  up more and more and it was starting to be pretty good.  So it is kind of a shame that it's gone because it was starting to look pretty nice.  But look now Google is getting so much content in Google Plus they can start surfacing Google  Plus posts in search and maybe they can do a better algorithmic job because they have  more signals about what's actually relevant or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So part of the irony of that is that because so much is made we don't know how much but  so much is made not public they're having a lot less there than they could have.  The other question Bill, why do you think that Google didn't include search in the beginning  of Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Google is a search company so they're going to do search really really well.  The only thing I can think of is it just wasn't ready for prime time because they wanted to  make it perfect and they had something so good they wanted to roll it out.  They're going to have great search and that's going to make a big difference.  And I'm really curious I have been posting and you guys were talking about this earlier  mostly public because I have things that I want to share with people and I don't want  to limit it to just a circle unless I have a family like circle or a private one like  you were talking about making a business one.  You know like a media one, we have an ideal one but most of the things that I'm sharing  I'm trying to open up a broader discussion.  I wonder how many people are doing that versus how many people are really keeping their things  very tightly in circles and more private.  I think one of the beautiful things about Twitter and one of the things about Google  Plus is it is public.  It is very different from Facebook.  I wonder if that's the way people are really going to end up using it.  Something about what you were talking about earlier about the very subtle rules, very  little things can make a big impact on how the thing plays out.  You said, you were laughing, why are people doing adamant adjus because they can.  Maybe some of the little rules that Google tweaks will have wild unintended consequences  but I think they'll stay on top of it to correct things and bring it back to a happy medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I turned myself down.  Surely they are aware that everything they do has a huge impact.  It's almost like a terrarium.  You take the turtle out and everything dies.  It's an ecosystem.  I think that that's probably a fair comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you guys see the relationship of Google Plus to Twitter to Tumblr to blog posts?  How do you see the cloud of chatras evolving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My question here is, and maybe Bill has some insight and I know you and Kevin might as  well, it's clear that there's a lot of stickiness and appeal to Google Plus.  I'm just not sure what it is.  Maybe it's UI, maybe it's the group that's there right now.  I'm not sure how long lived that will be.  If it's just the group that's there now, that's going to change dramatically.  Is there some magic sauce in Google Plus and what is it?  Bill, do you have a thought on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For me, the biggest magic sauce is the group that is there certainly matters but I think  that there's something else they've done.  They have taken some of the best ideas of Facebook, some of the best ideas of Twitter  and then they've added smart threading and smart groups.  That is a relatively small but big innovation at the same time.  It's small in that, well how could that little thing make that much difference?  But it really does.  It forms a new type of self-expression just like the rules of Twitter form a new type  of self-expression.  The asymmetry that you brought up about it relative to Facebook.  A whole life form emerged from the rules that Twitter set up and there's this new interesting  life form emerging because of the rules that have been set up.  Now as you said, it's a terrarium and then spammers are going to show up.  So right now the spammers weren't invited yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're the acid rain of the terrarium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's going to be amazing when it goes fully open.  People are going to be like every system trying to gain it for their benefit and find ways  to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It strikes me, I know you have a lot of investment in Twitter although I imagine all of your  clients, the Uber media clients, I mean they're really complete platform agnostic so it doesn't  from your point of view it doesn't matter.  In fact you might have some feelings about it not being Twitter after the way they treated  you and I won't go on any further.  I'm just wondering if though that Twitter may have what may happen is it's a very clear  roles may emerge for Twitter, Facebook and Google plus and they may be able to coexist  quite nicely.  Twitter really is going to I think become in many ways more infrastructure signaling  system.  That's what ended up happening to Friend Feed and Buzz.  People didn't even really visit that often.  They use it as a signaling system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that all of them are going to survive and thrive.  Yeah.  Twitter and Facebook are not going away because Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not a Twitter killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No but I think that there is going to be a level of innovation on those two platforms  on Twitter and Facebook that is forced by Google plus which I think is great for consumers.  That's right.  Totally great.  Yeah totally great.  I think Bing made Google raise their game in a great way.  I think Google plus is going to make everybody raise their game in a great way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One last question Bill and we'll let you go.  I know you have lots to do but I'm just curious if you see this as I have to say and this  is a show about Google about the cloud.  For the last year we kind of felt like Google maybe had lost its way a little bit was not  have not able to innovate in the way a small company a nimble company is able to innovate.  It strikes me that this launch along with Hangout and these new products kind of shows  a Google that is still innovative still is creative still can do something very significant.  Do you feel that is the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh I totally feel this is a Google has its mojo back moment.  Exactly.  I think that this is a collision of a lot of work.  Obviously this has been worked on for a long time but this is a collision of so many different  threads Google has been taking both their infrastructure their video their Chrome browser.  I think how valuable that is to this.  So many different threads have come together to make this great and it's the right time  and the right place and the right product.  I mean it's a really really well executed product.  So I think it's amazing to watch some of the companies today that are this big to watch  Apple a company this big to grow at that kind of rate to grow the revenues year over year  like they have with such wild innovation and to watch a company like Google that's this  big with that many tens of thousands of employees to innovate like this.  That is damn impressive really really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill's done so many great things at Idea Lab.  So many great companies have come out of Idea Lab.  Is there a company that you're excited about that's on the horizon that you want to talk  about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I'm doing a lot of stuff both on the internet but also in solar energy.  I have a dream that we can get solar energy to be less expensive than fossil fuels.  It's not an easy challenge but it's a very important one so I'm working very very hard  on that as well.  Where do you make the improvements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the efficiency on solar cells?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's both efficiency and cost and it's reducing the balance of system costs, it's  reducing all kinds of things to make it lower than fossil fuels.  Fossil fuels are so cheap because you just dig them out of the ground and burn them but  we're going to run out this century and it's either going to be pretty or ugly and if we  can come up with a cost effective solution we can make it be pretty and not ugly and  I'm hoping I can be a part of that.  One of the great things I saw this morning in the tour that Bill gave me besides it being

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a great space where you just feel creative all around and you know the ghosts of companies  that are here but he has a physical shop where they actually make things.  It's so Edison.  What all do they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well we have a full CNC machine shop that we make available to all the companies.  Not all the companies use it.  Obviously some of them use our servers and not our CNC milling machine but we try to  make it available so every company in the building can prototype rapidly, focus more  on its customer and not on the mechanics of getting things done and it's just one of the  philosophies that we have that's paid off very well for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really great.  It's so good to talk to you Bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh same here.  Thank you so much.  I admire what you're doing so much.  It's such an honor to be on your show.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel exactly the same.  Idealab.com but if you go to BillGroves.com guess where it takes you?  It takes you to the Google.  Thank you Bill.  Thank you very much.  Great to talk to you and thank you Jeff.  That's a once again Jeff Jarvis with the big score.  We're going to take a little break.  Jeff Jarvis and Kevin Marks are here.  We're talking about Google Plus.  But enough.  Enough of that.  I got to find out what you think of Murdoch.  The B-Sky B Initiative dead.  News of the world dead.  Is Rupert Murdoch finally, how could we put this?  Is he finally defanged?  Is he toast?  We'll talk about it in just a bit.  Before we do let me tell you about backup real quickly.  I want to talk about Carbonite.com.  You know what my friend Peter Krogh, we got to get him.  I think we're going to get him on Twitter photo very soon.  He's just a great photographer but also the author of a book called the Digital Asset  Management Book.  This is something every photographer has to deal with.  How do you protect your assets?  Cover your assets as you might say.  And of course it's all about good backups.  He coined the term 321 backup and I constantly refer to that when I'm talking about backups.  Now let me just tell you the 321 backup strategy then I'll tell you how Carbonite fits into  that.  321 means three copies of everything.  That could be the original in two copies.  If you delete the original then you've lost.  So you have to have three copies.  You know I see I hear people make one backup then delete the original say but I'm backed  up.  No that's one copy.  You got to have three copies of everything.  Two of them on different media.  So don't put everything on a USB key or an external hard drive because that's not going  to do it.  And finally and this is the most important one of them has to be off site.  If there's a disaster and you've got you know you've done the 321.  Well yeah well see I have a DVD here.  I've got an external hard drive here and I've got my original on the computer.  I've got 3 2 and then there's a fire.  You've lost them all.  You know somebody comes and steals everything.  You've lost them all.  You've got to have the off site backup.  Now there's no easier way to fulfill the requirements of 321 than carbonite.com.  Yes continue to make your local copy.  That's great.  That's easy.  It's fast.  It's right there.  If you've got USB keys around with me that's good.  But that off site backup carbonite.  Here's what happens.  Go to carbonite.com.  Install it on your PC or Mac.  It's free for the first two weeks.  No credit card or anything.  Just use the offer code twig.  Immediately starts using your internet connection to backup your data.  Now once that full backup set is done and by the way carbonite charges one flat rate  for all the data on your internal drive.  Once that backup is done then it's continually backing up whenever you're online.  It's really good for a laptop because you know all your when you carry around laptop  the whole world is in there right.  But carbonite whenever you're in an access point whenever you're at home it's backing  up backing up backing up and keeps you backed up.  That data is available anywhere.  It's true cloud storage.  You can log on to your carbonite account from any PC or Mac.  There's your stuff.  They even have an Android application a Blackberry app an iPhone app so you can always see your  data and should the worst happen restore is as simple as logging in your carbonite account  and pressing the restore button.  It's a good way to move to a new computer for instance.  So here's the deal.  Try it free for two weeks carbonite.com use the offer code twig.  When you decide to buy I know you will because it's such a good solution.  This is great for kids going off to college.  It's what I did with my daughter's laptop.  It's great for you know any device that isn't like a Chromebook that actually has data on  it.  When you decide to buy use the offer code twig.  It's fifty nine dollars for a year unlimited for a year but you'll get 14 months with the  price of 12 when you use the offer code twig.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right with carbonite.  Offer code twig.  So we've talked a little bit about this whole pretexting scandal.  It looks like not interesting.  It's not just the sun and the news of the world which are Rupert Murdoch's two big tabloids  in the UK but is the Times also involved in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not set not really known yet or even even if the sun is fully known yet.  You know part of the problem with reporting things in the UK is that you can't report  criminal activity too early in the process to prejudice the trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there is an investigation they've hauled in a bunch of people.  Yes.  And even and it's been it's kind of been admitted by some right that they were checking people's  voicemails you know by hacking.  Hacking is the wrong word to use.  It is.  The hackers get mad at it because it's simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you explain again how it was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you said pretexting so that's where you use social engineering to call up and get  a password or get some information.  We were talking with Steve Gibson our security guy earlier and he said also the fact is on  a lot of these voicemail accounts yours too and mine too there's a default remote access  pin which is often one two three four zero zero zero zero or at least in my case on many  of my phones the last four digits of the phone number all of which are known if you have  the phone number it's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what they would do is one reporter would call the number so that they tied up the line  so would go to the voicemail line and the other one would do the pretexting.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now it's not that it's so hard or so clever or so sophisticated it's just that it's unethical  as hell it's evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh it's awful it's awful and it was done to a report of as many as four thousand people  including the family of a murdered girl who was then thought to be missing including the  families of dead soldiers in Iraq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They in some cases erased these emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They erased the emails on the on the dead girls account so that more would be left so  they'd have more material.  Royals, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's account they tried to get the medical records of his  child I mean it's just really truly abhorrent and what's fascinating about it is I wrote  my little poem on on on plus this morning that you know Humpty Dumpty sat on a paywall  Humpty Dumpty had a great bail.  All the king's courses and all the king's men are now trying to fry him like an omelet.  And what's fascinating is that Murdoch was the one who built the biggest institution  of some would say put quotes around it air quotes around journalism but around news of  anybody.  He created this this institutional behemoth.  It had a very cozy relationship in the government media complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the other thing is bribes and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh police and and he was warned by the Guardian explicitly not to hire the former editor of  News of the World as his spokesman and Cameron rather and he did.  So the connections between the Murdoch Empire and government were very tight and cozy and  Murdoch himself is bringing it down.  I mean the company itself is bringing itself down.  So they they as you all know they close the news of the world which is a fairly abhorrent  but large tabloid.  They wanted to buy the sky B which was a huge prize Murdoch only knows 39 percent of it  and all of Parliament was proposed by the liberals but the but the conservatives the  government had to come in behind to and they would have voted today to urge him to drop  the bid.  So before that he dropped the bid which is a huge impact on the company.  People ask what the impact is going to be in the US for US listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He owns Fox News the Dow Jones folks who own republish the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a chance and this is only speculation this is not a prediction but after  I wrote this on Monday the Financial Times and Felix Salmon Reuters and others came in  John Gaffer at the FT came in and said the same thing.  I think that News Corp may have to get out of the news business because if all you are  is an entertainment executive then you're known to be rapacious.  That's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's allowed to be a shark if you're selling programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that he brings now such cooties to the news business and brings such presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why blame Rupert Murdoch for this?  Is he really to blame for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of his management.  The buck stops there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think he created a culture where this was encouraged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, encouraged.  But I want to be careful about that because let me say because I know right now there  are listeners of the show who get mad at me who are now tweeting away any second.  I'm not a stock Murdoch basher.  I worked for the company at TV Guide.  I want to say very loudly that I got no editorial interference there.  I got lots of editorial interference at Time Inc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing about the company is to know it's very Australian, very seated the pants, very  decentralized.  I think the culture is not so much that Rupert though he loves to find out what's on page  one of his papers and deal with that.  The culture is let's do something that will please the boss.  Let's do something that I know they'll like this.  It's that kind of culture.  It's not that he orders.  It maintains the deniability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Kevin, you must be somewhat of an observer on this.  It's funny because this story is only now gaining traction in the US in the last week.  Right.  Big story in the UK for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's been it's been it's been bubbling under for years.  This thing that The Guardian have been sort of digging away at this and that the phone  hacking stuff is, you know, they had a court case in 2006 or seven, wasn't it, Jeff?  So this is this is not this is not all new stuff.  It's just that they've actually brought up some more allegations.  But the other piece of this that that has been a sea change is that the political candidates  were all cowed by this.  They were worried that if the sun went against them, they'd lose the next election.  And so they would they would go soft on on the news, international papers and that stuff.  But what happened over the last two weeks is that there was a massive online backlash  against this campaign to get advertisers to withdraw their advertising for the news of  the world.  And that was, I think, a big part of what caused us to tip back back over and become  a massive cause for that again.  And so there's a lot of these allegations have been around for a long time.  Interesting.  Tom Watson, MP, who's someone I know through the Open Rights Group has been talking about  about this for years and being told to shut up by his party and so on.  And now the questions that he asked in parliament and the things being brought up in the news  stories.  So it's like the the institutions are sort of actually working as they're supposed to  now, but they had to get kicked into it by a sort of online campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Guardian has done spectacular work on this story.  A friend of mine is over in UK now and he said it feels very Watergate time like there.  And it's really quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much of this is Schadenfreude, though, on the Guardian's part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know this is hard.  Oh, they're delighted.  But this is very hard work.  As Kevin says, they went after it and after it.  Nick Davies, the reporter who is also is the one who convinced Assange to give him the  WikiLeaks data.  Davies is the brilliant kind of reporter.  Alan Rusberger, the editor of The Guardian, in full disclosure, as I write for The Guardian,  said in a wonderful video, summing up last week, that this was a week of the worst of  journalism.  Let's remember also the best of journalism.  The fear that I have is that the media in the news media in the UK are regulated non-TV  by the Press Complaints Commission, which is a private organization.  There's going to be a push to bring government regulation to news media.  I think that's why I'm not going to use my American quasi-libertarian soul just for that idea.  And I think it's the wrong thing to do.  And I think the real truth here is that the readers are your regulators.  The government proved to be a terrible regulator.  The government is part of the corruption, from police up to number 10.  And so the best thing we can do is to open up journalism more to more people.  Craig Newmark and I talked last week.  His hobby horse right now is fact checking.  I wonder how to make that scale so you don't just have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of out of work fact checkers who are glad to hear that.  There's business!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is business.  And so why shouldn't every news story have a fact check box on it?  The New York Times does.  We could crowd source it now.  You could start to do that, not put your hand over all the work for them.  A crowd could not do what Nick Davies did.  Absolutely not.  But the crowd can dig in documents.  The crowd can fact check things.  The crowd can raise questions about things.  The politicians say and journalists say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't that mean that we don't really need to do this anymore?  Because as soon as you publish a story, the hordes will jump on it and start to pick it apart.  And if there's a problem, they'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, don't you find that truly odd?  Yeah.  If you say anything wrong, there you go.  It's certainly true for us.  And the difference is the attitude about that.  The attitude that you have is, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  All right, let's move on.  I think that we've covered that.  It isn't technically a Google subject, but because Jeff is such a student observer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made it a little cloudy there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did a good job.  You got to cloudify it.  Oh, gosh, there's so much to talk about going on here that's not Google+.  I'm going to try to skip ahead.  Google Offers rolls out in more markets, including here in the San Francisco Bay Area and New  York City.  Got my new Google Shopper 2.0 with Google Offers.  Strange offer.  One of the local restaurants is offering $100 off on an education.  I think there's a mistake in here.  But otherwise, they've already got quite a few offers in my small little town of Petaluma.  Really?  Yeah.  So that means that the Google says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they manicurish or are they better than that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're not bad.  So here's Cucina Paradisa offering $100 off my tuition at the Italian restaurant down  the street.  Papa John's Pizza, Pistra Sabor, free churros, Los Arcos, Free Coffee Super Deal.  That's in Santa Rosa.  See, these are local.  I don't know.  I guess they've been doing this for longer than...  That's Eat.  Let's see what Play is.  And here's the...  Here's some $1,500 off of LASIK.  That's an impressive number.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little old Petaluma.  That's how many deals.  Little old Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Taekwondo, free first class.  AIM Mail Center, $2 off Notary Public Charges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll bet all those businesses have claimed their place pages and that's Google's low  hanging fruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, you know there is a little place button that shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why then.  Yeah, that's what they said they were going to do and that's what they're doing.  So now they have something else to sell the 6 million businesses that have claimed their  place pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Places, I think there's no reason not to do a place page.  That's just such an obvious...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not unlike...  I'm sorry not to go back to Plus, but it's not unlike how they're making the profile  page canonical for people.  They want the place page to be canonical for the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google offers now in Austin, Boston, Denver, New York City, Uptown, Downtown, and Midtown,  Oakland, East Bay, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New York City, the one so big we need three of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uptown, Downtown, and Midtown.  I'm not going Downtown.  But no San Jose.  Damn.  No San Jose.  I wonder if San Francisco means the whole Bay Area.  Let's see.  Oh, wait a minute.  You know what?  I was wrong.  So I was looking at...  So how do I look?  You have to get the new Google Shopper which just came out 2.0.  And then there is...  Then you have to subscribe.  And it looks like there actually is nothing to buy in Petaluma right now.  So whatever these other deals were...  Oh.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were Bay Area deals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they were in the Bay...  I don't understand the difference between that and Google offers.  But apparently there are offers.  I don't know why.  There are some...  There's...  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe it's...  Somebody at Google can explain what the difference is between offers and offers.  But apparently there is a difference.  I'll honor their offer.  And it'll be honor and offer all night.  Moving right along.  Let's keep going.  Jeff Jarvis said that.  No, I did not.  I say everything else, but I didn't say that.  Old jokes.  Old joke.  He offered her honor.  He honored her offer.  It was honor and offer all night.  Google Voice ad spam filters.  Let solicitors get caught in the web.  Another good reason to use Google Voice.  You can actually filter out the call you don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, on the regular phone, that's called do not call.  Yeah, but it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but they had this before, right?  They had numbers that were known to be solicitors and that you could then block them.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  So it's like a kismet for phone calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's creating a spam folder for phone calls, texts and voicemails.  The company's servers use collected data from other users marking similar messages as spam  as well as proprietary identification tools to help ensure that those generic creditor  or vacation sweepstakes calls never make it to your phone.  I love that idea.  It's a shame we need it because you're supposed to be able to say, and I try this all the  time with solicitors, please add me to your do not call list.  Right.  The problem is many of these solicitations now are coming from outside the US and they  go, I do not know what that list is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the great thing about the easiest signal you have is you pick up the phone and you  say hello.  And if there's a 15 second beat, you know what it is.  It's the phone room.  The phone room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we got one.  We got a live one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quick.  Right.  Android market has been updated.  Do you want to show?  I don't have it yet on my phone.  Apparently it's being rolled out.  Should I try it on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Look, it's beautiful.  I was looking at the Foursquare offers near me.  That was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, Foursquare also has offers.  In fact, Foursquare did this whole update to their Android app that makes it superior  to the iPhone app.  This is just the beginning.  I think you're going to start seeing as Android grows really fast that increasing.  It's just what happened with Windows and Mac.  Increasingly, people are going to go to Android first.  And I'm starting to see that a number of ways, including this Foursquare app where they put  notifications in and some other features that are not yet in the iPhone.  Of course, Google did it themselves.  Is this the old one or is this the old one?  I'm not sure.  That's the old one.  You want to see the new one?  Yeah.  Okay.  Rub your eyes.  Get ready.  This is so exciting, ladies and gentlemen.  This is the new market.  And it includes movies and books.  Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the difference between that and Google Books?  Is it just integrated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go out?  Okay.  I'm in apps right now.  Let's go to market.  Apps, games, books, movies.  I mean, it totally looks different.  This, by the way, is the nicest phone for Android, but you can't get it in the US yet.  It's Samsung's Galaxy 2S.  And oh, is it is it is it?  It's not mine.  I wish it were.  It's Eileen's.  She, of course, has to have the latest and greatest.  But it's it's just really Android lady.  She's an Android lady.  So let's look at Little Red Riding Hood.  Oh, this is a movie.  So I can rent this for three ninety nine.  Watch it on my phone or I presume tablet if I've paid for it.  It's got reviews.  It's got related.  Nicely done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really new for them.  Yeah.  One of the problems is they didn't have the Netflix ability.  So now they have their own Netflix.  Yeah.  The question is, do they have any good movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they have Little Red Riding Hood.  Well, hey, they're little red riding hood.  So little little Eileen Rivera, who has the best phone in the market, also then says to  me, and can I get the new Amazon tablet when it comes out?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it Android?  Yes, supposedly it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think she has a rumor, right?  This is from the Wall Street Journal.  Amazon.  I mean, I suppose that makes it a credible rumor.  Journal seems to do pretty well.  I think people leak stuff to the journal.  Amazon plans tablet by October.  Seattle based company will release two updated versions of its Kindle electronic reader as  well in the third quarter.  One will be a touchscreen device.  The other will not be touchscreen, but with approved and cheaper adaptation of the current  Kindle.  Amazon, of course, not commenting.  This is a rumor.  The Amazon tablet, according to the Journal, will have a nine inch screen.  It will run on Android.  It will not have a camera, said one person familiar with it, but it will watch, allow  Amazon customers to watch videos, read ebooks and listen to digital music they purchase  or rent from Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I presume they're not going to limit it to their tablets.  So anything you can do on Android, you can do from Amazon, you can do anywhere.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they want.  The Amazon is $139 version of the Kindle now, the 3G Kindle.  $139 is the lowest 3G they've ever offered, but you get ads from AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The advantage to Amazon to having its own tablet is what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would guess the same advantage Apple has owning the iPad.  They own the ecosystem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's two things to this.  One is that it means they get to put their app store on it as the default one.  And that means that they can sell not just books and media, but also apps through their  system, which is something, you know, at the moment, installing their app store is a major  pain on the Google ones.  Yeah, you have to go to a URL and...  Yeah.  I said the other piece of this is that the Nook is doing very well for Barnes and Noble.  One of the stories was that it was...  That's interesting.  It's competitive.  Top e-reader.  Yeah, it is.  And that started out as a sort of, you know, locked down Android that would only let you  read books.  And then you go, oh, let's let people install apps too.  And suddenly you got a $250 tablet that people actually want.  And they've got a lot of salespeople reading magazines and things on it because they're  selling it through the stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The speculation is, though, that the Nook's doing so well because it's color.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's part of it.  But the other part of it is that they have, you know, they have physical presence to sell  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a...  You go to a store...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could see before you buy.  They've got a hawker right up there pushing it hard.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you go to a store, the Nook Color is the number one leading e-reader sales for  the first time ever.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's somewhat related is the Philadelphia Inquirer is thinking about  selling... is selling slash giving away a tablet with long-term subscription.  Oh, that's good.  Well, yeah, you know, it reminds me of the early days of the web where a lot of newspaper  companies, Night Writter, decided they had to be ISPs.  Right.  And they started an ISP for dial-up.  And it seemed to make sense, but then again it doesn't.  It makes it seem that what you're a delivery business rather than you're a content business,  relationship business.  And so thinking you have to, you know, get people on tablets...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  But it's a reasonable bundle business to do, right?  It does make sense, doesn't it?  Rather, you know, you get promotions when you subscribe to things, they send you something  that's sort of vaguely related.  It's better than a toaster.  Yeah.  And if it is actually not some ridiculously locked down device, but an actual one that  you can sell other things on.  Yeah.  If it's like one of these, you know, these type ones that are actually quite nice, then  people will be attracted to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does sniff a smell of desperation a little bit, though.  I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What price point do you think tablet, you know, don't call it a seven, don't call it  a ten, a nine inch tablet will get to in two years?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's the subsidy cost?  I think we're talking a hundred, 150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wholesale cost, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, ARKOS already have some ones in that range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ARKOS is doing stuff.  Yeah.  But they're also saving money in various ways.  But yes, they're offering in very inexpensive Android tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw Nicholas Negroponte at an event at Harvard three weeks ago and the Berkman Center.  And he said what comes next for one laptop per child is one tablet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They realized that they.  By the way, speaking of one laptop per child, how many of you are using your Chromebook  on a regular basis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have one because I didn't get offered one.  Oh, Mr. Marks has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm using it right now.  But it is sitting here.  Do you like it?  Yeah.  I've got the I've got the twig episode guide up on it.  And I'm looking at that as my second screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it have anything to offer that makes it superior to a standard netbook?  It's just a netbook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not running Windows.  That's superior.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more secure, although I don't know if you can look at it and say, well, that feels  more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you can.  I mean, you can do the you can do the account switching thing.  Do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so cool.  I flew Virgin America yesterday and not on my short haul, but on the long haul.  They give you Samsung.  That's so amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Amazon is now offering unlimited cloud music storage, much like Google is at  least on its beta and Apple plans to with iCloud.  You still have to you have to buy a cloud drive storage plan.  So I'm not sure how it's not free.  But so if you if you don't pay for anything, you never buy nothing.  You get five gigs for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's the best strategic advantage to have?  Three choices.  Cloud account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you showing us there, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was showing the multiple login screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They needed that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the piece that you don't have on the iPad that you need and you don't have on the  other tablets or any of the other devices.  That's right.  Which is we can all log in with our Google accounts.  It pops up and turns into our machine and then we don't know how to go away again.  And so it becomes as a sort of family lying around competing device is actually really  handy for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that web apps, though, compete with standalone apps?  Do you really think people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it depends what you do.  Yeah.  For a lot of what I do, I'm reading stuff on the web.  I'm writing documents in Google Docs and doing Gmail.  I mean, I'm you know, I bought into that when I joined the company and I've stuck with it.  And it's the same with Salesforce.  Ours is very web based as well.  You can you can run a lot of your stuff on there.  I found for my wife, I gave her a try and she was like, yeah, I could use this.  I must surf the web and do email.  I think my wife would like it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does what she needs to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, if you are right, code is not the machine you want.  You know, edit video.  It's not the one video, not the machine you want.  Anything more serious.  It runs hang out quite nicely.  That works on it pretty well.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think education and companies, it makes a great deal of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so we were talking about it.  I'm sorry, we interrupted you, Jeff, on the Amazon cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, never mind. I was just going to go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think the advantage Amazon has over Google is that they sell crap.  I mean, Google, I mean, so it makes sense that if I buy a song  and it's now instantly in my cloud, that's nice.  I wish I was going to ask was this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the bigger advantage strategically?  Owning having a cloud account with somebody, owning the browser,  owning the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's that's germane to our Chrome discussion. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I mean, the point of the browser, you don't need to own it.  So I think only the browser is it's a necessary, but this is necessary  to have browser competition, which is why they built Chrome.  But they don't have to own the browser to make it make it magic and special.  I think that's the thing that there's some little things  that this does nicely, where the G chat is integrated to the system.  So it pops up over all the browser windows and pieces like that.  But there's nothing special that nobody else that anyone else couldn't have done to.  And the point is that the browsers are standard enough now that you can write stuff  and it will work across a broad range of devices.  You're not focused on one particular browser anymore.  I was hacking up on there was that thing about slope graphs.  So last night I've hacked around and writing a slope graph generator.  And then, you know, it runs on my three browsers on here.  It runs on the Chromebook. It runs on the two the two tablets.  It runs on my son's PC ish.  So that that was not me not spending lots of time trying to test it.  It was just like, I'll just use this library, write some code that draws  some graphics, puts it up on the screen using SVG.  And it actually works across quite a broad range of different devices.  And that's the that is the promise of the of the web platform.  So only the browser isn't isn't something that you need to do as a corporation.  But it's a valuable thing as a sort of infrastructure services.  There's a reason Apple had to build a browser  because they weren't relying on someone else for that.  And it's for Google to do that.  And now those two have done that.  We've got four competing ones.  You can choose one and bundle it.  You don't you don't need to know you don't need to make that investment again.  Amazon doesn't need to make that investment again.  And it's kind of the same with Facebook.  And Facebook doesn't make the investment again.  You know, they they they run across browsers that they've got.  They've got a nice choice of source ones that they could do.  They could they could customize one, perhaps, but they don't really need to.  And if you look at the way they've they've built the  the apps, they are relying more on the browser than on native apps.  So certainly for iPad and even for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I to answer your question, though, I think really  none none of them are sufficient.  I mean, it probably is better if you have to pick one of the three  to own the cloud.  But what you really want to own is you want to own  the ecosystem, the chain you want to own, which which which Amazon's  in very good position to do.  You buy it from Amazon.  It's stored on the cloud on Amazon.  It sits on your Amazon tablet, but it also works with any other device.  That's really I think isn't that where you want to be if you had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Amazon is the sleeper in all this.  We keep talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it's Amazon versus Apple.  I mean, really, that's what it's going to be.  And the problem with Apple is it's not open.  So if you're in the Amazon ecosystem,  I mean, the Apple ecosystem, you're in.  That's it. You're there's your choice.  You don't have nothing else you can do.  But but Amazon, it's kind of you can use this, but it'll work with,  you know, other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Amazon, Amazon is not dogmatic about this.  They're not dogmatic.  They got kindle apps and all the devices I've got here. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think the Amazon is the winner.  I mean, I hope Amazon is the winner in that respect.  The only advantage to the Apple model is you can create a kind of a unity  of experience that Amazon perhaps it may be it's more complicated, perhaps  requires more attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been going back and forth between two devices so much lately.  You know what drives me nutty about the Android tablet?  And otherwise, I love it.  Is that is the is the correction?  The typing correction.  Yeah, they don't have a very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it's a much better system for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tried to mount on the iPhone, so I like swipe on the Android.  And I wish that Android tablet had swiped.  Well, swipe. Yeah, you're right.  I'm very happy about a little phone when it comes to your eyes.  There's a taste thing there as well.  This is also like the Mac versus Windows fonts thing.  Well, no, no, no.  The correction itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's talking about the selection where you get that little  you get that little wedge, those wedgies that look like what it looks like a vice.  I put my text in a vice.  You're talking about that thing, right?  That piece. Yeah, I hate that thing.  And Apple's got the magnifying glass, which is so elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also the words it gives me if I start typing in a word.  Well, that's keyboard specific, right?  20 character word that I've typed before.  And I can't if I go back, you know, erase one letter changes to a whole other word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's but that's Jeff, that's completely keyboard specific.  So there's swipe, there's SwiftKey, there's nuance, has a very nice one called T9.  All of them do it differently.  Oh, so you should just try some other keyboards.  This and this is a huge advantage for Android.  I mean, I think this is one of one of I don't like swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But which ones should I use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would try an Amazon offer this for free a few weeks ago.  And I really like it. Nuance is T9 keyboard.  Somewhat like SwiftKey.  SwiftKey has a new one in beta that you might take a look at as well.  What do you like?  Eileen Rivera, hosts are all about Android showed.  Which keyboard do you use?  She likes the SwiftKey beta.  That's pretty interesting what they're doing there.  I haven't seen that one.  It's it combines tap and swipe and the recommendations and it learns from what you use.  One of the things that was cool about SwiftKey is if you type the same phrases a lot,  it will just all you have to do is hit space, space, space, space, because  it you know, you type the first letter in the phrase and it goes, yeah, yeah,  I know what you mean. And you just like we like to pull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They like. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually for somebody like me. It's amazing.  I must be a very repetitive person.  All right. Couple more stories. I got to go.  Paul Adams, did you know him when you were at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know him at Google, but I've I was very impressed with his  the presentation he read about that. And I've spoken to him since about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he left Google for Facebook. Right.  He did a Google canceled his book.  Yeah. Well, the thing is, he's the guy who kind of came up with that circles stuff  left and went to Facebook.  And then he wrote a book called Social Circles.  And Google is blocking it.  Is it that threatening to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know the inside story here, but the version I read  that was that they didn't want him to release this book  because it was based on what they hadn't released yet.  And they wanted to keep Emerald Sea as it then was under cover.  That was before Emerald Sea came out.  But that that excuse should be gone now.  And he said, well, if they're still not answering my calls.  And yeah, I guess they're kind of busy.  But it's not it doesn't seem great.  He says he's writing another book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it not the case that and I'm thinking about  Sheryl Sandberg here in the New Yorker profile by Ken Aleta,  in which one anonymous Googler said she is persona non grata here.  We feel that she is using her inside  knowledge of Google to give Facebook a leg up.  Simple things like Google takes three weeks to approve a new employment,  new employee. So she made sure Facebook took two,  giving them a little advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not inside knowledge of Google.  That's just like being slightly more efficient.  And that's just smart.  It was hiring process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But apparently now, you know better than I, but apparently she is like,  you know, hello, Sheryl.  She's not somebody they like much.  And I wonder if Paul is in that same boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He may have got a bit of that.  I mean, they may have felt, you know, he was,  they were encouraging to publish the book and then then he left.  And so then they felt it was like their book rather than his.  And then maybe some of that going on.  You're at Facebook now.  I hope I hope they're bigger than that.  They should be really that this thing.  But one of the part of the stuff he said about  not paying attention to the social scientists, I think that that rang very true to me.  And I think that's something that has got better.  And certainly we got a sense of that from the talks you had with  Vic and Bradley last week that they're actually paying more attention  that stuff and picking up on that now, which is which is encouraged  because that was that was a clear problem that I saw when I said that it wasn't that  it wasn't just that they weren't paying attention to social science,  that they didn't actually employ any or accept by accident.  You know, they ended up with Yuri Engstrom working there,  but that's because they bought his startup, not because they hired him  because he understands the sociology of the Internet so well.  Right. And he even goes as far as to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google sees every social problem as having an engineering solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there are engineers. That's what they do.  It's it's an experiment.  If you put a company entirely composed of software engineers, that's Google.  And to to to first approximation, there is the end.  There's the large sales organization that Sheryl Sandberg  put up when she was there and is still doing very well is it is not all engineers.  But all the PM people tend to have computer science degrees in Google as well.  So it is and it is, you know, you've read in the plex.  It's very data driven. It's it's very measured.  And it's not very nuanced on the on the social science side.  It's much it.  And I suppose the closest they've got there would be.  What's his name? The chief economist, he's the closest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they say that they have a very they may they may not have any.  They may be all engineers, but they do have a a guy early on.  They hired who's an economist.  Yes, yes. But he's an economist and he's kind of an engineering.  He's kind of an econometrician economist type. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whereas Zuckerberg, when I interviewed him, he made a point of saying that he  majored also in psychology. Right.  And I say in the book coming out September 26th  that Zuckerberg isn't so much an engineer, a social engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's really clear.  I mean, you could see that.  On the other hand, there is something anodyne about the engineering approach  to privacy. It's very clear and something a little creepy  about the social science approach to privacy.  It's much less.  It's much more mushy and gushy.  And I think that's one of the reasons we trust Google because they're engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I gave my talk on the value of publicness,  but I really concentrate on privacy this week at Google.  And I'm told that some of the and it was great, great group and funny  and wonderful and had a great time.  But I'm told that a few of the people who do things like encryption  thought that I was an edge case because they all know that.  Yeah, well, I do. Yes, I am.  Everybody. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have this problem, by the way, on all the Twitch shows  where we just assume we're like real people. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but that's also that's Google's problem, too.  Is that their presumption is that they they are typical.  And that was the thing that blew up in their faces with buzz because they're not.  You know, they're they're very not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's by the way, why I like a lot of what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Of course.  You know, they're doing things that, you know, we're we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we build for the edge case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're we're, you know, rich, educated, geeky people living in Silicon Valley.  We're exactly that.  And that's the thing for us.  And their challenge is to build it for, you know, poor people in the third world as well.  And that's the piece that they're not thinking about as clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the third people in the poor world should build their own.  I mean, poor people in the third world should build their own damn stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were scratching our edge, damn it.  Well, that's it. Tell them to get their own computers.  This is where the open source thing does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, that's what's happened with Android is that, you know,  China and India are using that to build their own work view  of how these things should behave rather than rather than Google's one.  So that there's that that piece is valid in that if you build this stuff  in a way that other people can remix and rebuild it, they will do interesting stuff with it.  And that's that's one of the pieces that's one of the narrative friends this week.  There was this maybe slightly nervous was that was the combination of no longer indexing Twitter.  The author stuff was like, we'll do the author stuff,  but you can only route it through a Google profile.  You can't use a, you know, another, you know, an H card or a V card or something on your own site.  We only verify if you connect it to our side.  And there's a there's a certain sense of we want to put ourselves in the middle again,  which was which is not the, you know, not the open web culture that Google built itself on.  So there's I'm you know, I think that the hearts in the right place where it came from.  We have to wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know a live search, which which who scotch the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Could it come from Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could. Yeah.  Or, you know, it could be one of these things where, you know, like when when Google and Facebook are trying to get something done,  and they don't trust, neither trust each other enough to sit down and have a sense of negotiation about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. We got to run.  I wish we didn't have to. This is so much fun.  And what there's so many things, other things we could talk about.  Our congratulations to the winners of the first Google Science Fair  and 15 finalists yesterday at Google's headquarters.  They streamed it, by the way, which is very cool on YouTube Live.  And the winners are, in fact, by the way, all girls, Lauren Hawj in the 13 to 14 age group.  She studied the effect of different marinades on the level of carcinogens and grilled chicken.  Sorry, that's just a great subject.  Naomi Shah in the 15 to 16 age group.  She endeavored to prove that making changes in indoor environments  that improve air quality can reduce people's reliance on asthma medications.  Interesting. These are these are a little they're very social.  It's good. Yeah.  And Sri Bose in the 17, 18 year old group, she discovered a way to improve ovarian cancer treatment for patients  when they built up a resistance to chemotherapy drugs.  Jesus. Smart, smart women.  And I just I think this is great that the first three winners of the Google Science Fair  should be women and so much for all the people who say, where are all the women?  Yep. In science and engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, during this, I was there during the science fair, I'll tell you where they went during it was  the families were in the Google swag shop like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also like it that the trophies of the three girls won are Lego made out of Lego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, that wraps it up. Let's get our we're going to we're going to get our  I don't know if Gina Gina normally does a tip of the week.  Do you want to do a tip, Kevin Marks?  I don't know if we asked you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am. Here's a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They think it could be a grand plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Literature tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, actually, let me ask you that.  OK, the graduate, you rewrite it for 2011  and Ben Braddock, you know, he just got out of college, doesn't know what to do with his life.  The guy, a friend of the family comes and pulls him over, says, Ben,  Ben, I want to tell you one thing, one word.  Now, in 1961, 67, it was plastic.  And actually, that was probably right.  What would you say the word would be if you were talking to a recent college  graduate, the one word?  Kevin Marks says one word kid.  Social mobile algorithms, green energy, green, greens, good greens, good green energy.  Waffles, battery or Charham bacon.  I think they're hungry. It must be lunchtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's tough to let you know, none of us lunch burrito

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're throwing all our words back at us.  Charham says you're going to have a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got one kid, one word for you, kid.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, it's kind of a stretch.  Let's see. The L.A. Times says that they looked at searches on Google  as an indication of the economy and found that  interest in investing in stocks is going to continue to go down  while the word saving gets a lot more requests.  And that's a fairly obvious thing.  And it's just a zeitgeist thing.  But it occurs to me lately that, you know, the guys who made a hedge  fund out of Twitter, this kind of data really shows what we think as a people  and indicates where we're going as a country.  The more public that can be, the better that can be for all of us.  The more that becomes open knowledge that we know.  So I would just say to the likes of Google and Facebook and Twitter,  this kind of data that you have in an aggregate form is ours.  We made it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But us, it's ours. Google did.  I have a tool and it's something I should have done a long time ago.  And it's something that many of you will will be.  Oh, of course. Obvious.  Duh. For the longest time, you know, I have a T-Mobile G2X and I've been waiting.  I'm on Froyo. I've been waiting. Just give me gingerbread.  I just want some gingerbread.  And supposedly it's in the offing and it has been for months.  If you're stuck with a phone, an Android phone that is not being updated.  May I highly recommend the Cyanogen mod?  It was easy as pie to root this phone.  It's a one click route.  You do have to connect it via USB and there's a lot of button pushing and stuff.  But once I put Cyanogen mod on here, CM7  release candidate one for this phone is now out.  It suddenly stopped rebooting.  It stopped crashing.  It got fast. It got reliable.  It made a huge difference.  He is doing amazing stuff.  In fact, let's get Cyanogen on if we can,  because I'd love to get him on the show.  He's taking the open source Android code, cleaning it up, polishing it with a large  team, I'm sure of volunteers and making really excellent ROMs  to make this completely legal, which it is.  In fact, HTC just announced they're going to stop blocking root  root exploits that they're going to support this.  And Google says it's OK as long as you don't include the proprietary  Google Apps, which he doesn't.  There are separate downloads that you put on here.  Of course, you get them all, but they're separate downloads.  He's just done a wonderful job of making a more stable operating system  than the stock operating system for many of these handset companies.  Best way to find out if your phone is or how to root your phone  and if there's a CM7 for your phone is to go to XDA-Developers.com  and search in the device database or just go to the forums  and search for the phone model that you have.  There are so many nice guys in there who who will help you and gals  who will help you unlock, upgrade and modify your phone.  Highly recommended.  If you've been afraid of doing this, don't be.  I was kind of stunned at how easy it was.  And and more importantly, because I had a bad experience  as jailbreaking the iPhone.  What a great result I got.  This thing is much more reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. Yes, sir.  Go to plus right now. Oh, dear.  I think we had our furthest.  I can't get to it. I think we have our first plus crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is plus down.  Well, I have plus is the home button on my sir on my.  No, it's just you. OK.  And of course, I've got animated panda gifts right there on the front page.  I spoke too soon.  But, you know, that's cute.  I don't mind starting my day with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is time you're going to get sick of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Who gets sick of pandas falling in the snow?  Nobody. They're cute.  They're cuddly.  And that's it for this week in Google.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, for joining us.  Even though you suffer from jet lag, Jeff, of course,  is the blogger at Buzz Machine dot com, the professor of journalism  at the City University of New York.  He's at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter, plus Jeff Jarvis on Google Plus.  And his new book is imminent September 26th.  Public Parts, Simon and Schuster.  Look for it. His current book, What Would Google Do is still a great read.  Thank you, Jeff, for being here. We appreciate it.  And filling in for Gina Trapani, who is in China  watching pandas go down slides into the snow, I might add.  Kevin Marks, thank you so much for being here.  Kevin is now at Salesforce dot com.  Chatter.com is the place to go to find out more about what he's working on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also wanted to mention Tamilvision dot TV.  Oh, I forgot. Yes, you have a wonderful podcast.  And we've got Paul Adams coming up on that in a couple of weeks.  I think it's maybe three weeks.  We've also got a bunch of other interesting people  could be talking about this, this social stuff then.  So if you if you're interested in the class and the social side of things,  that that's very much on topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, let me very let me plug this.  Heather and Deborah and you are just great.  It's a wonderful show,  which we had on the network for a while, and I'm glad that you've kept it going.  It's really fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're also thinking about maybe we could use  Hangouts as a way of doing video again, because the challenge is we can't  always we can't afford as much gear as you can.  But there may be a way to to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you might be able to get completely do a end around.  Yeah, very cool.  Thank you, Kevin, for being here. I appreciate it.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Thank you all for joining us.  We record Twig every Wednesday afternoon, one p.m. Pacific, four p.m.  Eastern at live dot TV.  That's two thousand UTC.  If you want to join us, if you can't watch live, don't worry.  You can download audio and video of the shows very easily from Twig dot TV slash  Twig or your favorite podcast aggregator.  I use Google Listen.  You could use iTunes.  It's it's everywhere you you want to be, including on the Roku box  and many other places. Thanks for being here.  Don't forget, we are going to the new studio.  We are not far off, just less than two weeks away from our new studio.  Two weeks hence this show will be from the new studio with a brand new look.  The costs are tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are your bricks by one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even if you've already bought a brick by another bricks,  that's what that TV. No, it's not tax detectable.  No, I'm not a charity. Yes, I do need your money.  It helps us build a better show.  And we actually I don't need to beg.  I really appreciate anybody who's contributed.  No need to. These shows are free and remain free.  But it is very helpful.  And I have to say, we've sold over a thousand bricks.  The wall of honor is starting to look really, really cool in the studio.  And I hope you come visit it.  Thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time on Twig.
