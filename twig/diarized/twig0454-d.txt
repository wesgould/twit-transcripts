Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cache FL y.com  This is twig this week in Google episode 454 recorded on April 25th 2018  The Oldsmobile of email  This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by rocket mortgage by quick and loans home plays a big role in your life  And that's why quick and loans created rocket mortgage  It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully so you can be confident that you're getting the right mortgage for you  It's time for twig this week in Google  I'm Jason Howell filling in as best as I can anyways for Leo the porch  Who usually when I'm filling in for him is gallivanting once again? I guess I just like that word  I like to think of Leo gallivanting somewhere and that's exactly what he's doing  But I'm always happy to jump on this week in Google  I'll be happy to be able to get a little bit of a better understanding of what's going on in the market  And that's exactly what he's doing, but I'm always happy to jump on this week in Google  I always have a lot of fun because I get to talk with amazing folks like Jeff Jarvis  You know him buzz machine calm professor at the CUNY

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's it going Jeff I was so the question is is Leo karaoke in there. Oh, that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen I haven't seen exactly how he's chosen to gallivant at this moment  But if he's because he's in Japan, right if he's in Japan and he's not carrot karaoke in is that how you actually say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of I was just trying to come up with something worse than gallivanting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gallivanting karaokeing whatever it's all the same to me. Also joining us is Matthew Ingram chief digital writer at  Cjr.org. How you doing Matthew? Good. I'm good. How are you? I'm doing alright doing amazing  I'm happy to be here with you guys talking about all things Google  But right before showtime  We had some non Google news that that just kind of dropped and it's kind of an important time right now because Facebook's been  Under the microscope to say the very least the last couple of months and apparently they just released their earnings report  I didn't have a chance to read through this Jeff. You were the one that that told me about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By bit right so revenue is up 49%  Year on year. Well, the bottom line is as Matthew said they're killing it  All the the alleged scandals and all that so far is not  kicking him in the groin  earnings per share are dollar 69 Wall Street expected dollar 35  Total revenue is 11 point nine seven billion  Daily active users  1.45 billion in line with expectations up 13% year on year  so the the you know, let's kill Facebook thing and I think is making a lot of impact and  the monthly active users also  I don't know if there  Yes, also up 13% and that's 2.2 billion versus a 2.19 billion expected  Profit 5.4 or 5 billion versus an expected 4.64 billion. So Facebook right now is doing just  Dandy, thank you very much Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And hashtag delete Facebook making little if any difference whatsoever to Facebook's bottom line  Which is kind of kind of makes a lot of sense. I mean is that a surprise? Yeah  You know, yeah, it's not a surprise  Although I'm surprised that it's not a surprise to a certain degree  That we can you know hear and learn  The things that we have and that it wouldn't have a material impact whatsoever  The stock is down 18% since Cambridge at Letica broke, but I suspect there'll be some folks buying it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know Facebook stock. Yeah, I think there's still a risk  I mean, I think some of the stock sell-off was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was an acknowledgement that there's still a risk of regulation that could impact the stock  Regulation that could impinge on Facebook's  Profits, you know, especially if it restricts what they can do with data  So there's I think there's still the potential for some of this stuff to impact the company  But it feels like it's not really at the moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we have let's see here I mean  so you've got Facebook dealing with  You know as best as it can dealing with a fallout of all the Cambridge Analytica stuff Zuckerberg goes to Washington  You know and still in the end at least as far as we can tell based on these earnings not a very big material  Effect on their bottom line Google had its or rather alphabet had its earnings  Report for q1 and there again big tech  Strong revenue grew 26 percent year-over-year  To thirty one point six billion dollars in the first quarter. It's actually alphabet is growing faster this time  Or this quarter compared to this quarter last year, then it had grown by 22 percent now. It's growing at a 26 percent rate and  Yeah, there's just there's there's no signs of any of this slow and obviously  some of the biggest, you know  potentially impactful things happening in the public sphere that would have  Its users maybe question their usage habits or doubt the the intentions of these companies  Making absolutely no difference. So apparently we've we've just all kind of succumb to the fact that this is how we live our lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we're okay with it. Well, yeah, and and you know again, I've been doing full disclosure  So I accepted money from Facebook at the school to start the news integrity initiative  I received no money personally from Facebook or any platform and we are independent of Facebook and of disclosure now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you did put a new wing on your house, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're flying and flying with it. No, but the vacation to Perugia was wonderful, isn't it Matthew? Oh  So  You know the thing I keep on saying is that is that if you go through your own feed in Facebook  Show me the Nazis right there not there. Yeah, it's true  You know, so there's all this argument. Oh my god, the world is falling apart  Everything is falling chicken a little  The the moral panic as I like to say on the show  That I believe is legitimately occurring right now. I mean, I think it's legitimately called a moral panic  Is a media narrative and a political narrative now that's going on that just isn't showing up in people's lives  And if you look at your Facebook feed and your Twitter feed and your Instagram and your Google searches  You're not seeing the world fall apart. You're seeing it was the same as it was a year ago. And you know what? It's pretty damn cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess I I feel like certainly talking to friends and family, you know, I've tried to explain  Cambridge Analytica I've tried to explain what the issues are  I don't think it really impacts a lot of people in their day to day and so to them Facebook is just you know  it's something you use and you  You accept the fact that you get something for nothing. And so maybe they're doing something with your data, but you don't really I think  Appreciate what it is exactly they're doing and I'm not I'm not saying people are stupid or just saying it's a complex  Issue it takes a lot of time to explain. It's extremely  Boring in some ways and so I think a lot of people just move on with their lives and and it doesn't impact them directly  That's not to say it's not important. So I think  Yeah, and there are things that have to be done  Lot that needs to be done  Yeah, and there are things that have to be done  By governments or by regulators or by whoever to to protect people. I mean, it's hard to discuss, you know  The poisoning of the environment or climate change or people would much rather just get on with their day  But that doesn't mean those things aren't important

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm working on a project  Matthew and I were just in the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, which is the greatest  I want to say it's a junket, but it's a great event  It's a wonderful journalism event and the pasta spectacular and the people are great  Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah wear the hair shirt. Yeah  So I I ran a panel there about the moral  Implications and imperatives of the decisions being made by platforms  Especially also media companies and and another one when Campbell Brown from Facebook did not come so I was gonna interview her  So instead I had four people on stage about what should Facebook do for news  And what struck me was is that when you get down to the details there is far from unanimity here, right?  One person on the panel says well Facebook should hire an editor the next person on the panel says the last thing Facebook should do is  hire an editor  The roundabout and I've been going doing some interviews for a project of working on on this moral basis question  And it's the only that strikes me so far is how there's not agreement  Even about what the problem is what the solution is what the expectations are it's it's a complex nuanced topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  I I get confused even and like I you know work in this kind of stuff every day. I get confused to the to  Figuring out and really understanding how I feel about all this stuff  I keep going back and forth because I stepped away from Facebook  You know almost a year and a half now at this point but little pieces here and there I start like dipping my toe  Back in because I for very specific reasons  Then I have this like guilt that sets in where I'm like, wait a minute  I stepped away from Facebook because this this and this and it's this does this mean that I'm okay with it and  But then and it feels very hypocritical. There's actually an article in here on the Wall Street Journal from  Christopher Mims  Who wrote basically asking the question why we aren't talking about Google in the same conversation as  You know what?  Everybody's been talking about with Facebook as far as harvesting data and what they're doing with your personal data  And like like I said, I feel very hypocritical about it because on one hand  I stepped away from Facebook because I because I saw things that were alarming to me as far as the potential use of data  And it felt I felt very manipulated by you know  Some of the things that were happening at them at the time that I stepped away  But then at the same time I spend my life here on Twitter  Talking all about Google and being all in on Android and everything when you know  The reality is Google is tracking and harvesting and you know  Manipulating that data as much if not even more than than Facebook is and so it's well  And I have a struggle a point that I'm at that I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what Jason I haven't written about this yet. Sorry Matthew. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what makes it so complex like Jeff was saying these are these are large  Conglomerations of services that we all use that are integrated into our daily lives Google in particular  I've you know got Android I use Gmail. I'm a Google fan  But that just means you know, I'm handing over more and more of my data to them  Yeah, Facebook I use all the time to connect with family and friends. It's a great service  so it's not that that  either one of these is inherently evil or inherently good it has  Good and bad aspects and that I think we have to think about the implications of you know  Our sort of connection to them and what that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me tell you about something else. I just did this week. I haven't read about this yet  There's a company called axiom ACX IOM. That's one of the cheese. I'm sorry  Can you guys lighten up on your end? I've been playing with this like crazy and I'm looking like I'm a ghost

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look like you're a CGI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's still not good. I'm sorry. I just look like I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay. Are you artificial intelligence? Are you a robot?  The Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Work on this so so anyway, so axiom has been around when I was at time Inc starting in 81  We use companies like axiom to be able to do  Individualized user data with your name and your address and your social security number and everything  So I wanted to axiom you can now ask where your data is and my you is a lot less specific and a lot less  Telling then what you get out of the platforms  But because they'll tell they'll say we know this about you, but they won't say how they know it or why they know at  What level but then I got a further report and it's it's pretty amazing  This is this has nothing to do with the internet folks. This is marketing and media world out there  They know my asset they don't know how they know the range of how much I have in assets. They have a good guess as to my income  They know what kind of brokers I use  they  Know that I have a checking account balance  They know what kind of investment I do  They know that I'm not likely to use a discount broker  They know what my discretionary spending is they  Put me in an economic spectrum. They have car information about me gifts. I buy  Where I travel all this stuff. There's huge amounts  You know, so everybody's going crazy get their data from Facebook and Google go get this stuff and this is again  This is tied to your name and your address and your social security number now at the same time. They also get crap wrong  Right because where I live they think I'm Republican ha

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now did they make that determination as far as you know because of where you live like that's just a blank I don't know  That's the problem. We don't know how they come up with this Google reveals a lot more about the how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right Amazon reveals their presumptions about the how you don't get the how are these guys?  But these guys know a tremendous amount and I would argue in ways that violate privacy  More when you consider that on Facebook what you're really doing is sharing  You're not doing a private transaction with the auto dealer that suddenly ends up here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, there's the the sort of voluntary nature. I mean Facebook no one reads the 85 page terms of service  But theoretically you agree to do those things  Databases are are accumulated without your knowledge and I I totally agree that if there's one thing we could get across  It's that Google and Facebook are a tiny proportion of this much larger problem  Which is that the entire economy is built on?  data  transfer hoarding knowledge  Understanding mining and so on and and they're just two I mean very large companies  But there's a massive massive kind of infrastructure of companies that do this all the time with our data  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Funny thing for given our context here is that they're what they they also get some things really wrong like worse than calling me Republican  Is they say that I prefer iPhones and blackberries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How'd you come up with that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This week in Google anyways like look at look at China's attempts to try and track people's social behavior and then  You know give them like allow them to fly or use the train or get medical services based on their kind of social  Performance if there's if all this data is being used in ways that we barely understand and lots of it is wrong  Decisions are going to be made that impact on us and we won't even know about it until it's too late

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely a lot of my own  It might qualify as techno panic I suppose but my my fears about all this stuff  When I read about how this is how this is actually happening right now. It almost feels like black mirror utope  You know the type of future in China the way they're doing this like social measuring and stuff based on data  that's the kind of stuff that frightens the hell out of me and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When it's government doing it government has power over you that Google and Facebook still do not have  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know I just I don't know what keeps it from moving in that direction eventually like the long tail  Hindsight is totally funny. You look backwards and you go man  We didn't see it at the time, but this is the direction that we were headed and we were just blind to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the manipulation that's gonna occur to there's a there's a big kerfuffle going on right now around Joy Reed MSNBC  and I'm a big fan of hers and  Glenn Rienwald went after there were some there was some anti gay  Post she did when she was making fun of her politician years ago that she apologized for and recanted and it's been many years  and so she's learned so like going green wall this week went after her and  Said that there were more posts found and in the way back machine and it's ridiculous and  when her people tried to say that it was  Manipulated it was it was hacked. Oh, yeah hacked now. I've just seen reports  Joan Walsh from salon who read her stuff for the last 17 years  Says that she read her blog and never saw this and her staff read her blog and never saw this and I read a  Security report that was done for joy read they've reported this stuff where things were added in  presumably before it went to to  Way back, but I don't know point is that you have a record out there that now you get and we see how news gets manipulated  If you want to get paranoid if you want to get techno panicky and moral panicky  You also recognize that there are the tools here to go after individuals in ways. This can be very hard to  Fight back and and so that's gonna cause another level of panic about this stuff. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hard to fight back hard to know what's true and and what's not like I read that last night and yes  About what you were talking about a lot of the posts that were supposedly pulled  From the way back machine before they were removed by request  I mean, you know a lot of that was really alarming stuff and the problem is it was removed from the way back machine  It happened a long time ago  And you've got some people saying that it happened in that she you know  She was the one that wrote it and some people saying that she wasn't and there's just no way  Like is there any way to know for sure and so  Everything it was a your doubt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a kind of forensic report that I read today that was done on our behalf  That was that relieved me because I'm a fan of hers  But but she has resources she had I mean that's part of the reason she's a target too, right?  But she has resources if it's just poor Joe Schmoe somebody decides to go after them, you know, how do we?  Get to a level of credibility  It's it's what Matthew and I do, you know worry about this stuff and write about it all the time  Around the so-called fake news  Realm. Yeah, but it's more than just news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and I think the thing that that frightens people about Facebook in particular is is  the sense that their data is being used by these shadowy groups some of which are tied to  US intelligence to affect  somehow the  way they perceive the world and the way they respond to things to effectively kind of try and  Manipulate them to behave in a certain way. There's no question that those things happen  Intelligence agencies try to do that  Foreign governments try to do that  The idea that that those sorts of things can be done  partially with targeting based on your personal data that was  Shared kind of without your knowledge is kind of a frightening prospect

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For sure  Let's see here. How about how about we move into fun things?  like like  Google's got a lot of random things that are suddenly hitting and I'm reminded of the fact that this is the time of year  We're a couple of weeks out from Google I oh at this point, which I kind of can't believe  But we're a few weeks out and I always kind of forget that this period you get a lot of  leaks about what you might see at Google I oh coming up a lot of  Announcements actual announcements from Google getting ahead of Google I oh so that there can either be something they can refer to from the stage  Two weeks ago we blah blah blah, and you've loved it so far those kinds of comments  And so we're we're perfectly fit into that period and we've got a bunch of stuff that falls right in there  We're gonna talk about that, but I think before that because it's a lot of them  Let's take a quick break and then we'll jump in and we'll tackle it all  This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by  Rocket mortgage by quick and loans if you are familiar with getting a mortgage if you've done the mortgage process yourself  Or maybe you haven't because you've heard it's complicated and it could be a challenge  You're not wrong the mortgage experience hasn't really been keeping up with the times  It was dated it needed a client focused technological revolution, and that's why quick and loans created rocket mortgage  Rocket mortgage gives you the confidence that you need when it comes to buying a home or even refinancing your existing home loan  It's simple it allows you to fully understand all the details and be confident that you're getting the right mortgage for you  That's so important when you're getting a mortgage you want to you want to understand it all and rocket mortgage makes make sure that you do  It's convenient the trusted partners allow you to share your financial information with rocket mortgage at the touch of a button  Because it's purely in the digital age it's in your pocket.

This is and actually today  We'll start with an actual announcement from Google  We've been hearing little rumors here and there that we might see a refreshed interface for Gmail  I've been using inbox for a couple of years now  So I've been kind of outside of the Gmail experience, but anyone anyone who's been using email  Would would probably agree that like the interface itself really tired really dated  It feels like a relic at this point or felt like one  so thankfully  Google felt that way too and they rolled out a huge update today  It's starting to hit desktop and mobile though as you know Google does things where they kind of roll it out slowly and in steps  So if you don't see it you will but but it worked for me. I went into Google  Gmail I checked the settings button in Gmail and sure enough at the top. It said try the new Gmail option

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so in so I went from from in a time mobile or you're talking desktop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Desktop, sorry not on mobile. I did this on desktop. All right, so oh no, I don't have it yet  and  Are you because I think it's also rolling out to?  G-suite users as well. So, you know Google likes to roll out things and then leave G suite users out in the cold  Yeah, I think they're doing it right this time. So you should be happy about that Jeff  Once you get it anyways, but so big changes look here. Sorry  How does it look well it's so what we're starting to hear about and we've got other things in here to kind of go  Along with this is I have a feeling at Google I'll we're gonna hear a lot about the new kind of  Approach to material design material design now has been around  For is it three years or four years been around for a decent amount of time  There have been changes but we've been hearing a lot about these big updates to material design  I've heard material design to the sequel  The electric boogaloo and and so we're gonna see a lot of what we're probably seeing  Here in the Gmail app, which is a lot of white space a lot of rounded corners type stuff  Oh, I just got it in my other email account. Oh you did. Okay, so you can look at it and then kind of pick it apart  It does from a design standpoint that looks different very different and it needed to be updated  And I think it looks a little bit more modern bright rounded oval buttons, you know all over the place elements that have movement  When you're interacting with the interface things that kind of move into place and out  Stuff like that on when you hover and drag it that that whole stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one of those one of those little those those those those  Macro those those kind of cook those French cookies the pastel colors  Macaron mean  Right that it feels like this thing is about to spew about some macarons

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it delicious? Is it like a little sweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fantastic, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want your business email painted with macarons? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It just feels a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bubbly. It's got that but at least it's a different it's different. It's a change  I mean it was looking pretty tired. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, amen was it was yeah, it was almost looking like old old-school G  Google search, you know, it's just like text and that's about it now  They're adding in more of the graphical elements and you can kind of see some of this stuff. There's three different views  So you've got which they call, you know, they're referring to the density of information  Default is a little bit more spacious that shows attachments in the list view  So you can click directly on those attachments similar what we've been doing in inbox and I'll open it up full screen everything  There's also comfortable which kind of minimizes things a little bit and then compact which is all about maximum density  Fitting the most on the screen and you don't really have direct access to those attachments that way  Also getting when you hover over a message it'll reveal buttons for archive  Delete read snooze. I know an inbox I use that all the time like that makes you fly through your email

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's good. I like that. I like that some of the features like snoozing and the the nudging even  I have found that the nudging helps because I have a tendency to forget

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but have you seen this with the nudging?  It'll it'll put highlights at top and then if I don't do anything today, it takes them out of highlights and put it in the back  So where to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is if you still a little bit but not too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Jeff what you're saying is you want to be able to nudge it to a future time and then still if you don't do  Anything with it. No, no there so it so it doesn't leave. Is that what you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm saying is when when Gmail would inbox nudges it for me  Four days ago you should do this or this is a highlight this person went right to you or any of those kinds of nudges  It puts it on top  I kind of like that  But then if I if I ignore it it's trying to learn from that and say well, I guess we were wrong  He didn't care. In fact, no I procrastinate  And so it disappears back into the into the regular email again, and then I really lose it because I where was it  I was up top. No, it's not a top anymore. It was up top

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember it. I think they're afraid of irritating you. I definitely find the nudging can get what they should be  Like like physically nudging someone like if you nudge them too much or too forcefully it gets super irritating and then yeah  I think you're right. Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing I mean, you know what I missed the one thing I miss from Gmail the one thing I miss is mark is unread  Oh, yeah, you're right inbox doesn't really have that inbox doesn't let you do that doesn't let you do that  Because because I see something on top that is still  That way I know that I still gotta deal with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean because I I use I will leave things unread as a reminder to me later to refer to  it and I think  And I think I've kind of worked myself out of that habit a little bit more  I've started to kind of trust a little bit more the you know  Hide hide this until tomorrow sort of thing and that way when it reappears tomorrow  I do something with it, which is kind of what you were talking about Jeff  But you actually have to do something with it  I mean inbox really seems to be built around this idea is inbox zero get it all down get it off  I've never used it like that. I just can't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Cuz I'm if I have more than like ten messages in the inbox I start to get anxious so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, okay everybody everybody start emailing Matthew. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have this kind of OCD thing where if it's unread I have to read it  So I will often mark things everything is read even if I haven't read it because I just get disturbed when I look at it  And there's it's like notifications on your phone  I I turn most of those off because I I get so obsessive about it  I have to you know that then I become compulsive about making sure the bubble goes away, and I'm no longer actually achieving anything  I'm just trying to get rid of the bubble

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when you okay, so if you have the need to read them all but you aren't equipped to deal with it now  Do you use the snooze tell later function is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I also have folders and stuff that I file things into that I check regularly I just  In many cases I wind up within bucks zero  Like I would say weekly  Wow, that's kind of yes, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't even know I don't even know what what that feels like that is yeah  I mean the only way I ever experienced that is if I declare email bankruptcy, which I've been many times  I just wipe it all out and be like, you know what the important stuff  I'm gonna hear back from someone  Deal with these three things because I know I need to everything else is red and hidden and I'm starting fresh and it always ends  Up back there. I just can't keep it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't look at my wife's email because she uses Gmail partly as a  Archiving and but she doesn't use folders. It's just the inbox and the trash folder so that both of them have  Ten or fifteen thousand unread emails in them and I just can't I can't even look at it  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, it's Google so they give you the search function. That's all you need is to know how to say that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. I have to confess here that I have turned into that horrible person. We're basically  If it's important enough, you'll bug me twice or three times  It happens and I hate myself for that but it's true. Yeah, and you're as famous as we are Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, these are just some of the things that come with the territory

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You jet to Perugia as we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well as far as Gmail is concerned a bunch of changes so you should definitely jump in there and check it out it does have  The what you were talking about Jeff where they did bring over the inbox feature that will  Resurface those messages after you know, does this need a follow-up?  Right or you emailed someone and you never heard back from them  Checking with them again or that's what that sort of stuff both have the presumptive responses to right now  Yes, actually actually they do. Yes Gmail now has the smart replies as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I must admit when I because I use inbox a lot, but then I go and use  Gmail on you know mobile device or the tablet and it's a shock in some cases because I've got to be used the inbox  Functionality and then I go back to Gmail. It's like going back in time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is so here's the question so is it just reporters trying to stir up fear that  We're they're worrying that inbox might disappear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man I meant to do this before the show because someone I saw someone had posted  Why they didn't think inbox was going away, you know some of the features are still in inbox that aren't quite over  to Gmail yet, and I don't know I think Google's kind of holding the line of  Look inbox is a different  Methodology, it's a different idea. We do some more experimental stuff there and it's just you know  It's there are a lot of similar features. Obviously now they've they brought a lot of those features over to Gmail  But those were good features to bring over right? Those are very useful  features for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like inbox is kind of their power user thing and so  They can try things out in that and see what the response is and then use that data to roll certain things out to Gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you're right. You're right Matthew, but there's there's kind of an irony in that and then the inbox is more  Automatic versus stick shift  Right, so you think you know, yeah Gmail is more like using pine to me now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow fine, there's a flashback  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo bragged last week that he still uses it. Oh  my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I feel stupid I need a reminder pine  Even Carson was laughing and I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an email system that was developed in the 50s. So, you know old people still use it. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, man, that's it's the old it's the old will be a little email

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If email were cars, that's basically where we've got  Yeah, so I I don't know if inbox is going anywhere  I think that was the initial fear because it seemed like a lot of the features were very redundant between the two products  But in using Gmail for a little bit even with these new changes today versus what I'm used to with inbox  I realized like the the environment is just very different, you know what I mean?  It feels different  There's a different kind of flow to how I use inbox versus how it was using Gmail and I think comparing  Gmail to a stick shift versus inbox to an automatic is a really great  I think that's a perfect analogy with Gmail even this morning  I felt like I was doing a lot more heavy lifting myself whereas with inbox  And maybe I'm just used to it  But I feel like I've got my flow and it does a lot of things smartly without me having to really get involved. So  Hopefully it doesn't go away because I like it  That should be Google's only metric is do I like it?  but sadly they don't do that which is  Which we'll talk about in a little bit  but before that let's talk about another new product that they revealed today, which is Google tasks and  Those of you who have been on Android for a really long time  Actually, those of you who have had gmail for a very long time would remember that tasks has existed in  in the past and then it really just kind of got de-emphasized to the point to where it went away and  You know, there was no support and now today  There's a new Google tasks app that has launched again with this bright bubbly UI that looks very  familiar if you've checked out the new UI on Gmail and  And I guess tasks yeah, they were they were in calendar as well  But they got really de-emphasized you really just kind of stopped relying on them because it didn't feel like Google was giving any sort  Of attention to it  But some of the some of the other UI elements that you will probably see at IO wouldn't material design to is  Announced likely are is this idea of bottom oriented UI?  elements things that you might  Skip from one section of the app to the other being located at the bottom instead of at the top which we've seen for a  very long time and that seems to be a direction that Google's going as well, so  Kind of sounds like we're gonna see more of that and you see that in in Google tasks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  App and I really wonder how they do those meetings, right? Yeah, let's move. I got an idea  Let's move it to the bottom to confuse everybody brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's do that company-wide but except for that team and except for that team. They'll get there in six months  They'll get there in eight months, but let's the rest of us do that. It's the bottom year

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you're if you're looking at usual like user data  Changes like that lead to huge increases engagement because people have to spend longer  Figuring out how to use the damn thing. So it looks like they're using it a lot. I guess so you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's so manipulative, but you're probably absolutely right whether they intend for that or not. It's good for that engagement number  This too is part of sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I have to say tasks and to-do lists apps and stuff are lost on me a guy for whatever reason I can't  Get myself to use them. I know that they're really useful lists are great. I know that lots of people use them effectively  I'm just not one of those people so I like it email myself reminders and then forget to read them  I should probably try harder, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel yeah, I've definitely had my time  Using and trying to rely on tasks apps in order to catalog things  It was actually really funny logging into this Google tasks app for you know  Once I installed it this morning because all of my previous categories were there from like six years ago  Right and it was like it was like walking into a time machine of what was happening in my life six years ago and  All the things that I was tracking then that was the time that I actually tracked it and tried to use it now  Kind of like you sometimes I'll email myself a reminder because I know that it'll arrive in my inbox and be unread  And it'll be that visual reminder that I can then dismiss later when I'm done with it finally  But a lot of times I scribble it down  I write down lists a lot more now than I ever have and it's really effective because I don't have to like oh  I want to remember this quick thing  Remember this quick thing unlock open app like I can just be like put it done move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sort of yeah, that was one of the first things I started doing with it because it was so quick to take a note  You just jot a few things down and then and it saves it. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't I have to I need your to-do list to remind me to use the to-do list  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Need a daily reminder 8 a.m. Remember to use your to-do list today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remind reminders I never I saw put that reminders and I and I ignore the reminders. I'm awful. I'm just awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really important. Someone will yell at me and tell me to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It's the whole email me three times that I'll reply to you mentality, but applied to town. Yeah  So the tasks app  You know, obviously the standard stuff create tasks create lists edit manage drag-and-drop UI  You can add details  You can also add sub tasks if you like also a due date with a reminder  But there is no time assigned so you can't say this needs to be done by 10 o'clock tomorrow  And this I feel like is a really this this next point is a really big miss  because I feel like this is kind of in a  Prime example of sometimes how Google has so many irons in the fire that they're their lines  Just don't meet up and they've missed a great opportunity  Is that it doesn't integrate with assistant like I want when I'm at home with my Google home to say hey G  Create a task and it would be purpose to be able what is your task and it throw it in there instead  I did that today and it said sure for that you can talk to swell enterprise. Is that okay? It's like no  It's not okay. You have a task app now do that instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other is my here's my little bit of hell  So I go and I find the Google task link and your administrator has not given you access to this item  See it's a I'm my own administrator  But I have to go I have to go I have to go manually  It is a 40 step process that I forget every time if I want a new app in Chrome because I'm a g-spot  I have to go and go through all these steps find this really not  Intuitive way to say yes, I'm giving myself permission to do what I want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's and this is the Jarvis hell that we hear about time  No, I mean I think it's it's constantly an issue right at least you can activate it from day one  But it's not easy apparently you got you know  And if you weren't you the administrator if you were just right user on it on somebody else's  Account or apps account you'd have to go through a lot more trouble to try and convince someone to get in there and do that  But at least it's possible. So there's the the shining light I suppose

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think integrating with it with the system  I mean that's got to happen right because that's that's gonna be the way 99% of people are gonna want to do this is  By saying something. I mean I've seen already  Friends and family with Google Homes or Alexa's one of the main uses in addition to setting timers is  Shopping lists or reminders or to-do lists. It's just a natural  Thing that I think people are comfortable doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and now I mean this this actually ties in with what you're talking about is this change that happened last April  so a year ago where  Google changed this that if you're talking to your Google Home and you try and make a shopping list instead of putting it into keep  It puts it on it's puts it what in the web somewhere. You have to actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know go on. Let me try. Let me try it. Pardon me audience. Really? Okay, Google like a separate site at a task

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's trying to do stuff. That's not a good  Not a task  Shopping list try and do a shop. No, I'm doing I'm trying to do the task

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, is there you think that they would have integrated it already, but no, yeah, even when you have it installed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the Google Express  I think it I think it what it does when you're trying doing a shopping list is that it add it creates a list in the Google Express  Interface or website or app or something?  So anyone who is using their their keep account to you know create a shopping list or whatever that just kind of went away and  You know, maybe with tasks that comes back, but I don't know it's it's so confusing as with so many things Google  It's so confusing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not a surprise that some things don't work with other things. Yeah  Or the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, such is life thank you for teaching us a life lesson Google  and then  Just to kind of round out here as far as material design to is concerned  It's like I said, we're probably gonna hear a lot more about this at Google I o  There are a number of other products that we're starting to see this happen  Chrome canary now has the whole rounded and bright UI interface  Including a pill shaped URL bar and you're gonna see that more because I don't know if you guys talked about this on  Twig a couple of weeks ago when there was a  leaked well  there was a  photo that Google put on one of its blog posts and then changed it to remove this part of it but it basically showed the  New launcher and down in the home button area instead of being a home button  It was like an oblong pill button and based on you know per people that know about this launcher  They're gonna move more towards a gesture based kind of UI  Element for the launcher as opposed to the standard multitasking multitasking  Home button and back button and so that pill shape  I think is probably gonna end up being a big part of material design to you see it in chrome canary  You see it in the gmail the new gmail interface in the you are and you know in the URL bar and bunch of other places  But the product sans or sound is it sans or sans product sans font  Which is the same font that Google's logo is in that seems to be constant across all these things  There's a language building in here and they're starting to kind of trickle it out into some of their other apps the Play Store  Google feed is testing it a bunch of other things. So  Apparently that's gonna be a big deal at Google I own a couple weeks  And I guess it should be I mean, it's what three four years old might as well  Yeah, might as well update it. What else is big? Oh, this is interesting. So  Messaging on Android  Apparently is not solved. I think we all  Think we all realize that  No  Rumors now of Google's new messaging effort effort. Tell me if you've heard this before  Called chat, but this time it's a little different  Chat is not necessarily a new app but rather a type of  RCS which stands for rich communication services back in 2015 Google bought jibe and  Primarily they did that to lay the groundwork for what's about to happen. Google's been working with carriers and manufacturers  Apparently they've got deals with  48 major carriers all the major carriers in the US and you know a bunch of the MVNOs and you know other sub

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Subcarriers whatever and then I was looking forward to this Jason. I figured you could explain this to me. I  So is this is all about trying to make the link to SMS through a carrier what's happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so so basically from what I understand about RCS is it's kind of next-generation  SMS SMS as as a platform as a as a protocol has been around a very long time. There's a lot of  modern messaging functionality  Functions that you can't do through SMS you can send texts you can see you know up to a certain character limit  You can say send photos, but it down res is the photos and video and you know to to reach size limits  There's a lot of things that it doesn't allow that we're very accustomed to with modern messaging apps  So the idea behind this chat, which is you know RCS is  That it's you know, it's called rich communication services  So its aim is to bring some more of those features into kind of like an upgrade more or less to SMS  So features like read receipts group chats  File transfers location sharing user presence  So when you're typing the other the person on the other end would see typing dot dot dot or something along those lines  kind of that dynamic  quality of modern messaging apps, but through something that's  Handled or managed more on the carrier level and that's why Google's been talking with all the carriers because Google has its own  flavor of  RCS and apparently all the carriers kind of had their own flavor  But in order to get them all on the same page Google has been working really hard to say hey ours is really good  You should support it because then all Android users will be able to talk to each other in a consistent way using RCS  So now we're going to talk about the RCS  So now stupid question time number one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Apple is able to do all that with his messaging because it controls the hardware  Yeah, and I think Apple from what little I understand about how iMessage works on the back end

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But from what I understand Apple has already  Kind of made these you know made these deals with the carriers to allow for it  They did that a long time ago. They did well, okay. Google has had a really hard time  And number two will this finally allow me to send

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Messages seamlessly from both desktop and phone  So as far as I know there will be a web component is that what you're asking like if there's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I can I SMS somebody from my for my as my wife can't from her Apple to my daughter?  Oh, I see I can't from my chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right from what I understand the web interface for this at some point will be released and it'll be similar to what you have with alo  Have you used the web interface for alo? It's basically like you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One day after I oh and then I stopped there like everybody else right because it's forgot it even existed  Yeah, it's not a it's not a website or a plug-in that you just open up and you can just go to the website

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can just go to the website and you can just go to the website and you can just go to the website

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a website or a plug-in that you just open up and boom you've got access to it  You go to the site and gives you a QR code  You use your phone with the app to scan the QR code and that sets up a direct link between your desktop  Computer and the data that's on your phone  so basically what it's what you're doing is you're using your desktop as a  Kind of an extension of sending a message through your phone. Does that make third last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's last I can be lying is what's it gonna take to link up all of this Android world with apples?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then and that's a really great question because that's one of the very big  Asterisks here is that I message does not as far as we know based on these rumors, by the way  This is not like fully announcing based on these rumors  I message does not fully support or support at all this particular flavor of RCS  I don't know if it supports RCS at all and will not I mean, let's face it Apple has zero

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know  Like there's nothing pushing Apple to do that  I message I think is a huge kind of walled garden something very very powerful that in  In my case two of my daughters moved back to Apple just so they could use I message  So they moved completely off a platform just to get I message  I mean, that's a that's a hugely powerful thing Apple has I find it hard to believe they're just gonna open up and  Integrate with every other you know, they want to keep that Apple only I think it's certainly been a very exclusive thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I message as far as like the like you say people will stay on the platform stay on the US  In some cases because I message exists and because all their friends have iPhones  Or iOS devices and I message has those functions that work with those other friends and if they aren't on that  Then they feel like they're being left out  So in what in some ways this if it rolls out the way that the the rumors are pointing to  This would be Android's equivalent to I message in the sense that all Android users would have that same functionality with other Android users  So, you know iOS has their playground  Android users have their playground and they're very very similar operating  Independently would there be any reason for those to cross?  That would be a great world to live in because then you know  If I'm chatting with someone that's on an iPhone  I would see that they're typing or whatever that sort of stuff  But maybe it makes a bit more of a business sense for Apple to keep it exclusive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure it would be it would be great to have that kind of interoperability  Like I remember the early instant messaging days when you couldn't message someone on another, you know  Messenger you had ICQ you couldn't  And and that was a horrible horrible time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't there a brief time when you could interoperate among among those so there was something called three shiny moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, truly and really allowed a message to multiple  And then I think I see Q added support for a bunch of them  But but the it was a little like not only being able to call people who had certain types of phones  You know, it was just a nonsensical like it makes sense from a business standpoint, but as a user it's it's horribly irritating  I can see definitely from Google's point of view  This is a smart way to kind of make up for the fact that they missed the sort of messaging boat  And in fact, they've missed it multiple times, you know, they they probably should have bought whatsapp  Maybe they tried to I don't know but you know, they've tried I don't I've lost count of the times  maybe, you know the number of times they tried to kind of read your mess and try again and  Reorient this app and that app and sometimes multiple apps that do similar things  this seems like a smart way to kind of do and run around it and  Make it more of something that's built into the phone as opposed to just another app that you download

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, did we?  We talked about the self-destructing emails that Google's doing as well  No, you know what we we didn't because that's interesting across across both email and you know various of the of the of the other  Communications tools the kids use today is this notion of self-destruction? Yeah, what we think about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good good extra feature on Gmail, you know, it's it's funny  I read about that in the rumors that I read about the upcoming Gmail interface  But I didn't see it written about today and in the release. I must have just completely missed it  I'm sure it's in there though  But the idea is that you could set a time at like an expiration date for a message  you could  I think you could you could do two-factor authentication for messages a bunch of I did see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were gonna add two factor on a per message base for a single message, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see here. Oh, that's a lit. That's an older link scooter X. But yeah, I'm not sure what I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think about that. So if somebody sends me a threatening email  Right a nasty horrible email  And I want to save it for my files because they did something bad  To me I can't you can't print it out. You can't screenshot it. You can't do all kinds  Oh, I guess I could take a camera to it  But right, but that's kind of it because it's in the senders control whatever this is where when you when you put things in the senders control  that's what you got a world of spam and and  Bad manipulation when you put it in the recipients control  Things are better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a tough that's a tough. I  Mean all swords cut in two directions are almost all and so I mean you can see why those things would be beneficial  But at the same time as you point out there are ways that they could be  Misused I'm thinking now Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives at one point could delete  messages from their Facebook Messenger  Going back in time like right and they could delete them from your inbox  Not just their own and and I think when people mentioned that they were doing this  You know, you're responsible. Why why are they doing that?  That's that's wrong that you should be able to delete something from someone's inbox and yet  You know, you can see why they might want to  So that things from years ago don't show up and get used against you in some way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's interesting from the perspective of you know a thread an email thread or a messaging thread is  Involves two people so it amongst two people's words if my email did like  Would it be that the person that retracts the the email all of their responses disappear?  Or is it that the entire dang thing disappears and whatever I happen to write even though it was the password to you know  the my my  Lottery winnings vault and my only one that I happen to email that person that one time it's gone  I don't get it to get access

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook what happened with Facebook was people noticed they went back to look at earlier  Conversations with Mark Zuckerberg and there were no responses. So their their responses were there but then there was just a vacuum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very subtle  But who's really going back to look at that so I guess if you had a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that these we're when we're talking about social relationships and social networks  There is no such thing as just your information  Do you know what I mean? So let's go Matthew exactly  People are talking about I need to control to own my data or I need to control what's done with my data  Well in the case of something like Facebook or even an address book, is that my data are my friends phone numbers?  Do they belong to me? No, they belong to my friends. So why should I be able to control what happens to their phone number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so glad you say that Matthew  You know when you buy something from Amazon you tell Amazon to forget well Amazon your every time there's a transaction social or otherwise  One side is not in control of it. You're exactly right. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and I think that's why it's so complicated to come up with ways to deal with this stuff because  Like let's say you you Facebook had to ask everyone if they wanted their information  That is their phone number to be shared. You'd literally have to ask billion two billion people  Times however many you know about the contacts in their address book. It's just I'm feet infeasible so  That even on us on the simplest level  It's hard to deal with the way that information gets all intermingled and interconnected

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, obviously we haven't figured out exactly how that's supposed to go because it's so confusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This this this bromide we have is people should control their data will define  Data and define control that is not as simple right by any means

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, especially when you're given controls  but you know like permissions and capability of  You know accepting or denying permissions and everything  but if you don't actually know what those permissions are being used for or  You know you're using the permissions to control your data to say yes  I trust you in having access to my camera roll because you're doing some funny  You know thing that that I expect but then what happens after that or maybe you know contacts is a better better example in this launcher  I need to surface the pictures of my contacts  So I give you permission what happens after that when the company, you know pulls a Cambridge Analytica and says hey  We we had a reason to get it  In a public sense for this but we decided we already have access to it  So we've decided to do this and there's and I think that's where so people who took that personality quiz

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Said sure. I don't mind sharing, you know, my friends names or data with a personality quiz, right?  Because who cares it's some dumb Facebook quiz and yet right all of that data somehow  Leaks out and then companies use it for all sorts of nefarious things that you would never have agreed to  Nobody said I'd love for my data to be used by some shadowy organization to target  You know voters and or to try and rig the Kenyan election or something like nobody  Nobody would have agreed to those terms. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No  Absolutely  One thing I want to jump back to chat real quick to also point out because I think this is something that people have been focusing  On is that this new chat?  Protocol does not have any sort of end-to-end encryption  Involves I saw a lot of people, you know complaining about that and rightfully so I feel like I feel like in this day and age  You know, we're we we talk so much about security  It almost seems like a no-brainer for messaging apps to have some sort of end-to-end encryption integrated should be said  However that this is a replacement for SMS which also has no end-to-end encryption  So to that degree, it's the net effect is the same  I suppose not that that excuses it but keep that in mind like I think end-to-end encryption  I I'm not sure exactly exactly how that is coordinated at a carrier to carrier level  You know what? I mean like it's it's easy for an app that's installed on my phone and and that the services  Servers in the cloud to facilitate end-to-end encryption  Is it that easy for the carriers and the answer is probably that it probably is to some degree  But for whatever reason it's not happening here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's a fair point. This is much more like an upgrade to SMS and it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see here in other things that might change  YouTube remix or whatever they're they're working on that would be the new YouTube music platform if you are a user of  And which I am of the Google Play music the music service droid life says that they have a source  That it's going away at some point or that your discussion on on all about Android was exactly right about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm upset about that. I'm  Upset about that. I'm I'm to about this. I am too because I like Google Play music  Yeah, I do too. I use it a lot and and and and and and YouTube search has always sucked  Mm-hmm  Ironically, I mean I get from a professional

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  why they why they might want to do this so that there aren't so many competing things, but  Google Play is a perfectly  Fine service and useful that lots of people  It feels like you know, I just had a flash Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because you know what my my way of watching shows is Google Play movies  They put that into YouTube. Oh my lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that that Google Play that play rebranding we did years ago we've decided we're doing something different we're gonna brand everything YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna pull a navigation at the bottom. That's what the kids want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know to that degree  I guess I I understand from a marketing and you know standpoint that YouTube is a very strong media brand  I mean about as strong as you get in modern, you know with  With modern-day kind of viewing habits and stuff YouTube's right at the top. So, okay  You know, maybe it's makes sense to move music in there  I'm just and and I don't want to be afraid because it's new and it's changed  I'm always trying to tell myself don't be afraid because of its change because of change and be afraid of something that hasn't even happened yet  But man if they get rid of the my ability to keep my music library uploaded on their servers  That's gonna be I mean that that could be the straw that that breaks my back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that'd be the end for me because that is one of the main things I like about it. That's I mean I I use Spotify  I've even used Amazon music, but I keep coming back to Google Play  And the main reason is because I have all kinds of music uploaded there and it it gives me recommended music and other stuff  that's based on my existing library and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd literally can't get that anywhere else unless I are you paying monthly's Matthew for all those services. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Know does your wife know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not always white I can tell her  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just got over the fact that I was paying for Dropbox and Amazon AWS and Google Drive  You're a cloud storage baller I got rid of Amazon AWS  Still Google Drive and Dropbox. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm a little sad if this ends up being that that's sort of a change also  You know, so we're kind of wondering what happens to the uploaded library  Would this add too much emphasis on video?  That's another concern that I have because I have no interest in video  Music I also know that it's for the kids, right? That's that's how they use YouTube. I watch my daughters do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's their main sort of media consumption vehicle  Video is a huge part of the way they consume  Everything information of all kinds music or anything else  But I admit I don't like if I want to listen to music  I want to see a bunch of dumb music videos or stupid YouTube compilation things. I just want to listen to the music  Yeah, yeah, and sometimes I hear the music from YouTube that that's found on there and it's definitely less quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know lower quality than  What you find on music services?  Way fine on music services  I have to imagine if if they were actually going the route of replacing one for the other entirely  That they would bring the quality of that music up to standard industry level because they're also competing against Spotify  You know all these other companies that would eat, you know eat them for lunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting to me that if they do do this it's going to give  the RIAA  Even more ammunition I think to argue that they're not paying enough  Which is a continual kind of cry from the record industry that YouTube is a massive music consumption engine and it doesn't  Provide enough, you know to copyright holders when I think there's all sorts of problems with that argument  But if if they start  devoting more and more time  To YouTube as a music delivery  System get rid of Google play music and that just reinforces the idea that that's what YouTube is. It's a music discovery and consumption  mechanism which case  The our our a our a a's argument would be that they should pay as much as Spotify is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another unanswered question is what happens to podcasts they rolled podcasts into that app and funny you should ask because  Apparently Google has plans to change its podcast strategy and apparently saying apparently Google is enough to wake up assistant go away  That's a new wake word who can't even say the word Google I know exactly, huh? I'm here. I'm here  So apparently a goal the goal with this new podcast strategy is to double the amount of podcast  Listening in the world over the next couple years that's according to Zach Renault with Dean who is Google podcast  I'd call that God's work. Wouldn't you this is the most important thing in the world pretty important to us I would say  and  Let's see here Zach's realize it says that Google realizes falling way behind on what iOS has which is a dedicated  Podcast app and a dedicated podcast strategy that's actually worked pointing out that the average iPhone  Listens to over ten times more podcasting than the average Android that is a crazy statistic that I have never heard before

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a market opportunity right there. Holy cow  Yeah, no Google. They must have like that number would trigger  Aneurysms yes  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I and I hope that it does because if that is actually the case and there are 10  There's ten times more podcast listening happening on iPhones versus Android  I mean that's and why it's like that's crazy Google Google had listen not that it was a good app  But it had listen a long time ago  It had the opportunity to continue building that out and make something out of the podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thing I think it's definitely been a hole like a hole in their product suite for sure  I mean they've spent orders of magnitude more resources trying to  Revivify chat in 85 different ways and and yet have spent very little time on something that's become a huge  You know consumption mechanism for lots of people. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and Alex actually points out in chat. Thank you for reminding me of this says me, you know, maybe some of the  some of this with the androids lack of podcast  Strategy is due to the fact that the podcast section and play music is only available in the US. That's a constant  You know struggle with with Google and launching products hasn't launched outside of that  But apparently according to Pacific Content  Which is the the medium publication that's publishing a five-part series right now that dives into Google's podcast strategy  It could be because these changes are right around the corner  It kind of seems like if Google play music, you know might have an end-of-life in sight if those rumors are true  And then this put these posts with Pacific Content  There's a big change, you know a lot of change happening all at once kind of makes it seem more likely anyways  And in the case of podcasts  it sounds like you know based on some of these articles of Pacific Content that they would be  They would be  Doing a bunch of different changes around search and assistant to kind of integrate it  So deeper integration with search making podcasts in search a first-class citizen as they said  So alongside text images video  integrating search into podcast content  somehow, so if we do a show on I don't know Google and  You know Jeff Jarvis and Matthew Ingram are on  That there would be some sort of knowledge on the search side  So that when people are searching for whatever they're searching for those paths cross and it surfaces it in an easy to easy  to act on way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a natural opportunity for Google  I mean search, you know, everyone has a favorite podcast or a couple but they're hard to find  It's hard to find new ones  It's a lot of it is word-of-mouth a lot of it is, you know  Maybe Apple's recommendations, but there's a huge opportunity to sort of make it easier for people to find  Good podcasts sort of find content within podcasts  Exactly within Jews where it's exciting  Imagine if that was integrated into a system you ask your Google home  You know play a podcast that's about X or  Find a podcast. That's about Y and  And  You know that that kind of consumption model just makes a huge amount of sense and Google's perfectly positioned to do that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right away that that post was incredibly long and detailed. It's a five-part series a five-part series

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes  Three three days worth now. They've got a few more days left  Yeah, they're stretching that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, some people really live podcasting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that's cited that's that's what it's all about right like what is it it's a Pacific content is a podcast  something something about podcast  Yeah  So we put some podcasts in your podcast yes makers of original podcasts with brands and one of entrepreneurs 100 brilliant companies  There you know the more you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will say podcast is one of those dumb words that's stuck around long after anybody remembers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What it were oh, you're gonna you're gonna piss off Dave Weiner  No, I like that. I like podcast. I think it's I think it's  It's it's nice that it's retro. I guess  The fact that he that a an iPod is retro is itself charming. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About the term movie, you know it moves so it's called a movie. That's a pretty dumb word

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, true yesterday I said it's okay I can videotape that I  Held up my phone and I was like, wait a minute. What am I doing?  Anyways exciting stuff for podcasts if Google does double down on that's good  Yeah, that's something to look forward to and speaking of podcasts also by the way Google has rolled out an update to assistant  Apparently to allow for starting a resuming podcast between those devices. I  Yeah, I mean that it makes a lot of sense that which basically means you can begin listening to a podcast on your phone  For example pause it and then ask your assistant on say Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play the latest this week in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well meta

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If we start echoing back to ourselves, it's gonna be really weird  Seeing you could pick up three seconds into that podcast on another device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is that's pretty effing amazing, you know, there's moments when you got to pull back and say wow  Yeah, it's cool  Instantly it knows where I am. Yeah. Yeah, and then it doesn't work in here right on that and I curse  Yeah, well, I was just going nuts with my printer  Yeah  They are the absolute worst took it took a half an hour of it kind of  Trying to figure out what I was doing I was driving screaming at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd think we'd have those figured out by now, but no, we do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do drivers anymore, right? You don't know those two anymore do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Show up took me the better part of a day to get my printer working under Linux. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like a fun day. Yeah, I bought a new laser printer just because it was all had Google print in it  That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has it made anything everything more simple for you simplified your life because it's all I can do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on Chrome OS  You're not installing drivers or anything. You can't print directly. Yeah, so you need to go through Google print  But once you do that, I can print from anywhere except the office

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Slight problem there. I still remember this is sort of tangential  But I remember remember when people's Wi-Fi they would often leave it unlocked  So my my neighbor had his  He had a Wi-Fi printer which was still relatively new and I could see it from next door  And so I I considered typing out a message saying hey  you should lock down your Wi-Fi and print it printed out on his printer because I  and  And then the next day I told him that I had decided not to do that  And he said that's good because I had like $50 photo printer paper in there  Note about my Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And being Canadian you apologize for something you didn't even do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, although if that had printed out he could have just framed it and give it he could have framed it that's right  Yeah, it looked really nice on your wall

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like and you have to put it up for a year, that's your that's your payback  Probably getting close to pics and tips and all that kind of stuff  But before I do that, are there any stories that we haven't talked about that you guys want to jump into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on here. Let's go look at it. I mean, there's a lot of stuff  I think Facebook released its community standards what what it uses is not just we go to detail  It's a good move I guess smart the same as Google finally released a report on YouTube, right?  All this pressure is getting them to be more transparent about the stuff and why they do what they do, which is which is critical  I think so I'm glad about that and how can we leave behind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The secret Amazon robot. Oh, yes. Good. I'm happy that we did not leave the robot behind because then it would come back and kill  us later  codenamed Vesta  Amazon's lab 126 department has been working on this  They're also of course responsible for the echo and the fire and a whole bunch of other  Amazon stuff  These would be robots that are separate from you know, obviously separate effort from like their warehouse and manufacturing robots  Which are probably not nearly as cute as this will end up being I'm guessing  Job postings hirings of experts who are working in this field  For the you know a couple of years to create a home helper robot of some sort  Do we really know anything about like the form factor or what this actually means is it like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's rumors all but I kind of enjoy it. Yeah, they say it's separate from Amazon's, you know warehouse robotics  But but but it does make me think that just as AWS or something they had to do for themselves  They turn it into a huge business. Yeah, Amazon has a huge expertise in robotics  And  Move, you know robotics that get things and move things right that works in your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd love a robot to get me a beer from the fridge and bring it to me  That would be awesome and drop it on  Fall into the puddle of beer. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is these things don't scale but you can also imagine imagine if you could if you could have robots in for people who?  were disabled  Yeah, and just think like you know, go go get something  I can say something I can get it that would be very cool every time the subject of robots comes up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think of this artist whose name I can't remember who has  who creates  Robots that don't work very well. So she built them. Oh, yes  So she has one that pours the cereal and then tries to pour the milk and milk goes all over the table  And cereal goes everywhere. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Queen of se robots. Yeah, she's  Simone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is the one that I've seen the cereal one. That's great. There's I just saw this one here with lipstick

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, whenever I think about home robots. These are the videos that I remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the chat now everything starts somewhere  I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like whenever you see Star Trek or some movie, you know, the robots work perfectly right they do everything  Exactly, and you know, that's not gonna happen, you know, they're gonna blow it a bunch of times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's gonna be hilarious. Yeah, eventually that that'll happen, but that's a really far ways down the road. I have a feeling  and Amazon hopes to  Get us to Mars and hopes to get robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they'll be like the Boston Dynamics the dog robots the scary dogs. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean I'm kind of okay with that because I really want to see when in person  But I don't know if I would want to live with with a boss. Yeah  Yeah  And by the way, I don't know why I said Amazon's gonna get us to Mars  I was obviously getting them confused with the well-known Jeff wants to get us up there, too  Yes ambitions space ambitions, oh and what about Amazon now delivering stuff to your trunk the trunk of your car

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do we think of that? Yeah, that's I don't know every time one of those comes out  I think it's a an onion article  The one where they were gonna get you to give them access to her house like a key to your house  But it's a real thing. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So satire is impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, eventually  As relates to technology there's always at least someone out there that's like I don't know that sounds pretty cool to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody somebody I follow said the future will be Amazon warehouse where you just live in an Amazon Amazon warehouse  Deliver anything everything is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the fifth pod to the left

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  upstairs you live in a container that  Moves you around. Yeah, exactly. So everything  So what we're saying here is the rumors wrong Amazon's not going to build robots for the home

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Robots gonna become your home. Yes Amazon's gonna build your home and the robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The robots but someone I've you're talking about about the getting access to your home  One their  Review was that Amazon wanted that partly not just to drop out packages  But so that it could then offer other services in your home, you know, that makes it clean your home  Whatever cook you dinner. I don't know look after your time fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take it sure I'm coming home in a half an hour. Please have the pizza done and it's free with Amazon Prime  You know, and you know what? I'd have it make Matthew  What cut you a pet pay?  That only tastes good in Italy, I think I think you may be right I haven't found a good one here that it's it's it's  It's grown up macaroni and cheese. It's just pasta cheese and pepper and it's the best thing in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may only it may only taste good in Italy, but that's why Amazon has drones. Yeah, it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The old Charlie Brown  Comic I think it was that hot dogs hot dogs don't taste right unless they have a baseball stadium wrapped around them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true actually  cool any others before we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  jump on I  Think you hit most of them. There's a lot of being bought by smug mug. Yeah  Yes, all right Flickr  Was my first so I went in I had gone to Flickr in ages and I had you know, the horrible  Yahoo password hell. Oh, yeah, I've got I got back in today, you know, it's like whiteboards from five years ago  Pretty much stupid stuff. I didn't care if I lost. Yep, but I'm glad I'm glad that there you know, it has a life  I realized so go ahead. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was just gonna say that I  Number years ago. I tried  Smug mug and it's a great service. I don't know like I haven't used it recently  But if you were even remotely interested in photography  It was a great alternative to  sort of the free services that did so much but but not enough if you wanted to pay a little extra  Smug mug was a great service and and a great business. I thought so I hope I think it's probably a good home for Flickr

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I yes smug mug mug is just one of those  Those internet properties I never tried I don't even think I have a login for it  Was it was the idea behind this that it was just like high quality photos that you could then print on things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well design more for if you had a sort of professional portfolio  If you actually wanted not just collect videos to share or photos to share like Flickr  But if you wanted to do it kind of semi professionally then it it looked good  There were different themes and stuff you could use it made it very easy to kind of do it as a business in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this reminded me so I thought all well good Flickr got rescued for now that I remembered that  Delicious was rescued by the founder of YouTube and I didn't realize I went looking it up. It's dead gone  Yeah, yeah didn't work  Good bye. Bye. All those bookmarks I had there on  Yeah, not that I would not that I missed them it's like that closet you didn't you didn't clean out for two years  Yeah, and your wife says fine then throw everything in and out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually went back and  Went back to an old RSS reader  That I haven't used I think it was it might have been digger or or Feely and I hadn't used it in probably six years  And it was like a time capsule. Oh, yeah  So yeah and of the sites that I had in there don't exist anymore  And just reading the names it was like it was like reading, you know a list of comrades lost at sea or something  You know, like it just what happened site of the day. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and they were all gonna change the world at one point. Yeah. Yeah  Yep, they all aspire that way  Yeah, there've been many examples of like digital time capsules on today's show  tasks and  Yeah, you open it up and you're like, oh yeah, that's what my digital life was like five years ago  I'm sure we'll be saying the same thing about Google Photos when it goes away and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it took us in it rated into YouTube  That sounds like a type of hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I think we're good. I think we've made we've made it through the the big news  Sure, we've missed some stuff, but we have a few more things to to show off and I guess we can start with the pics  Jeff, do you have a number?  Some yes, I do  So you missed last week. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both delighted amused amazed and amazed  Your colleagues when I when I told them about the naked breakfast taco at Taco Bell  Where the shell was a fried egg  This is a thing that exists it absolutely exists  Absolutely exists and we discussed this last week. So I thought I would even though this is new to you since you weren't on last week  I thought I would continue the Taco Bell theme  Because a a college tournament  Contest was held last week  A college tournament contestant Rishabh Jain  When asked what he would do with a hundred thousand dollars  And if he won it in the championship said that he would buy a lifetime supply of Taco Bell. Oh my goodness  No, sadly tragically. He didn't  But Taco Bell sent him $500 worth of gift certificates

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little little small for the amount of publicity Taco Bell probably got out of that  Could have been nothing so, okay  Man, I have another lifetime talk about that would have been a really bad idea. Just saying yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Taco Bell. I like Taco Bell a lot. So  There's also a study from marketing firm Stone Temple  I never know how to take these marketing firm studies now seriously, but they they a  tested  4942 queries against Alexa Cortana Google assistant both home and phone and Siri and  Google assistant one on the smartphone the surprise here is that Cortana came in a close second  beating expectation  Siri no surprise  I like some but you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting that Cortana beat  Beat out Alexa  Microsoft gets no respect  Yeah, well, they've deaf. They've definitely been kind of a quiet  Entrant and in all of this I would say of the four of the really big ones  Anyways, yeah, Siri gets a lot of talk because it's not good  And so everybody talks about Siri because it's not good and that's what you talk about  Assistant seems by and large I've just and maybe it's just because I'm so entrenched in Google stuff  But assistant just always seems to give you  What you're actually looking for the majority of the time?  That's been my experience. Anyway, so I'm not surprised there, but Cortana. I really don't know very much about and why  It's on Android you could totally use it  You could actually replace it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't use assistant that much I use assistant in the car to look up the exact same Persian restaurant  Time and time again so I can call it  That's all you use it for  This kind of thing I use it for you because I just say okay Google search for Persian restaurants and some in New Jersey  Up it comes and there's a button right there. This is call and I asked for my  Hummus and and chicken kebab

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know the next step and actually order for me, which would be nice. It's coming  Man now on hummus you've sold and then and then Amazon could put it in my trunk. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe maybe maybe Taco Bell could wrap your next taco in hummus. I don't know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take it. All right, I would take  Wait you might have just invented something it's like it's like when you know when peanut butter met chocolate the first time  I don't know hummus taco. That's that beats the Korean tacos man, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure I didn't just I'm pretty sure I just I didn't just invent something good  I may have invented something but it's not something that anybody wants to try a pretty positive  We can all invent something it's just isn't any good  Does it actually exist apparently vegetarian hummus tacos with avocado cream?  Okay, but is well, I'll take a fine taco like you're still had Mediterranean ingredients inside  It's not like taco seasoned ground beef. Well, we got these Korean tacos everywhere  Okay, well food trucks tomatoes avocados. Okay. It's like what is the sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good point that's a good point whatever it is it has to have mustard I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think we're all hungry here  Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have any like tips or it says in here stuff? What is your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there was one thing that happened that we didn't get around to I don't know you mentioned it on other shows  But Amazon disclosed the number of prime  Amazon disclosed the number of prime subscribers for the first time  In Jeff Bezos's shareholder letter a hundred million people  Which to me is just a mind-boggling number  That's I think all close to a third of the United States  Population it's three times the population of Canada  That's just a mind-boggling number and you think about  This the services that Amazon is building into that  You know music deliver product delivery all the things that it's thinking about that we don't even know about that's just a  unbelievable kind of  Base of users to devoted users who paid for this monthly service that you can then funnel things through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And no kidding. Oh, yeah, that's right. So this was news from the 18th  So I think it was like last week and it flew by me and I didn't really  Put it into perspective, but I mean, I'm not surprised Amazon is a beast  Prime subscription is good  And continues to get stronger. I mean, which is why people do it. Yeah, exactly  I mean, it's it's popular and it's it's not popular because it's a really great value even though it's expensive  Like it's expensive from the top. It's obviously it's a great value because everybody understands like I ship this much  So it's gonna pay for itself. I watch this much  So it's gonna pay for itself like there are many ways how it pays for itself in very short amount of time  And that's that's why I'm amazed that it doesn't cost more than it does and I'm not giving you any ideas Amazon. Don't do that  You're making plenty  I  Thought I would show off an app that maybe maybe kind of flew  You know by the radar of this week in Google  I did search in the dock and I saw that it hadn't been mentioned on the show  So if it has I apologize, but it's an app by Google that you may have missed late last year  Google put out an app called. I don't know if it's data Lee or day tally. It's probably day tally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No data Lee. It is much better day tally sounds great on the year. It's got to be data Lee. I don't know  I  Hope it's not I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's I mean really it's gonna go either way because they spelled it that way and it's and it's open to interpretation  So your mileage may vary as far as how how it's pronounced, but what is it?  It's a data saving app data monitoring app for Android and it does a couple of  Specific things to do that. It's actually pretty interesting pretty effective  It kind of hinges around this data saver  Function which is a little slider once you give it permission what it's doing when I turn it on is it's actually  Activating a VPN inside the device and when I say VPN, I don't mean this is a VPN that you connect to out in the cloud  It's creating a VPN that all data when this is on now channels through and what that allows it to do is it allows it?  To analyze the data usage that's being employed by the apps that you have installed on your device  So you can see on the side here. I've got you know audible is locked essentially what this means is that  When the when the data saver is on any activity that might come from Google to use data  It will encounter because it's passing through that VPN  It will encounter the fact that it's locked and it will not allow that app to pull on  Data usage when I'm out and about it restricts based on on how you set it so I could you know set any of these  To not do it. I don't know why I would have inbox set  But now inbox is allowed to have mobile data  And if you've got high, you know high data apps or maybe apps that you don't trust what they're doing in the background  Or maybe they you know  They update randomly or whatever you can activate that when you're out and about and that will make sure that you aren't burning through  Your data when you don't want to be so if you want to save your data usage, this is one way to do it  And it's just kind of cool how it does it activating that VPN on the device. I can switch it back off  Hold on it's easier than it looks  And it's now off and you know, my device will operate as normal and then also it has this function here for finding  Wi-Fi that's local and in the area which is another way to obviously save on your mobile data if you're out and about and you  Don't want to use your mobile data, but you need to do something  That requires it you can find based on your location nearby Wi-Fi that's open and it will point you in that direction  I think maybe I'm guessing they're they're kind of pointing to  similar Wi-Fi access points that they already know about as trusted Wi-Fi access points thanks to project fi  Which is a part of that service that that project fi will know when you're in a certain area when you're close to a  Trusted Wi-Fi and it will opt for that so that you save on data  I think that's what you're getting out of a data layer date alley or whatever it is  So anyways, if you hadn't heard about it, it's kind of an interesting way to save data and you should check it out for Android
