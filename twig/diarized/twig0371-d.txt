It's time for this week in Google Twig.  I love it when Leo goes out of town.  I know that sounds weird.  It's not because I don't enjoy him being here,  but it usually means that I get to fill in on this week in Google.  And besides, he's having a lot more fun than any of us right now  on his travels vacation around the world.  I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo, and I'm super psyched to be here.  Joined as always, and really happy to talk once again to Jeff Jarvis.  How's it going, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I'm glad to be back.  I was gone for two weeks, but I'm here.  What do you like it or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it. I do not choose not.  I choose like it. Where were you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Working. I think I was.  I went to the online news association in Denver.  And I had something else.  I can't even forget what it was. OK.  Well, now you exciting life I lead.  I don't even know what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my life every single day.  It's like I get through the weekend.  They're like, how was your weekend?  I think it was good.  I don't know what I did, but it was good.  Also joining me on the show, Stacey Higginbotham.  How's it going, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going great. It's excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I haven't done Twig with you since you've since you've become  part of the Twig family, so it's really nice to do this with you.  Well, you're in for a treat, fella.  Excellent. Well, I know.  I know that I've podcasted in forums, I think, on tech news today  with Stacey in the past, at least once or twice.  Yeah. So I'm feisty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to be careful.  She's also excitable.  I appreciate both. Yes. Both qualities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got a lot of stuff to be excitable about this week.  What do you guys think?  We do indeed. This has been kind of a crazy week for news.  And this time around, I mean, there's tons of Google stuff to talk about this week,  which is perfect for a show called This Week in Google.  I think we kind of have to start with the obvious one, though.  The thing that as of last night, when I wrapped up doing one of my other shows,  Android App Arena, the very last app I reviewed on that show  is usually reserved for like the big app of the week.  And I picked wrong because Aloe wasn't released yet.  It's going to this episode's going to release this afternoon.  So it's already outdated, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should hit the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's Jason.  I'm going to leave my app pick for the end of the show,  because that's my pick of the week, because I got it.  I couldn't find anything else.  But a close second.  Actually, it's first.  It bests it is the release of Aloe.  This happened last night.  Aloe is Google's kind of smart chat app.  And it is now a thing that you can download on Android and iOS.  Just go to the Play Store.  No more waiting on the wait list.  Pre you know, they had a pre-release thing that you could sign up for  and get notified when it was done.  It's out.  And I feel like everybody has been using it and talking about it all morning long.  What are your thoughts?  Where do you guys come down on this new chat app, this new chat effort from Google?  Stacey, you're first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I think it's fun.  I love having everything integrated in there because I am the worst.  The second I switch from one app to another screen to find something or look something up,  I immediately forget whatever I was doing and focus on something completely different.  So this is nice.  I'm a little worried about Google kind of backtracking on the ability  to kind of delete information or move chats  to keep some of the chat information off their servers.  So I'm kind of like, oh, dang it, opt in to encryption.  And the way to do it's a little awkward.  And so far, it's not retroactive.  We tried to do that.  So if you start a conversation and suddenly things get, you know, sensitive,  you're like, oh, hold on, I got to start a new one in incognito mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think that that was a policy change or a technology limit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm guessing it was probably a policy change based on like  keeping the government placated.  Plus, it's also going to help Google develop a better product.  I mean, the more information they can slurp, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For sure, especially when it when it comes down to kind of the smart  kind of AI stuff that's happening underneath, obviously.  And I've got I've got the interface up here if you want to take it, Carson.  When you get replied, you know, or when you're sent a message,  you get those little smart replies down at the bottom that appear  similar to what you might get in inbox or whatever.  I found them to be super accurate.  So obviously, Google knows what it's doing and analyzing how I talk to people,  because it usually says exactly what I'm thinking about saying.  So you just tap it and it sends it right off.  But in order for it to do that, it needs to have unencumbered  access to your conversation, both for the word that you might want to say  at that moment and for the context that preceded that in order to get there.  And so I think that's Google's rationale anyways is, well, how else are we going  to bring you this really cool, neat kind of predictive stuff if we don't then  also have access to your conversation so we can analyze it and give you the things  that we think you need or that you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it might have been.  I was going to say might have been totally on point so far with the smart reply.  Kevin and I were Kevin Toffel and I were chatting back and forth and it gave me.  It wasn't actually right because we overlapped on our texting,  but it was right based on the context of the words that we said.  That makes sense?  I think so. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, Google at I.O.  had said that all conversations would be stored in an unidentifiable way.  And basically, I mean, if I don't know, I don't know why that changed.  I don't know if it's a policy thing like like you were saying, or maybe Google  just thinks it allows them to enables them to make a better product that will  satisfy the needs of people wanting to use it.  But I'm pretty disappointed in that, too.  I thought I feel like the trend right now with messaging is more secure, more secure.  And this feels like a big step backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we understand there's basically so one you can do an incognito, you can do an  encrypted doesn't appear anywhere chat.  Right. But you have to do it in advance.  You can.  The second question is, can you as you can't encrypt the history, which I kind of  get technically.  But, Stacey, your further suggestion is, could you erase you can't erase a chat if  it's not encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can erase a chat.  You can erase your whole history like I could delete our previous chats right here.  But you erase one chat.  I don't know if I can erase one chat.  Let's see if I can erase just that would seem to help some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that you can.  Like I'm tapping and holding on some of the ones.  Let's see if I can tap and hold on the last one that I dropped, which was me showing  off how the text you can make it bigger and smaller.  And there's nothing I can do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can delete an entire thread.  So I just deleted the entire conversation Kevin and I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can delete the conversations for sure.  You go out to your main list and is deleted for Kevin as well.  I think that's a good question.  That's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see if he responds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The shame to me.  Well, yeah, so I'm curious to know that actually, obviously, if you send him a new  message, you'll probably see it and that'll be a new thread.  But if I delete that that conversation, does it then disappear from Kevin's list?  Let's say that is a really good question.  But yeah, sorry.  Yeah. OK. All right.  Well, we'll hear about that.  I mean, basically, as far as this whole security thing is concerned, Motherboard,  Edward Snowden even has basically said, stay far away from Aloe.  Google easing up on the encryption protection basically is very bad for security.  Of course, this has been the drum that Snowden has been beating for a few years now.  I don't know. Is this I mean, but I guess my question there is, is this anything  more than what Google is already doing?  It already needs all this access to our emails, let's say, and we share potentially  we share way more about ourselves in email than we do in chat.  Or is that mistaken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that's true for young people.  I'm also going to tell you that Kevin got back and he said that our old thread is  still in his chat, so I could delete it on my phone, but not his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so the point is that if you were trying to having just done this  dastardly perfect murder, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know this about you, Stacey.  How did you know?  Things get more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's diabolical. You can be sure of it.  Right. So you we also so it's deleted from your view.  We don't know those deleted from Google's database.  And it certainly isn't deleted.  Obviously, is it because Kevin still has? Yeah, right.  So so either you have to encrypt going in or you're F'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically. But when you do that, of course,  you don't get any of the extra bells and whistles that.  I won't get small replies on my murder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My murder help.  I'm thinking of dissolving a body and lie.  Google, I've got a solution for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I told you, Jason, do not cross her.  Apparently not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to be really careful in this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. So what did Google promise at I.O.?  So what is what is the backtracking here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Google basically promised, from what I can remember, that by default,  the conversations were not going to be trackable to you,  that they were going to store conversations.  In for it, for access within the app,  but that it wouldn't be trackable to you in some way,  that they would make it less identifiable, let's say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they also said they would store the messages transiently.  Right. As opposed to the word.  So it was they promised end to end encryption in a in.  OK, I cannot say this word.  Incognito mode and then.  The story messages for a limited amount of time as opposed to forever.  And now they're saying they're going to store all non incognito messages by default.  And it's unclear if it's going to be identifiable. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So. Hmm.  Yeah, so I don't know how I feel.  I mean, this is going, I imagine it's just going to make those  who don't like the fact that Google has lots and lots of information about you  based on your usage of those products.  It's going to make those people not want to use this.  And there's going to be a whole other subset of people there like, yeah, well, whatever.  That's that's what I think there's going to be a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There'll be a lot of people caught out.  And if you start using incognito mode, people are going to be like, well, why?  That's a good point.  That is that's the whenever you make these things opt in as opposed to default.  Well, yes, it make it a choice to go private.  Right. Like, why are you going private? Right.  What have you got to hide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you about to tell me about the body that you just buried or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I, you know, I just told all of our listeners, so clearly I'm not worried.  Yeah, they're friends. They're friends.  They are. They would never give me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They deserve to know.  Oh, they love you.  So the other part of Aloe, of course.  Well, I mean, we're talking about it kind of tangentially, but the Google Assistant hooks.  And what can you do with Google Assistant when you first load up the app?  And I've got this up again here.  You enter into a conversation with Google Assistant.  And it allows you to do things like I played a game that I was very bad at  identifying movies based on emoji, essentially.  So you can play games.  You can solve riddles.  They have quiz doodle games,  different different functions around assistant, like getting to know  one another, essentially, basically, I mean, what we heard about at I.O.  that I that that Aloe would allow you to chat with Google Assistant.  So it wasn't very smart for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just put it I put it I was downtown.  Founders for my put in lunch, question mark.  It responded. Let's find you something to eat.  By the way, what kinds of food do you like?  I'll remember and give you better options.  So I answered burgers, Mexican, Italian fish.  Hmm. I didn't quite catch that.  Oh, no. What kind of food do you like?  OK, needs a sentence.  So I said, I like burgers, Mexican, Italian fish.  Still same response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Commas are there commas in the burgers comma?  There's commas. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe you should have just stuck with I like burgers or just burgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing. Do I do it four times? Right.  But one of their examples to you like one of their examples to me  was multiple things, I guess it wasn't the.  Noted anything else?  Can we try this? So I think there we go.  French. No, I don't like French.  Well, I do. But Mexican.  Mexican is my favorite.  Oh, come to Texas.  Are you back?  And I said Mexican and it said noted anything else.  So I'm going to try Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  French. I like burgers.  Noted anything else?  It gave me I like burgers as an auto complete.  Oh, what is it? I'm going to try fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  It got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand what happened to you.  Let's just.  So is it actually giving you options?  And it gave me bubblegum shrimp company.  Hey, Google, I got better taste than that.  I think I am.  I'm not a tourist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should know this about you, Jeff.  It's been. You should be.  I live here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting red lobster and bubblegum shrimp company.  Jesus, Google, surely, if you know me this well,  you know I'm a classier guy than that.  It's like very disappointed in your disappointment in me, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can they pay for that?  If you're Red Lobster, can you pay to get better features in aloe?  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a good question.  Now, how do you but it's also so it's got bubblegum shrimp company  and Le Bernardin, which is the the polar opposites of culture in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You know, pick one.  And if it sees you're eating at one or the other, then it'll give you  maybe better recommendations going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Bernadette, here's a brief.  I got Applebee's and I hop.  So, you know, I'm not going to try anything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, Jesus, you guys, it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I also got some other ones.  Namaste Kitchen Cafe Geostra.  Never heard of that one. Brazil barbecue.  But yeah, I hop in Applebee's, which I believe are like right around  the corner from the new studio.  So maybe that's more purely based on location than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And use it as my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I like so I oh, we're going to get the voice of Leo in a second.  Excellent. So as soon as I got aloe, I'm sitting in the conference and I  and I I obnoxiously I know he's on vacation, but I obnoxiously go to Leo  and I say, do you have aloe yet?  And he comes back.  How did you get it? I didn't see the Android or iOS, but then I'm in France.  Mixed feelings about that now.  And never mind, I just got a text on my six p five to the rescue.  So he comes in another account and Leo goes berserk.  He's immediately the the the master, the ninja.  France, Schmance, I got aloe.  See, I hope this I haven't played this.  Here's audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is Google playing at?  I can't use it as my default text messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My Nexus six p question mark.  It's just like he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's obviously using the voicemail feature as voice entry feature.  Which there are two different things.  They see you were talking about this in our chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then so then I say they're on their way to Stockholm for their cruise.  So I said, I love Stockholm.  You have to go to the Storaheuf, which I've been trying to push them to.  But he doesn't want to go because there's herring.  But I said, it's not just herring.  So then, you know, the quick intro for the restaurant came up.  So it's got cool stuff.  Mm hmm. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was chatting with Leo for quite a while this morning.  Actually, you can pull my screen here.  He was he was waiting at the airport.  So I think him and Lisa were just kind of bored.  And so we went for a long chat on here.  And actually, one of my one of the things that I really like about it  is that audio message feature right now.  I'm doing an episode of this week in Google.  Leo wish you were here.  But really, you're having just a tad more fun than we are.  Unless you're on an airplane.  If that's the case, then I'm very sorry.  So then I let go.  That's going to send him a 10 second message.  And right now I'm doing an episode this week.  All right. And you heard me do it the first time.  But it was really cool because like you start doing this.  It's almost like like this delayed cloud sync push to talk like  and not that voice messages are anything new.  But the way that Aloe kind of surfaces it, it makes it really easy to use  on the fly when you want to communicate something.  Maybe typing it just seems like, God, am I going to seriously sit here  for 15 seconds and swipe out my idea?  I'm just going to record my video and move on with my day  or my audio and move on with my day.  I really like that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's no undo button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which I was as I was like, don't.  So you got like two seconds of Stacy going, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I'm very happy to have.  Yes. Yeah, no, that's a really good point.  I mean, once you hold that down, that thing, when you let go of it, it's sending.  It's going whatever you say there.  Or if someone suddenly runs by yelling their social security number,  there's nothing you can do to prevent that from happening.  That is true. So I compare Aloe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Facebook Messenger, to Google Hangouts, to WhatsApp.  What's your what's your thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've really used WhatsApp, so it's hard for me to compare it to that.  But a lot of people are comparing this in many ways to WhatsApp.  Personally, I don't know that I don't know the comparison.  I know the voice mail or the voice message thing is very similar.  And a lot of the UI has similar kind of notes between the two.  Leo mentioned on that audio message that you played that there is no SMS integration.  A lot of people are upset with that, about the fact that you can't make this your SMS  app. Google did note it note that at I.O.  So that's not necessarily a surprise, but it it's it's one of those kind of indicators  that makes this this whole like Google and messaging kind of conversation  much more confusing. Right.  Google has so many different things going in messaging right now.  They've got Aloe for, you know, the smart chats between people.  They've got Hangouts for messaging between people.  I don't know, you know, the messenger is for the SMS aspect.  Hangouts is also for the SMS aspect, but now they've kind of removed some of the SMS  functionality, so it's not as much.  It's just so confusing. I don't know how you compare it because they're all different  enough, but similar enough, if that makes any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With Hangouts, you can still or I think you can still turn a conversation  incognito or I think it's take it off the record in the middle of a conversation.  Yes, and I like that. I do like that.  I'm trying to compare to WhatsApp.  It feels like comparing it feels like bringing WhatsApp in with some of the nice  features from Google now. So like when you click on one of these restaurants, like  Kevin and I were looking for restaurants in London and he actually just typed.  I think he typed, I want to steak dinner in London Saturday night.  And it just brought up a bunch of restaurants, you know, in London and being able to,  like, look at the menu from in there and all of that stuff was really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. And could you make a reservation from that point, too?  Like, I know some of these bots allow you to go further with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I clicked on a restaurant near me and it gives me the option in this case to call  directions, pictures, menu, or it tells me to go to other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So I guess I have those results, too.  I could tap into it and see what happens here.  Namaste. OK. And it gives me the information that you would get in like an informational  card on Google search. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you said I need to go to Berlin.  I thought I would say, oh, do you want flights?  Do you want this? And I just gave me the you know, the Brandenburg gates there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It didn't offer to teleport you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google flight. It's got a button for flights.  And I'm not sure what I expect from a chat app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah, that's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nice to have this in here.  I don't know. You know, again, I think it takes a little bit of programming on the user  side to think about using a chat app for some of this stuff.  Like I just it's not the first thing that occurs to me, but maybe that's just because I  haven't used a chat app for this sort of stuff very much yet.  Maybe it'll make sense as I use it more why I would choose Aloe to, you know, do these searches.  Oh, this is cool. What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. As someone who travels a lot, I asked it, I need a hotel in Seattle.  And some of the one of the options was under one hundred dollars USD.  So it gave me some hotels and some options.  And I clicked the one hundred hundred dollars and it just came up with a bunch of things for me.  Hmm. Like the Motel Six.  Excellent. Which book it.  Done. I can't actually book it.  Let's see Motel Six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you're better than that, Stacey.  It won't let you because it wants you to stay in a nicer place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not I wasn't actually going to stay in the Motel Six.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lobster. But it wants you to stay in the four seasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The four the first option was the Fairmont in Seattle.  So. Oh, OK. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's better, Stacey.  I was that I went to Jeff.  I don't know. You guys know Jeff Pulver.  You must know Jeff Pulver, Stacey. No, I do.  Jeff's a wonderful guy.  So yesterday I spoke. He has a new conference called.  I don't know what the hell to pronounce this mode age.  M.O.N.A.G.E. about about messaging.  And he put together a wonderful group of people.  I was the first speaker yesterday there.  As I said, there, Jeff is everybody's cousin.  You know, we all love Jeff.  But it was a conference about messaging, which included bots.  There were some brilliant bot people there.  And it is really just the beginning of this world. Yeah.  In terms of being able to use natural language processing  and AI to guess what you need and be able to bring stuff back.  I do think that the you know, is Google behind Siri and behind Amazon?  Yes. But I still think it has such capability that if it can  if it can hold on to this one and not pull a wave on it and kill it.  Though I was wrong about wave, I was wrong about all that stuff.  It was one of the ways.  But you think they have the the wherewithal to make this new and different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has a packaging problem. Yeah.  They know. I mean, they know what that's cool.  But and they did actually.  They just this week bought an AI company or a natural language processing company.  So the API.AI startup.  So maybe. Get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Tools for speech recognition and natural language comprehension.  Basically what that's all about.  Better voice recognition, better understanding of commands.  You can see this completely tie in with what we're talking about with assistant  potentially. And I mean, I should also add like assistant is kind of  is the new you know, it's like Google now, 2.0 essentially,  or probably even further than 2.0 at this point.  There are, you know, suddenly mentions of Google now in the Google app  are disappearing.  I think there's a single mention where there used to be a number of different  mentions in there now on tap is now named ScreenSearch within that app.  Now are renamed to feed.  So they're preparing this transition from Google now, which we are very used to  using for being our somewhat assistant to assistant,  being our total voice assistant comparable to something like Siri or whatever.  As far as what you were talking about, Jeff.  So that transition is happening, it seems like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the what's the what's the voice prompt?  It's still it's still OK, Google.  OK, Google, I would guess.  Sorry. OK, now we know we just started the whole world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Stacey didn't do it, I did it because we both did it back to back.  So apologies to everyone.  But hey, it still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But when when I apologized, I got the sorry song from Justin Bieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google really does know what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So I finally today got the the seven  dot download the new download for my Nexus six.  Oh, excellent.  I'm putting it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does it treat?  Let me know next week how it treats your battery, because mine has been no.  Has yours been bad?  OK, I because I test a lot of things, my phone is not as consistent,  but I feel like the battery has been draining faster.  So I feel like I'm getting about an hour less battery usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not alone.  There are definitely people that are complaining about that.  I've I have not noticed that on mine,  which I'm really surprised about, because usually that stuff hits me  for the same reason it does for you.  I install so many apps and uninstall so many apps and make so many changes  to my settings because of the shows that we do around here.  Like, I'm always monkeying with my phone.  So I always expect it to be the, you know, the worst of the worst  when it comes to stuff like that.  But I've not really noticed much battery difference.  So I don't know. But definitely you're not alone.  There are a lot of people complaining about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And someone in our chat actually put a link to the story about boot loops  on Nougat with five X owners.  And I actually had that issue, you guys.  And what happened?  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.  And that didn't help.  But then it went away.  So I'm not. So what happened?  Magically fixed.  But I will I will say that I had that same thing.  And it was really frustrating because I would pick up my phone and it would  just be brick or it'd be off.  And I'm like, what? What just happened?  So it says that this is a hardware related issue  and you should contact your place of purchase for warranty or repair options.  I bought it from Google.  So I suppose I could call them, but it seems to have stopped.  So I don't know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if it's doing it and they're offering a replacement.  Yeah, I guess if it happens again, take them up on that,  because you might as well have a perfect device.  You know, not a subpar device.  Although there is no such thing.  I was going to say the five X, there is such thing as perfect five X  because it's just had issues all around, I think.  So that's Aloe, any final thoughts on Aloe before we move on?  I think I think it's so new.  We have to spend time playing with it and everything.  But I don't know. I like what I see.  I just don't know if I'm really  thrilled about moving, you know, like my wife over to it and teaching.  You know what I mean?  Like moving people into this new thing when I've already done that a million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the compatibility with SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's actually a really good point.  So OK, so there is no SMS.  You cannot make this your SMS app.  So your SMS has to come into another app, let's say.  If you send a message to someone from your contacts list or a number  that is not registered as being a user of Aloe,  you know, Google determines this, your Aloe account is tied to your phone number  and you can only your conversations don't move from device to device.  So if I have a conversation with you,  you both on this device and I move to another device,  even though I put in my account, that's not going to follow me over there.  So it's all tied to your number and your device.  It's a little confusing.  But if I send a message to someone through SMS using Aloe  that doesn't have an Aloe account,  depending on where they're at and what OS they're using,  if they're on Android and they're in the US,  they're going to get this little toast message in Android.  And it's going to be the message relayed through Google servers via SMS,  but sent to their phone, not in their SMS app, but in this toast message  to say, here's the message.  Do you want to reply via SMS or do you want to install the app so you can do it?  It actually kind of looks a little spammy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks a little spammy.  Yeah, do you get that every time or is it a one time choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't know if it's an every time or one time choice thing.  I know that. And then the number that's associated with it is like a shortened  number in the US. And I can't remember the reason.  I think some FCC requirements around that aspect of it.  But if you're outside of the US in certain places,  you'll get the full phone number that the originating phone number that it was sent  from. So it's a little confusing.  And I don't know how I feel about it, but I understand why they're doing it  because they want to drive adoption of the app.  But the whole SMS aspect is a little strange.  So that is that I will take that as a as a reason to take a break here and move on  because we've got even more crazy news, hardware news for Android here coming up.  We'll talk about that in a second. But before we do, let's take a minute to thank Casper,  the sponsor of this episode.  I sleep on a Casper every single night, be it in my actual bedroom or be it in my  kids' bedroom. When our kids come into our bed and kick us out, I end up in their bed  and they have a Casper too. So we love Casper's in our house.  Casper's an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  Casper's actually changing the way that you buy mattresses.  They're revolutionizing this, the mattress industry, by cutting the cost of dealing  with resellers and showrooms.  And they pass that savings on directly to you, the consumer.  Casper's mattress is obsessively engineered and it's a fair price.  You'll see when you go to the site and check it out for yourself.  Casper combines two technologies.  There's a springy latex foam and then also a supportive memory foam as well.  And that creates an award winning sleep surface with just the right sink, just the  right bounce. You're going to fall asleep almost immediately when you lay down on  this thing. The Casper mattress is a 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation  Award winner.  Casper mattress provides long lasting comfort that's going to last you a really  long time and support.  And it's got a breathable design so you don't end up like super hot at night.  It keeps you cool, keeps your temperature regulated throughout the night so that  you're comfortable throughout.  You can buy it easily online.  That's a big part, a big component of what Casper's doing differently here.  It's completely risk free.  You can try on a Casper mattress in your home basically.  Casper understands the importance of truly trying out a mattress that in all reality  you're going to spend a third of your life on these things.  You better get it right.  Casper offers free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period.  So you don't have to lie down in a showroom for like two minutes and go, yep,  that's the one. We actually did that in our oldest daughter's room when we upgraded  her to a bed. And it's the bed that no one wants to sleep in because it's not as  comfortable as the Casper.  Casper offers just a whole lot more.  The engineering underneath the engineering of the mattress meets that the kind of  magical Goldilocks standard of just right.  So it's not too hard, not too soft.  And Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards.  They're made in the USA, free shipping and returns to the US and Canada.  So if you want to drop a pineapple on your Casper mattress, like you're seeing in  the ad here, get a Casper mattress today.  Five hundred dollars for a twin or nine hundred fifty dollars for a king size  compared to industry averages.  That's I think you can agree that's an outstanding price and you can save an  additional fifty dollars towards a mattress purchase as one of our audience  members by going to Casper dot com slash twig and entering promo code twig.  That's Casper dot com slash twig and make sure and enter the promo code twig  terms and conditions apply.  Check it out. You're going to sleep really good once you get one of these bad boys  in your home. And we thank Casper for their continued support of this week in  Google and the network.  All right. So I think the good transition at this point from Aloe and assistant,  especially because there's going to be some assistant, I have to imagine in some  ways at the event. But Google announced officially we've kind of heard often on  through the rumor mill that this was going to happen and that this date October  4th was the date that we were going to get a hardware announcement from Google.  And sure enough, they unveiled their announcement.  They have a teaser site. It's made by dot Google dot com.  And, you know, you can go there and see, well, a little teaser.  I mean, it's like it's like a search box that slowly morphs into the shape of a  phone. That's about all you get like a little carousel of pictures through there,  which I mean, we still don't even know if those pictures were taken with the phone  or phones that will be announced at the event.  And is it just phones as far as the rumor mill says?  No, so it's not. So what we're looking at as far as what we've heard and, you know,  things that we're expecting by the end of the year.  So we've got the Pixel phones.  So Nexus branding out, Pixel branding in for their phones.  Those would be the two HTC devices, the Pixel and the Pixel XL.  So a smaller five inch version and then a larger one.  I can't remember the size of the larger one if it's five point seven inches or what.  Yeah, these are some leaked photos because it's about that time where everybody's,  you know, dripping these out to the press so we can all get excited about them.  Made by HTC, which kind of goes counter to the slogan made by Google.  Personally, that's how I feel anyways.  Yeah.  Brought that up last night and all about Android.  And I think I was outnumbered in that in that belief.  I don't know. I feel like it's a little disingenuous to say this is made by Google  when it's when it's not. And none of the other Nexus devices were made by Google.  They weren't making that claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Pixel computer and tablet were made by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. And they they have the Google design stamp on them.  You know, they have a very different kind of design approach.  And to me, that looks made by Google.  And I just feel like calling these made by Google when they're not.  It just feels a little weird to me.  So what else is coming out?  So we've got those potentially.  We've got a tablet by Huawei.  Possibly it would be the seven seven P, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm eager for a seven inch to come back.  I love my seven inch loved it.  Mm hmm. And every Googler, a lot of Googlers I know, still carry their old Nexus sevens.  They were there attached to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, they're a good solid device.  So we might see that that's expected by years and based on what we've read.  I think it would be really strange for that to release or, you know,  be announced outside of this event.  This event seems like it would be the catch all for all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any rumors of a Chromebook Pixel?  I haven't heard anything about that.  No, that's that's that's depresses me since they don't aren't selling them anymore.  Right. Really depresses me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's a really good secret.  Maybe maybe, you know, like we hear a lot of these things ahead of time.  That would kind of make sense if Google's got especially if they're moving to the pixel  branding, you know, for a larger family of devices, you know,  and the device that started it all, the pixel gets an update.  You know, the Chromebook Pixel gets an update.  I don't know, but that's total speculation.  4K Chromecast, which I guess the 4K Chromecast was  potentially going to be released earlier this year.  It missed some sort of a release or announcement.  So that didn't happen.  So people are thinking we're probably going to see that here.  And then a big part of Android right now, at least part of Nougat is Daydream,  which is the virtual reality layer, let's say baked into Android OS,  as well as the Daydream spec for hardware.  So there are rumors that are saying a Daydream view would be called the Daydream view  headset might be shown off.  I think it's very likely we're going to hear something about VR and maybe some sort of  hardware shown off for VR because these phones, I have to imagine, are built with  Daydream in mind, especially the fact that Daydream is a component of Nougat.  So, I mean, you have to like, here's what we're talking about at I.O.  Here it is. I don't know.  Any of that stuff excite you, Stacey, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, no, because I'm not a huge tablet or I use a MacBook instead of, I'm sorry, a Pixel  or Chromebook.  And so none of that's super exciting.  I am waiting for the Google Home stuff.  The 4K Chromecast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like, yeah, Google Home.  That's the other part that I actually missed.  And that's actually a really exciting one, too, because it's got the got the assistant.  Do we think that's coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.  We think they're going to give us a lot more detail about that.  Yeah.  And so Kevin Toffle and I talk about this a little bit, and I'd love to get y'all's  opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it when you talk Texan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, it's more efficient.  So you've got Google Home and you're going to be talking to it.  And I'm going to say it again, you guys.  Should Google name their assistant?  So Google's named assistant assistant, but should it have a person's name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I feel like you put, yes, like Stacey, that would be I would hate them if they did  that.  My wife would hate them, too, because their name Stacey.  Yes, like Jarvis.  So, yes, you do that.  But I'm just thinking, you know, wouldn't that be a little bit more fun in the home?  Make it a little bit more like I.  Alexa has a seat at our table, basically.  When we when we talk at the dinner table, she we it's time to settle an argument or  ask something.  We actually try her first.  Sometimes she doesn't get it.  And then we move to Siri and only then will we actually talk to to Google because I  don't know.  It's just not she doesn't belong at the dinner table.  It doesn't.  I see Google still in it to me, whereas all the others are she's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, is the difference?  Well, I guess Siri would be this way.  I was thinking is the difference.  The fact that it's an appliance versus a device like I always feel weird pulling out  my phone, let's say at the dinner table at home anyways.  When I'm out with friends, maybe not as much.  We're just yelling to the air.  I don't know.  Like if it's if it's an appliance, then it's there.  It's not like you're going out of your way to tell everyone, all right, wait a second.  Let me pull it up this wall between us and ask this thing a question.  You all have equal opportunity to just kind of throw it out there and use it because  it's always there working.  You know, I'm fascinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is really I'm fascinated as we negotiate our new norms in society around  all this. I really am.  Yeah, it fascinates me that to you, the idea of playing with the phone and all that  is Google is somehow more in play than, hey, Google, when was FDR born?  I think it's an ether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've we've developed a way to like manage this, which is OK.  Oh, but you have.  We're arguing over something.  Oh, I think it's this or I think it's that.  And we're like, all right, all right, let's let Alexa decide.  Hey, Alexa, that.  So we've I mean, it's very much a negotiated thing.  I mean, like socially, we bring her in as a poet.  And it's there's a moment for people to be like, no, no, let's not bring a device.  No, don't invite Alexa again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, dinner is just never the same.  What's Alexa's every dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Such a know it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't you can't.  OK, that's interesting.  You can't just blurt out in the middle of nothing.  When you have a curiosity or you're asking something, you just turn and say,  you know, I don't know what was that?  Oh, hey, Alexa, what was that?  You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you could in that situation.  But we've got we've got my daughter, my husband and I, and we're usually  like in a conversation, so.  And I would like to bring up because people are talking about.  Being able to give your own name to these things.  And that's actually a really difficult problem for the hardware  and the computer scientists working on voice recognition.  So it's worth noting that deciding what to call one of these devices  because it's deciding on the wake world wake word for one of these devices  is actually difficult because they have to understand.  They have to make sure the false positives are kept to a minimum  and that it responds whenever you say something.  So it's got to be well trained into the computer in a bunch of different ways,  accents, and you throw it in in the middle of a lot of different inputs  because you don't always get this pure play.  Alexa, right.  Sometimes it's like across the room or hey, this or what not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the average person would not put any thought into,  oh, I'm going to give it this name.  And the fact that that name actually sounds very close to this other phrase  or two or three syllables that you say all the time in conversation.  So that wake word is constantly the the the eyes just thinking  that it's being woken up when it's in fact not.  No, no normal person would think about that.  They just go, I really like the name Bud.  So I'm going to do that.  And that sounds a lot like a lot of other words.  So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, but like, but I wasn't going to say it, but there you go.  Every time you say, but not only like that, I mean,  but on the other hand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  both, both, your mind goes how both both kinds of butts.  That's all I'm saying.  There are lots of different ways.  He's got young children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's probably a big thing in his house.  It's you know what else?  It's a constant struggle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The six year old to come in and sabotage it and name it fart.  I would laugh at that when I.  Yeah, you would every time.  Because we're hard.  That's Howard Stern thing.  That's why farts are funny.  Yeah, I tried to help you get past this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm like I would giggle.  I there used to be a Cardinals player named Albert Pujols,  and I would giggle literally every time he came up to bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never thought of it like that because I'm six inside.  I've heard his name a million times.  I've never thought of it like that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've ruined it, but he no longer.  You ruined me.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's OK.  The past tense of to drive in German is fart,  and every German student on the earth just giggles every single time it's said.  America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, I'm sorry that when I come on this show, it devolves to.  I pretty much do that.  OK, good. All right. Good. Not alone.  I don't know. I'm looking forward to it.  There was a there on the same day as the announcement of the hardware.  Google started this big advertising blitz, and it's kind of ongoing, right?  There was an ad run on the Big Bang Theory.  There was a leak of the phone.  I don't know if it's a leak or if it's intentional or what,  but a nest ad that was ran in the Netherlands  had a front and back shot of a device  that matches up with the leaks of the Pixel phone.  So I don't know if that like was a premature ad  or if that was meant to come out after the actual announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does anything look different about this phone? Really?  It looks pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't scrutinize it, but is there a head.  But what I'm saying is, is there anything that new about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hardware. Oh, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean just in general, what sets the hardware apart from?  No, I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like it has only one camera in the back, right?  Not. Yeah, one camera, a big parallax view stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It doesn't really look very, very different to me,  but it doesn't have a periscope like the 6P did.  Yeah. In the leaks.  So I don't know what to expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I know they did say didn't it?  Didn't someone say that it was going to cost six hundred and forty nine dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Premium price of these devices. Yes.  The small one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The small one. There it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is obviously leaked information.  So that could be that could change.  But I mean, that puts it that puts it squarely in the Samsung  Galaxy S seven range of cost for these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I pretty much unlike Leo, I don't have an expense account.  I pretty much buy every new one that comes out.  I my six piece still a good phone.  This is maybe the one time I don't know.  I made skip. Yeah.  Because also, if they do come out with a new  Chromebook Pixel, I need to save my bucks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And if they don't, I'm going to cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, Jeff, I'm just going to break down and cry right here in front of you all.  It's going to be very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could get the seven inch tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, doesn't do it.  No, I actually I am using my my Pixel C.  I mean, I'm sorry, my my Pixel C.  I got all these. I'm getting all confused.  Yeah, I use that a lot.  Is that a lot? I try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will be excited that when they they combine all the brands together  because I'm like pixels, Chromebooks, Nexai, Nexus's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, speaking of combining things like accounts.  So the new travel app is right.  The Google Travel thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  She says, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Jeff installs it.  And guess what happens?  Oh, the account administrator won't work.  You won't do this. You won't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a lesson that will apparently never be learned.  Apparently, because every single product that happens that that they release.  Newman. That happens.  Well, that's a bummer.  It's a good app.  I'll I'll talk I'll talk about it a little later.  OK, oh, sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, good. We're ruining your pics here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is no, this is this is effectively a tease at this point.  This is this is a tease forward or shadowing into the future.  Let's see here.  What else we've got?  Well, we've got the ongoing saga of Samsung.  You guys want to talk about that a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I really feel bad for Sam.  I do, too. They finally got their act together.  They made it, you know, a decent phone.  They got everything going and they're blowing up the world.  I really do feel bad for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, too.  Because, I mean, by all accounts,  everything was going well leading up to the Note 7, right?  The Galaxy S7, S7 Edge was selling like crazy.  Sales were just starting to slow down a little bit.  So it made sense, as Samsung usually does this time of year,  to to release the Note 7 to kind of bring that that bump back up,  lead into the holiday season, be strong throughout, compete with Apple,  all that sort of stuff. And of course,  what news is coming out right now?  I think Bloomberg has had a story that said that the reason  for the battery mishap, if you want to call it that,  is that Samsung was so focused on beating Apple to market  based on an iPhone that they thought that they had heard  that was a weak iteration of the iPhone.  And so, you know, they placed even more pressure on suppliers  and manufacturers to kind of speed things up in doing so.  Missed some critical errors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is the is the is the Note 7 brand dead?  Does it come back? Do you get replaced with a new Note 7?  What's what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so they have the official recall.  Today was the the day that Samsung said they would make sure  that 500000 replacement Note 7s would be available for exchange.  So you go to retail stores where you bought your device.  You can now go there and and get that note  exchanged with another one.  They, you know, they also have other plans that you can do.  You can get a refund entirely and not get a Note 7 or you could,  you know, get the difference refunded to you, I think,  for getting like an S7 or an S7 edge.  So they should have stock of Note 7s now, apparently.  Oh, they're safe. OK. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those would be seen as and is it sure that we know  which ones are dangerous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's an important thing to know.  So Samsung is basically putting a green battery indicator  on devices that are safe.  And this is this is kind of interesting because it goes against  Google's spec for Android.  But Hiroshi Lockheimer actually said on Twitter, like they made a big  they made an exception and worked with Samsung to come up with  an alternative on this because the because the scenario is just so,  you know, important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so I've flown four times since this happened.  And then boy, boy, they announced on every flight. Wow.  They do use it.  So what happens now is, oh, no, no, everybody's OK.  Oh, yeah, sure. Don't you turn that on?  You know, it's going to be really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. How do you undo the damage that that's caused for people who own it?  And a lot of people, there was there was something in the  I want to say it was in USA Today about not a lot of people  are opting for Android or for Note 7s.  They're opting for other phones like the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is. So just 25 percent Note 7s.  Samsung says only 25 percent has been exchanged so far,  regardless of the availability of a replacement device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, she's going to change hers, but she was holding on to hers  until she's like, it's not going to explode, Stacey.  So take it. She's she's ready to shoulder that risk.  She feels like a hard-bitten mom.  Yes, we're all weak for listening to recalls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does she charge it next to her bedside at night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope not. And she yeah, she leaves it next to like some oily rags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is not smart. Stacey's mom, don't do that.  Yeah, there's also actually a warning from what I understand.  Samsung will put up a warning on your device.  I don't know if it's at boot or whatever,  but if you have one of the affected devices  when you boot it up, it's like a full screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn this off, idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says don't do this.  Take it back. Get the get the refund or get a new one or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's that's good, actually.  So this is a place where connected devices.  Yeah. They have a huge advantage because like, I don't know, as a parent,  I remember like all the like we bought a crib and later it was recalled.  And so now that crib, like what happens to it?  We did not like donate it to Goodwill or anything like that.  And have someone else have the issue.  But, you know, there's lots of my buy a phone on eBay or in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's Ms.  Ms. IOT, that's really an interesting point.  If if devices are going to be connected moving forward,  should the Consumer Product Safety Commission put in a requirement for  a kind of red light recall notice on the device?  If the manufacturer could send a recall notice for any unsafe device,  that would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It there's the ability to do that.  There's also the ability to track it.  So like the database that tracks this stuff could be a lot more accurate.  So they could actually see where these devices are when they.  That's got to freak me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Knock it on your door. Hello.  It's the crib police.  We understand you have a recalled crib in this house.  Oh, what else do they know about me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I mean, you have to know that if you've got a connected device,  you know, that is like, like, not that I would cheat on a review,  but I'm highly aware when I'm testing a device that is connected,  that everything I'm seeing, the company is also seeing.  So if I if I write about it, I thought of that.  I mean, it's again, I'm, you know, testing everything.  So it doesn't bother me, but it is.  It's like a set of eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I was a TV critic, I I did have a very strict rule.  I would not fast forward between.  I mean, this was hell when they had 14 hour miniseries like AD.  But it also meant that I didn't rewind the tapes to the set of backs.  Oh, you can make sure I watch this piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that you had actual tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. Not only that, Stacey, three quarter inch tapes,  one hour maximum each.  So AD arrived with 14  fiction bit Bible sized containers to get the mini-series.  Wow. Yeah, that's rough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Old school, hard work.  And you made sure to watch all the commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, there were no commercials in it.  It was you get rough cuts and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then what were you not fast forwarding through?  I guess I missed that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They would send me a tape before it was on the air.  Oh, I see. OK.  So it was a preview. Yeah.  Yeah, this is the old the old days, son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back in those days.  I could my day.  Oh, yeah. Well, I had a laserdisc player and halfway through a movie,  I had to wait because it had to flip over to the other side.  So there is bad in my day.  Uncle Jason. Yes.  Yeah, I feel bad for Samsung.  I think they're doing, you know, and I think that the kind of  the tricky part is that they really wanted to do things quickly and swiftly  because they had researched how, you know, effective product recalls are done.  And usually it involves the company responding very quickly.  The unfortunate thing is they missed the fact that they needed to make sure  that they coordinated this with the proper proper organizations.  And they did not do that.  And in doing so, it ended up making everything a lot more confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see. That's that's.  Yeah, because they seem to be acting on their own, saying, oh, problem.  But then the government issued an official recall.  That's why. Yep. That's exactly why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, basically.  Yeah, there was there was a longer delay because they essentially had to analyze  and undo to a certain degree what Samsung had already the wheels  that they'd already put into motion because they have to then come in  and literally be the ones to clear whatever the solution is.  You know, those devices that are being sent out.  Are those good replacement devices is replacing a device?  A good alternative is is that sufficient enough for consumers?  Or, you know, do we need to do something different?  Samsung had already made a lot of those determinations prior to letting them know  that anything had happened.  And so that's why it took longer.  So they really wanted to do good on their customers, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  We will, I guess, rushing the product through in a way that's unsafe.  Is that a good thing to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a good thing either. Right.  But, you know, I guess the the big question is in doing so, did they know?  And I'm guessing no, but I guess I don't know how it works behind the scenes.  But did they know that there was a potential that there was a possibility?  I can't believe they did. I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they would not.  I mean, they're having to sell off assets to pay for this recall.  That is, I mean, if they knew that would be like, yeah, they they were.  What did Samsung just bought?  Or sorry, just sold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they did. You're right.  I read that yesterday briefly.  They sold off a few different assets.  Yeah. Yeah.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that one for sure.  You know, I guess I guess I've just seen Fight Club one too many times  where you realize there's like there's the there's the level of like calculated risk.  And it's like, well, does this outweigh that?  If so, then it's worth taking the risk.  I guess you never know.  But they probably knew, didn't know enough to prevent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so Samsung sold its shares in Seagate, Rambus and Sharp.  Oh, and also A.S.M.L., which is a semiconductor manufacturing company.  So, I mean, I don't know if all of those things  went towards paying for the recall, but they did blame it on that,  which is a pretty significant step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Do we want to talk about trolls or election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I wanted to talk about the same difference.  Yeah, basically, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were you OK? What were you saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, I wanted to talk about  the profile and Ruth Porat from Fortune just because there's a lot of really  great information in there about like the fate of the alphabet and kind of that shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But OK, go for it.  Because I do not know that I read that one.  I'm sorry. Oh, you'd it's really I need to. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it starts off with this.  You know, she slips on some ice.  She's on her way to spin class, slips on some black ice and breaks her shoulder.  And apparently for two days, she walks around like postponing surgery  so she can make an earnings call at Morgan Stanley.  So and that's hardcore.  But it's basically I encourage people to read it because it's a really nice  look at kind of some of the things that are happening inside the  other bets divisions at Alphabets that we've seen kind of some of the  like Google Fiber cutting costs, Ness, like Tony Faddele leaving  kind of all of these things, this kind of explains some of the back end  stuff that's happening.  So it's talking about the other bets businesses being billed  for some of the company resources.  So. Like legal counsel, human resources and PR are now these other bets.  Companies can use the alphabet services, but Alphabets charging them,  which is a very corporate kind of old school corporate thing to do  and not very Google like.  So I just I thought this whole thing was kind of a really interesting look  at Google trying to grow up.  And I wondered if you guys had thoughts on if this is the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did what did you?  All right. You know, full disclosure is I'm a I'm a nano Google shareholder.  If you are a shareholder, would you feel better about the company  knowing that she's in this power position?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends on what I think Google is.  Am I making am I investing in Google for like their incredible  short term profits based on advertising or am I investing in Google for the long term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, really good question.  So so all right. So which way does she come down in that world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could argue that it's both.  Because you can't like.  I guess then the question is, is this sort of accountability  going to hurt their.  Their progress for the long term, or is it just kind of shutting down  things that are silly? I.  I think it's probably a smart thing to do, to be honest.  I think some of the some of the things in Silicon Valley, where people are like,  I'm going to throw a lot of money at a crazy idea and see if it flies.  It it sounds good.  Some things have come of it, but I don't think a little discipline is bad, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like the promise of these long shot bets  for the for the longest time, anyways, it seemed like we were willing  to kind of go along for the ride with Google and be like, oh, well, yeah,  if anyone could do it, you know, just taking Google as an example,  Google could do it because they've got more money than than they need.  And, you know, they've got all the resources, but it seems to be turning out  turning into kind of a realization that even with all that money,  it's still incredibly hard to pull a lot of this stuff off.  And Google, you know, Google dreams big.  That doesn't necessarily mean that Google can't dream big.  But by focusing a little bit, maybe that's a good way to make sure  that some of them happen and are executed as opposed to all of them, not  or whatever the case may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's it.  I just I liked the profile.  I like the writing.  Yes, I used to work in Fortune, but I just I was like, that's pretty cool.  And you so we can talk about trolls now.  Or elections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds that sounds fun.  Jeff, you pick this time, which one you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you guys know better. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about election first here.  It really seems like, well, if you didn't know,  there's a big election coming up in the US.  And technology is very infused this time around.  I feel like in years past, you know, the Internet  played into different facets of the election in different ways.  This seems to be the the first US election that I can remember  where social media is not just this kind of tangential thing on the  on the outside sides of it, but actually totally tied into the process  to a certain degree. Case in point, Google, Facebook,  they're all basically getting involved in things like the upcoming debates.  They're going to be offering data to moderators  leading up to kind of help plan for these events, as as could be expected.  Facebook is also going to be helping to source questions  during the town hall debates.  There's going to be Facebook live broadcasts from the events.  Snapchat live stories are happening from the events.  They're all kind of getting involved  in in these debates, kind of making the town hall just a little bit broader.  I don't know if that actually means that.  Oh, great. Stop wagging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I don't want to make any political statements.  I won't make any political statements. I just want to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to try my best to not make any political statements.  But I don't know, is this is this good?  Is this I mean, I suppose it makes sense because our world is  social and technology is such a big part of what we do nowadays.  So it makes sense to include those voices in the process. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the next president of the United States thinks so. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audio listeners have no idea what you're talking about.  That might be a good.  Jeff was just making a political statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of. Yeah, just to just ignore this. Yeah.  Look the other way.  Oh, I'll get in such trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a good idea.  Oh, sorry, you asked a question. That's all good.  We just talked with Stacey.  I'm sorry. Were you engaging us in debate?  All right. What was it?  Was your question basically social media?  Should we be using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, no, I think is is.  Can social media be counted upon to take something like an election  debate process and keep it?  I don't know. Keep it focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Oh, as much as I love it, as much as it matters.  You know, we have that's why politics and trolls are the same topic.  You know, we've reached this point where where I crave civility.  I crave some way to get a decent conversation going.  And it's so hard now.  And and, you know, I'm not sure what to do about it.  And this election, I mean,  how do I say this without getting in trouble?  Because I am clearly partisan.  I mean, the full disclosure, if you did, for those of you on audio,  as I'm just, you know, before I go further, I'm not making it.  I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.  If you still follow me on Twitter, you know that for sure.  But that's my perspective, which is important to say.  Journalism, you know, professional journalism has failed miserably.  We have an ill informed electorate and it's our fault.  It's our job to inform. We didn't inform.  So how do we expect social media to come along and make up  for what professional journalists have done horribly?  And, you know, the other thing about  about this world is I think journalism also has done a terrible job  of reflecting certain parts of America and, you know, including less.  Obviously, African Americans and Latinos and women  and other groups are long, ill reflected, but so are in this election.  We're learning under employed angry white men because because that's the  breeding ground for for Trump.  And so media have done a terrible job.  And how we expect social media to come along and without any systems,  without any structure to fix that, they're not going to happen.  Now, what we what we in media need to do is to better inform those conversations.  What we immediately need to do is to better reflect those communities  and their concerns and give them greater respect.  I'm writing a post right now.  I'm actually playing with the idea of saying that if liberals want to fix things  in this country, they should fund the creation of quality conservative media.  So that you do have people  were feeling reflected and feeling as if their concerns are paid attention to.  Sorry, ask me a simple question.  You're going to get me to go off on a little liquid.  But I just think that that,  you know, we've got to learn some lessons after this election.  And it's a it's a huge problem.  And and we see the debate after I'm sure you talked about the  the napalm photo on Facebook when I was gone last week.  But there are those in my field who say Facebook is media.  It should act like media should operate under our standards.  And I say, no, Facebook's not media.  Facebook's a connection machine.  It's something entirely different.  It doesn't have a responsibility in the same way we think we do.  Nonetheless, Facebook has an opportunity  to better inform people and to figure that out and to expose us to things  and so on and so forth.  So it's a really complex question about a time in this country  when when huge institutions like media are changing,  when, you know, a renegade can come along, pardon me,  and take over a political party and utterly, utterly change it.  These are these are big changes.  So sorry for the soliloquy, but I'll end it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The soliloquy is what I was hoping for, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was lovely.  I will say.  What what can I say after that?  I will say that I'm glad that.  Google and Facebook are using their platforms  to give people access to this debate that may not otherwise have it  and to bring people into the process.  Like, I do feel like.  Maybe they're not better informed, but people are more involved  when it comes to women.  Politics reach out to them through these platforms.  I will say that I totally agree that.  This it is not just this election.  Previous elections have been the same way.  It is hard to get any sort of politician to talk substantively  about anything during an election season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it feels like worse in so many ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then it is worse, but it's also not.  It's not unfounded that this happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, it's a progression, but it's a progression.  I'm sorry. May I interrupt this message for a quick question?  I thought when you got to seven, you wouldn't get this damned  upgrading every every application message.  Oh, no, no, no, it does that.  I thought that was the promise we were going to get rid of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With those did not do that.  Mine did not do that, but we minded.  And were you on the I'm thinking maybe the different  maybe the difference is the developer preview.  Were you on the developer preview prior?  I was not on this one.  I was not. We were.  At least I know I was.  And I'm pretty certain Leo was.  Maybe that's the difference.  Yes, that was one of the things that they said you would not get in Nougat,  but that might be, I don't know, it might be tied to getting a new device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe get it the first time, maybe the second time.  OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I don't know what's going on.  I hate that screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that screen is. Oh, I despise it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So so what do we what do we do about this?  How do we how do we return to civility in this country?  You know, I don't think we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think with the cat is out of the bag.  We are moving to a oh, who's the character?  A zafide people, Brock's from Hitchhiker's Guide.  So our our our elections are going to be purely theatrics.  I mean, you can't hint to this in Trump saying, you know, the offers to  it wasn't Mike Pence.  It was another VP candidate.  And he was like, you know, you could you get to actually deal with Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. You could deal with all international and foreign things.  What is that kind of or domestic and foreign affairs?  Exactly. You be president.  I'll want to have your own hotels. OK, deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, maybe it's really cynical.  Maybe it's just reality.  I feel like we've been moving this way forever.  Politics are now sound bites and who makes who looks best on television.  And if you're lucky, you're going to get someone who actually cares about this  and is good at it.  If you're not, you're going to hope that there are people behind the scenes  that are supporting them, that are actually lucky and or know what they're doing  and good at it. Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. So there's the social kind of media getting involved in the election,  the debates itself.  But then there's also kind of the technology companies, like you were saying,  Stacey, who are empowering people to get involved,  which is the other important component here.  YouTube announced today the Vote IRL,  Vote in Real Life campaign to basically kind of get young people to the polls.  And they're listing some top YouTube talent to basically record one minute  and thirty four second videos to raise awareness leading up to  the national kind of voting registration day, which is the September 27th.  So that's next week.  And basically, it's a minute thirty four because Google says it takes  a one minute thirty four seconds to register to vote.  So really kind of driving driving the point home for younger potential voters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I went to Bethlehem, PA, which swing state last week,  and I've gone to Pennsylvania twice to volunteer in both cases as registering voters,  which is God's work in any case. So it's fine.  And so I sat outside the Bethlehem, PA library.  Now, Bethlehem, PA, by the way, is a city made by Bethlehem Steel.  It couldn't be more labor in its heritage.  And there's there's more than two colleges there.  So there's a bunch of, you know, commie pinko academics there.  I was amazed at the number of people who were Republican, which is fine.  It's free country. It's fine. And we're voting for Trump.  I saw enthusiastic Hillary voters who told me they were scared  to put bumper stickers in their cars.  And I know one Trump voter who also got something thrown in his car  because of his Trump bumper sticker.  It's not just virtual. This is happening now.  There's there's a fear of the discussion and the discourse around.  I had shruggy voters, but what disturbs me most is people said, no,  I don't know what to come up with.  You know, the kind of the the the curl lips near  and especially young people.  I I used every persuasive skill I had to get some young people to register.  And I don't think they're going to show up at the polls.  So I don't think just saying, hey, get out and vote.  I'm famous. So you should vote like me.  It's a bigger problem than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you want people to register to vote, that's fine.  But I think those efforts would be much better.  Directed at something like the there's there's a poll  or an effort to get companies to sign on to give people two hours off  so they can go during the week.  If we could get not just tech companies,  but everyone to push for something like that, that's probably better  than a thousand, you know, rock the vote, ask YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, well, Stacey, that's a great point.  Do you know of any of the tech companies come up with a policy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of them have.  I was just going to check if Google has signed the  I'm trying to remember what it's called.  That's that's oh, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there is something. I saw that a few weeks back.  What was that?  We're like, oh, Google food.  Don't let me down.  Yeah, I can't remember exactly who.  But there are tech companies doing that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would also love like in Texas, they've changed  the early voting laws and restricted it somewhat.  And then they've also changed the number of places where you can go vote  in an effort to reduce minority voting.  I'll be honest, that's what it's about.  And I would love to get proactive notifications like one or two  on my phone saying, hey, today you can go vote at these places.  You know, just as like just a little notification in the morning.  And I remember, you know, Uber did this when in Austin, when we had the  the kick out Uber effort and as a private company,  they were advocating for their.  The law, they wrote basically.  And they did. They were very like aggressive.  They were like, remember, vote today, vote today.  And I think if you had something like that, because a lot of people,  they're like, oh, yeah, I got to vote.  Oh, yeah, I got to vote.  But it's one thing to be like, oh, hey, I need to vote in.  Oh, I'm right over here.  And there's a vote.  There's a polling place near me.  So I don't know.  I feel like there's.  This is window dressing.  This this like YouTube star is telling people to vote.  I mean, that's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marginally effective was rock the vote, very effective in its effort.  I mean, I remember it as a kid.  And I mean, when I was younger, I'm trying to remember if it was the reason  that I ever registered to vote, but I don't think that was that was the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  election I voted in, but I'm one of those weird goody two shoes types of people.  So I like I was excited to vote and I was going to vote.  And I did vote right when I turned 18.  And so I can't tell you if it was effective or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Hard to know if it had anything to do with that for me, too,  because I feel like I was pretty charged up to vote regardless.  But I don't know if part of that influence came from the fact that all my favorite  rock bands were saying I should vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and that's it.  See, which which was the first presidential election for each of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clinton. Yeah, it would be Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Oh, here it is.  It's called Take Tuesday, asking employers around the country to make  November 8th a vacation day on their corporate calendar.  There you go. So oh, look, major tech company.  Casper Thrillist, Data Zoo.  Let's see. Hunter Walker has a Google Doc.  So I'm looking at the Google Doc.  So here I here I am loading the Google Doc.  Let's see if we can find.  Oh, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't get past the lock screen on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, maybe you're one of those people.  Oh, no, it's a six P.  Oh, then you're not one of those people.  I don't see Google on here.  Lippel, Good Giphy, Get Dusk,  Guild Education. No, Google is not on here.  Oh, wait, maybe Alphabet is hold on.  Oh, right. That makes more sense.  More sense. I don't see Alphabet on here.  Oh, now California requires employers to give time off.  So that's in order that varies.  But in that's fine.  But it's one thing to be like, hey, you can do it.  And it's another to establish a culture where it's cool to go vote or acceptable.  Yeah. Like in my gig.  You know, someone would be like, oh, you know, I'm going to go vote.  And, you know, somebody be like, I don't know if I want to.  We're like, go vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm. So that's more effective than YouTube stars, probably.  All right. Before we get to our final ad and do pics and tips and stuff like that.  I know. Is there anything in here that we didn't talk about  that you were really charged up to talk about?  Maybe that I mean, there's a lot of stuff in here that we did not talk about,  but I think we stuck pretty close to the Google front today.  But you did a good job, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you actually did better than we did, because I think we talked about Google  like most of the time. Yeah, that's amazing.  Which is unusual for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, let's let's stop while we're ahead.  I'm going to thank Blue Apron, who's the sponsor of this episode.  Then we can come back and we can do tips and tricks and pointers  and whatever we have numbers, all that kind of stuff.  So let's take a break.  Thank Blue Apron, the sponsor of this episode.  This is the part of the show where I get super duper hungry  because I ate kind of a lunch, but I didn't need a Blue Apron lunch.  And I kind of wish I did.  Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone  while also supporting a more sustainable food system.  And in doing so, setting the highest standards for ingredients  and building a community of home chefs.  Blue Apron is going to make you a better chef.  That's kind of the beauty of Blue Apron.  And I've loved learning how to cook better by using Blue Apron.  It delivers seasonal recipes, along with fresh, high quality ingredients  to make delicious home cooked meals.  Every meal comes with a step by step, easy to follow recipe card  that you get to keep after the fact so you can remake these recipes if you want.  Preportioned ingredients that can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.  You'll save time and money.  You know, when you're going to the grocery store, you're paying a lot.  It's 60 percent more expensive than what you pay with Blue Apron.  Basically, if you spend a lot of time and money eating out  or going to high end grocery chains,  well, now you're going to spend under $10 per person for healthy home cooked meals.  You can customize your recipes every week based on your dietary preferences  and choose a delivery option that fits your needs and your schedule.  There's no weekly commitment, so you only get deliveries when you want them.  Blue Apron delivers to 99 percent of the continental U.S.  Blue Apron sets the highest quality standards for their community  of over 150 local farms, fisheries and ranchers across the U.S.  Seafood is sourced sustainably.  Beef is raised humanely.  Chickens are free range.  Pork is raised naturally.  And regenerative farming practices are used for produce.  And, you know, they're only sending you the exact amount  that's required for that particular recipe.  So in doing so, Blue Apron reduces food waste and also keeps the recipes  really kind of specific.  You don't end up with extra and have to figure out what you do with that extra,  you know, a little teaspoon of sugar or whatever the case may be.  Whether it's Japanese ramen noodles, wild caught Alaskan salmon  or heirloom tomatoes, Blue Apron brings you the best.  Blue Apron not only supports a more sustainable food system,  it also supports happy and healthy families, because when you cook together,  you build strong family bonds.  Research actually shows that Blue Apron families cook nearly three times  more often. New recipes are being created every week by Blue Apron's culinary team.  They're not repeated within a year.  So you can get paprika, spiced shrimp and cheddar grits with tomato and sweet corn.  You're starting to salivate.  I can tell. Eggplant and chickpea.  Is it tagine?  Tagine with some tagine maybe with islander tagine.  OK, now I get to start over.  Oh, you would know that fella.  Tagine. Oh, you would get fat.  Eggplant and chickpea tagine with islander pepper, tomato and couscous.  There's summer udon noodle salad with cherry tomatoes, corn and summer  sweet pepper and spicy hoisin chicken stir fry with baby bok choy  and sesame ginger cucumber salad.  This sounds really good.  Check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free  with free shipping by going to Blue Apron dot com slash twit.  You're going to love how good it feels and tastes to create  incredible home cooked meals with Blue Apron.  So do not wait.  Visit Blue Apron dot com slash twit.  We thank Blue Apron for their support of this week in Google.  Blue Apron is a better way to cook.  My favorite of the of the meals that would be in some of the reads  for Blue Apron was a chicken tinga tacos, because it's a lot of fun to say.  And I still have yet to make a tinga taco, but I want to because it's named so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's barbecue tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's barbecues sauce with Mexican food, basically.  Still sounds delicious.  Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm a Texan.  We're like, wait, barbecue plus Mexican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've just I've just never I had never heard of tinga tacos before  before Blue Apron and even not knowing that it was barbecue.  It still sounded delicious just based on the way the words sounded.  So I got to make it.  And the good the good thing is you can go to their site.  You can actually find all the recipes and try them for yourself.  So there you go.  They get their chicken, tikka taco recipe.  OK, so let's do  tips and numbers and all that stuff.  Jeff, why don't we start with you?  What's your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this afternoon,  Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg went on Facebook Live, of course,  to announce a major initiative.  They promised to give away most of their money in their lifetimes.  They're giving away three billion dollars to cure disease.  Wow. A better thing to do, I can't imagine.  However, I imagine commentators will say that there's a bit of hubris to this  because three billion dollars is a hell of a lot of money, more than we have.  Any of us can be spent over 10 years, but the  budget for, you know, the government's efforts in this line  are thirty one billion dollars per year.  So I'm not sure, you know, what three billion dollars is a generous gift.  It's an important gift.  What I don't know yet is how they have the belief that that three billion dollars  is going to be able to to do this.  And as Zuckerberg said, it doesn't mean that people aren't going to get sick,  but they want to make diseases curable and manageable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also are taking everything and making it open source,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is all this is great. All of this is great.  But what I don't know yet is how is three billion dollars going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that really puts things into perspective.  It does. Yeah, that is insane.  I never would have known that.  That's crazy. Yeah, that's a comparison.  That's the drop in the bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's other things, too.  Yeah, but it's this is a hard it's a very hard problem.  Engineers love hard problems. Yeah.  But I know that the tech naysayers out there are going to say, oh,  they can do what God couldn't do.  You know, so I'm I'm I'm hopeful,  but I'm not looking forward to the conversation over the next 72 hours.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And hey, if something's better than nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So at least that's all I'm supportive.  I think it's great.  But there's a lot more to come, obviously. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, we will be following that.  Stacey, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a recipe for you guys.  Now, the challenge with all of my recipes are they're device specific.  So if you have these devices, you'll be excited.  If you don't. Go buy them.  I talked about this before this.  This one, this this involves three things.  So get ready.  The first is a my Q garage door opener from Chamberlain.  It's I bought mine for about 100 bucks.  It's I think 130 right now at Best Buy.  So this is an attachment that you put on your garage door  and you can use it to remotely open and close your garage door.  And you can also see and get notifications if your garage door has been open  for a while. I love that about it because we're moving in and out.  And our garage door is almost always open.  So I'm like, oh, close it.  OK, so that's part one.  Part two is a Wink Hub.  So the Wink Hub, it's about 50 dollars.  We think a new one's coming out soon, but we don't know.  So you may want to wait a little.  And then the third item you need are Lutron lights.  And the reason you would have all of these things or if you have all of these things,  what I've done is I've set up a recipe using the Wink app to open  whenever my garage door opens after a certain time at night.  My porch lights come on.  And this is super handy because even if I'm opening it to leave,  it's nice.  Then I've left the house and my porch lights are on.  So, yay.  Or if I'm coming home late and they're dark, then when I walk outside,  because I have to walk outside my garage and go up the stairs to get to my front door.  Then I've got light.  So it's a nice app or a nice recipe.  If you're going to do it, the Wink app is sometimes a little bit wonky.  So if it doesn't work for you, you may have to divide your day  like before midnight, your night into before midnight and after midnight.  So that's your pro tip for you if you're actually going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool. How connected is your home?  I mean, I know I know that IOT is kind of your thing.  Do you practice this to like an insane degree at home?  Is your home super connected?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My home is super connected, but it's not convenient.  My husband will be the first to tell you like this one is something that works.  But as you can see, like.  It requires a lot of things to do this sort of stuff.  And like to get this one working, I actually had to call Wink  because they had a glitch in their system.  So if I tried to make my night last the whole night  instead of dividing it up into two chunks, it at midnight, it was like.  Oh, I'm done. I'm no longer going to work.  So the whole recipe just didn't work and I didn't know why.  So I had to call them and figure it out.  So this is why I'm telling you, because if you have these things,  this is how you can make something like that happen.  That's cool. Oh, the other for because y'all are sorry,  because y'all are Google people.  The nice thing about Wink is they actually show up.  Some of the devices that are on my week show up in my Google.  It's I would call it my Google Now screen, but now it's something else.  It shows up as a card on my.  What do we call this now? Not the Google Now screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.  It's a good question.  All right. I mean, the assistant screen, I don't know what it's going to be.  It's still the assistant screen.  Yeah, it's still Google now, but it's changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The status of some of my devices, it'll say things like, hey,  we notice you're not home and your garage door is unlocked.  And then I'm like, oh, crap.  And I'll hit it and it'll lock it straight from the screen.  It's totally unprompted. I didn't do anything with it.  That's so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's nice.  I imagine I imagine there's going to be a sequel to Soylent Green  made from your house.  Maybe everything is controlled.  Everything is controlled.  And there'll be these kind of iron doors that come popping down.  And alerts that go up and cameras that go around.  I just imagine you and your dotage having everything you need  for a perfectly paranoid.  But it's oddly convenient existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paranoid and yeah, it's probably accurate.  Yeah, I like this a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  20 years from now, what I like about it is it's the all powerful Stacey.  Yeah, sitting on her couch can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's I really want that to be the case.  I know you like I know you never have to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. This is the greatest vision that that you can be in your fortress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of the promise of this of the technology that we have right now  is to make all of the things in our life easier.  But, you know, I mean, and I'm sure you would agree,  the promise of things like IOT doesn't always bear out in practice, you know.  And I can't even get through these stages.  It's learning. It's learning stages right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what will happen, Stacey?  See, what will happen is you'll have your fortress set up.  I'll try to be doing the same thing, but I'm on a Google Apps account.  So another little work for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. I'm on a Google Apps account.  I'm on Google Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to get trips going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Trips. Good segue.  Let me show you what you're missing, Jeff.  I'm sorry that you can't get this because it's actually really cool.  So Google someday, Jeff.  Don't worry.  It actually makes sense for Google Apps because, you know, it's business  tied to your business account. You do a lot of travel and business.  I'm sure there's a lot of overlap there.  So what does it do?  Google Trips basically trawls through your search history.  OK, that needs to stop your search history.  You're hi, Megan.  Megan is allowing me right now.  She must know that this is appearing on the show right now.  She's doing some research for tech news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, go to Austin. We can see how good it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is OK.  So this is from back in 2010.  You can see the date there. 2010.  Back then, I went to Austin with Twitter for South by Southwest.  So here is so basically it's gone through my email, my Gmail account,  and found all the travely things that I have and put them in here.  Now, I don't really have a whole lot in here from Austin,  other than probably reservations.  So, yeah, stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin.  And I forget. Oh, jeez, Jason.  You know, nothing but the best. Oh, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I stayed at the Motel Six, but you. Yeah.  That was actually really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So where did you have dinner, Jason?  I have to say that was a really nice hotel.  I'm very fond of that hotel.  Yes, it is.  Megan's not sending me stickers.  Anyway, so you get all the information about about your reservation.  If I had flight information, which, you know, I think in this case,  it was tied to my Twitter account.  Then it would go there.  You get information about what you can do while you're there.  So while I'm in Austin, I've got top spots here, of course, for you indoors.  You know, if you want to check out museums or whatever,  outdoors, botanical gardens, zoos, that sort of stuff, things that are kid friendly.  All these things you can kind of look at in advance.  Oh, yeah, I definitely want to check out the Hamilton Pool.  I'll go ahead and favor it. Right.  As a favorite things, they appear in saved places that I can remember them later.  Now, where this gets really kind of interesting and powerful,  and I'm not seeing it for Austin, I don't know why.  So let's go into something else here and see if I get that day plans.  So if I've saved something for in day plans, let's see if I have.  I have saved places for Las Vegas.  If I go into day plans, I'm given both prearranged, predetermined  kind of like things that you can do, order an order of sites  and experiences that you can do while you're there for, you know,  an extended period of time, let's say.  But I can go ahead and create and it will take into account  the things that I've saved and the things that it thinks in that area  I should check out and it'll create a full day itinerary.  In this case, I could tweak that to say I'm only going to be there in the afternoon  and it would kind of narrow it down and be like, OK, well, in that case, this,  you know, these five locations are where you should go and in this order  so that it makes sense geographically,  you know, moving from one point to the other.  And so then you can, you know, you can save it.  And that's part of your itinerary going forward.  And what makes it more powerful is when you're going to this far off land,  in this case, Vegas, where I'm sure connectivity is plentiful.  But if you're going somewhere else where maybe you're in the mountains or whatever  and, you know, overseas where you don't have data, you can set it for offline.  And all that information that you searched in here stored.  Everything is stored within this little packet so that when you get there,  you don't need connectivity.  You can just pull from here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd sure like to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would it be nice?  It would be nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It'd be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice.  It's a cool tool.  And I have to imagine it's going to continue getting better.  Again, it relies on information that you're willing to allow Google  to hold on for you on to for I have no problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has a problem with me, apparently.  Yeah, I have no problem with Google.  I went into my apps administrator account and I'm already set up  so it is supposed to just automatically say, OK, anything new.  But I ain't there. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing. Someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that is frustrating because I've got a Google apps and I just got  if I do my apps account, it didn't work.  So I'll go in and administer my account.  So it does. But I travel both personally and for business.  So I'm kind of like I want both of them to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The same. Yes.  Just or come back to this.  Google, I give you permission to mush.  You know, how many years Google should be able to record?  You should be able to give Google permission to say, I am the same person  and combine these things. It's good for Google.  It's good business for Google because they would know more about you  as a person to confirm you.  I don't get it.  Yes, I get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're a company selling people Google apps.  Yeah. If you're if you're a company that's administering this account,  maybe you don't want Google to have some of this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but when you give it permission to make an interest.  We are sorry, but you do not have access to Google Trips yet.  Please contact your Google Apps administrator for more information.  Hey, I'm administrator.  Yes, Mr. Jarvis, what would you like?  I'd like to have trips. OK, let me see if I get it for you.  Oh, sorry, you're out of luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, no, it's so it's actually pulling up.  Some of my trips are they both from your business account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, if you ever forwarded it to your personal account,  it would pick that up and it would put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know some of my personal stuff to my business account, I think.  Well, sometimes like I get I get travel travel information,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, set up for Twitter.  And in order to make sure that I have it, you know, in my personal account,  I'll just forward the email over just so that I have it there and start it.  Just so it's in both places.  And it picked up those in the in trips.  So I don't know if that's what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I travel a lot. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then this is probably right up your alley.  This is this is this is good for anyone that's traveling a lot,  especially if you're going to some place like that doesn't have any connectivity.  That's awesome to have that stuff accessible.  That I believe, as they say, is that a lot of fun.  We stuck pretty darn close to Google today and had a great time doing it.  Let's start with you, Stacey.  I know you have the IOT podcast at IOT podcast dot com.  Got the Internet of Things newsletter at Stacey on IOT dot com.  What am I missing here? What else you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have every two weeks, I've got a smart home column in PC mag.  If you want to read that, I had one come out today  where I give I answer readers questions about various smart home stuff.  And I actually did a different recipe in there for connecting your doorbell  to your lights. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So somebody rings your doorbell and your lights turn on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's for somebody has somebody asked me a question  because I have a deaf sibling and they were like, that's a really  I'd like to help them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really smart solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want somebody to ring the doorbell and starts pouring the Cabernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you want somebody rings the doorbell and the champagne  pops in the other room.  A visitor's. Yay.  It's a party. Music starts playing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you could have a disco ball in the living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The steel shutters come down and nobody else can come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a this is a closed off party.  Thank you, Stacey. This is a lot of fun.  I really appreciate it.  Jeff, what about you? You've got BuzzFeed.com.  Buzz Machine. I don't I wish I owned BuzzFeed.  Oh, wait a minute. Yeah.  No, that doesn't make any sense. Sorry.  It's in the back. I just did a total rumburgundy right there.  It's BuzzFeed. Buzz Machine.  That's the only one. No, that's pretty much it for now.  That's it for now. All right.  All right. At Jeff Jarvis on Twitter to follow and medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  slash Jeff Jarvis to do a lot of stuff there. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  I think you did a good job, boss. Thanks, man.  This is fun. I've got another two weeks in the hot seat,  so I'm looking forward to it.  Did I see one of you is out next week? Is that right?  I think I'm California. Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm not this is the trouble week when we're probably both out.  I apologize. I've been I've been a bad boy this month,  but it's just a bad confluence. That is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will figure it out.  I know that we've already got actually we have Ron Richards  on the docket for next week, so we'll figure it out.  We got you covered.  You know, you both take the week off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are unflappable.  You lose your identity on the air and you just don't flap.  And you are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no choice.  I lost access to all my Google account.  I really had no choice but to plow on.  But hey, I got access back.  So, you know, what more could you ask for?  And we learned that we learned.  Yeah. Thank you to Matt Cutts and a whole lot of other people.  We learned a lot of valuable, valuable, important lessons that day.  Let's see here.  Twig this week in Google records every Wednesday, one 30 p.m.  Pacific, four 30 p.m. Eastern, twenty thirty UTC.  You can always join live to watch the show at twig.tv slash live.  Of course, on demand at twig.tv slash twig.  Pretty much everywhere you're going to find your podcast, both audio and video  all over the map.  But that is it for this week on this week in Google.  We will see you all next week.  Take care, guys.
