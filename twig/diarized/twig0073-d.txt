Hello Gina from  Lifehacker, of course many moons ago, now SmarterWear.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Howdy, good to see you. And Think Tank, Think. Think Up. Think Up.  Lead development on ThinkUp. ThinkUpApp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ThinkUpApp.com.  Also with us, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, where he  teaches people journalistic integrity.  I'm actually home today. In his library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, how's that? Now I'm looking all fuzzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look good. Don't worry about it. A little pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that you probably. I have a big light now on my desk.  Oh wow, look at that. What is that? Wow. And an umbrella.  Yeah, I mean, I actually need to get the one you mentioned I had didn't get to the store.  Is that like a regular umbrella or a special? Yeah, it's a regular umbrella.  No, it's a lighting umbrella. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, you look very good. We should send a gaffer your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need, I want them to explain what the hell a gaffer is.  I know, I just love the name. I like saying gaffer.  Can they bring along a best boy? Yes. Now that sounds bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ain't gaffer. Also here, Joel Johnson, who  is at gizmodo.com. Hello, how's it going?  Good to have you back. Now he's got a headset. He sounds so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do. I sound amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I want to thank who hosted the show last week.  Was it you, Jeff? Did you do all the work? No, no, no.  Tom came in. Yep. Tom Maron.  Tom Maron. I'm Tom for doing doing the yeoman duty while I was at Loo Web  with Marissa, me and Marissa hanging.  She ignores me. I met her.  I've met her twice now in the last week.  And both times it was like.  She just didn't. I don't think that registered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was she like surrounded by groupies or was it just like  no, actually, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first time was at a restaurant in Paris where Loic had brought all the speakers.  And then the second time was at Google's media party.  And both times, nothing really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think she's exactly, you know, missocial.  I don't think she's that sociable.  No, I don't think she is. I think that's just her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I think she's got a little bit off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's been civil to me and nice and decent.  She's no, no, I wouldn't say she was uncivil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She just wasn't particularly.  She doesn't start telling jokes and no conversation.  And yet I had some great conversations with like Google's chief economist, Hal Varian.  Oh, there's some smart people at Google with.  Yeah. Isn't that amazing?  That was a very interesting thing to go to.  And Larry was there and Sir and Eric was there.  But I had the most fun talking to like, well, her replacement, Udi,  who's doing search now with Mike Cohen, who is their voice guy,  who does all the voice recognition.  That was a fascinating conversation.  So I bet that was really good. Yeah.  Really interesting.  So we're going to get many of those people on the shows in future.  I also talked to.  Oh, and I can't remember his name.  Shoot. To the guy responsible for this.  The the Chrome OS.  And we had a very good conversation because I tell you, I pardon me.  His name is on the dock.  Wow. Eileen is. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai. Eileen's on the ball, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is so good. Well, she was standing right next to me.  Thank you. She's awesome.  So Sundar and I had a conversation because I have the CR 48.  This is the and you know, Google said very specifically, don't review the hardware.  This is just you know, this is not even a reference platform.  It's a it's a thing that we sent you.  So I'm not going to review the hardware.  There's some interesting stuff, for instance, no caps lock key.  They put a search button on there instead.  I think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Can I say that I actually think the hardware is fantastic.  Do you like it? I think the hardware is so like we got one of those into the office  we in New York this week or last week, I guess it was.  And everybody was just fawning over.  It's like the anti MacBook.  You know, it's got a lot of the same clean lines, but there's no logos anywhere.  There's no stupid Windows stickers like it's very black helicopter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you feel like you could you could there be no radar signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like what a ThinkPad wants to be, but they've kind of gone off off message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a VGA port.  It's generic. I'm sure they had somebody's a generic hardware design.  It's running Debian.  And then on top of Debian, it is exactly what, Gina, what we had talked about.  It's just Chrome.  Instant on. I like that.  You saw how fast that turns on boots very quickly.  It's a small solid state drive.  I think was it 16 gigs, Joel? I can't remember.  Yeah, I don't remember. It's very small.  You log in with your Google account, which is amazing.  Very Android like, very Android like.  And all you get is a browser.  In fact, this is the conversation that I had.  I said, Sundar explained to me, I have Chrome on my, let's say, MacBook Air.  And when I I can go to the Chrome app store, I can install the same exact things.  It syncs up.  I if I filled the screen with Chrome on my air, it'd be identical to this.  But then if I want more, I've got it.  Why would somebody voluntarily?  Say, well, I don't want more or I'll never want more.  I just want a browser because that's all this is really.  It's just a browser.  And his point was.  Simplicity.  Security, some people don't want complexity.  And then I thought maybe if they sold it really cheap,  that's what I'm thinking, it'll be subsidized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if you think the hardware platform is going to be pretty stable  for what it takes to run Chrome, you know, run Chrome OS,  that's not going to change a whole lot over the next year.  So, you know, a $50 Chrome OS laptop is not out of the question by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I could understand it because, I mean, you get what you pay for, right?  So you get a little bit less, but you're not paying for it.  I think why not give it away?  Comes with it has 3G and Wi-Fi and it comes with and apparently it's  even any commercial version they sell is going to come with a hundred dollars  a month, a hundred megabytes a month of bandwidth free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that so smart to go to finally go to an upsell and usage?  I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean upsell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The freemium model.  Take the free and get used to it and get addicted and then you buy more.  Oh, it is an upsell, true, because 100 megabytes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ain't going to get you very far at all.  In that sense, it is an upsell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wonder whether whether this is also kind of a proof of concept  for browser as world, you know, that even if you don't buy this machine  or have this machine, it makes them build everything, everything into the browser.  So you don't need anything else.  And, you know, yeah, if you have the machine, fine.  If you don't, same difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some issues. It's Debbie and under the hood.  And I, you know, if you look very closely at the font rendering,  it's not very attractive to control alt t, Leo.  That's kind of cool, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that crosh shell is a very, very, very simple shell.  So you can SSH.  You do have a little bit of a command line there.  But not much, not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's very there's no there's no none of the Linux or Unix  applications you'd expect. There's SSH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You want to just SSH somewhere where you did have a full.  I guess so. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad that they have that, actually. I don't know.  That may be. Do you think that that's going to be part of the final Chrome OS?  Or is that just for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the final Chrome OS, there was there was talk of that remote desktop feature,  that promoting feature, right?  Where are you supposed to be able to get into remote machines?  And the way that I envisioned it, the way I think it was described,  was that it was going to be like a remote desktop window inside a browser tab.  I know it's not ready yet.  So I think that this shell is a kind of another way to give kind of early,  geeks, early adopters a way to get into a remote remote server.  Last show, I was saying how I didn't see how a software developer could work on  a Chrome OS machine full time.  They said hundreds of Googlers were using their CR 48 full time.  And I said, how is this happening?  And a Googler said to me, all of our code compilation and testing and code hosting  happens on in the internal cloud.  And we access it through through Chrome.  So I think that they provided that shell just so that you know,  the prototype testers could have that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  If they're saying we're going to sell this to grandma because she doesn't want complexity,  having SSH is not is not a selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But grandma's never going to hit control alt t.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, if she does, she's going to call my radio show saying,  what happened?  It's all of a sudden it's saying, crosh.  What is that?  Crosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does that mean?  I don't even think that that shortcut shows up on the control alt slash.  I don't think so.  Keyboard.  Yeah.  So they kind of hid that there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it wouldn't be so hard to accidentally hit those keys and go,  what the hell happened?  It just happened.  Right.  Right.  It doesn't say, oh, you do.  So I have a feeling this is not fine.  That will not be in the final.  I can't imagine that'll be in the final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is this not going to come out?  Remote desktop feature will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, we don't know.  They say Samsung possibly will be making some sort of device with this.  Samsung seems to love Google these days.  We'll talk about another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung, yeah, they still do.  They have a heavy OEM business.  I think the most exciting thing about these though is that  it seems like Google's web apps development has kind of stagnated in some ways.  Like it's been a long time since I've really been wowed  on the web app side of things, not on the data side of things.  So them eating their own dog food for a while and running up into the problems  of like, well, what do I do if I want a video editor that's web based?  Or what do I do if I want all of this stuff?  Like I think even if the Chrome OS platform isn't super successful,  it might push Google to start really pushing the envelope again on web apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is some skepticism.  I'm not the only skeptic.  To me, it seems like unless they can make this free or very close to free,  there's not much of a market for such a stripped down device.  Since I can get all the functionality in any other computer that runs Chrome.  Paul Buchheit who created Gmail for Google left to create friend feed,  left sold friend feed to Facebook and just recently left Facebook,  famously tweeted a couple of days ago, tweeted a couple of days ago that  he thought Google would only have one OS.  That ultimately this was doomed by the end of the next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's been the question forever is why is there Chrome OS and why is there Android?  We're at least seeing Chrome OS now and getting to play with it and having some notion of it.  Tens of millions of Android units are already out there and now you've got the Galaxy Tab  and it's going to move to tablets and move into this same weird space that Chrome OS is at.  I don't think it's necessarily going to exist in the way that it exists now as the sole OS of a  laptop.  They could do the same thing.  There was a couple of companies actually a couple of years ago that were using  really light Linux environments as like an alternate boot.  Like you could you could just hit a button and have an instant on in a Windows laptop or whatever.  So I could see Chrome being something like that where you know you have a full-blown laptop but  you don't need to use it for everything.  You just need a web browser and so you boot into Chrome OS as opposed to Windows or OS 10 or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this also just part of Google's master plan to get us all connected all the time everywhere  and if you're not on and can't afford it this might argue against the notion of the digital  divide and if you could get this thing down to 50 bucks that's pretty compelling.  That makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or in a school.  This is like the OLPC really.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think Jeff's point earlier that this is proof of concept.  This is Google proving to consumers that all you need is the browser.  I mean I sort of agree with Paul.  I can see down the road that Chrome will be ported to Android and we'll get full Chrome on  Android with extensions and with web apps and you'll be able to pay web.  I mean the Chrome OS introduces the App Store which is a way for web developers to get paid  for their work.  So this is going to jump start the developer community, prove to consumers that all you need  is a web browser.  Eventually once Chrome gets, full Chrome gets on Android I could see maybe them killing  Chrome OS and it just being Android and so Chrome OS is just Android starting up quickly  and running the browser but Android doesn't have that super fast startup speed yet and  I don't think consumers are convinced that all they need is a browser.  Or at least not consumers but I don't, I wasn't convinced that of all the stuff that I could  do in a web browser and having the CR448 definitely made me go like oh okay there's a lot more here  than I realized there is.  Although I haven't been able to switch full time.  I mean we're on Skype now right and I needed a full machine to do that.  You can't make video calls though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has GTALK and the GTALK plugin.  It comes with a camera and a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to switch to GTALK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should all just use CR48 from now on.  That's it.  If you don't have a CR48 you can't do the show.  By the way when I first got it I said oh that must be the periodic table of the elements  number for Chrome.  It's not.  Chrome is 24.  CR48 is an unstable isotope of Chrome.  What?  Of Chrome.  Oh yeah.  Chromium isotope.  Chromium isotope.  It's an unstable.  So again with the geek.  You know these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you store things and work offline on this machine?  No absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't or can you Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can.  There's a slot for a camera card you can put in.  You can plug in a USB drive.  You can browse files.  If you go to Flickr for example and say upload file you can browse the hard drive.  You can take a screenshot by doing control.  I think it's control alt.  There's also screenshot extensions too.  Yeah but that will save the screenshot to the disk.  But where is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you can't find it.  How do you find it?  You don't have access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to Gmail and say attach file it will open up a dialog box which will browse  the hard drive.  And you can also browse the USB drive and there's a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like the iPad in that sense where it has no real it has a file system but no  real user access to it.  The program requires a program that's knowledgeable about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean you have to have a web app that triggers an open file dialog and it's really ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you browse in the open file?  I mean can you go up and down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah you can go up and down.  You can see the different disks.  If you have a USB drive plugged in you'll see it.  So can I have my email stored on that device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because on my Android, on my Galaxy tab I've got my email on here offline.  Right.  Is there offline email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that Gmail supports offline anymore because they pulled Gears but I'm  pretty sure that the plan is to support everything to HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah Android will download your mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But I think this is going to be all HTML5 offline storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not an airplane machine yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well this is the thing.  I think once the web apps mature to the point where they're all using HTML5 offline storage  then sure you could.  I think ideally once this does actually get released you'll be able to edit documents  and check email and all the apps that use offline storage.  Because the apps can either be just a wrapper that points to a hosted version which is just  like basically a glorified bookmarklet or it can be the app can be bundled.  All the JS and JavaScript and HTML markup can be bundled up into  one file that you download and that stores and that you actually store on the machine itself.  So they are kind of like offline web apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found this frustrating to use in a way that I don't find the iPad frustrating to use.  Maybe it's because it has a computer form factor and you just kind of say well it's got a keyboard  and I mean this should be a computer.  If it were a tablet though maybe well but it is not.  That's there's where you have Android.  By the way one of the things that Sundar said and I think this is true is it is much more secure.  Yes.  It does.  It does.  Yeah and you know if people really got skittish about security that might push them in the  direction of something like this.  It does a hash on the firmware and on the system files if they're modified it fixes them.  It doesn't you know it's a big deal to change any of the system or firmware stuff.  Automatic updates he he he said he sold that as a big point he said you know you don't have  to ever think about updates.  Everything's sandboxed every tab is sandboxed as it is in Chrome but also the reader and the  flash player are sandboxed he says eventually everything will be sandboxed in Chrome OS.  So it is fundamentally something written from the ground up to be fundamentally secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah the the updates are great.  I mean I think I got updates twice and it was just a little thing that said hey restart.  You've got updates and you know the restart process is only a few seconds and I just kept  going it restored my tabs and it was like nothing happened.  When you think about the pain that is you know Windows update and even OS 10 update.  It's like watch a progress bar reboot the spinny thing.  It was none of that.  Right.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know the argument has been for a long time that a computer should be as easy to  operate as a mixer.  Right a toaster or refrigerator that we don't think about those things.  Is this does this herald that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah you know I have this like really high expectation of it being like turning my TV  on really fast boot up and it isn't quite that right.  I mean it is a few seconds.  I mean it's I think it's maybe about I haven't timed it.  I think it's about 10 seconds or maybe 8 to 10 seconds which there's a little bit of a  boot up time.  From a full off.  But from a full off.  From a full totally off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't really turn it off ever though right.  I mean the whole idea is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right you sleep it right but I haven't set I haven't set up so I sign in every time  you sleep so you know you sign in and then it takes at least for me because I've got  a lot of wireless networks around me.  It takes it takes a couple of seconds.  All right start counting ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I'm going to I'm going to this is full shut down.  Ready in three two one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand  this is good radio five one thousand there's the chrome logo six one thousand seven one  thousand eight one thousand.  Of course I have to get to the log in.  Can you bypass that log in and have it automatically go right in 10 11 there it goes.  That was pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right you know that's not that's not it's not instant though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it was like 13 or 14 seconds.  You know I hate to say it and this is what this is what I showed Sundar said look I got  a MacBook Air it's got Chrome on it it boots just as fast it's got full storage it's got  an operating system it's got it you know they said but you're comparing it to you know kind  of like the creme de la creme of notebooks not everybody's going to want or can afford  a MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right but you you still write you have to run time machine you're running carbonite.  I mean you've got to worry about backing up your stuff you have to worry about keeping  you know things updated you're getting you're getting notifications that iTunes has another  update I just got one right before the show and it's actually blinking at me now.  So there's that there's that it can be used too.  I'm not I'm not defending this CR 48 I think there are problems with it I'm not I wasn't  able to use it full time but I but I do think that there's not there's an argument for this  kind of thing I think it's really just the netbook you know the netbook market I'd much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rather get a netbook which by the way is dead as far as I'm concerned I think the netbook  right what do you think Joel I mean you see this is that is it seemed to me the netbook  was a fad it was the hula hoop of the year 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I mean I think a lot of people did what I did which was buy a couple and you know  play around with it try to find the operating system I liked best for it and then realize  you know the keyboards aren't very good at this size.  It's cheesy.  Yeah I mean they're really nice but but everything seems like it's fracturing right like the  instead of you know everybody's like oh the iPad's going to be the future of computing  and it's like well yeah for some people it is and like the CR 48 is going to be the future  of computing and that's style.  Yeah I guess you're right it's a fragmented fragmented market.  Yeah I mean I feel like it's you know back back in the day to make a always you know  perilous car connection you know you had a car and you had a truck and then they had  a few different cars and then they had a few different trucks and then they had big trucks  and like computing seems like at this point it's just going wider and wider and wider  where there's a couple million units here and that's a success for somebody and there's a  couple million units there but even the fact that we're considering like an iPad and an iPhone to be  fundamentally different experiences when they're so close to being almost identical right it's  pretty you know pretty important but I do think that this pretty much will end up nuking netbooks  if you're not paying for any hardware I mean like if the hardware and all of that stuff ends up being  99 bucks like these are the kind of things I could see rolling into doing a project somewhere  and stopping by the store and buying 10 of them and you know handing them out to people and then  when they're done you know take them with you or whatever like it's the point where computing  hardware becomes almost disposable with all of the you know problems that entails you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would worry too about I think people are going to the first time the Google goes down for half a  day and all that their stuff is inaccessible it's gonna that's gonna happen that day will happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right it will happen right but again I go back to Android on my Galaxy tab I have my email  offline not on this on my Gmail right but I think if they do it on one they can do it on the other  it's not it's not out of out of but I don't think this is just I think they could do it but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that they choose not to this is a this is you know it's got two gigs of ram it's got a tiny ssd in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's coming though I mean just like basics like Gina said a lot of that is is like this close to  being there you know the fact that they had gears and pulled it back was really more just a let's  make sure we do this all on a on an open standard and open platform that everybody can use so  within another year or two I would say that all of those apps are going to be very robust offline

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well you know and to answer the question about two os's I think it's perfectly reasonable what  Eric Schmidt said this we talked about a couple of weeks ago for touch we have Android for a  standard kind of more computing with a keyboard we have Chrome OS I mean that's not unreasonable  Microsoft had multiple operating systems for years it's not unheard of yeah I don't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  still felt like a big kind of Schmidt finally found a way to explain why they had two os projects

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going at the same time what is yahoo yeah yeah well um but Gina back to your tv analogy I want  to play with every second this looks more sensible to operate than my cable box and remote control

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a lot better than the Logitech review I'll give you that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it beats Google tv all up and down it's it's a it's a dead simple computer right so for people who  are don't like the complexity of computers or didn't weren't even really aware of how complex  you know full computers are the the cr-48 definitely makes you go like oh yeah I never  touch the function keys I don't need those oh yeah a caps lock key stupid anyway um and and oh  yeah I just basically boot up my machine and open my browser anyway and this just does it for me  so I think that this is just about Google is showing people like this is you know living  living your life in in the cloud or working in the cloud all day long is definitely a possibility  and not not everybody likes that Richard Stallman doesn't right he doesn't like a lot of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  S Joel you must have it you have it around yeah we've got Buchanan who is our major Matt Buchanan  who's our major phone testing guy has it right now and is actually writing his review up but I  didn't get to play with it it came in Friday right when I was leaving well and I should say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina and I are big Nexus one you still use your Nexus one Gina yep Nexus one's still my primary  phone I still consider it the best phone ever and I you know I've been using a droid X because I  wanted Verizon but and I like the bigger screen but I have to say once you get back to that vanilla  Google experience it really all the carriers Motorola blur h even HTC which I think the  Sense UI is pretty nice it's still not as good as just that pure Google deliciousness can you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  does the curve in the screen actually make any sort of difference to you can you feel that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no and you know I don't know is it in the screen or in the bezel it's you could see a very slight  curve I mean it is very very slight and it may be I mean I'm the theory might be that's to is to  reduce reflections I don't know I I can hardly notice it but this is gingerbread 2.3 this is  T-Mobile you know T-Mobile is fine where I am I don't I don't know why I'm so set on having Verizon  but it is it just reminds you how good I think the pure Android experience is you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and what what in gingerbread is making you a couple of things about this first of all it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  much snappier I think it's the same processor as the other galaxy s but gingerbread apparently  uses more GPU acceleration and you really do notice the difference it is much much snappier  it really feels it feels like a faster phone and a more responsive phone I love the Samsung OLED  screens I mean they really do a nice job on that there you know there's some more subtle differences  for instance the let me let me start a new text message the keyboard has changed slightly you  know I use swipe and then I think it was going to be my pick today SwiftKey which I really like  but this has some SwiftKey like features this if you start typing it gives you suggestions here  which you can click is the new keyboard there's some so I think they've done a nice job I think  the keyboard is very good subtle but good there's some interesting choices for instance they've put  manage apps right on the main menu here so so then that's useful after years of saying you  don't need a task killer right they put it in the main menu and I have to say one of the things and  I'm sure there's much more you know I'm just every time I use it I discover more stuff but one of the  things I really like is the new the new battery display let me let me get the  where is it where do they put that power now I've lost it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it really does seem like the OS has come into its own in gingerbread though like visually and  the way it all kind of hangs together like it doesn't feel like it's necessarily just cloning

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh it's beautiful it's it is it it really is its own thing here's this is the you know we who have  to survive with these phones for more than five or six hours a day spend a lot of time in this  battery section look they have a graph now it says four hours 53 minutes on battery and if I tap the  graph it shows me this is this is battery usage it shows me phone signal it's so gps on wi-fi it's  so geeky a wake screen on so these little bars are when the screen so you can really see what's  using it I know I guess most people wouldn't want that but I like it no I mean it's it's nice for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when mom says why does my phone die after two hours well this was a lot of it because you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you saw right here oh display use 21 percent but now you really can get granular on this and see a  graph of battery usage that is nerdy isn't it it's a very you know though on the other hand is a very  polished phone I mean literally and figuratively it's piano black it just feels good in your hand  it's just a nice good hand feeling yeah is it plasticky yes it is you know it's just it's funny  because Samsung it's just like the galaxy s it's just like the focus which is the windows phone  it's got a little hump here all the phones now seem to have these little humps at the bottom for  antenna I guess good camera by the way first time I've had a really decent camera an iphone 5 almost  as good camera on an android device one or two cameras front facing two cameras  you know no software as far as even fring doesn't use that front camera yet but it's there  good video not not seven here I am not 720p by the way 480p I asked I just randall about that said  you know it's a phone and people are complaining you can't shoot high def video come on  and 480p is very good the quality is very good the camera is very good surprisingly good  the other thing is out to other media people no they did not hand it out at the media event but  I understand Googlers are going to get them and it will be available at best buy on Thursday  best buy says two units only they'll start selling it when the store is open at 8 a.m

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  online 8 a.m eastern time and what was the they shipped on mock or they only on T-Mobile this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for everybody there's apparently both this is an unlocked which is great I'm thrilled you know  they want this one back but I will buy it probably spend more money to get it unlocked  five five yeah it's unsubsidized so it's expensive really way too much doesn't have the the 18d  frequencies too ah I don't think so I don't know that's a good question I don't know  I think this is I think once again if you want the best Android experience it's a Google phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oddly enough so if you had a droid would you upgrade would you upgrade the first droid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah oh yeah in fact I'm not I'm going to use this instead of the droid x I'm going to buy one and  put my T-Mobile sim in it because it's just really nice I wish you know I wish I had this in France  it's really nice very speedy I put you know I can bog that droid x down pretty good and I  guess that's gingerbread because I don't think the processor is that different but  a couple of negatives one is you can't there's no SD card slot so you but it does come with 16 gigs  which is you know I was able to put a you know decent amount of music on there it seems to have  I think it has a gig of storage for the apps I must be wrong but it seems like there's tons of room  for app storage if I go to manage apps I just got a ton of space  that's good 248 megs used 724 free doesn't that sound like there's a meg of ram in that  a meg of app space in addition that's the internal storage in addition to the 16 gigs of  SD card that's a lot it's 529 without a plan 199 with a two-year okay that's fine okay it certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  looks like those screens are you're navigating between those screens very quickly they seem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  very snappy just watching you just tap around and I'm running a fairly you know I always like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these stupid live wallpapers this is a live you know I like those two and they are really stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah yeah I put this one on this is this is how I test how snappy a phone is this this wallpaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just kills the droid x it's a fish tank and and the fish are swimming around in the background I  mean there's a lot going on in this thing it doesn't have to be a fish tank it's a fish tank  going on in this thing doesn't doesn't it doesn't it doesn't faze it I mean it's just as snappy  the other thing I found is having multiple screens like seven screens really it slows down the droid  x having this only has five screens in the gingerbread having a lot of widgets seems to  make a difference you know in terms of performance but nothing that I've done so far has bogged this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing down see that's still my favorite thing about about like android phones in general is  just the way that the front page and all that information is put up there if I could have that  plus all of the iphone apps and the whole you know iphone experience that that would be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  perfect phone we're getting close aren't we I mean angry birds is on there fruit ninja is on there a  number of companies have announced they're going to do android versions the only one that seems to  be a real holdout is netflix who says well we're worried about you know piracy yeah there's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the limit of I think didn't they just bump it up for gingerbread I think they went from 25 meg to  50 meg on on how big an app can be ah okay and a lot of the really hot uh iphones apps especially  the games are like yeah many hundreds infinity blade is almost a gig it's 700 megs which is great  like oh that game is so good so awesome I know so you play these games and you're like like you know  that's a lot of it for me on the iphone and I love the iphone I love the the four hardware and the  experience and you know whatever it's all great but I could probably move to android but I I feel  like with my iphone I have a games platform that's fairly credible and my tool and then you know if  I go to android it's really just the tools but yeah they'll get there it's worth with friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they've been asked words with friends is going to be on here that was a big missing uh uh gap

Transcript:  oh don't hit the bomb though oh good to know yeah yeah yeah oh go ahead jeff what's your question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go ahead jeff I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm mesmerized too um two things one my my galaxy tab I found  this is a problem that's not uh uncommon unfortunately it suddenly stops recognizing  phios routers and it won't get an ip from the wi-fi yeah it won't get and then this is there's  a lot of them and it's across carriers across uh galaxy tab carriers Verizon by the way is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  notorious for using a really crappy box for its routers is that what it is well any uh any uh any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tip for me anything I should try jake's coming home Saturday so I'll have him do it that seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  weird I mean wi-fi is very strange right that's the thing right wi-fi is wi-fi I blame Verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh it's their fault yeah but you know how you're never going to get anywhere trying to convince

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them of that if you I mean does it not fix it if you turn off your router and turn it back on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no no people are saying well it fixes it if you if you rebuild the galaxy tab but you know you  don't want to do that every three weeks if it just suddenly stops recognizing anymore that's weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  should get an ipad would that fix it hey hey I got hold he already sent his ipad back I just made  100 bucks from Steve Jobs that was awesome I'm by OS are you on that program because I am too the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs hundred dollars if you mentioned me program it's great it's a real subsidy for  those of us working in the in the trade I'm on I'm on the academic equivalent which is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I pledge to quote Clay Shirky once a day oh that's good that's good does Clay give you the money or  to Steve no there's no money it's considered just a good to the world it's just a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way literal net it's a joke so my galaxy when I go to my galaxy tab dot net you're right  this is this is apparently a very common problem yeah we're rising Fios and the galaxy tab it won't  it won't dhcp to the tab that's very interesting so here's my other quick question on my android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phone when I go to all the applications they're in alphabetical order on my galaxy tab they're  not and I can't figure out how to put them in that's a carrier that's really annoying it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  carrier issue that's the carrier yeah really yeah because well I have the same problem on the  Motorola and then I and I went to the I opened my apps on my on my Nexus S and I was shocked  Angry Birds was was up at the front which had never been before it's in alphabetical order  yeah which I love yeah that's a carrier or maybe not carrier maybe hardware manufacturer but that's  it's probably hardware it's probably that's probably the Samsung thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is why you order on the Nexus one yeah because it's a Google experience I think and  I just assumed it was the same everywhere that's crazy this is the only thing that drives me really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  crazy is that these buttons are in different orders on almost every device you know I wish  they would the bottom buttons you know so I have to relearn first back menu search home I mean  that's perfectly logical it's just different from the way Motorola does it this these are soft  buttons by the way and I know some people like physical buttons I kind of like the soft buttons  I think this is a boy you're gonna love this Gina yeah it looks really it looks really cool it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great to go back to that your your router question can you change the channel or change the encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and see if I just saw that here that I don't know I gotta find that out somebody said to change the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  channel to 11 yeah to just do it to something different than what it is maybe you're getting  some interference but that's not a file you know that's not a Fios router specific thing that's  something I would you know do with any router I was having trouble connecting this seems to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  direct interaction between Fios and the Galaxy Tab as I look through my tab is fine everywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah not good um so I'm not watching movies on it at home because I don't want to go through my  bandwidth yeah so you're you're a big fan of the tab I'm loving it you know and because I had to  write a column on it today and it is the perfect form factor for taping you're kidding it's not  too small to type no it's it's it's it's incredibly right for typing thumb typing  very interesting beauty of it um typed a column on it oh yeah oh yeah without wanting to kill  anyone that's amazing that's saying that is amazing yeah that's that's the key to it so you can really  um I can't show you my thumbs but but it really yeah then that's something you can't do on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPad uh you have to type like a typewriter on the iPad it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so are you using Google Docs Jeff or I'm using think uh no I'm using um think office  came with think office and the god bless um Dropbox yeah yes indeed the combination works  just beautifully so I had the start of this column I had to write and then I just went on the train  today when I'm on ground and I'm going along I get back and I switch to my other machine and  and I have a you know you start to have a sense of what life is like on Chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the mouse isn't quite as you see you Californian don't do populous things like I have to do just  stand on the subway yes you're right standing on the subway I'm right in the column no you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sit in my easy chair you're in your chauffeur my limo yeah yeah to Chipotle that was good  did we was that on the show or is that what that was off the show that was before the show we  should explain I have never been in burrito now I have never been to Chipotle no longer owned by  McDonald's there's the good news and both Gina and Jeff are major Chipotle fans so Eileen I think  was coerced by these guys to stop at the Chipotle because she lives near one and bring me some and I  confess not only is the not only is the not only is the not only was the bowl good but there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um like they've been sprayed with a lime coating or something gosh that sounds great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it when he said oh the iPad that's not mobile I just loved that yeah there's something satisfying  about that yeah most of these executives are so mealy-mouthed and careful that you never oh that's  kind of here's another picture of Zuck with a bunch of oh you got to look at the at the family

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Assange will have a lasting impact and you can never be as secretive again and that's going to  be really important but I think Zuckerberg's impact is bigger though there's some arguing that he  already won with us two years ago right if you go to the main page here it is there's a this is the  slideshow that's the picture they didn't use no there's one that says photos Zuckerberg the early years this is not it

Transcript:  definitely definitely great sense of what builds a great product people want we had a debate on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  twit on Sunday about whether he who was smarter Bill Gates or Zuckerberg and I said I think Bill's  a better businessman it's clear Mark is not a great businessman but I don't think anybody has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the insight into people that Mark Zuckerberg but here's the here's the key difference I think and  this is kind of a will end up being a joke about the movie but but Gates never invented anything he  executed brilliantly on mentions of others exactly Zuckerberg you know all movie jokes aside invented  this exactly it was his creation yeah so you see you put executives into two buckets the Gates  bucket or the jobs bucket right I would put Zuckerberg in the jobs bucket actually I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gates and Jobs have more in common Zucks more like was I think Jobs was a productizer a businessman

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wait we think that Zuck invented social networking no no no but I think that he has a vision for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  product you just said it Gina right he definitely has vision for the product right right but but he  looked at my space and he looked at Friendster and said I'm gonna take the worst things about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these two things and do them much better right yeah but he he created the wall he created photo  tagging I mean there's there's some see you know relate you're just your relationship status  he created some some things that are sticky as hell he figured out he did he did I'm not I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  okay he figured out I think that the these you know these parts of these ideas were  in a lot of different places he brought them together to one unified product which I give  him total credit for I don't think that he invented a lot of this stuff I mean well Jobs  didn't invent the mouse either right absolutely right so you know I don't think that Jobs  invent stuff Jobs looks at what's out there and goes that last extra mile and says I'm gonna  make this amazing yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's Zuck does that for sure that's what I'm  saying that's that's what's similar yeah maybe maybe you're right yeah maybe that was the wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way all right I'll give you that and it's a small difference all right Gawker had a big  password breach and I know you guys are gonna have something to say about it so let's take a break  and come back Gina Tripani is here as is Joel Johnson from Gizmodo Jeff Jarvis we're talking  Google in the cloud right now I'd like to tell you to register your domains at hover.com if you  go to twig.hover.com and get 10% off your next registration hover is domain name registrations  made simple without all the frills the bells the whistles the upsells that the other guys do you  get automatic for instance automatic who is privacy it's part of the price there's no additional  sell they don't do hosting so you're not they're not going to say oh get the hosting to your  package we get all the it's very simple domain name forwarding email forwarding you can set up  email addresses you create url extensions you've got privacy controls it's all simple it's all  clean it's kind of the google of domain name registration clean interface it gets the job  done and that's why I use hover and registered ever I moved everything over to hover all my new  domain names registered at hover and I couldn't be happier twig.hover.com for 10% off and by the way  you're gonna love their no hold policy if you've ever called these other guys they it's like they  get money it's like they make more money if they put you on hold the longer you're on hold it's  almost I think they're playing a game with you these other guys how long before they hang up  how long can we put them on hold before they give up not with hover if once once you know during  business hours when you call you get a live person and you are that's it no hold they're  going to handle your problem or or explain what to do or so forth they the domain transfers are  free they'll charge you 10 bucks to extend the domain you'll get one more year automatically  when you transfer over that's what I did actually I took I took advantage of it got four years on  each try it right now will you twig.hover.com all right so um this is we were talking about this  off the air I think but let's talk about it on the air now gawker got hacked you you life hacker  is a gawker property but did you leave Gina before gawker was involved or life hacker was always a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gawker so you've worked for you've worked for Nick I've worked I worked for Nick for five years I  own stock in the company now sometimes I sometimes they send me articles from my site I should  what's that you do yeah a lot a lot of employees and some of them do now I like that I should have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  been nicer than this and Joel Johnson writes for gizmodo which is of course a gawker property as is  gawker itself valley wag fleshbot yes they know I know as you guys don't talk about fleshbot as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're a separate advertising package yeah it depends on if it's ad sales talking about  fleshbot or if it's the editorial talking about but somebody hacked the entire database now what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is what I didn't know I thought it was just you know your routine run-of-the-mill hack  but it was actually targeted it was like let's get Nick kind of yeah I mean it's that's what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  said that's certainly what it looks like there had been you know and I and I for what it's worth I  mean I pretty much know what everybody else knows at this point but you know they they had said that  they were going after gawker.com and Nick didn't in particular it sounded like for their arrogance  that was the term at least that stuck with me so yeah they made a concerted effort to actually  penetrate and had apparently had access to things for a while before they released it wow now it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one thing to go after gawker but it's another thing to release that information although  what did that what did people really get there's not credit card numbers in there it's just  passwords most of them crappy apparently email addresses usernames and passwords okay username

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and passwords which is you know if they if they were it's a it's a sticky situation right like  because my instinct is to say well you shouldn't use those things on other accounts that matter  like don't use the thing that you would sign up for gawker with your bank but at the same time  you know gawker we were the ones that lost the passwords and lost the emails and so we we can't  we're certainly not criticizing anybody if they made that mistake so I know that you know world of  warcraft apparently had some problems twitter had some problems linkedin sent around some emails

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  didn't send out a great message where they just made you change it obviously obviously they they  crocked the the leak and if you were a gawker user they sent you out something  yeah very smart I appreciated that that's interesting yeah so they proactively reset

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  passwords for any email address that showed up in the gawker data leak which I you know I think  makes a lot of sense right because it's kind of I mean a lot of these were kind of like throwaway  accounts oh it's just some blog I'm going to comment on it's not like financial information  but you also kind of might feel the same way about twitter or facebook or linkedin oh it's  just a social network whatever i'll just use my weakest password so it kind of makes sense that  a lot of people used a similar password on gawker and twitter and linkedin and I think it's great  that I thought I thought it was great that they those companies proactively sent out emails  resetting those people's passwords to avoid any problems and also there was there was a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bit of a kind of you know complaint going around that that we hadn't sent out an email to our you  know one half a million plus users and basically that was happening while while all these other  emails were going out they were figuring out the best way to send out those emails and the process  for all of that but like to defend our tech team just at least on a human level like they were  dealing with all of the nightmare of the hack while at the same time trying to figure out the  logistics and the and the etiquette of emailing you know a million and a half users all at once  so it took them you know it took them longer but you know the the flip side is we definitely got  caught with our pants down and the the political aspect of it aside like that the idea that our  users should be punished because a handful of people don't like our attitude aside it was a  real bummer that we we dropped the ball on that one for sure yeah i mean you know sorry i was going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to say like you know it was a horrible week like it was i mean for me it was really kind of outside  the company at this point it was just like watching a you know this terrible freeway rec  sort of unfold it's in like slow slow motion it was really bad and and what's hard for me because  most of the tech team are my friends tom plunkett's a cto a friend of mine i introduced him to nick  he knows better like this wasn't a this wasn't like a lack of technical ability on the part of  our engineers because you know most most of the articles written about this especially in the tech  press are about how bad the encryption was and how you know terrible you know and weak the my sequel  database password was but you know the reality is in that startup world especially tech startup  world especially in denton startup world like putting time and resources toward infrastructure  is not as high a priority you know it's about shipping new stuff and i think this is just  mortifying and embarrassing for the tech team and for editorial especially the editorial of the tech  sites at lifehacker and gizmodo and and it was a hard lesson learned i gotta i gotta point out that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this happens all the time at the same time that this happened people who walmart sent out emails  to many of its customers their accounts had been breached with much more serious data in there i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean this happens all the time it does it still i mean it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing and  it makes people think you know it just it's hard to be you know people have short memories but it's  also still just just just rough when it's happened and they said that there are going to be future  releases so we don't even know what else that they have if they have anybody's going to hold

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this against gawker i really yeah and i don't as far as what they're talking about future releases  i don't i mean i can't imagine what they would have that would be i mean i should knock on wood  but like i can't imagine that it's going to be worse i i think there's like a lot of the stuff  that they were pulling out of campfire for instance uh you know that they were throwing in our face  like see the arrogance of these people and like that's just people joking in irc and campfire  and you know like it's just people talking so uh you know we'll we'll see what happens but like  i uh i i definitely i have to underline what jena said is like at gawker to step step out of it as  an employee role and more of just like me and my experience with gawker over the years like the  tag team has always kind of gotten short shrift financially you know and and they've always had  to really make magic happen with just uh just a little bit of uh far less resources than they  probably should have so they've you know they're not they're not dumb they weren't careless um you  know everybody made mistakes there were mistakes made on a security standpoint in company wide  like we were never as stride in about you know changing passwords and all of that stuff now  or all of that stuff as we are now but yeah that tech team always worked really hard  and and it's totally the last week have been beat up moving on i want to talk about some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  google acquisitions google hires there's a google was very busy we we haven't talked about google  books yet did you talk about that last week we did we did okay so we don't have to mention that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what did you think what did you say about it uh good thing yeah we yeah we talked about how it was  kind of a good thing i talked about we you know we talked about the android app and uh jeff's book  is on google books mine is not yeah which is kind of kind of neat the problem is you can't mark text

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which just drives me nutty which you can in the kindle yeah it's not quite as fully baked as the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kindle but you know the kindle wasn't fully baked when it came out either right it's first  generation although you think they might have learned from what other stuff does i just downloaded  it i haven't bought anything yet i mean i'm always going to buy stuff through the kindle store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because i have it works it works well it reads nicely on my galaxy tab i'm liking it all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's a thing yeah i'm kind of invested in kindle and when i think i want to buy books online i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think amazon i don't think google yeah speaking of uh book readers the nook uh you know which is an  android-based device but a kind of a hobbled and board android-based device but a lot of people  are reviewing it very positively it's color the new nook it's backlit running android and now the  latest rumor is that barnes and noble is going to put froyo on it in the next couple of months and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it will be an actual tablet yeah that was an a pretty amazing backdoor attack on getting into  the android tablet market no kidding yeah it's you know it's still going to be a little weak

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hardware wise it's not very fast what is a processor i don't i don't remember it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  nearly as snappy as the samsung for instance right but it's a lot of a lot of this product

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way barnes and noble is denying that but i don't know if that means anything well yeah a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  lot of this product stuff is just approach right like if you sell something as an ebook reader  and then say oh but it'll also be a tablet if you want to use that later on people are going  to be far less critical than saying this is a new tablet so well it's 249 it's cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a lot cheaper than the samsung darn straight yeah 599 can you get the kindle app on it  no i want that's interesting if you add the android marketplace i guess you could  that might be that might be the single biggest reason why barnes and noble will not do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right right because it's kind of undermines their store well i want choices hey i bought kindle  books and i want to get you know i would like to get them on my e-reader tablet yeah the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing we didn't talk about last week that i don't understand is how google books evidently will work  with the small bookstore now and you can make it which makes some sense a bookstore should become  a showroom and you then just order the book otherwise fine pay premium i like that yeah i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean it looks like it's just a web-based partnership so if you go to a powell's website i'll say hey  buy ebooks online powered by google books i think that's the how it works well that's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then powell still gets the business and the traffic and the yeah maybe they get a cut  and some revenue well i'm i'm sure they would and so they said which is really smart positioning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  against amazon you know amazon's killed all these books yeah that's right uh oh you know i would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i'll tell you what if that's the case i would absolutely move to the google books platform  just to keep those local bookstores around i think that's that's actually a very compelling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  argument in favor of that well then the idea i think again is you change i think bookstores  should change the model you know they've got to figure out how to change the model so that it's  not about holding inventory even though they're the inventory risk is the publishers not the  bookstores but there's still a cost issue there and if it became more of a reading room showroom  hey you want to read this when you leave and in a sense barnes and nobles headed there since you can  as i understand you can you can read any book electronic book while you're in the store  yeah right so so if you want to leaf through or look at things like that and get a sense of it  read you know just flip pages and all that fine hold on to two copies of every book  hmm and then but but have a far larger selection of books so your inventory risk and if you really  want to have it fine you can buy this one but you're going to pay full retail well and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  independent bookstores do so many other things including you know speakers and i mean it's  really important part of the community i would love to keep them around and that's great but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  when's the last time you went to a local bookstore it's been a while we have one down the street

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but but um my wife goes and my kids go yeah the worst question for me joel before i started

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  writing the latest book and doing research is when's the last time i read a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i read books all the time i live in portland now and so uh you know the big powells is obviously  here but the last time like the last three times i think that i've been to powells has been when  i've been taking books to sell back to powells and then just walking out with cash and not buying  any more books so i'm part of the problem apparently one thing i'm really unhappy about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the change to the refund policy in the google marketplace they're improving the google  marketplace the new marketplace should be rolling out now lots of nice features except instead of  24 hours to return a program now you have 15 minutes whoa not so good this was to me one of  the chief selling points of of android over the iphone is you could try any application  in the marketplace and if you didn't like it return it and get your money back you can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on iphone how's that i i feel like i'm probably tipping a hat that i shouldn't i shouldn't give  but i i've gotten tons and all of the app store stuff for apple is handled all the refunds and  all of that stuff is handled by apple so you pretty much just have to file for a refund and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they'll give you a refund for almost anything really so you just say i don't like it give me  my money back and they will pretty much how many times do you get to do that before they say get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  out of here i've probably had 10 things over the last couple years that i've given back yeah so  it's clearly a soft policy like it's not something they have kind of clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  marked i didn't know you could do that i think that somebody told me the reason that the the  google change is 24 to 15 is because people were buying games and beating them in less than 24  hours and then returning them and i guess if you're an avid game player that makes sense i can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  imagine doing that that seems like that's nuts yeah if you've done if you put that effort go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ahead get your refund yeah really take your money back maybe if maybe it seems this is this is  obviously a change in response to developers and it's the kind of thing i don't like because what  it is is it's it's saying the developers all right we're gonna we're gonna respond to your  interests over and above that of our users and i hate it is that's a big jump too yeah yeah like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i can understand needing a few hours to kind of get a handle on something before you know if it's  going to work in 15 minutes it's nothing that's basic 15 minutes is not you can test this and see  if you like it 15 minutes is i accidentally bought this right that's like that's really the only

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  scenario that covers yeah and i'm and boy head go ahead and try to get a refund from google like  you do from apple you know the python support is not going to let you do that i'll tell you that  topic dot pi doesn't compute refund dot pi hey let's take a break when we come back lots more  to talk about and i will play that onion that onion bit it's very funny and a little and it's  got a little dig at the yahoo at the end of it as well because we're getting it back uh well yeah i  think uh i think uh anonymous relented uh i do want to mention our friends at general elect with  the creators of the ge eco imagination challenge this was a i don't want to say a contest but i  guess it was in a way a competition among inventors innovators uh um people who uh you know  startup folks to create to really reinvent how we use energy entrepreneurs business innovators and  students competed for 200 million dollars in investment capital from general electric in  three categories renewable energy to encourage uh you know things like wind water and the sun  uh grid efficiency everybody's talking about the smart grid in years past now they want to talk  about the digital energy and some very interesting ideas came out of the eco imagination challenge  there to improve transparency at every step of the grid to reduce waste to give more choices for  consumers and energy providers and then finally uh green homes and buildings because of course  we've got to reduce consumption as uh as well if you go to eco imagination dot com slash challenge  right now you can see the wieners the people who uh who are participating in this 200 million dollar  investment some really great ideas uh for changing the way we use energy we create energy  we distribute energy really a great project great ideas catch on great ideas catch i invite you to  visit at eco imagination dot com slash challenge to find out more and by the way watch our green  tech today show because we've got a lot of these innovators on it general electric sponsoring the  show and we're very proud of it it's a twit tv slash gtt or you can find it uh on itunes or  the zoom store anywhere you can find podcasts green tech today thank you general electric for  making that possible and for sponsoring the eco imagination challenge eco imagination dot com  slash challenge so jeff uh you tweeted something about uh google and acquisitions what was that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right there was a washington post column uh that argued that it was wacky because it's from a  business writer who just said well i don't have a problem with google being you know big and doing  things on their own but i really disagree with that they should be able to grow with requisition  and arguing that they should be regulated on antitrust basis for that which makes no sense  whatsoever this is the business section of the washington post it's just unfair on the face of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it why should google be hobbled artificially like that name any company cisco every time there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  downturn cisco cisco you know probably has arguably nearly the the monopoly of part of  the communications business uh i'm gonna go a little far there but but but you know i don't  know what what's what cisco's market share oh i don't know probably 80 i mean it's huge right  right and google is 63 percent or something like that in the u.s. right and so how does cisco grow  well chambers brags all the time by buying buying buying so google came back and responded to this  as well they should have very smart immediately the same day and wrote a blog post up on their  own blog saying that um this is ridiculous and we're not you know antitrust and we're just doing  business the way you do business but at the same time the pardon me stupid french country just the  government goes attacking this look at this look at me tweets oh this look at me tweets the google  eating surrender monkeys of france uh wrote this you know this is this ridiculous announcement  trying to argue that google's responsible for the death of news it called links parasitic oh please  misunderstanding but here's my favorite part they they complained that that you can't pull out of  google news uh without pulling out a google search which is not true patently wrong ask mr murdoch all  you have to do is do a search and they publicly attack google right without a friggin fact  so they didn't even think they could have googled that exactly all you gotta do i tell i said okay  let me make sure i went to google news no times of london go to google search times of london look  on assange boom tons of stuff the authority the torre te de la concurrence so google becomes you  know the whipping boy you know the the phrase that i hear again and again and again this is what came  out in the washington post piece i heard in an interview today for the bbc you know is google  too big and i keep saying show me the definition of big right right and and it's it's almost a an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  anti-capitalistic view that well well but they're just too big right i don't think it's that i think  it's a real fear of the power not the size but the power that google exerts yeah but leo okay fine so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so the issue in in in europe is um uh the idea that they can they can do two things number one  they can favor their own sites well name me a media brand that doesn't right and go to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  today show this is in fact that was our next topic was this and it's true uh i'd see at google's  defenses well we're just doing what our viewers want they're they're not even saying well we're  favoring our own sites they're just saying this makes our search results better and it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even places is free even if they did favor their own stuff name me a company that doesn't right  google was the first media company that stopped doing that again today's show you're going to see  what are they what do they promote nbc shows yahoo what do they promote yahoo stuff aol what do they  promote aol stuff that's the way the world operates and google pulled back from that so that's the  first thing they're complaining of the second thing that complain against google we've discussed  before is that they do have power of god when it comes to deciding and this is matt cutts whether  you're uh you know a spam site or legit site and i have argued that that that that gets them in  trouble and they should have my ideas they have a jury of peers to decide those things but those  are the two cases here so so you know the argument yeah you you you say that leo about power but i  don't i'm gonna get smashed for this you know google's not all powerful it's not that powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
