Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Came up this is the same song

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what this is actually what makes tick-tock pretty amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that because because that's the collaborative part where you right?  People add on and do edit and do edit and do edit. Yeah, right. It's pretty wow  It's pretty amazing. If you go down you also go to the I think the original one  Hold on here. So I'm on the wrong page

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's I've got some from a CNET. Let's see  See shanties are taking from Wellerman to drunken sailor  See shanties are attracting the attention of landlubber  Ticktocks it went wild. I don't know what happened said the guy at the center of it all  So he starts it solo and then other people on tick-tock pick it up one guy comes back

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one guy comes back the guy with a really deep voice  Yeah, the bass he's great and then and then another one does it and another one does it and it becomes a chorus  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is aberration. Yeah, and that's the thing that's cool about  Tick-tock is people can take your little track. Here's one with strings. They've added strings to this  Yes  All right, that's pretty awesome I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doing Northwest Passage. Okay, it's very similar and I love it because immediately Hank Green who?  Apparently has decided tick-tock is the hip place to be not YouTube is  Explaining the Wellerman song. Yeah, let's hear it. You all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tick-tock and I love that I'm on see shanty tick-tock and I hope there's more  But I have some questions about this song because I listened to it with my son a bunch this weekend and I didn't understand  All of the references in it now the main one. Okay, that's fine  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like that this is not just people lipsink  Yeah, you know  I would watch this cuz my only impression of tick-tock was everybody's doing a lip sync or some sort of a white  Transition into something else to do on and it just got tired. That's how it started. That's what musically was it was just lip-syncing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But somehow when they bought musically and that some and I think really the I the main  Thing that they did right was they said royalty free you can and pop stars agreed you can use our tracks  And it's not gonna undermine our sales and that really is it's right, you know, have you watched  The  Fran Lebowitz  Martin Scorsese documentary on that works. Yeah, is it good? Yes. Awesome. Looks like it'd be pretty fun. It's called pretend  It's a city. She's hysterical. But one of the things she says, oh, she's she's just like so grumpy and brilliant  She's the Lewis black before there was lose black. Yeah  But she says the thing that's great about talent is it's just sprinkled around like sand  It's not you can't you can't earn it or learn it you're born with it and it's ran. It's completely random and  That's I think when I heard that I thought you know what? That's true  Whether it's writing painting ice skating playing a bass throwing a football  But he should see or see shit, but what I realized is that's that's really where YouTube tick-tock  Really is a huge thing because it is randomly scattered  Mm-hmm  And so it's not the people who went to Berkeley College of Music who or signed a record company deal  Then the old days those are the people who got we got to hear if you were maybe in the subway you heard  Right that happy step in all the time Jeff you to go in the subway  Maybe some brilliant violinist you go. What this guy's playing for bucks in the subway. Yeah. Yeah  But now you played with subway what really? Yeah, would you play hockey?  guitar  Really?  You'd go down there and yes, did you make money? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah some days I made cheese one day. I think I made $150 for two hours. I think we used to know me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice. Yeah, it was great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  the best part is because it's the subway you can literally play the same five songs over and over because people are just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need a repertoire week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just do the times they are changing over and over and over is that what you would do folk kind of folk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, Neil Young Bob Dylan. Nice. Do you still do any of that? I do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I love that  See that I you know when she said that I thought it's a shame  I didn't get any talent because I would have loved to she also said  That musicians there's something that there's no other profession  Where people just love you because everybody associates a particular song with their youth or good moments in their youth or their child  and so  Musicians had unlike almost any other profession have this people just love them because it's it's this memory of their youth and so  Where then it made me sad? Yeah that you know, she she talked about it  She plays the cello or played the cello at one point  She said the the elementary schools would you know, you get a free instrument up to a certain point  Then you have to buy your own and they took her cello back and her parent and she said I need a cello our parents  Trying to figure out how they could buy one and find finally she goes downstairs says mom dad don't buy me a cello  I will I will never be I will never be good at this  It's a waste of your money. I don't have that talent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unlike what the hardhead told me in that trombone of his does he did you buy him a trombone?  I did and he was good. He used it up until we got over here and in California  He stopped playing elsewhere, yeah, he was focusing more on other stuff particularly girls sports and what sports?  Okay. Yeah, definitely sports girls here in a few girls

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of sports

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he was really good. I give him credit. It wasn't a total waste of my money cuz he was he was really good  He was first chair pretty much soon as he picked it up. Are you sad that he didn't keep going?  Yeah a little bit  Because I like how  Having an instrument in your hands just just keeps you busy, you know  Mm-hmm. It's just something about the the part of it, too, you know  Did he like it? Yeah, he loved it. He loved it. He was good  And it's funny every now and then I'll catch him listening to classical music. Good. So he has an appreciation  Right, you know and I can remember just thinking back to  When people would laugh at us  Growing up for listening to classical music, but you know, he was he just embraced it him and him and his brother  They both enjoy jazz and classical music as well as some of the other  Wild and crazy popular music that's all over the likes of tik-tok

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so, you know if you if you're not gonna be a professional trombonist learning appreciation for music and and  That's a lifelong game. Yeah, that's a plot. That's a pause. So when we gathered here last week  It seems like a year ago  It seems like a year ago the the Congress was being assaulted when we gathered here last week  So even though it does seem like a year ago and a lot of news has happened  We haven't talked about it on this show yet  the in the aftermath  Facebook which had resisted this ban Trump then Twitter  Which had resisted abandon for 12 hours and finally banned him completely  So did Pinterest I didn't know the president had a big Pinterest account  Maybe that baby's does he's just been he was banned on YouTube and then he just got banned again  This time permanently  Apple  Google first said you can't put parlor on the Google Play Store because there's too much violent  There are too many violent posts there  Apple initially said you've got to moderate it and then finally said all right, we're pulling it  Then Amazon Web Services says we're not going to host it then parlors lawyers said we're not going to work for you  Parlor is suing Amazon  We found out the par this has all happened in just a matter of  Days, we found out the parlor had very poor security  And and that a hacker had downloaded pretty much the entire database including all the metadata of all the photos  FBI's are all over the place  Photos FBI's very hilarious. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently they used a a trial version a free trial version of a security product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that easy folks?  But before parlor was banned it leapt to number one on the app store  Of course and had many hundreds of thousands of people sign up gab too  Um, it's been kind of crazy  Uh, it's been kind of nutty

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Air bnb just announced that they're going to cancel  reservations for uh air bnbs in washington dc during inauguration week, there's some concern that  Uh activists will come back the number one video  On twitter and and reddit was uh one, uh one, uh,  Insurrectionist who went to the airport?  And found out all of a sudden he was on the no-fly list and burst into tears. That was very popular  It's crazy  It's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First draft news has a list of all the platforms and and what they did and when  And it's it's everyone you can think of shopify paypal  twitch kentucky reddit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so many people so many disney are pulling  there are donations to republican members of congress who  uh, uh  Protested, uh the vote said it was uh, it was a fraudulent lot of companies  um  You had an interview on the bbc jeff. Why don't you tell us about that? I could play it but  Is he gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, i'm here in audio, but the your video is like that's all right audio is fine seconds late. Yeah, okay fine the um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His bbc appearance, uh, I I just have to say it  That I love you mr. Jarvis and thank you for that that was should I should I play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. I was I was afraid you're gonna say I love you, but yeah, that's what I I thought was coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here let me let me play typically what I say here in the house to everybody else, but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The bbc the bbc is not going to take us down if I play it right jeff. No, not at all. Not at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on twitter net is brought up as many places to go  But let's be clear that free speech doesn't only include the right to speak  It includes the right to choose what you carry  To have uh compelled the speech is not free speech  So the platforms are perfectly within their rights to choose to carry donald trump or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But isn't the problem when the platforms become so big they're almost like public utilities. They just happen to be run by a corporation. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The platforms have opened up speech in ways that our old business of mass media never allowed  In this country we have mass media controlled by old white men who look like me  And now the social media allowed black lives matter to come out and me too to come out and all kinds of movements  And yes, it also enables  The miscreants of of the congressional riot to come out as well, but that's the nature of free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But isn't the problem here that you end up with the people in charge of tech companies who largely are driven by  The considerations of profits making decisions about whose speech is acceptable and whose speech isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well my they are damned if they do and damned if they don't because for the past four years  I've heard people screaming to take down donald trump to take down  Disinformation to fact check to the net and then when they do they get accused of being too big

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just can't win but the reality is though jeff that they may have taken president trump down  They may have currently disabled parlor  But you and I both know if we spent some time on twitter or on instagram or on facebook or any of these platforms  We'd soon enough find people doing much the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even if we took down every bit of racist speech we could find and played whack-a-mole with it all  The fundamental problem remains that america is a racist country  So so worrying about this moral panic of technology and social media  Distracts us from the real problem that we have in this nation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But surely you're not saying and of course racism did predate these big tech giants, but surely you're saying their products  Have not affected it at all surely  You're not arguing that the internet hasn't in some way changed the dynamic of racism within within american society

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am saving on the balance. It has it brought a huge improvement  Black lives matter and the stories that occurred in the hashtag living while black never came out in big old white mass media  Because it didn't happen to them because the newsrooms were not diverse a cause that you care about deeply  Now finally social media enabled people who did not have a voice in mass media to have their voice their press  And so I strongly believe that we've got to leave this open  So in general i'm in favor of free speech and of leaving them on there, but i'm also in favor of the platforms  Deciding what norms they should maintain they have a right to do that as well  I think in the net that the net has improved our society the problem right now is that media are in the midst of a moral panic  Trying to look at you. You got it  Distracting us from our real problems, but hold on jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've seen already accounts of people who ended up outside the capital building some of them going inside it  And we just forget it's the stories of their radicalization at the center of their radicalization every single time  Is these platforms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the woman who that's a good question in the capital  Uh her saga according to the stories about her started not with social media. It ended up there but started with fox news  Let me be very clear that the single most malign influence in all of english-speaking democracy in my country and yours  Is rupert murdoch and fox news. That's where the jury begins journey begins not in social media, but in media

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff thank you very much for coming on outside source  We appreciate it and needless to say rupert murdoch would not agree with that categorization of himself for the products  Which he owns is is this well the bbc is not owned by rupert

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess it's safe to say that not yet ross is great. That's ross atkins. Yeah, he's very very good  Yeah, um, he started a movement within the bbc  They called the 50 50 which is to to get more diversity in their sourcing starting with gender in the uk  But also now we're part of that 50 good good good. He's very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for playing that scenario  Listen what listening to that and watching that reminded me of a scenario that I had with a family member back east that wanted to  Message me with something pretty salacious  This was last year sometime before all of this mess started happening  and it and they were all freaked out and  And just trying to give me the business about it and at all and I said, okay  Well, where did you hear about this and they told me?  Told me fox news and I said, okay fine. That's fox news  Do you hear about this on any other platform and they said no, that's it  So why are you just going to assume that is the gospel is fox news the one and only?  News sources out there. Why aren't you thinking critically about this stuff instead of instead of going out and inciting more?  Idiocy and people getting upset over something that doesn't even really exist or even matter, you know  And just the way you hit that right there. They just struck home with me. Mr. Jarvis and they're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You were a good guy. You moved to california

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So jeff one of the respond i'll include all of you in this please not just jeff  But one of the things I thought was kind of interesting was annula annula merkel of germany and then followed by  Emmanuel macron of france who said well was baffled said well, this should be a government  Regulation not not private industries. They shouldn't be deciding who to platform a deep platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's just ridiculous right on his face

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a fair point, but it's not what we they don't have a first amendment. We do  There's government here is specifically prohibited from making that kind of law

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, then I had a journalist from london call me this morning and  Um, she's doing a public she's doing a story about iran  And now iranian activists are saying okay twitter you took down trump  Komeni is bad or worse for these reasons  Why aren't you taking him down or why don't you go to the philippines and do teretek?  So they're they're constantly stuck when they set a precedent  Uh-oh now we got to enforce it across even just force enforcing it across world leaders is hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, I should say  Uh  There's two different  Interpretations of what these big tech companies have done denise howell who's a lawyer? Uh, and uh,  You know very smart on this stuff said they did it because their lawyers came to them and said you are exposed  You you are in trouble if you let this continue you've got to stop it  Uh, others have said well in what way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because protected by section 230. Well, yeah, there's right by 230. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah that so some have said well that just gave them the cover to do what they've been wanting to do  um  True  I so I have a theory section 230 how far does section 230 go if you know if if if somebody is  posting plans

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's this is a hypothetical if it's illegal. It doesn't save you from illegality, right?  No, so it does a lot of the stuff that was on these things could be interpreted and and there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean  There's a definitely a range of interpretation of what the president said with is that illegal is it legal is he calling for?  Violence or is he just saying, you know, we got to fight for ideals. I mean  That was a gray area because he's very careful  He's very smart about not as most trolls are about not crossing the boundary into illegality  I'm so if you look at first amendment law

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you look at first amendment law you have to be very very specific about the violence you're calling for and who specifically?  You're calling for violence against it's it cases have established that you can't  It's not illegal to just say I think people like this should be harmed. It has to be  tangible specific and imminent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, and ant you were saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was saying i'm glad you you mentioned that that he was quite selective on  How he put his message out?  to his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's not going to say followers go on guys blow it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be a shame to see what something happened to that nice congress. Yeah, like like some have said like a mob boss

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't this way. Michael cohen always said he doesn't have to be explicit. He just we know what he wants  exactly exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, so this idea the government should set it just surprised the heck out of me from merkel and mcroll  Um, but they don't have a first amendment  I don't know even so even so to have official speech to have compelled speech to have government demanded speech  The government should decide that government is in this platform the president in germany

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Restricts your speech all the time. Yeah, the precedent for that is you can't post restriction. You can't the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't sell nazi memorabilia on ebay. You can't yeah, but this is compelled speech. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bill-cannery merkel  You cannot take merkel now. Is that what she meant what she was to say?  Yeah, that's what she's saying doesn't you can't take you can't take trump down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think there's something to be I do think that that's not an on  I know it's going to make you ballistic, but I think it's not an unreasonable argument that it does give  uh jack dorsey and mark suckerberg, uh  Unelected a lot of power unelected capitalists not a lot of power trump was  Trump was elected  Duly elected official of the united states government  I I think that that's a reasonable question mark should private companies be unelected  You know oligarchs be allowed to do that. Would you say this to the new york times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You must carry all of trump's speeches. You must print them all that's the equivalent  Of course, you wouldn't  Would you say to nbc? Wait a minute. No, stop. Hold on. Hold on. There's a must carry on tv. Those are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are platforms those are publishers  Twitter is not a publisher  That's not the same. It's apples and oranges

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh, would you tell uh  Verizon that they must run the the president's channel  No, you wouldn't we wouldn't do that in this country

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they have to let him make a phone call

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I don't know what the answer is, but I think it's not an unreasonable position to say  Should these big tech companies be in this position? I don't like that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How is it any better like I agree government control of speech is bad  But how is it any better to have a bunch of you know, 30 somethings?  Running this gigantic company controlling what people say. How is that any better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the other side of it is he's still the president he could go down at any moment to the briefing room  Yeah, he could he I mean he it's not like he doesn't still have his bully pulpit, right?  It's not like a talk radio isn't dominated by dominated by conservative voices  Do you find it troubling that one of the biggest broadcasters in america cumulus told its hosts?  You may not say this election was stolen. You've got it. And by the way, they're they own the shop

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean i've been told if they came and said you may not call grown women girls  That'd be right. You say well, that's because they're worried about their business and they want to make sure that it uh,  Doesn't offend half the audience and yeah, that's within their right to do. It's their company. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have a theory a friend shared with me about what the platforms are doing  This is kind of a conspiracy theory, but and there's no real evidence  But his argument was what if what if they wanted to?  make  what if they wanted to  imply an argument about  Fiddling with section 230 if they wanted to say  Fiddling with section 230 is bad getting rid of it is bad  Um, they could just say look without section 230. We would have to do what we're doing now all the time. We have to take  Everybody down if they said anything even remotely bad because we'd be liable for it. Why do you think trump doesn't like 230?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, um exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just no, I just I bet you I think sunday  With um, the twitter panel we did that's right in yep, that was that was probably the most succinct and and and  Useful discussion about 230 because there's still a lot of people that are confused about far as  What exactly it means to them as a regular user of all of these different platforms? There's congress people who are confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most people are confused. Yeah. Yeah, so today sundar prachai was interviewed on reuters  Let me see if I can find this real quick. I quoted him.

That's right  For you know four days online and sundar was interviewed at the end of today and he said it is the most  It is the thing about which most people get get it wrong  And mike maznik was very happy that sundar finally started standing up  For 230 here it is. I've never seen anything that is so foundational that is so misunderstood  Yeah, section 230 is what promotes freedom of expression to which mike maznik said finally  I've been waiting for any of the tech insects to say this but it's felt like they've been too afraid  Sundar is exactly right people attacking 230 are attacking the wrong thing  Um the people on the left they think attacking 230 means attacking big tech companies on the right  They think attacking 230 means the sensors are going after me  um  There was also a great moment here. I have to I have to say, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pichai said the same thing in his testimony to congress in october  So it is about 230. Yeah, he says it's foundational to the to us leadership in the tech sector  So it's not the first time he said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not just 230 right the tech platforms are protected by the first amendment, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can't yeah, the government can't regulate them  It's protecting against different groups 230 protects them against lawsuits the first amendment protects them against the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's government. Yes, and and newspapers that have comments and forums are protected by 230 as well the guardians  us operation at least of of comment is free is protected by 230  The other one was so barjory taylor green wore her that's the that's the uh, as my representative the qanon representative  Malinowski calls them the qanon caucus. Yeah, she's the head of the qanon caucus. So she wore a mask. She wore a mask today  That's the good news. The bad news is that censored  And as a colleague of mine said nothing says censored by speaking freely into a microphone on the floor of the us house

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While it's broadcast publicly. That's the thing that really does crack me up about this the conservative complaints that they're being deplatformed  there are plenty of  Venues for conservative speech as I said talk radio being first and foremost fox news  and then of course the follow-ons like oann and  Newsmax there's plenty of play. It's plenty of venues for conservative thought. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, and and and they end up in media all the time. They get you know qanon. I think is a tiny  um  We don't want to say movement, but it gets amplified by media. The conservatives can amplify by media plenty  um, you know what I I my most popular tweet this week was saying  um, just by the retweets account but was saying that  um  Remember that donald trump was not a genius at twitter. He was a genius at using twitter to manipulate media  He got his stuff up on media. So media, you know, they have the  Gop has plenty of opportunities. They have a whole tv network  Um, they're doing fine with their attention just fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do worry though and I know you hate it when I bring this up  But I do and I don't know what the answer is but I do worry that facebook in particular  Is a really great place to radicalize people. I guess youtube as well  Um, I are you just saying there's just nothing to do about it and uh, and the benefits outweigh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they should you know, I well two things. I don't think we have sufficient data on that  I don't think how much we know that there has been data on youtube that it isn't as bad as it said but in any case  We don't get the data from the company. So it's hard to know. I don't think the research is is conclusive  But but let's let's let's just say I grant what you what you just said  Even though I don't think the data is there or are there the data aren't there? Um  Is that yes, I think the platform's  long since  Should have said these are our standards of behavior here  This is our north star as I've said on the show often and we should take this stuff down. I I absolutely agree with that  I think that which includes taking trump down, right? They had a right to take trump down  They have a right to decide that this is their garden party. My argument this week was it's not an editorial decision  It's a social decision  If you come leo drunk and obnoxious to my party and you start insulting my friends and I kick you out  That's not an editorial decision. That's a social decision  There's a there's a difference of gradation and how it operates but there's still decisions and judgments. I think they should make yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when they make them they get in trouble with the right no and and your point with the bbc that they can't win is  Is well taken. I mean, uh, oh, yeah  It feels like nobody's happy no matter what they do that hate speech you took down was my speech. Yeah  Yeah  Let's take a little break, uh, because ces is going on and isn't it fascinating?

You can't find them  There are plenty of places for them to go  telegrams one discord  matrix gab their eight chan, you know when they when four chan went away, they went to eight chan, um,  I think there's places beyond eight chan. It's the internet the nature of the internet is  It's whack-a-mole. You can't  Successfully block all of this you could so that's why it's the wrong way to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think is that we've got to spend we spend all of our time thinking there's somebody bad on the internet. I can't go to bed  When what we need instead is institutions and structures to emphasize and amplify the good. Yeah  And and the baddest idiots are always going to be there  It's like I always say twitter is not the new york times. It's times square  There's always an idiot on what it was and just like times square. I will go to uh, 110th street and go around

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To avoid twitter. I did I just i've had I really have had enough  I just i'm off of it because  It makes you're missing so much. No, i'm not i'm missing  the the  Spilkes the the the I don't see any spilkes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally get where he's coming from because I feel the same way about my facebook experience from years ago  Yeah, I got I don't miss facebook nothing out of it. Yeah, and ever since I left I haven't thought twice about it  Yet I have a friend a a dear friend of mine who just recently retired  Who made his business off of facebook traffic? I mean he oh I agree 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree 100 whatever works for you, you know, i'm not look i'm not saying these  I'm not disagreeing with anybody who says there's value in these platforms. I just don't want to be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ethan zuckerman wrote something about uh what you're describing leo about how driving  You know whether it's the daily stormer or whoever off platforms  They will find places to try some underground  Yeah, and they will be harder to find and they will be harder to see and harder to track  But they'll still be doing all the same things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I guess what you're saying jeff is  The point is not to make them invisible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The point is to create a safer better twitter a better facebook. We need we need we well so so um  the first known effort watch out here comes a goodenberg moment to uh, uh,  censor the press  came in 1470 from nicolo pareti  Who was a grammarian?  Who was appalled by a translation of pliny's work and wrote a letter?  Just don't worry. I'm gonna get there soon wrote a letter to the pope saying you must stop this  You must appoint someone to censor the press  You must appoint someone to correct all the forms before they go to press because we just can't allow this  Right. Well in a way he wasn't asking for censorship. He was asking for an editor  And and and it took a while it took a long time before we invented the institutions  of the editor and the publishing house  to find the best and establish quality and  And establish standards  Right. It took a while, but we invented those institutions to create those standards  We enter a new world where now everybody can speak and you know  How much I celebrate that because we have black lives matter and black living while black and me too and so and occupy wall street  And movements that wouldn't have been heard before  But we also hear q anon and idiocy and right now what's happening is we're concentrating only on the bad stuff and in doing so  We're amplifying the bad guys and ignoring all the good stuff. My difference with you leo is primarily  I spend a lot of time on twitter. I follow  3693 people I honestly honestly honestly see no cesspool these stuff  I get no sewer gas from my twitter feed. It is helpful informative  Amusing friendly. It is a good part of my life. Well, I can say so I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you please start messing with thanks a lot? Jeff?  You're not doing your job

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff I want to point out you didn't always feel that way. Remember when there was a guy called professor jeff jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I hated him and I and I blocked him and yeah, there are bad people there. Yes  Well, what did I do? I ignored him?  And he's under a rock somewhere and I don't give a damn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My experience started out pretty shaky as well on twitter and I didn't quite  Think it mattered or had any kind of point but it took a while to do a bit of curation and working on it  To now I I love being there you guys talk like junkies. You're just like junkies you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, man, you're gonna really miss it when I when you're gone, man. It's great  Yeah, fine. Oh, yes  I do not miss either twitter or facebook. I have a much better I don't miss newsweekend time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. You see that's that's the world we had before let time magazine tell you about the entire world  No, i'm really glad i'm rid of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did want to mention though that  Taking parlor off of aws is I think significantly different than removing someone from twitter discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so matthew talks about that. So is it was it was it a line too far is was it too infrastructural or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think I mean, I don't know but I think it raises different questions because you're going this is a very similar down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To the to the stack the challenge is that matthew prince at cloudflare?  Faced because he was he was protecting ddos

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Protection for the daily stormer. Is that up the stacker down the stand h and and h i don't know  Is it up or down? I think it's down. Is that Matthew was very much matthew was very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saying well, we got to protect speech and uh,  And honestly, it's not for us to de-platform  Somebody he did eventually by the way  Um, it's a very reading what he wrote

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's worth reading what he wrote after the daily stormer and he mentioned what they did with hn as well  Um, and he said I feel uncomfortable being in this position. I should not be  Do like I should not be in a position where I can do this remove someone effectively  From the internet and yes, you can as a number of people point out to me  You can run your own server on a raspberry pi in your mom's basement or whatever and you will technically be on the internet  but it's it's still  it's  qualitatively different to have  Something like a aws or cloudflare remove you than it is for twitter to remove you the daily stormer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should mention was a nazi  Newspaper a white supremacist. I thought it was a weather thing  And by the way, I think that's where denise howell's point comes in I think amazon  Even so even if they weren't exposed by hosting parlor  Because there was definitely illegal content on parlor. There's no question about that. We've seen some of it  I mean people and saying you should have amazon the vice president in the court was there's some bad  Stuff there. Yeah, sure. So whether they were using it as a pretext for doing something they wanted or their lawyers said  You really need to do this because you're exposed  uh  Is a minor difference, but I remember when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They took down wikileaks as well  Because they were effectively threatened by the by congress, right?  And so caused a huge storm at the time, right? Yeah, is that good? I mean, I was not too happy about that when it's  When it's someone we don't like so so but it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the best thing the best way to handle this case by case?  uh  Is it impossible to make a policy and say well this that's what they hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They hate that because they want a rule they can plug into an algorithm or plug into a rule set that says  We did this and and so my argument to them is  You're you're thinking at the statutory level. You should be thinking at a constitutional level  On on a level of principles and then yes, it's case by case  But you have something to call upon all they have to call upon now. Facebook is the statute of the breast  Female breast with nipple not allowed unless baby or surgery or statute  Right, and they're at that level rather. Yeah, they want something algorithmic. Yeah, it's not algorithmic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it's not judgment. I hate judgment. Yeah, why did twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why was what trump said at the rally in which he didn't mention violence at all?  Why was that?  Different compared to when he said when the looting starts the shooting starts the shoots. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was advocating violence pretty clearly. Yeah. Yeah, it was uh, but it's also timing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's it's you know, you you look at at the the the  I think one thing we we forget about is when people twitter should be braver. Well  Donald trump had a corrupt department of justice jail the irs  A mob all behind him and it wasn't until the end of his reign  That I think that they had the the courage frankly to do this and we can mock them for that  But hell the republican members in congress who wouldn't vote  The other way because they were afraid for the physical safety of their families

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we should mock them a little bit because it's fine to  I think it was alexander petri or petri dishes on twitter who wrote, uh,  You know i'm resigning from the death star, uh because I can't put up with this anymore a week before  It blows up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's it's a little easy for us to say all i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's super easy mike maznik had a great post last friday, uh on his blog tech dirt. Not easy  Not unreasonable, but not censorship the decision to ban trump from twitter  And in which he's basically saying  It is it is ad hoc  It isn't there aren't algorithms and that at each point, uh, the decision has to be made  To the to those who think that twitter should have done this earlier he writes or that it would have made a difference  Remember recognize that your concern is not so much with twitter, but with trump himself  Remember that while trump might not be able to send a tweet right now  He still literally has the power to launch nuclear missiles at twitter's headquarters. I don't think he does. I think he can only target  Uh enemy installations, but I might be wrong  Trump is obviously too toxic for twitter, but he's also too toxic for the white house  The real complaint shouldn't be about twitter or facebook acting too late, but about congress failing to do their job  And removing the madman from power and by the way as we speak, uh,  Congress has voted to impeach. Pelosi is speaking right now the second time speaking of twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a great thread from a guy who looked into  Uh trump's what it would take for trump to actually launch a nuclear missile  And you're right that technically he has to call a play from the playbook. Yeah, he has a list of targets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bomb mike maznik's house, no no  Uh, which is still not reassuring  The good news is most of those targets are in the old russia old soviet union  So and I know he doesn't want to do that because you know first he has to call the right phone allegedly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And which is held by his aid so if the aid doesn't give him the phone number

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You you know there was a proposal once and I think it was brilliant. It's horrific, but it was brilliant  that the phone number should be  surgically placed in the  aid's chest  And that the president should have a knife break glass to use knife and be compelled to kill the aid to use that phone number  But there's a good reason for this so that oh, yeah million deaths  He will be causing which in abstract are brought to concrete reality  You got to kill one person yourself before you're allowed to kill a million  So I heard the aids voted that down. They didn't want that one. No  The union  It's too horrific to even mention  But it's you know, it's an interesting thought experiment because if you're not willing to kill the person standing in front of you  Should you be allowed to kill the million people who are not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the amplified version of count to 30 before you send that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another way to do it. Yeah  Um  You know that we live in such challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Times I was going to ask you whether you read something emily bell wrote for the financial times  Where she said we we need a more eu approach to speech. Of course. She would read that  She's from british

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is this is where emily I love emily but we go back and forth all the time because emily emily is  Believes that there's no capitalism and journalism are fundamentally incompatible  We have to get rid of capitalism and journalism and that government regulation and government creation is the solution to most everything  So you guess emily and I don't always agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean we are we not putting a lot of really an awful lot of power in these platforms hands  We are sure a couple of a couple of white guys mark zuckerberg jack dorsey. I again I have two words in response

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Donald trump  So for the last four years we were better off. We were better off in their hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he was duly elected by a democratic process  You may not like him. I may not like but he was not elected. Yeah, trump won a presidential election

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He later lost but he won a presidential election and and and and under the law of i'm sorry. I'm gonna go godwin here  under the law of germany, um  hitler  Was legally ensconced right but at some point you say someone is bad in office and wrong in office  And you need a check and my point is the public including journalism is a check on that power and so so we know I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's checks on getting rid of trump. There's a process for getting rid of trump. There's no process for arguing with mark zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no appeal. There's no helpline that will get you why did he bother getting rid of trump because of public pressure on him?  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it up to the crepe iron works having dinner and lunches with with the white house just a handful of months ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, so I don't know. I repeat. Well, then then i'll bring leo's words back then ant  He's the president of the united states. Why wouldn't you have dinner with the president of the united states?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're I if you're a good ceo you have to that's your job your job is not  To weigh in on you know, your company your company, which is where I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you don't have to hire somebody like joel caplan who basically convinces you not to do things to cater to  conservatives so should the uh the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  krupp family  The big munitions family in germany should they have said to adolf hitler look  You got elected. You're the chancellor, but we're not gonna we're not gonna work a deep platform somebody should have but they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't and so you need you need independent checks, but this is why we have independent institutions  I'm as I i know in these moments. I sound like i'm libertarian and anti-government. I am not  I am pro-government and pro safety and pro lots of things, but i'm also pro public  um  counterweight

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right  We're all in it together

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, so I have a friend of mine a friend of mine from south america right now who is who's emailed me just appalled  At these images of american soldiers in full regalia sleeping in the capital that that that that that but but you  She comes from are relieved. No, it's a no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has there been any follow-up on the tech that had been stolen well, this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do not know this is a massive as you know cyber security issue  Because most of the staffers and members of congress left their computers logged in they ran out of there. I don't blame them  Right as it pelosi's  Yeah, stolen laptop a laptop was stolen several laptops were stolen  But even more of greater concern is the computers that were logged in and on  And look again most of these guys are idiots  We're not they weren't going to do that. But there were I think a handful of people in there who were absolutely  Bone chillingly  uh  You know of mal intent and who knows who had a usb key  And didn't take that opportunity to go around and put malware on there. So malware  It turns out every uh office has its own it system. They're not all  Networked together. Yeah, I didn't realize this there's not some central system. So in some ways that's a good thing  It's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because they're not all tied together  It's a bad thing because the practice security practice is very right, right? And so you know, uh  It's kind of a mess. I login is admin password is yeah, it's kind of a mess. Um  I I I don't know, you know  if if you were  A russian or chinese operative in the united states. I think it would have behooved you to be in that crowd. That's a rare opportunity  Oh, yeah  so  Uh, you know was fancy bear there  If they if they weren't they really missed a big opportunity and there was plenty of warning  It wasn't like they didn't know  So everybody knew except the capital police. Yeah, well, I think they knew too and but you know, i'm gonna get conspiracy here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be quite frank. It looked pretty cheesy. Hey, welcome to the virtual room and then it takes you to a zoom event  Um, and the zoom events were just like any other zoom event we've seen for the last 10 months  And it was just it's just not that seems more painful to me  Yeah, it's just not the same and then the fact that you know, you're having to do it  Virtually, so you get all of these invitations to keep up with and as you mentioned the time zone difference, so  I'm freaking exhausted and I hadn't even gone to vegas. Yeah, it's teams by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They use microsoft's teams, but we use lowercase z's of teams to describe what this is  We all know what it is. I so when this all began a few months  Into it I was thinking, you know, the world's gonna be different. We might be a little more chastened those trade shows may go away  uh travel world travel might go down I am now of the opinion that  When the dam breaks probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year  It's going to break with a vengeance the people have been not spending as much money  So at least those of us who have been able to continue to work will have some cash  Uh, they'll be desperate to travel to party to ces 2022  I'm gonna make a prediction right here will be the first I thought oh, it's gonna go away  Everybody's gonna say we don't need this anymore. I have now of the opinion. It will be a bacchanal. It'll be insane  People swinging from the chandeliers it'll be nuts because just like the roaring 20s in the 1920s, right?

It's a very good front of them to show the products  Yeah, me part of the press  I need to see some of those products because looking at it on one of these stupid virtual meetings is not the same.

Transcript:  All right. I was debating between two of them. Um, well, we're uh, so the edelman trust barometer is out  And this is shocking  It usually happens at uh davos but at the undavos roger's next today  Uh, richard edelman revealed it and if you go to slide  Nine you start to see the beginnings of the real numbers  Among the mass population they trust no institutions  Yeah among the so-called elite or informed population. They trust three out of five, which is to say  NGOs business and media but not government. I don't know what the fifth is  Majority of people are pessimistic in 15 out of 28 markets including the u.s  The majority of people in 21 out of 28 markets fear being left behind  Yeah  56 believe the capitalism as it is today does more harm than good in the world. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

But the other one that I saw I found interesting  was  that  uh people returned  428 billion dollars of merchandise

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought this was really interesting. I know you're talking it is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then so what's happening?  Uh is that is that amazon walmart and company use ai to judge whether it's worthwhile to get the return or not  In terms of how they can resell it and shipping so a lot of times they just tell people  Keep it give it away to a charity. Whatever  Because it's so expensive to pay for the return

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's smart, but they do and the ai is used for a number of things  But but a lot of it is your past buying record  So don't get don't get excited that oh good. I never have to buy anything again  I used to know a young woman who would buy shoes  Tape the soles wear them to the event remove the tape because you can't return use shoes remove the tape  So there was no evidence and return them. She never slipped on quality rear end because the tape slippery  I know I'll probably use good tape. She learned over time, but she never bought shoes. She didn't have to  Uh, I don't think this would be an excuse to do that. No  For every billion dollar in sales 106 million dollars is lost to returns

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
