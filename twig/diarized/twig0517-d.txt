Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not here. So yeah, I had my Botox yesterday so we should be okay. When Stacey gets the Botox,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is not cosmetic. She does not need in any way, shape or form cosmetic help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is for your headaches, but it works. It does. It works really well. That's amazing. I just can't,  I can't. Go ahead, wrinkle your forehead. Go ahead. Try it. Try it. That's all I can do.  I can't wrinkle it. I'm trying so hard. No, stop. Don't. I don't want you to get a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also with us at Jeff Jarvis, he is a headache. BuzzMachines.com,  professor of journalism at the townite graduate center for journalism at the  City University of New York. Always a pleasure, Jeff. Happy birthday. He's not going to like it.  He doesn't want me to say it, but he celebrated his birthday this week. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay, Jeff. Look how grumpy. You're older and wiser and grumpier. Look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Jeff. I'm very grumpy. Very grumpy. Jeff. So Jeff's been playing with FaceApp,  which is that- I'm going to do this. I'm going to send it to Karsten.  Send it to Karsten so he can show it. That's that crazy app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to show yours first? Yeah. Because mine's going to be funnier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. Mine, mine, look, I look so old. No, mine's going to be funnier. I guarantee you.  Look how old I look in that. It's horrible. That's terrifying.  Terrifying. Oh, shush.  No, you want to see the, I don't want to, look, I don't want to spoil yours, Jeff,  because mine looks so old. I want to see yours first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yours is going to, mine is going to be worse. I guarantee it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I'll show you mine and then you show me yours. Okay.  This is what FaceApp, which is a viral app.  This is the new, this went viral about eight months ago or something. And now it's come back.  I guess they have new features, but one of the features is it'll age you.  Look at that waddle. It's so gross. The waddle is the-  Actually, the waddle is the one thing I actually have, but thanks very much, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no. It's all about the waddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, shush.  I think I look distinguished. Actually, I look like Freddy Krueger for crying out loud.  Okay. Wait a minute. Is Jeff's worse? Jeff's, yours is worse?  How could yours be worse? All right. Carson's got to pull it up here.  I think it's a pretty cool app. I mean, I don't know if I will look like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's exactly what you're going to look like.  That is what I think you're going to look like, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thanks a lot. Ancient Mariner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although your glasses are being swallowed by your face in this one.  So I think, you know- They've been on for 40 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff. Like the wrinkles are growing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, this is about 15 years from now. Jeff, I got bad news for you.  Shut up. For both of us.  Shut up. I'm a couple of years behind you. That's all.  I think- Now, here's the thing. At what point do we stop doing video in these podcasts?  What do you think, Jeff? Stacey, you got to do this too. You have a face app yet?  I want to see what Stacey looks like old. I didn't do it because I don't do those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  knowing that they use my photograph for all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that, it's funny because that is the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You now have lost the rights to your face, to that photo. You no longer have copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the way this works is you upload it to the cloud because they have to do the editing in  the cloud. But this app comes from Russia and the app's creators are harvesting metadata.  Close research, this is from The Verge. Close research suggests face app isn't doing anything  particularly unusual in its code or its network traffic. However, they do have your picture now.  And so that's the issue. An ex-Yandex executive and CEO of the Russian company that created the  app, Yaroslav Goncharov, said that photos uploaded to the app are stored in the company's servers to  save bandwidth if several filters are applied, but they will get deleted not too long after.  And because of GDPR, I would imagine, according to TechCrunch, face app says you can request  that your face be removed from our server. However, if you do, you'll get a message saying  the team's currently overloaded. But users can send the request through Settings, Support, Report,  Abug with the word Privacy in the subject line. But they're in Russia. So, you know.  But you know what? Everybody's got my face, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yes. In all of these apps, I mean, when you looked at Microsoft, it wasn't hot or not,  Microsoft had one where you did your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same thing. And they predict your age. Yeah. In fact, Microsoft,  that came out of Microsoft research. That was so they could get face data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And Google did a very similar effort with a couple of their apps, actually. They had the Art  Face app thing. So this is very common. It's just I don't like participating in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that makes sense. You just don't want to imagine yourself with wrinkles since you have  none. You're physically incapable of wrinkling now. Do you think face that would detect the botox

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and say, well, you're actually going to look exactly the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, only my forehead. I'm going to I don't have I don't have botox anywhere else. So,  okay. See, look, there's wrinkles right by my eyes. I'm spicing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's perfect. Perfect. You're perfect. This is the same issue with TikTok, which is a Chinese based  company that kids all over the world are uploading videos to crazily. In fact, now, Jeff, you and I  wanted to go to VidCon, but didn't. Right. Apparently, this is from an Atlantic article,  Taylor Lawrence, saying TikTok stars are preparing to take over the internet. At the VidCon party,  YouTube posted its annual party, influencers, industry professionals sipping beer eating  vegetable skewers as DJs blasted pop hits. Taylor writes the party felt like a generic corporate  sponsored event, probably because the real party was in 1.9 miles down the road at a private event  hosted by TikTok. It was a private event for creators only no marketers, no fans. But it was  by 815 15 minutes after the party started at the Bullmore lanes in LA. It was so packed  that hundreds of creators were left standing outside. Sam Coe. He has 300,000 followers  arrived 15 minutes early by 10. I'm sorry, she, she was still trying to get in. I'm annoyed. We  drove all the way here from Santa Monica. Oh, oh, I see other huge creators here too. And they're  still waiting in line. So the party there, by the way, they loaded this gummy bears on the bowling  alley seems like a bad idea. Yeah. People are already saying that TikTok is the next big thing.  And if VidCon, which really was created by YouTubers to highlight YouTubers is is taken over by TikTok.  I mean, can the world be far behind? Which, but also goes to say no platforms forever. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's a good point. Yeah. I've got a story on the rundown saying Google searches is pass. Hey,  now there's all these other searches out there. All this fear that they're all going to take over  the world and own it forever. So far, I actually stay tuned for my tip though, because I have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tip at the end. I discovered a little something and I'm I got a tip for you that will help you  if you wish to wean yourself from the goog. I want to say they, they, we do get new platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They just get purchased by the bigger players. So think about WhatsApp and Instagram. TikTok is not  for sale, however. But musically was most of it. And not Yandex. What is the name of the Chinese

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  company? Who is it? Oh, no, no, they're owned by Tencent. They are owned by Tencent. I think so.  They spent, get ready for this, $1 billion on advertising last year, $1 billion.  And they paid one influencer a million dollars for 15 second video. They're actively wooing  YouTube's creators. First quarter of 2019, the third most installed app worldwide, right behind  WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. 1.2 billion monthly users globally. That's bigger than Instagram.  And coming up on YouTube, which is 1.9 and Facebook itself, of course, more than 2 billion.  TikTok is big, but this is the point. Every video you create on TikTok is sent to China.  So you want to hear something funny?  Should we go on TikTok for a second and look at some?  Sure. Go ahead. Something funny while I fire up TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So my daughter is a, she is young. She turns 13 in a month. And her favorite thing to do on TikTok  is to watch recreations of popular old vines. It is mind blowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no. Oh wow. How meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause frankly, TikTok is Vine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is Vine. And she just like, she speaks only in memes and it is her like, I should have her come  on the show and do a guide to what teens think in the meme scene. But yeah, only vines.  That's pretty wild.  And there are some fun TikToks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, it's, it's, no, it's, it's, you know what? Just as Vine was a great platform for people to,  you know, to make, what was it? Six second videos that were hysterical in many cases.  And these people were propelled to fame and fortune.  You gotta think Twitter bought Vine and killed it. You gotta think Twitter is looking at TikTok  saying, hmm, hmm. What have we done? I can't show TikTok videos from TikTok.  Yeah, you can.  Well, I can do it on my phone.  Go to trending. Go to trending.  TikTok. Oh, go to, oh, I see. It's on the website. If I go to trending hashtags.  Yeah.  Okay. So let's turn on some sound and, and see what these, see what these guys.  So these are influencers talking about influencers.  That's, that's, I guess good. If you know who those people are,  how about this one? This is a kid.  Cause remember the part of this was originally to as musically to lip sync  to existing music. So they're eating cotton candy and the guys in the thing with a mask and  there's too much base. My, my amp can't handle it. I don't, I don't know what that is. How about  Elmer's glue, Elmer's glue, Elmer's glue color changing glue. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you  here's some sandals. We squirt color changing glue on the sandals and sprinkle them. That was  exciting with sprinkles. And now you have candy shoes that are terribly uncomfortable to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What if you just put paper in the bottom and then did it be so much better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a wonderful sub Reddit on Reddit called DIY spelled W H Y and that belongs on DIY.  Um, then there's, then there's just people singing songs. This little hoodie.  I see why this can speak to the youngs. So your daughter likes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She doesn't like, she only likes the recreation of the vines.  Oh, that's all she watches. That's all she watches. Um, and why I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see what hashtag that's left a huge hole in many, many people's lives. They were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they were bereft. She thinks, she thinks a lot of them are a little too, uh, mean or risque  or stupid in a not fun way. She's, she's kind of an absurdist though. Here's from the hashtag

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pets are people. A vine has been viewed more than 1.3 million times. Did I say vine? I meant  tick tock. It's just a cat sitting there. Very fat cat. 1.2 million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long the big investment in watching those for that way though. Well, that's the point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right? You're sitting on your phone. You're waiting in line at the DMV. It's just another  meme thing. I see kids doing this a lot. Teenagers doing this a lot. They pass around memes.  We're at dinner and, uh, Michael and his friends, he's 16 are handing their phone around and looking  at a meme and laughing and they're not kind of, they're not that funny. And I'm thinking this is  really a degrading the human's experience. It's that I'm in a conversation where it's a meme  based conversation. It's very strange. I don't know. I don't want this to become a new alphabet.  The old's talking about the, those crazy kids. So I'm sure this is great. It's a new,  well, we're as old as our pictures, Leo. That's pretty damn old. Yeah. That's pretty. So did you  let your daughter do tick tocks knowing that her image is now being sent to China? She doesn't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to do tick tocks. She's not allowed and she doesn't want to be actually online doing these things.  So I don't have to worry about that for now. I'll be interested because she's going to a new school.  Her old school had a no smartphone at all policy and this new school does. And so we'll see. And  all the parents who were in the class, we all got together and like did a no smartphone kind of pledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we'll see. My son makes a lot of memes, but he doesn't actually like to appear in them. He  just likes to, yeah, she makes, yeah, she makes lots of memes. He likes to get copyright take down  notices basically. So, so does he use a meme generator or does he do it by hand? He just edits

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  by hand. And how about your daughter, Stacey? She, she edits her own. So, you know, in a way  this is good. You're learning skills. You're learning comedy writing, you know, pithy comedy  writing. You're learning Photoshopping. Brevity. Yeah. Brevity. I mean, I think it's, yeah, I think  it's not, I mean, there's some skills in that. You'll be great at PowerPoint presentations.  Oh goody. Yay. PowerPoint. I mean, I, I spent from the age of probably 17 or 18 till now learning  this medium, but this is a, you know, I don't know if it's a dying medium, thanks to podcasting,  it's not hallelujah, but, uh, you know, that's what you do. You start young and you're learning  a new medium. Do you think in 20, 30 years, well, I'll just be looking at memes all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're nice. I mean, so people, people make fun of emojis. People make fun of gifts,  but I do think they're a really good, quick way to get an emotion or point across. That's kind of  fun. And I think we'll have the same sort of thing with Tik Tok or short form videos that are not  gifts. I mean, there are ways to like share an emotion or a mood or how you're feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, in a way, emojis themselves are a new way of communicating, right? They're a non,  it's kind of nonverbal communication, uh, that, that a lot of young people are able to use quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  adeptly to say a lot of things. Okay. So I'm, I'm, I'm fascinated about the, uh, I mentioned last  week, I'm reading this book about dictionary wars with Webster, who turns out to be a bit of a jerk.  Oh yeah. Oh, I am so surprised. Um, don't spell it that way. Um, uh, but the, but the desire  for standardization and Caxton, who was one of the, it was the first major publisher printer in,  in the UK, wanted to standardize the language. Webster wanted to standardize American as a language.  Johnson, there was that once you could with printing, sorry guys, Gutenberg moment,  but now what the internet does is free us up again.  Yeah. Although come back into our alphabets and our expression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's a great thing. Cause if you read 18th century manuscripts,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's crazy. Talk about non-standard. Uh, they don't Shakespeare, it spelled his name five  different ways, his own name. So it, I don't think standard, I don't know, maybe it's cause  I grew up in a world where it's spelling was standardized. Was it Webster who said,  let's not use the British. Oh, you are. Oh yeah. Webster had all kinds of, he, he went,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he was very controversial. He went for a lot of, uh, of, um, sorry, he took out the U and color

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because we should have an American way of spelling all kinds of other things. Uh,  and the Z and the S in organize and apologize. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Organize is  spelled with a Z a Zed. A lot of his things didn't. Okay.  Webster spellings to now we have somebody from Portsmouth, uh, and, uh, England in the studio.  When you look at, uh, the bizarre American spellings of color, uh, and organized,  do you think how illiterate these colonies are? I'm a programmer. So I've adopted the American.  You have that's, oh, by the way, there's another interesting story. Americanization is because of  coding have become universal. Uh, in fact, there's also interesting misspellings that have become  universal in the HT, uh, ML spec or HTTP spec. There's a refer, right? Which has been historically  misspelled with one R and, and, uh, I think it's one, is it one R or one F? Yeah. Anyway,  it's misspelled, but because that's how it's spelled, you have to spell it that way. And that's  I think art that's fascinating. I'm reading, um, uh, the book you recommended Drexler's was  Drexler's English. It's a dry dryers, dryers, dryers, English. Wonderful. And I'm listening  on audible. They have the great courses and I'm listening to a course in the, in the English  language and how it's changed. And the, it's interesting that there's grammatic cessation,  there's syntax change and, and it's a very Asian fights. The words, the word silly used to mean  saintly. It, uh, and so there's dryers English and utterly correct guide to clarity and style,  which actually is very, it's actually very fun and loose. He's not, uh, one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it sharp and funny as per the little blur? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And he, uh, he uses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and he believes in the Oxford comma. God bless him. Yeah. He says there's no reason not to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the expert comma. So he got rid of, or as he calls it, by the way, the serial comma is not the  Oxford comments. It's the serial comma. Um, he got rid of, uh, Webster got rid of, uh, redundant  letters like the E from fewer, the K from frolic and music, the U from Arter endeavor and terror.  He wanted to get rid of a switch that he switched the RE, the ER with meter, uh, scepter, uh, theater.  Um, he switched the CE, uh, to see on expense, offense, pretense. But what he's done now is he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  given, uh, come down on whiskey. What he's done is given Americans, uh, the opportunity to be very  pretentious and spell. Oh, you are. Yeah. And theater, I know people who I literally spell  theater RE and, uh, and so really all he's done is given us the opportunity to act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was, it was at the moment, it was very much about breaking away from Britain and culturally  and trying to come up with your own language. So what I'm, what I'm arguing is that the internet  now has the opportunity for people to break away from the orthodoxy and do so not just with the  letters we had, but with this whole new world of visual expression. It will be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To see how the language changes and the rate of change and how that's changed by the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would imagine it would be significant, right? Well, here, Stacy, here's a question for you. Uh,  how much language is unique to her daughter and her age that you have to ask what it means,  or you have to figure it out. Oh boy. Words, phrases, expressions. That's slang. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  happened all along. That's every generation. It's also kind of a secret language. And do you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the word Yeet? Um, so Yeet is they make fun of you if you use the word. Yeah. Okay. I said on  fleet the other day and they said, oh, that's so 2016. Yeah. So everything goes faster. I will say  that I pick up just being on Twitter or anything I need to know. So like I had one who was talking,  she's like, Oh, I low key something, something. And I was like, well, I high key. And she was like,  oh my God, you were the coolest mom ever. And I was like, thank you, Twitter. The 12 year olds  think I'm on fleek. No, no. But it was like, you know, I use Reddit the same way. Reddit's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  same. Yeah. I use Reddit that way. So linguists talk about, this is a great, by the way, really  good lecture. I'll see if I can find it before the end of the show, but he talks about how language  changes, semantic bleaching, morphological reduction, phonetic erosion. This is from the  Wikipedia obligatorification. That's when the use of linguistic structures becomes increasingly  more obligatory in the product of, in the process of grammaticalization. And actually this  Wikipedia article will be a great way if you want to know more about it. He talks about in French,  I don't know, are we getting really too obscure here? You know, if you say, if you say, if I want  to say, he doesn't walk, I say, il ne marche pas. Right. That's right. And there's a double

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  negative. Logically, I could never figure that out. Well, it used to be, in French, it used to be il ne

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  marche. There was no pas. Well, so where the heck did the pas come from? It makes no sense. So I  think this is fascinating. I apologize if you don't, I'll do this quick. Pas means step. And so as you  probably know in English, we'll often say, oh, she wouldn't drink a drop. He wouldn't walk a step.  As a emphatic way of saying, not only won't he walk, he won't even walk a step. Same thing in French,  il ne marche pas. He wouldn't walk a step. But what happened is pas became absorbed into the negative  of the language. So that now pas is added to any negative. It was originally in a way of making  more emphatic. Just for that one verb, that's crazy. It started with that one verb and it extended to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  all the rest. One of the most amazing things about English, it confuses the world, is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  meaningless do. How we add that verb into things for no reason whatsoever. But without it, do is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a great verb. Well, there were no prepositions originally. How did a word, if you think about  it, when Adam named the things, everything had a name, but it was a thing. What's a preposition  have to do with anything? What does do have to do with anything? What is a do? What are you talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  about the meaningless do? Give us an example. I'm trying to give an example of meaningless do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you walk? Carson, help me. Do you walk? Do you walk? Yeah. Instead of walk you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you walk? The do doesn't really make any sense. It's not needed. It's probably another  if you go to Spanish. Okay, I got you. Yes. Yeah, in French it's... I do the laundry. Marchez-vous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. It can replace any verb. I launder. Instead of I launder, I do the laundry. Add do to a noun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, in French though, they have fe and they do like... Which is like do. Yeah. Which is kind  of like do. I imagine there's a Spanish anyway. No, do English is a special... It's a special...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's a weird thing. Meaningless do, isn't it? Here's where I got that from.  Leo, if you like all this stuff, you'll like this book. Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue,  The Untold History of English by John McWhorter. I love linguistics. To me, it's always fascinating.  This one is really good. Endlessly fascinating. It's from a few years ago. I was just going  through my audible to find it. It's like one of the first lip books I listened to on audible

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and it's really good. I will write it down. I do. I enjoy these kinds of things. But we are moving  to a less verbal world. I remember Trey Radcliffe, the photographer, telling me, thanks to Instagram,  he thought that the young people today were growing up with a much better visual vocabulary  than previous generations. I think he'd grant that that's probably true. And emojis, same thing.  Apple and Google showing off new emojis and it's interesting how emojis reflect cultural changes.  So these new emojis are more inclusive. There's a prosthetic arm, a girl or a guy in a wheelchair.  There's a seeing eye dog, a man with a cane. What's going on there? Why are you opening up there?  Oh, you got a new hat? Is that an emoji hat?  Is that a Buttigieg hat? What is it? I don't know what it is. McCloughan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, a McCloughan hat. So wait a minute. Matthew Ingram got a major award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How come Matthew's picture isn't on it? All you got was that lousy hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because here's when I was at the the media ecology association where Matthew got that award.  I saw a guy with a Marshall McCloughan hat and I was all jealous.  And I said, oh, how do I get this? Well, actually, there's a high school in Toronto.  So I got myself. He's a rebel. The Marshall McCloughan rebels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the greatest t-shirt ever. Isn't that the best?  Oh my gosh. The Marshall McCloughan rebels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Send an email with the information how to get that t-shirt.  We are going to. So I'm now just a booster. It's on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just in fact, we're going to get we're going to get Marshall McCloughan rebels t-shirts for everybody.  I don't think you need a Marshall McCloughan rebel t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This will be our new twit uniform. So I didn't know what to do. So he was born in 1911.  I put an 11 on there, I think. But I should have put a four on there because he was all about tetrads  and the fours. But you can put your own number on it.  Here's one. I don't know. This might be a mixed a mixed message property of Marshall McCloughan rebels.  Might not be. You found it quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's available in the Marshall McCloughan Catholic Secondary School.  The rebels. How about this one? For some reason, they're just seeing all these fans they have.  Carson, you're going to want this one. It says go fight win Marshall McCloughan.  That's a t-shirt. That's a t-shirt. Or maybe just something a little more understated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they have hats. As you can see, you can do the hats. You do lots of things.  Wow. I'm very proud of this.  And you chose 11 because why? I think he was born in 1911. I wouldn't let you do it without a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should have chosen 65. What's the Gutenberg number? 14 something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1450. Oh, you could. Property of Marshall McCloughan rebels. 1450.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's only as if you're on the team. I think it only goes to two digits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's 2019. Here's XXL. Or just, you know what? Do it in big, bold block letters.  Marshall McCloughan rebels. That is awesome. And what color should it be? They have many colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you can go to the hats too. They have hats. They have other things as well.  That is so hysterical. I'm going to buy these.  Best? Yeah. Isn't it the best? I forget the guy's name. I'm sorry,  even if it was. Whoever it was, thank you for this. What size are you, Karsten? Large?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am large. All right. John, you're large, right?  1X. Let's get two larges and two XLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. I'm ready. Wait, but not that design? You don't want the cooler?  That's pretty cool. I like that design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's subtle. It's understated. It's a gray t-shirt, so it's like an athletic t-shirt.  In bright green letters at the top, it says Marshall McCloughan. Underneath it in slightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bolder letters. In blue, it says Rebels. And I like the possibility that it might say  Marshall McCloughan rebels. Rebels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nice.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the medium is the message. Was the medium is the mess age? And medium is massage?  He loved-  Is the medium is the mass age? He loved-  He loved buns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He loved buns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, McCloughan-  McCloughan would say that we're passing from textual back to orality. We're passing from  orality to textual back to orality. And even though we're talking about images here,  it's a form of orality. It's a form of conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? This is an issue I have because I think about the oral culture and then I think about  text-based culture and it feels like things like emojis feel more text-based.  Gifts and vines feel more- and I'm not- I mean, this is really academic, but I'm like,  where do we draw the line? Especially since it's all kind of flowing together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the difference, I think, Stacey. And this is why I agree with you because I struggle with  the same thing. Text-based means the current alphabet of 26. So emoji are- emoji being the  plural- emoji are a new alphabet.  Yeah, but I mean, you've got other alphabets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Well, you've got other alphabets. So is it just your phonetic alphabet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lexicon's better than an alphabet. It's not an alphabet because it's not a letter.  It's a lexicon.  It's pictograms.  It's pictograms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, because I'm just thinking about if I go into Sweden, they've got more letters. If I go to  Russia, they've got completely different letters.  But they're all textual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, but emoji are words, not letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  I can get behind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a lexicon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why you're saying that's- so you're arguing that lexicon is really a dictionary of  words, vocabulary. So thus emoji are vocabulary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Thanks, Karsten. I knew I needed the Harvard brain in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just trying to clear up this- clear up things a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Marshall McLuhan High School wants me to create an account.  So this is slowing me down just- just a- just a slightest bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's okay. We're nowhere near the show at this point.  Yeah. The show has drifted way off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried to get back online with emojis, but that didn't go well.  Just pushed us even farther.  Pushed us even farther.  Facebook, five billion dollars fine. That sounds like a big fine. Five billion dollars with a B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the largest fine ever.  FTC has never-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the largest FTC fine ever.  And it's a quarter, almost a quarter of their annual profits.  There's only one little fly in the ointment. That as soon as this fine was announced,  Facebook's stock went up six billion dollars.  Meaning this fine, make that smiling guy, Mark Zuckerberg, a little richer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't own all that stock. They don't cash in all that stock.  Mark owns a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't cash it in. But there was a big jump in the stock price,  which just shows that the stock-  Get them off their back.  Here's the point. The stock market feels like, oh, this is good news.  Yeah, get them off their back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, the stock market is constantly doing crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.  Okay, so I mean, look, if you said, I'm going to take a quarter of your profits,  I'd say, what do you think you are, the IRS? No, I would say that hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right?  Plus, when you have in Europe, under GDPR, you can go up to 4% of gross.  And the problem is that if every country starts doing this, you end up getting to 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Good point.  Nevertheless, a lot of people, including Neelai Patel writing in The Verge said,  this is a slap on the wrist.  You see that? But that's part of the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Neelai is always so cranky, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why we like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's the Damascene conversion. The people who, oh, no, suddenly tech's awful.  The punishment is never bad enough. I'm tired of that.  Okay.  Because it's dangerous. Because here's what happened yesterday.  Let's talk about this.  In the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the, was it the Senate or the House?  Senate.  Okay.  It was Cruz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  And Maisie Hirono.  Yep.  Maisie, to my mind, a good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google, Apple, and who else were called to testify.  Actually, this is a series of hearings. This particular hearing-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook, on Graphcourse.  This was a series of hearings, and this one particularly was focused on trust, antitrust.  And they said, how do we promote innovation in this country with tech being so strong?  So they also were speaking in the House, right? Was there another hearing in the House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There were four separate hearings.  Okay, there were a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There were many.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turn off the room mic, because it's a little echoey.  All of the executives who testified in the House said,  we face competition at every turn, especially with WeChat and TikTok eating into our global market share.  But they did the thing that Mark Zuckerberg did, which when asked questions he didn't know the  answer to, he said, well, let me ask my team and I'll get back to you.  It's frustrating. It's definitely frustrating.  Said freshman representative Lucy McBath of Georgia, which definitely means we're  asking the right kinds of questions, and we recognize this is an ongoing issue.  In the Senate, maybe it was a little different because it seemed like there were competing  agendas, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So the right, so on the one hand, you have people going after the platform saying,  take down extremist content.  And then with no sense of irony whatsoever, the right is complaining that censorship of them,  which to me kind of admits that they are doing extremist content, but we'll leave that to the  side. So now they're arguing that, so Ted Cruz was going after them, had a presentation he'd  gotten out of Google that he thought was damning and so on.  Maisie Gerono, who's the ranking member on the other side, said someone I haven't watched the  testimony yet, but someone I know who I respect a lot who watched it said that she was doing a  better job of defending Google than Google's guy was.  But where you end up here pretty soon is you end up with the potential of the government basically  trying to legislate forcing the platforms to run certain content.  You have things like PragerU, who also testified.  Having gone from Trump's own little White House party for the extremists, they go over to Congress  then. And so they're trying, you've got this pincer movement going on where from the left,  it's you're too big, we're going to break you up. And you got privacy. And then from the right,  it's you're censoring us and you're not letting us speak because other people, the left, are saying,  get the bad speech down, but we don't think our speech is bad. And we're all going to attack you  now. And what's going to suffer is the internet. And that's what worries me. That's what worries

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  me greatly. They also asked some good questions. In fact, I was very impressed by some of these  people. Pramila Jayapal, who's a Democrat from Washington, asked the Amazon General Council.  She said, when people sell products on your site, do you track which products are the most successful?  And then do you sometimes create a product to compete with that product? We've heard, of course,  that Amazon does that. In fact, I think there's pretty good evidence that they do something like  that. Oh, sure. That's one of their, that's their virtuous cycle. Amazon, well, here's Amazon's  response. We do not use individual seller data in order to compete with them. Seller data. Yeah. So  Pramila Jayapal said, you do connect, or no, I'm sorry. This is David Cicilline of Rhode Island.  You do collect enormous data about what products are popular, what's selling and where they're  selling. You're saying you don't use that in any way to promote Amazon products. And I remind you,  you're under oath. Sutton replied, we use data to serve our customers.  We used, that sounds like a little weasel, right? Yep. That's the squirming out of it.  Well, I will say this about that. We use data to serve our customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on your definition of data. It depends on your definition of serve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll serve you right. I mean, Amazon does think of the individual buyer. It doesn't think about  society. It doesn't think about externalities. And it thinks about maximizing its profits  by optimizing the buyer experience. You might say that that's their job.  Yeah. Well, I mean, that is their mission. They talk about it all the time. That's day one,  blah, blah, blah. So it makes sense to say, hey, I'm going to look at data either in aggregate or  what people are buying for them and show them that. And because we want to make money too,  I'm going to use that and show them my stuff. And the consumer gets maybe the best price for this,  which they want. They can find other stuff if they work harder. It's just a question of how far  do we want to let those systemic advantages accrue to Amazon? And we live in a country where there  are systemic advantages that have accrued over time to whole swaths of people. So having it happen  to companies, it feels very much like something we don't know how to talk about and we don't know how  to think about and regulate. So I think it's part of a macro challenge we have here just in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fox News had a headline that would be, I would think, worthy of the Bulwer-Litton  contest. Google VP grilled in hearing over alleged bias against conservatives as slain  reporter's father calls for regulation. Oh, I got a whiplash on that one. Okay. Republican lawmakers  on Tuesday criticized Google during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing over allegations of bias  and censorship of conservative groups in the tech giants platforms. That actually wasn't what the  hearing was about, but okay. Also during the hearing, the father of Virginia reporter,  Allison Parker, who was shot and killed in August while conducting an interview on live television,  called on Congress to further regulate Google and other tech giants.  The problem is that the killer uploaded videos of the murdered to YouTube.  Of course he did. We all saw him, but I think YouTube probably pulled him down as quickly as it could.  Ted Cruz, Google's control over what people hear, watch, read, and say is unprecedented. Google can  and often does control our discourse. The American people are subject to overt censorship and covert

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  manipulation by Google's algorithm. Again, let's look at the one hand we have people screaming  to take down hate speech and take down extremist speech and take down everything. And then we have  them saying, when you take it down, you're hurting us. Now note also, I went looking for coverage of  this hearing. According to Google, except for one to my mind badly done NPR story,  every single bit of coverage was on far right media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I covered it yesterday on Sunday. So partly because in a way I feel like the media,  does it need to cover this? This seems like a dog and pony show.  I don't. It is, but we got to show what they're doing. They're trying to present a worldview here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's going to have a major impact that is being believed by 40% of America. And every time I'm on  MSNBC, I begged them to start a feature called We Watch Fox News So You Don't Have To.  Because it's important to cover it as a political actor. I said somewhat smart ass, but I mean it  in a sense that I don't know what they do cover. What does my father see? And I don't know what  they don't cover. And I want to compare that then to what left media is doing, which is the  media I watch, MSNBC. And we need to see the different worldviews people are getting.  And we have a lot of talk about how there's bifurcation in social media, but there's much  bigger to my mind in media. By the way, there's an excellent study I'm writing about. We'll talk  about more next week. A researcher named Alex Bruns from Queensland, Australia, who I saw last  week in Madrid, who did a study arguing that there's basically no such thing as filter bubbles  and echo chambers. But those have become the working metaphors for all the discussion of  where we are. And we're far too much taking assumptions and myths in this world where we're  headed. So we've got to look also at the larger ecosystem of media and where media are in this.  And we don't really see that. So this is a case where there was a hearing, there was a huge upcry,  but only in one half of the media world. Half is even over it. But it's not at all in the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  media world. Yeah. Well, the other media world was worried about some other things going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  over the weekend. True that. A little more concerned about that. And the first media  world was trying to ignore what was going on in the other media world. Yeah. It was fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is if you watch, as I try to do, Fox for a while and then watch MSNBC for a while, it's almost as  if they're reporting on different countries. Oh, it's really a disconnect. Meanwhile,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Congresswomen testified, I turned to Fox, and they went on about how this was Antifa. Antifa,  however you pronounce it, right? So it was a very different worldview, shall we say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, today, Dave Marcus is testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee  about Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra. And certainly members of Congress, there are members  of Congress and definitely President Trump and definitely Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,  who think Facebook should halt development of Libra. Marcus, however, wasn't, he was a little  equivocal about agreeing to a moratorium. He said, we're going to take the time to get this right.  We will not launch until we've fully addressed all concerns, but we're going ahead with it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is pretty much the end. What did you expect him to say? You're right, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks. Never mind. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a form of prior restraint. You know, you can regulate it  anytime you want. You can stop them, but see what it is first. Yeah. Or pass a law now. You can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that. Or yeah. But you don't even know what it is. Well, I think one of the concerns,  here's Maxine Waters, Facebook's proposed entry into financial services is all the more troubling  because it has already harmed Facebook has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar  to Wells Fargo and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous. Facebook says it's going to be a Swiss consortium. It'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  regulated by the Swiss, not the US. It's other companies, many other companies involved in this.  There's also a concern about its use for money laundering. All cryptocurrency has that.  That's a legitimate concern. Yeah. So there, Maxine Waters did circulate a draft bill that would block  it legally barring all large tech platforms from providing financial services. Senator Brian Schatz,  a Democrat from Hawaii has circulated a similar bill in the Senate that would outlaw reserve backed  digital currency. Libra is reserve backed. So maybe they will make a law. Maybe there  ought to be a law. I don't know. I have to say there's serious concerns about this legitimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There should be, if not federal oversight, at least some sort of auditability  of the process that is conducted by a third party that isn't involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should Facebook, which already, or Google, or Amazon, or Apple, I guess, because Apple's  credit card is rumored to be coming out any day now. Should these companies be told in no uncertain  words, you should not be in financial services. You've got plenty of fish to fry. Let's not  extend your monopoly into an entire new sector. I think that that's reasonable. That's antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not, no, not under American law. It's not. Not if they don't abuse it, they can go into things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Using your monopoly to enter new markets is exactly what antitrust law is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a monopoly. Under legal definition, it's not a monopoly. It's a big company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Using the gigantic size. We've got to really understand what monopoly is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Using the fact that you're very, very large is not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I know. A small company can use its clout to get into a new market. A medium and a large  company can use its clout to get into a new market. Here's what I would argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the problem. The, pardon me, moral panic we have is aimed at a few specific companies.  Instead, say, if you're concerned about currency, because Facebook's not the only  one that's going to develop currencies. Others are, too. If you're concerned about them,  then figure out what you want to do in regulation of the currencies and those activities,  as opposed to saying, if Facebook doesn't, we hate it. That's not a saying regulatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so I think that's a little disingenuous, because Facebook has a history of pushing the  envelope on privacy, data sharing. So it's not like this is an innocent or a neutral actor here.  It is someone who has a bad history coming forth and saying, yeah, I'm going to get into this.  It's like if you knew the town drunk, we're going to, you know, maybe their normal business  is a new stand operator. And now they're like, you know what, I'm going to get into the rental  car business or the chauffeuring business, or I'm going to loan you money. You might be like, hmm,  I don't know if you're the right company to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we can agree there's cause for concern. It may not be a trust, any trust issue,  because of the definition of trust. Although one could say Google has pretty much of a monopoly on  search. Well, we could also see that the market uses new searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, well hold on. You could also see the market respond. So I don't think portal is selling very

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well. The Facebook portal, their camera. Yeah. And I think one of the sales on it for  on Prime Day. Oh, really? So it was one of the big sellers on Prime Day. I don't know if it sold well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it was cheap as hell. That is not a sign that it sold well. That is a sign it was not selling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well. And by the way, as somebody who spent like $1,200 on two Facebook portals, I am not happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about that. So it might be that the market makes a decision not to use Facebook's currency. And  maybe what you need to look for is Facebook pushing it at the expense of other currencies  or using its position to force people to use this particular currency. And that's, that might be  anti-trust. It's very hard to say. I mean, we see this already with like ISPs and they're like  discounting, you know, usage data caps, you know, for certain things like, let's say AT&T and saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah, do HBO go. It's sufficient. Your case is sufficient. Facebook is the town drunk and they're  trying to get in finance. And regardless of whether they're a monopoly or not, they probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  shouldn't be running the banking sector. So regulate the banking generically. The problem  I have with these tax bills too, these tax laws in Europe, we're going to go after one company.  That's, that's private facing, not fair. You have a tax bill that, that has, gives equal treatment  to companies. You have a banking regulation that is equal, which is just smarter regulation too,  because who knows, a law could come tick tock and decide it wants to be a bank. Yes. And that should  be prevented to regulate banking as a generic activity. Fine. However, however, however,  I think what's really happening here is, is a challenge to government and nations. Wars are  fought without weapons and armies. They're fought with data and kids in Moldavia and  currencies are going to be started, have been started by entities other than governments.  There's a larger challenge to government here and I'm not sure the government's going to win  in some of these wars, whether it's Facebook or anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's, that's, that's a fair point, but that is kind of a different point. They may

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not win, but I think it is their battle to play. It is definitely their battle to take. But I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  saying then go about it wisely. Don't go about it emotionally. You know, I was in Madrid last week  and I had a panel of people questioning me and one of them was, what about breaking them up? And I  said, that's, that's emotional. Tell me, tell me why it's pure emotion. And a lot of this discussion  is emotional and that's what's dangerous. Deal with evidence. There is, there is a case to be made

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that these companies as they get bigger and bigger and put more of their fingers in more pies and  gather more data about us, become more and more difficult to, to disentangle from the American  economy. So maybe not breaking them up. Here's a proposal from Robert Epstein. I'm sure you hate  this too. This is in Bloomberg Business Week to break Google's monopoly on search. Don't dismantle  it. Make its index public, give other companies access to the Google index. You could have an API.  In fact, they do have an API. They just don't let anybody use it. So then other search engines with  other approaches could emerge that would provide some competition. What about that idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, it's a specific attack on a specific company, specific function. There's no other  company in this realm. Well, let's go to that other story. Let's go to that other story.  There are others. There is Bing. Oh, come on. Bing is as credible as terms of functionality.  Five percent of the market. Well, because the market can speak. So what's to say that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  prefer Google? Here's what Epstein says. There's precedent for this both in law and Google's  business practices. When private ownership of essential resources and services, water,  electricity, telecommunications, and so on, no longer serves the public interest,  governments often step in to control them. The 1956 consent decree, AT&T, the US forced,  this is before the breakup, AT&T to share its patents with other companies.  AT&T was a monopoly. Let's be clear about that.  I don't care what straw drog search engines you pull up. Google completely dominates in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search is now so unimportant compared to the other things that go on. That's the other thing.  I would say for most people, Google is the internet. That's why the right to be forgotten

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  texts Google because if it's not in Google's index, nobody's going to see that page. Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is the internet. Don't listen to me. Go to line 30 in the rundown. You have the BBC with an accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google search isn't everything. It's just almost anything. This is Mark Ward,  technology correspondent writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just simply arguing that this function that we thought was all  encompassing does happen a lot of other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google is getting their hands into all of this as well. They have their home and voice and they  use lots of their data that only they gather to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I say one welcome by new master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not a compelling. I mean, it's an opinion piece. It's not a reportage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's emotion. That's not facts and data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And honestly, it doesn't provide me with it just says, you know, somebody else could come along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As has happened in the past, Microsoft was going to take over the world.  Microsoft was the big evil. There was no beating Microsoft ever.  I don't see it.  There was a story in the Guardian 2009. Somebody put it from a decade ago.  No one's ever going to honest to God, Guardian, no one's ever going to unseat WhatsApp.  I don't want to. I mean, I mean, no, my space, my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that was a different time. My space had a 25 million users. I mean,  this Google is so dominant and the Google index, the crown jewel of Google is,  it's been so long cultivated that it's hard to imagine another company coming.  Look at, I mean, we talk a lot about Duck Duck Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not the value is the index is the index is not the value.  The index you find. So we save you the effort and expense of scraping the web.  Well, that's considerable, but that's not where the brilliance of Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, good. Then you don't mind if we open it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is we're going to end up with another crappy web search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it won't be crappy. It'll be. Well, no, I'll telegraph my pick of the week  because I learned from this article that Google does offer one and only one  company in the world, full access to the API. It's a company called Startpage.  And Google does not get information back from Startpage. The Google search.  If I search for Jeff Jarvis, this will be the equivalent result of an incognito  search using Google because it is the API. It is the Google, but notice anonymous view.  Google lets them do this. According to this article, I'm not sure I buy this.  Google allows this kind of sharing with a chosen few, most notably a small but  ingenious company called Startpage in the Netherlands. In 2009, Google granted Startpage  access to its index and return for fees generated by ads placed near the Startpage search results.  I actually don't see any ads. What I don't see.  Well, that's a search for me.  What I don't see and I love is the YouTube slideshow, the Google AMP slideshow.  There's a Wikipedia link, which is great. So there is a knowledge bar.  You can make this your default search engine. It is my default search engine in Firefox.  I think it gives me, I mean, would you agree these are good search results for your name, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google deciding to do this, I have no objection to whatsoever.  Bravo, Google.  Government mandating it because they happen to have a Jones about Google, particularly,  I find troubling as precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of like to see them mandate it because then we could see other companies like Startpage.  Under what legal doctrine?  I worry that Startpage at any point, what legal doctrine? I just gave you water, electricity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, it's not a monopoly. Where it is monopoly, Leo, where it is close to a monopoly,  where it does have that power, it's advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This does not require it to be a monopoly. It's merely saying it's in the national,  there's no law. You make the law. It's in the national interest that we, it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  socialistic. Under what, there has to be some legal doctrine in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it exists. It exists. Your water company is not a private company.  Is a really bad. Your water company is not a private company. It is run by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't give me the utility thing. That's so, you know where, why? Because that's going to,  that leads straight into the white house and Ted Cruz saying, we're now going to force you to  publish things you don't want to publish because you're Google is an internet utility.  No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I think, and if it, if we ever get there,  watch out to what the Donald Trump's do to it. Watch out to what others in other countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a straw dog. I think we could fight that battle when that time comes.  I don't think it's at all unreasonable to say there yesterday and the Senate judiciary committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The challenge always with regulation is it's going to come from the parties in charge. And  presumably if I mean, we used to have, and I'm not being straight when I say we used to have a  Congress that worked, but we used to actually have people coming from both sides to create  reasonable legislation. 230 came that way. Right.  But I, I will say to say that we should not regulate something because we are afraid of  what the party in charge will do is just giving up and saying our democracy is clearly broken  and we should just give up now. So we either have to say, okay, it's broken. I hope it fixed.  I hope we can get a fix and I hope our government can step in when we need it to,  to regulate problematic industries or we just say, okay, I'm moving to pick your country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I just think throwing up your hands and saying, uh, it's too, it's impossible to regulate  these guys. So let's just let them go and see what happens. I'm not saying that I have, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  put forward regulatory regimes that I do believe in. I believe we're more flexible, but I believe  we're more negotiable that are based on principle that are not based on momentary hatred or  moral panic. So I'm not saying let's do that then, but let's do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk about something else. Y'all. I'm, y'all are yelling so much today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man. We're overriding the Botox. How about the baby named after Google? That'll cheer you up.  And nice. What did nice Google do? A baby boy in Indonesia, given the name Google  got a goody bag from Google after the story of his name went viral. Ella Karina, the mother of the  baby did not want to list every item given to her son, but there are a few items Google Indonesia  sent the items, including a baby jumper branded with the company's logo. Aw. At first Karina said  she didn't agree with her company, her husband's idea to name the son after the company, but she  got, she became more accepting of the notion after the positive responses they received.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll get free stuff. Little baby Google. Little baby Google. Aw. That kid's going to have such  a nightmare life just because of things like, Hey Google. I don't know what it, maybe in Indonesian

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google means something good. Maybe it means chocolate cake. I think it's actually a fun name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google. It's not, yeah, it's not a terrible name. It's a great baby name.  No one's name in their kids is Alexa anymore. So let's play a game here. What tech brands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would be okay as names without associations? Bing? Yeah. Okay. Bing Crosby. Uber? Chandler Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chandler Bing. Hey Uber. Uber. Definitely not Uber. Deutschland Uber Aulis. A little tough there.  No. Microsoft? No. That poor kid. If it's a boy, bad, bad, bad.  Faith. There is a kid named Facebook after the Arab Spring. That's not a great name.  Yeah. I wonder if I think it was a kid in Egypt who was named Facebook because his  Yo, Twitter. Come here. Twitter's a good name. Twitter's a good name. Twitter's a good name.  Twitter. By the way. I like that. Since we're in, while we're on the subject,  we're trying to lighten things up. Do you have the new Twitter look? Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've had it for a while. I like it, but mine's in dark mode. So Jeff would hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I'm sorry. So I keep checking. I don't know why. I honestly don't know why I have such a  visual visual reaction against dark mode, but I do. It's earnest. It is different. And so I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a hard time with it for the first probably three days and I was like, but I forced myself.  Because it's easy on the eyes. Because I forced myself to like embrace something for a week or so.  And then I'm like, yeah, it's still not me or, Oh, okay. And it is, it is easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come to us. Oh, I'm going to sneeze. Sneeze to us. All right. I'm going to log into Twitter.  I've been checking. Lisa got it. It's slowly rolling out this week.  And Lisa got it, but yes, bless you. But I have, I don't know if I've got it yet.  I just hope Twitter doesn't destroy tweet deck. Cause as far as I'm concerned,  that's the only way to use Twitter. Nope. I don't have it yet. I still have the whole new Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is coming. What does that look like? Tweet deck. Oh no, no, I know what Tweet is. Okay. That's,  do you have it on that machine? Can you see the new Twitter? I do. I've forgotten all about old

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter. So this, everything's on the left now, right? And then they put lists over there,  which is nice. I'm glad they brought lists back. Okay. They do keep, well, they, I think they were  already switching your timeline too. You know what they didn't do? I don't know if they should have.  Remember Twitter is now putting when a major political figure, somebody with over a hundred  thousand followers says something that violates the rules. I've never seen that. I've never seen  it yet. Some people thought that the Donald Trump's go back to home where you came from  to the UFO, US citizens, members of the House of Representatives, that that may be deserved

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that thing. But they didn't go back to what happened on Capitol Hill just yesterday  where the right wing is screaming that they're being sensitive. Twitter is saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah, you think that's as prudent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting. You know, at one point, is it, is it the moral obligation of a company to  do things like that? At what point do you understand and say, well, if you're going to make a rule,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you're going to have to do it. I don't know. I don't care. It's Twitter. Who cares? Here's the  New York Times. I don't know if I agree with this. This is another VidCon story. The New York Times,  Kevin Ruse, who I like a lot and is very smart tech reporter, don't scoff at the influencers.  They're taking over the world. He says that all these TikTokers and YouTubers, they're going to  be in charge. They're going to be in charge, which I don't know, maybe he says, well, first of all,  being an influencer is a tough job. These people are essentially one person startups. The best of  them can spot trends, experiment relentlessly with new platforms and formats, build an authentic  connection with an audience, play close attention to their channel analytics, figure out how to  distinguish themselves in a crowded media environment, all while churning out a constant  stream of new content. What better qualifications for president of the United States, I ask you.  He says these social media guys, he says, just look at AOC. Basically, she is the opening wedge  of young social media aware, literate people. Influencer culture, he writes, is already an  established force. A generation of direct to consumer brands were built using the tools and  tactics of social media like Glossier, the influence beloved beauty company that raised  $100 million at a billion dollar valuation or away. The luggage startup whose ubiquitous Instagram  ads helped it reach a valuation of 1.4 billion, by the way, podcast. We did podcast ads for a  way too, but I don't know if we helped. I know I had them on one of my podcasts very early days.  Natalie Azade, you may know her as Natalie's outlet, 10 million subscribers on YouTube,  a wave of influencers who treated their online brand building as a business rather than a fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  hobby. So what if instead, okay, well, no, okay, that kills that point. Nevermind. Go back,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  keep going. Well, so for instance, four years ago, she came to VidCon, but she was a marketing  student and less than 7,000 subscribers. She decided to study her favorite YouTubers, figure  out what made it work, tested videos in multiple genres. She said she was watching people like  Michelle Phan that were building legacies out of honestly just being really relatable online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was always an aspiration. Which media companies just simply can't learn the value of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  relationships and trust. Oh my gosh. Yeah, I was going to say what if this is about sincerity? So  maybe I should say what if it's about sincerity and gaming the algorithms? But like I do have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to wonder why Brian Williams is still on MSNBC after all this time. I mean, honest to God,  this guy is not a network anchor. He's terrible. How did you get from Phan to William? Well, I'm  just saying mainstream media does seem to have missed the point that integrity and relatability

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and authenticness are important. They think that I sat in meetings at NBC and they just, this is  before the controversy with him and it was all, they were all built around Brian, Brian, Brian,  Brian, Brian. This is their view of the relationship is a celebrity and they don't understand that  Michelle Phan and bigger and huge, the Green Brothers and name them have an entirely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  relationship. I think we get fooled. I get fooled too. I'm a mainstream media guy. We get fooled by  the Logans of the world and think, oh God, that stuff on YouTube, that's crap. That's terrible  content. I don't know why. It's just the kids, they'll grow out of it. I think that's the big  phrase that they use in the 30 rock every day. They'll grow out of it and then they'll come

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  watch Brian Williams. They'll read newspapers. This is why I love VidCon. This is exactly why I  so love VidCon is because it forces you and I tell every media person I meet and every TV person,  especially I meet, they don't listen to me, to go to VidCon because you will see an entirely

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  different relationship. And can't we really say that Donald Trump got elected president  to a great deal because he did that. He knew exactly how to reach out and build his platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope, disagree. What he did is he used that platform to manipulate dumb old big media.  That's true. They were complicit. And that's the secret to what he did. He didn't really build  the relationship. He built the relationship in the rallies. I think he did. But the relationship

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was a screaming relationship. He has an amazing relationship with his base. As he said himself,  he literally could go out on Fifth Avenue, shoot somebody and his base would go, yay Donald.  It doesn't matter what he does. That is an example of an incredible relationship with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  30% of the American population. But all he does is shout back to them what they want to hear.  Well, it works. I'm not saying it's good. I'm just saying it works.  Yeah, but I think it's a different analysis. It's populism. You know, we've always had populism. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  by the way, Kevin Roos points out, we've always had this with talk show hosts and movie stars  and Davos attendees. I don't know why he's throwing that in. Maybe a shot at you,  Jeff. I don't know. But we have always had this populism. You go back to Huey Long. Huey Long  spoke to his people, right? Savonarola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Savonarola. Yeah. If you want to go a little further back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit of breaking news here.  Savonarola. Yes, breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bloomberg reporting that Trump now is talking about intervening in the DOD cloud contract with

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon or Microsoft. Oh yeah, he's real upset about that. He doesn't want them to award the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't want Jeff Bezos to be running. This is the Jedi contract, I think. The 10 billion  dollar Jedi contract. Yeah, I put it up there on the rundown. He's also saying we should investigate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's relationship to China. Because Peter Thiel said Google should be investigated as a traitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see Dan Primack? Do you get his newsletter subscription, the Axios one?  Where he was like, Peter, are you sure you're not a vampire? Can you deny that you are a vampire?  And oh, it was just so salty. It was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Questions for Peter Thiel after his accusations. So a few questions, Mr. Thiel. Have you shorted  Google stock? By the way, Thiel is one of the big investors and founders of Palantir. Is Palantir  currently competing with Google for a major US government contract? Oh, so good. You've said on  the record you're not a vampire. Are you able to provide independent verification of this claim?  Because were you a vampire, it would pose a national security risk. Is it because you're  actually a vampire that you deny being a vampire? And would that not be seemingly treasonous in the  generally accepted societal punishment is death, albeit by wooden stake in this case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One shot Axios is going to get put out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, the only reason I don't fear so much is because the Donald says a lot of things  and does very few of them. So admittedly, he's the leader of the free world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Others do things on his behalf, including his cabinet members,  like rolling back certain EPA restrictions, among other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I honestly think that that's the real agenda. That the stuff, all the noise at the top is to  distract you from the real agenda, which is getting done very effectively by appointing judges,  by removing restrictions and regulations. That doesn't get the headlines because the  Donald's getting all the attention. Say over here, look at this. I think let's investigate Google.  Meanwhile, we don't need any emissions restrictions. Those are silly. Silly.  That's personally my personal view of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twitch.  I'm going to apologize right now for eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please. One must keep one's blood sugar at a reasonable level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is before you were on the pre-talk, Stacey. I wonder, have you bought the,  how much is it here? $275 toaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, because I have the six-fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's got to do an oven. Her stuff, even more.  But this is particular for toast.  It only makes one slice at a time because that's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it have a bidet?  Does it have a bidet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It washes your butt and makes toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will say my toast does taste better in the June oven. So I can imagine a  dedicated novel toaster being-  Oh, here we go. Here we go. What have yous been buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Mitsubishi Electric. Look at it. Look at it. Let's watch the video.  Let's watch the video. I'm going to show you the video here. Yeah.  That's not it.  That's Texas Toast.  The other is from Mitsubishi's product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what they sell in Japan a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Texas Toast is good.  Okay. I'm going to skip the taste test.  Yeah. All right. Shut up.  This is what it looks like. It looks like a grilled cheese maker.  It does look like a grilled cheese maker.  Yeah. Because you put the lid down.  This is the, he says it costs so much because it's a completely new structure.  You put butter on the thing. It really is a grill.  You know what? If I were George Foreman, I'd be pissed.  It's a George Foreman grill. It's a freaking George, $270 George Foreman grill. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I wouldn't buy that. I did just buy something really cool and I can't wait to tell  you guys about it in a week when it arrives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it the Whirlpool trash composter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but does that automatically tell me which goes where?  Also, I am composting now and I hate it.  No, that's why you need this.  And I will do anything to solve that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need the new Zira food recycler. They're putting it on Indiegogo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yes. I've wanted that since it was announced at like CES forever ago.  Yeah. Well, it's coming up.  No, no. Go back up. That dateline is 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. But it is now on Indiegogo. Let me find it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, okay. I was like, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. They announced it two years ago.  Whirlpool put it on Indiegogo?  Well, it's Whirlpool's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. GE does stuff on Indiegogo too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the GE thing? That's right.  It's W Labs they call it. It's Whirlpool's kind of think tank.  What are you eating, Stacey?  It's like cheesecake.  Okay. But when you're done with it, okay, here's what you do.  Flavor? What flavor?  Here's what you do.  Cherry.  You can buy it now, by the way. So let me just show you how it works.  It's only $1,199. Let me just...  That doesn't include the pods that you have to buy.  You end up with dirt.  Yeah. So what it is, it's a little thing that sits next to your counter.  Yeah. It's a big thing. It's bigger than your trash can.  You put anything in there, food, scraps, everything, meat, potatoes, milk, doesn't matter.  Put all your scraps in there. Now, wait a minute.  I got to point out that while your scraps are in there and rotting, it's in your kitchen.  So they do have a special filter system to try to get rid of the odors, but I wonder.  Okay. But wait a minute. Now it's going to take three and a half kilograms, seven pounds  of food stuff, churn it up. And then when it's done, look,  you get this beautiful mulch you can feed your micro greens with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is it not using the heat generated by this to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because it does it in 24 hours. So you're not really getting...  And you have to buy a special pod that you put in.  They show it briefly, but they don't really emphasize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it has worms in it? Is that...  No, I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worms are slow.  Composting with worms.  No, the pod has chemicals in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, well, that seems...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it speeds up the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That seems like a recurring business model, but that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the Juicero of composting.  So you need the Xera filter because it stinks because it's rotting food in your kitchen.  And then you also... And I'm just assuming, maybe it doesn't.  And then you also need for $13.99, the Xera additive.  It's made from something called Quar, C-O-I-R, and baking soda.  Quar is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Quar is like hemp or root.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, coconut. It's made from coconut husk.  The Xera additive pack is made from paper design,  so the entire additive, including the packaging, can be placed in the device.  You get... Oh, I'm sorry.  You know what? It's 14 bucks for four of them, so it's only a few bucks a week.  However, the Xera food recycler team has been notified.  A number of fraudulent retail websites have been targeting consumers across social media platforms.  Please make sure you get the genuine Xera food recycler as part of the W.W. Lab's Indiegogo  pre-order campaign at wlabsinnovations.com.  Sorry. I don't know why Google decided...  Siri decided to make a note of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  False positive.  I would say... What was I going to say?  Oh, I have a composter. I went with the OXO composter,  but the popular compost design for those counter things does include a charcoal filter for the  smell because they do smell gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I got a lot of stuff. By the way, they also have a Smart Oven,  which looks a lot like a June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Mitsubishi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. W.W. Labs, which is Westinghouse.  Whirlpool. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they launched that at CES this last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Smart Oven, huh? I wonder what their Smart Oven costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has an integration with Yumly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With what? Yumly? Oh, I love Yumly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did they buy Yumly? I think they bought Yumly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. Whirlpool's got some money, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you know what? Do any of you have a Joule Cooker?  The Joule Sous Vide machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No? Well, Breville, which actually does make a great Smart Oven.  Breville's great.  They purchased Chef Steps, the company behind the Joule,  and they purchased the Assets, which means it was a fire sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so Joule was not a...  I feel like I have a Joule on order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like you do.  I feel like I ordered that a couple of years ago.  Oh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, I have a Joule, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well.  So Joule's kind of the wave of food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's get back on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah. No more cooking.  Let's talk about something really important.  Prime Day surpassed Black Friday and Cyber Monday, combined!  The biggest shopping event in history.  How many workers walked out?  And did it impact this?  Because that was going to be the big boycott, right?  I intentionally did not buy anything on Amazon to show support for the walkout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't buy anything on Amazon because I just didn't need anything.  So the big sellers in the US...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went to the page after page and couldn't find much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  Look at the big sellers.  It was the LifeStraw personal water filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was everywhere.  They pushed this like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the thing I really yelled at Chad Johnson for using on the GizWiz.  They brought in some scummy swamp water and he drank it.  And I said, if you died, I'd be responsible.  Please don't do that.  What do you think?  You are a YouTube star.  Did he die?  No, he didn't.  Did he get sick?  Go eat Tide Pods on your time, Chad Johnson.  No, but I was worried like we're liable if our employee decides to drink swamp water  through the LifeStraw and he gets sick.  But he didn't.  It makes disgusting water drinkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not drinkable.  But maybe not...  There's a bit of a privileged thing here.  Why don't we buy those to send to countries where they can't get drinkable water?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was used in Haiti after the earthquake, Rwanda in 2015,  and apparently can be commonly found in the rucksacks of many a member of the US military.  It's the kind of thing...  I'll tell you why it sold well.  It was $10 and it's the kind of thing you thought,  well, I'm not going to drink any bad water, but if I ever had to,  it'd be really good that I had the straw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good to have in your go bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You put it in your go bag.  I guarantee you that's what...  I have a little light, a Sterilite, that's for sterilizing water so you can drink it.  I've never used it, but I got it.  Number two, the Instapot.  It will never die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Man, who doesn't have an Instapot?  This is what's so confusing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still have not bought one because no one has convinced me why I need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need an Instapot.  Yeah, my wife doesn't want one.  You don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't love mine, but...  300,000 Instapots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, actually, wait a minute.  I take it back.  That was last year.  They probably sold more this year.  And then weirdly, I guess because they were 50% off,  the number three seller, 23andMe and Ancestry DNA DNA kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So I found...  Did I tell you my story about this?  So my grandfather was illegitimate.  And in West Virginia, back in the holler,  he was raised by his grandmother as if his grandmother were his mother to the town.  And his mother was, by all appearances, his sister.  But now he took the black and he's fighting on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't know who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My name is not...  My name probably isn't Jarvis.  What?  Given genealogy.  The kids...  We visited my father.  We went crazy on genealogy because 23andMe came to me and said,  you have a second cousin who shares grandparents.  Who's from the town where the guy knocked up my great grandmother.  Was from Buffalo, New York.  And what was his last name?  My mom's from Buffalo.  I forget right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cousin, my long lost cousin.  His last name was Higginbotham.  Is that fair if you were related to me?  That was the best punchline ever.  And his last name was Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not my mom's last name.  I know.  That was such a good punchline.  By violating your security.  Don't say your mother's maiden name.  My security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because yes, they still ask that question.  I always yell at them when they do.  And that man's name was Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to just take a real quick break with our sponsor and then we will get back to more.  We'll do some fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We could talk about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we have.  We could talk about the people who are leaving Google.  All the people who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I just saw that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Meanwhile, our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology,  WWT.  I think a lot of you, especially if you're in enterprise, know about WWT.  But do you know about their Advanced Technology Center?  This thing is amazing.  They started building about 10 years ago because they realized when you're selling  enterprise technologies, it's never just in a vacuum.  It has to integrate with a variety of other technologies.  You need to test it.  They really wanted to bring down the time from figuring out what you want to buy to  getting it in place.  The ATC does that.  Now, half a billion dollars of equipment in this amazing lab from hundreds of OEMs.  I mean, all the biggies at Cisco, NetApp, VMware, but not just the biggies.  They've got disruptors too like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.  WWT is a trusted partner.  When it comes time for you to expand your portfolio, to add to your security,  to move to the cloud, WWT is there for you and will be there with you over the years.  Many of their customers have been there for years, for over a decade.  They know WWT is where they can go to get the answers they need to make sure their  business runs right.  So much information.  So many tools.  Such smart people.  In fact, the WWT engineers work in these labs every day themselves.  Beta testing, new equipment building, reference architectures, helping clients in business,  in government, set up custom integrations so that you can make decisions.  You can see the results.  And frankly, with less investment on your part, they've already made the investment.  What's cool about the Advanced Technology Center, it's an incubator for IT innovation  and you can use it.  You can use it.  Hundreds of on-demand integrated solutions labs representing the newest advances in things,  everything from flash storage to software-defined networking, network automation,  endpoint security architecture, stuff that you're looking at right now that you're trying  to solve and you shouldn't try to do it on your own.  WWT and the Advanced Technology Center is there to help you.  You can learn about products before you launch them.  You can do exactly what the engineers do.  Spin up proofs of concepts and pilots using their built-in sandbox so you can select the  right solution for you with confidence.  And they're there.  Their engineers are there to help you.  Reduce concept time from months to weeks that increases the speed to market.  They call it lab as a service.  I love this idea.  It is within the ATC, a dedicated lab space you can use to perform programmatic testing  using any of these half a billion dollars worth of gear, this vast technology ecosystem,  and it's virtual.  So you can use it.  You don't have to go to St. Louis.  You can use it anywhere you are 24-7.  Later this summer, WWT is going to launch a new digital platform which will give you  hands-on access to more than 200 lab environments.  This could be even better.  And if you want early access to that, you can go right now to www.wwt.com slash  twit and sign up for pre-launch access.  WWT, Worldwide Technology, simplifies the complex.  So remember that.  WWT.com slash twit.  I know people are, as I've been talking about this over the last few weeks, are very excited  about this.  This is what we need.  This used to be something that, you know, back in the days of PC Magazine and the great  tech magazines, I remember they had a great lab in Foster City.  This is the kind of thing they used to do.  No one can afford to do this anymore.  WWT can.  Half a billion dollars worth of gear.  And a lot of that's thanks to their great OEM partners like NetApp.  WWT, Delivering Business and Technology Outcomes Around the World.  WWT.com slash twit.  Thank you WWT for your support.  We're already talking about going out and visiting that lab next year.  I want to see it.  WWT.com slash twit.  So what was it that we were going to talk about?  I forgot.  Google.  Google, the workers, mostly women, right?  Or are they all women who started the walkout?  Most of them have now left.  Most is a bit strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Four out of seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's more than half.  Technically accurate.  The most notable, of course, is Meredith Whitaker.  She was, you know, not, not, she was not a run-of-the-mill employee.  She ran Google's open research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eric Anderson, who was a great, great person at Google News Lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whitaker, you may remember a couple of months ago,  claimed that Google had retaliated her.  She was working on AI ethics through AI Now, a research institute she co-founded  that has received funding from Google.  She'd already been told that her AI ethics work was no longer a fit for the cloud division.  She wrote in a farewell note posted last week on Medium,  It's clear Google isn't a place where I can continue this work.  She left, but she did on her way out urge employees to unionize,  protect whistleblowers, and insist on transparency around the technology  they're building and how it will be used.  You know, there's so many companies where the workers don't have that power.  But in a company like Google where your, your line workers, our PhDs,  are very valuable engineers and developers, not easy to replace,  rightly so, I think they have a voice in the work that they're doing.  She had been at Google 13 years.  So I think that that's significant.  I don't know, I have no inside knowledge.  I don't know.  You know, Google says she was told she could continue working on AI ethics  in her personal time, but her official role at the company was open source work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So did you ever read the story about how Google doesn't fire anyone?  They just like shuns them off to irrelevancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw it on Silicon Valley, the TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there is that, but there was an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google would take a guy who they didn't want anymore, but couldn't fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they just sent him to the roof where he could just sit around all day.  And there were, and he got up there and there were a bunch of people on the roof said,  yeah, we just sit, we'd collect our paychecks and we enjoy the free food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a story about, yes, that is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently they do it in Japan.  It's common in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was about people with stock options waiting for them to vest, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, because you're not going to leave.  Either way.  If you've got three more years to vest valuable stock options, you're never going to quit.  I'll go make compost for you, yeah.  In California, at least, and I bet you this is the case in general,  but in California, at least, it's hard to fire an employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, in Texas, it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, wait a minute, California is in that wheeled state.  So maybe it isn't so hard.  I don't know.  That's what I thought.  I find it difficult.  Maybe Larry just doesn't have the, you know, I just, I can't fire him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He has people who do that for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's Google's statement to Wired.  Meredith Whitaker has decided to resign in Google's open source program management team.  Since 2016, Meredith spent most of her time on work for NYU's, by the way,  NYU's AI Now Institute.  And we'll leave the company to focus on this work.  Google will continue to work with policymakers, academics, the tech community,  other leaders from across industries as we tackle these important issues,  in addition to providing transparency into how we're putting our AI principles into action.  Kind of misses the point, I think, but her last day at Google was Monday.  Celia O'Neill Hart, former global head of trust and transparency marketing and YouTube ads,  left to go to Pinterest.  Claire Stapleton, a former marketing manager YouTube left in June.  So yeah, I mean, honestly, if they're not happy, they should go back where they came from.  Oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, where is the boxing glove when you need it?  Wow.  That was just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but truthfully, if you're not happy to accompany, you should leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what if you had been happy until you spoke out and the company made you so miserable that  now you had no other option?  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's different, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which might be happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google says it did investigate the retaliation claims from Stapleton and Whittaker,  found no evidence of retaliation.  Erica Anderson, former head of news ecosystem for Google News Lab, left in January to join Vox Media.  Only three organizers employed at Google just eight months after the protest.  The remaining organizers decided to decline to comment or did not respond.  So of the, what was it, seven, three or only three are left.  That's more than half.  I don't know.  I, you know, this feels like an employment dispute.  I don't, I don't know if I can weigh in on this.  I'll let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I don't, I don't have anything to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I was like, I don't understand.  Well, I just think I, I, I'm not surprised by this.  I think it's important to note it and be like, hey, that's not awesome.  Um, and I, I wanted to bring up something that I'm sure y'all talked about.  Did y'all talk about it last week?  The Google workers listening on the okay Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, let's talk about that.  Google laughed and said, well, of course they're listening.  How do you think we do quality assurance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's me saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what actually in, we talked about this on our show, Kevin and I today,  but what actually struck me about this was,  and I knew that this had happened.  One is I thought Google actually had a procedure where they  anonymized or modulated the voices.  So you couldn't tell who was speaking.  That's a good idea.  But apparently they don't have that.  I don't know why I thought that I read it somewhere that was wrong, apparently.  But the other thing is the false positive rate here is pretty high.  So this company VRT, VNT, V something T,  they said they had over a thousand utterances, recordings of utterances.  And there was 153 false positives where people didn't say Google or okay or hey or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And as a result, they got, there were private conversations and all sorts of stuff.  VRT is a Flemish Belgian news organization that was given the information,  leaked the information from one of their language reviewers of some Dutch audio data.  And yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?  What was it? What percentage was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It turns out, well, okay, we don't know the base number.  It's more than a thousand recordings, but of those more than a thousand, 153 of them were false positives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like 15, at least 15%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, at least 15.  Well, at most it would be 15%.  Okay. Right. At most 15%.  Right.  But yeah, but it's still, I mean, that's a crazy high amount.  That's not certainty at a place where I would feel comfortable.  I mean, I have a Google in my office, but I've always unplugged it when I'm talking about  sensitive things with people. But there's a couple of things I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You actually go over and unplug your assistants before you have serious conversations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, before I have conversations about like with a source or something, if someone's talking.  Yeah, as a journalist. Yeah.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't have like, I don't have any like of my smart speakers on, although I guess if you were  leaking in on my phone, but I'm talking to you on, you could hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You have a microphone in your pocket all the time. Here's Google's, one of a part of Google's  blog post, language experts only review around 0.2% of all audio snippets. Actually, that's a  surprisingly large number, honestly. That means that's what is 20 out of every thousand  snippets are reviewed. Audio snippets are not associated with user accounts as part of the  review process. And this is to your point, Stacey, reviewers are directed not to transcribe  background conversations or other noises, and only to transcribe snippets that are directed to Google.  If they don't hear, okay, Google, they're not supposed to pay. They're supposed to say, oh,  I can't listen to that and move on. Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pay it, no mind. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It occurs to me that yes, there are, I get false positives too, right? I'll be, I'll be talking.  We all do, right? Yeah.  But, but in every case, it comes to life. It comes to life. And so, you know, when you've  triggered a false positive. No, because you can turn off, you shouldn't, but you can turn off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bloop. And in fact, I've done that on my Echo show, cause it's annoying. And so the only way I  know is there's a little blue light on my show cause it's got a screen. If it weren't, if it  didn't have a screen, then maybe there'd be a ring. But if you weren't looking at it, it would,  there's no audio. I see. Okay. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. I've done this with now, now I'm worrying that I shouldn't have. I've done this with the,  turn those back on. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon Echo in my bedroom. Yeah. Cause I don't like that. It's annoying. In fact,  they probably make it annoying. Oh, you see the difference for me is I only do, I have the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't do any screenless assistant. But this, even during the show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  every assistant I use as a screen, I should just point out just minutes ago,  Siri had a full page of transcribed conversation because it had accidentally been triggered. I  didn't say, Hey Siri, but it had actually been triggered. And this whole screen was full.  Now it did make that thing at the end. That's how I knew that little bding at the end, but still,  I think they're listening. We should, you know what? Remember in the old days,  mom and dad would say, Oh, little pictures have big ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Little what? I think that's talking about kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. No, that's not talking about voice assistance. This was 50 years ago. I'm just saying  now we have to say, little voice assistants have big ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google assistant only sends audio to Google after your device detects you're interacting with the  assistant or thinks you're interacting by saying, Hey, Google are physically triggering the Google  assistant, a clear indicator, such as the flashing dots on top of a Google home or an on-screen  indicator on your Android device will activate anytime the Google device is communicating with  Google in order to fulfill your request. Rarely devices that have the Google assistant built in  may experience what we call a false accept. It's not so rare. Is 15% of this particular sample

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  size rare? So that's high. I want us to stop talking about this. Like, ah, like here's the  details. I want us to start talking about how we fix this or how we make these. There is one and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  only one good, but there's one easy solution. It pisses me off. The first assistant that does this  will suddenly become the market leader. Let us change the trigger phrase to something long  and unusual. Please. My old Moto X phone, it was helped me. My old Moto X phone was helped me. And  this is how I know they can do it. They did it five years ago. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only  hope. If I said that it would trigger that never had false positives. The reason you don't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is because sometimes in the middle of a conversation or argument, you want to like say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. He wants to show off. He wants to show that off  in every conversation. No, I'm just right. Karsten. And I tell you what, if echo does it or Google does  it, whoever does it first, and it's not a hard thing to do. This would be so wonderful. It would  be immediately the best selling device because everybody agrees with me on this. The only reason  I can think they don't do this because it's expensive. You have to have more memory. You  have to have more processor. A phone could do it because a phone's got a lot of intelligence. Why  these phones don't is beyond me. But a small cheap echo dot or Google Home Hub, maybe that's too  expensive. But look, add the five bucks because even if it costs five bucks more, everybody will  buy that. I don't know why they haven't done that. Drives me nuts. Okay. Well, I have  different ideas. It would also make it so we don't have to always say, hey, Shlomo, hey, Guillermo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aliocious. Children could be named the A word again. Children could be named AliexA again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please set the free. Have we seen any, you know, those every year, those, those, you know,  names kids have, is there, have you ever seen anything that says, oh yeah, whether that word  has gone up or down? Social Security. Yeah, it went down. I'll go to Wolfram Alpha because,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, I love one of the things I love about Wolfram Alpha is you can put your name in  and you can see the incidence of using that name. So let me just say the name AliexA ranks 90th.  Yeah, look at the graph. See, can I zoom in on that graph? Let me see if I can zoom in on that  graph a little bit. So see, it was going up until it was about 2008 and the sudden precipitous  decline in people naming their children AliexA. There are 85,000 people named AliexA today, but  well, a lot of four-year-olds expected current age distribution. The Youngs,  here's some famous people named AliexA, but if you look at that graph, that drop off is  pretty precipitous. Something must have caused that. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. The next web

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  did a story, let's see, how old is it? Five weeks ago. And they've got graphs on Madam A, they've  got graphs on Bixby, which is hilarious because Bixby actually goes up. Nobody names their kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bixby. And if you do, you should be punished. It went from four to five. Yeah. Yeah. It's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  zero to 10 is their YS. But we know there's at least one kid in Indonesia named Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. So in Siri, same decline. Cortana, eh. It peaked in 2015, apparently. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that when? I think it's right about when all this stuff started to appear. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I was wondering, because isn't Cortana named after a video game character? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a character in Halo. Yeah. Halo. It's actually the same character. It's a virtual assistant,  female virtual. It's like Jarvis. It's like Jarvis. Only female. Yeah. With three syllables.  Okay. Okay. Good. Thank you for ending this on an up note. Anything else we should? Oh, let's see  here. Did we miss anything you wanted to talk about, Jeff or Stacey? We got the Japanese toaster,  I'm happy. Facebook's new finger cams. That's not real. Oh, good. Okay. I mean, it's a patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a patent. That's mean they're going to do it. And somebody goes berserk about it. No, no.  Neural link. No, we got to do that one. Yeah, we got to do that one. So that was last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was trending on Twitter. I said, what is this? They had a live event, which I didn't watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watched the last half of it. The first half, my wife made us go out to the park and go pottering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good for you. You're good for Kimmy. The first advance pottering. Oh, pottering. I gotcha. I gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we call it. We HPWU fans, we call it pottering. I thought it was mispronounced puttering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, well it is. It's equivalent of puttering. Why didn't you go putter in the park?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's equivalent of puttering. And because there's a big event going on now,  we're all out and about, all of us putterers. Elon Musk's neural link. This is basically Elon  reading too much science fiction, but I am all for it. The idea is why are we wearing silly glasses  or in-ear monitors when we could have wires direct into our brain? And who better to bore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a hole into our heads than Elon Musk? Yeah. The first big advance is flexible threads,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which are less likely, no, not highly unlikely, but less likely to damage the brain than the  current materials used in brain machine interfaces. These threads also create the possibility.  Yeah, there might be, you know, less likely. Threads also create the possibility of transferring  a higher volume of data, as many as 3,072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads.  They are four to six micrometers in width. That's thinner than a human hair.  You know, think of it as acupuncture for the brain. You first, Elon. They are looking for  volunteers. Early experiments will be done with neuroscientists at Stanford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We hope- I need you to describe the picture of the rat because they've tried it on rats.  Oh, this isn't the story. There's a fabulous photo. I think it's on the verge. There's the rat.  The rat with a USB-C interface. Good God, that is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That does seem a little cruel. Doesn't it seem well-  Well, at least it's USB-C. Yeah, at least it's not micro USB. That would be cruel.  At least it's a modern interface. That would be cruel.  So they hope by the- they said by the end of the year, they're going to have a human-  we hope to have a human patient by the end- oh, I'm sorry, the end of next year.  Musk revealed results that the rest of the team hadn't realized he would.  A monkey has been able to control a computer with its brain.  I- you know what? I'm hoping in my lifetime, I can put it on a little funny hat  with a USB-C interface and I can lie in bed and be stimulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you rephrase that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are doing things with magnetic resonance that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That are non-intrusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't just put on a funny hat. You have this robot that looks like a combination of a-  What was it? A sewing machine and a microscope that inject these 96 filaments into your brain.  Because he also invented the robot. And if you look at a picture of that, it is horrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It's not going to be suddenly Neuralink will have this neural lace and start taking over  people's brain, Musk said. Ultimately, we want to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence.  Because even in a benign scenario, humans are going to be left behind.  What we want to create is emerging with AI. He said, we're already a brain in a vat.  That vats our skull. So what we want to do is make a connection into the vat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which the thing that he has been arguing is so scary and awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he said it's kind of his attitude. And I think Elon's using a little too much something.  I think his attitude is- these are the Neuralink threads.  His attitude is, if the AI is taking over, at least we can be part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's he having for lunch so I don't have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think the kids call it Molly. To combat the problem, the company has developed the  aforementioned neurological robot capable of inserting six threads a minute automatically.  I want to see the picture. Where's the picture of the robot? Here it is.  There.  It's not really a robot though. It's not walking around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's going to hang out on your head.  Let me-  So cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a robot like that hang out in my groin for surgery.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Is that what arthroscopic surgery looks like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it is now. It's robotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's robotic.  So I'm going to, just to illustrate this, draw a picture of Karsten's head right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where's the bow tie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we need a bow tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bow tie for orientation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, just for orientation. There's Karsten's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  His bow tie is usually smaller than his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? I should probably make the threads be a different color, shouldn't I?  Let's make the threads-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would, when I look like that picture from FaceApp, I will get this done. Because why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got nothing left to lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could put it in my waddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Karsten, you think this is a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is important and needs to be done.  I agree. Yes, we've got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's going to be, you're going to, you know, to make an omelet-  Is it important, Karsten?  You need to break a few eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is it important because of the looming threat of AI or is it important because it's  people who are paralyzed and otherwise incapacitated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are several reasons why it is important.  It is important because people are blind and deaf.  It is also important because movies shown through this would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, imagine, I think this would be great.  Because so far, here's the problem.  And this is, you know, this is the stuff of science fiction where in the Matrix,  they connect the thing to the back of your head.  This, the human machine interface is very poor right now.  Speech is the closest thing we've got to a natural interface.  Typing is not it.  And, you know, and wearables like watches or AirPods or these silly glasses,  they're really primitive.  I think we need, we're going to need, if it's going to happen, we need this, this kind of,  you know, interface.  So yeah, and you know what?  I think within my lifetime, we will perfect this.  Next 20 or 30 years, we will perfect this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I predict you'll become,  whatever company does it, you'll be complaining about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  They've got a monopoly on the neural link.  On my head.  I have such a headache.  You won't need Botox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You won't need Botox.  Maybe.  You may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  You may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neural.  It's all done.  You know what?  You're right.  This is what we need.  We need every head in the country so we can just calm angry people down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The president, instead of having the nuclear codes, he'll have the neural link codes.  Oh God.  Flip a switch and we all go,  so the funniest thing, I didn't watch this, but according to the verge,  the chief surgeon, when he came out to do his presentation was dressed in scrubs.  Like, I'm just out of the OR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little bit of theater in Elon's soul.  Little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's get our picks of the week and we can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, are we not going to do a you know what?  A what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google change log.  Oh crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again with a Google change log.  Play the trumpets.  No, no.  I said I would.  Karsten has prepared it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The trumpeters are ready.  The trumpets will sound.  They've been smoking in the back for a while.  How about this?  Google, this is neat.  Arts and Culture, they do some really cool stuff.  They have made an AR gallery that you can use that celebrates color, the art of color.  You can wander through the gallery.  It's a pocket gallery.  You need the application Pocket Gallery and you put it on your phone.  Is it Rothko's?  I don't know.  You can actually put these things.  We're seeing a lot of this in honor of the Apollo 11 launch this week.  NASA has put a lunar lander on your desk.  Whistler's Mother?  Oh, you know, they say they've got Rembrandt's masterpiece, The Night Watch,  which I have seen in Amsterdam.  I that is if you go to if you get a chance to go to the Reichs Museum and go to the  Rembrandt gallery, The Night Watch is at the end.  It is massive.  And that is that is worth going to Amsterdam just to see.  But now you could do it in your phone.  I can't imagine it'll be quite the same.  But for not everybody can get there.  Well, it's just an amazing painter.  Speaking of AR, did you see the Stranger Things ad in the New York Times?  Where you can go visit the Starcourt Mall and it becomes to life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That means you need to print newspaper.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's kind of a mismatch.  It's a technology mismatch.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you watched Stranger Things yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't.  Not sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not compelling.  Maybe the 80s weren't like a big thing for me.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was my childhood.  So I'm going to I'll reserve judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it did you like it, Kirsten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did not actually like the 80s be moving through them because nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody lived in the 80s like the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like looking back upon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That mall is kind of cool.  It was an old, disused mall that they rebuilt for shooting the show.  And as a result, they got, you know, they put in old movie theaters.  They had a game.  There was a game store that ended up using.  It's kind of cool.  Google tweeted because that's how Google communicates now.  Over the next couple of weeks, we're rolling out a redesign news tab and search on desktop  that refresh design makes publisher names more prominent.  I wonder why and organizes articles more clearly to help you find the news you need,  to which immediately somebody replies, is there a way to revert it back?  Have you have we seen this?  Have you seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, so the problem is Google when they changed Google News the last time,  it became useless for me for researching the show.  So what I have to do is go to Google, search for the word Google,  which makes me feel like an idiot, and then go to the news tab there.  And that's a good idea.  That was that.  Well, but it's not so good anymore.  The advantage of that was that it had the old view that here's one version of the story  and here's other versions.  They've taken all that away.  So now it's just pretty boxes and it's not as useful.  Oh, pretty boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now that's the pretty boxes.  It's useful, but not as useful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google, of course, leads with Fox News because, hey, I don't want anybody to shut me down.  I actually might be a search result for me.  I don't know if you get the same result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also a current story.  Yeah, that's how I do research every week for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, smart.  Do you know about the tennis game hidden in Google?  I lost with one ball.  I know you're a serious tennis player.  So it's in honor of Wimbledon, which, by the way, Federer Djokovic, what a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are all huge Federer fans, so it broke our hearts.  But what an amazing match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody won that match.  That was a tie.  That was amazing.  Yeah.  So, okay, so if you search for Wimbledon scores, where's the tennis?  Is it at the bottom?  I don't see it.  Let me go back and look.  Look at the article again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to the score for your Wimbledon scores.  And then there's a bar at the top.  You scroll it far to the left.  And there's a little ball there at the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I didn't scroll.  So scroll that bar all the way to the left.  Oh, I wasn't scrolling.  Scroll that right there.  That little green ball.  What's that ball doing there?  Oh, I'll tell you what it's doing there.  It's time to play tennis.  Wait, let me turn my slide.  Right and left keys.  Okay.  Okay, I'm ready.  Is there sound?  Oh, this is pong.  That's pong, baby.  And I'm just sped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not over yet, cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh, this is like Fedor Adjokovic.  Okay, never mind.  The first Google messages beta.  4.7 crashes instantly on start.  Just a word of warning if you're doing the beta.  Okay.  And Alphabet's Wing launches an app to manage air traffic for drones.  This is the Wing Air Management System.  Wing is an offshoot of Alphabet.  And the app is called OpenSky.  It's been approved to manage drone flights in Australia where it's free.  So if you're not down under, maybe you won't get a chance to use this.  Everyone, it says empowering everyone to safely access the sky.  Flying is complex.  Through automation and data, our OpenSky platform empowers you to take flight with confidence.  Having crashed many, many, many drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Many, many, many, many drones.  I am all in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's approved by CASA in Australia.  So when you open it up and you agree to the terms of service as I am doing right now.  Boy, that's a long term service.  I should have read that probably.  You'll get a choice of recreational, commercial, or REOC.  Those are licensed drones.  I'm going to do recreational.  Flying for fun or hobby.  You see it's only got the map only works in Australia.  There's no information for anywhere else.  It could tell you what you can do.  Here's some checklist.  Okay.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this control your drone in some way?  I think it's like a flight plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It helps you know what's around, I guess.  We did the emoji.  Oh, one more.  Google Maps now has, I think this is good, bike sharing stations.  Bike sharing was big.  Is it still big in New York City with a city bike?  People still do that, Jeff?  Oh, yeah.  So last April, city bikes started appearing on Google Maps.  Now Asia, America, Europe, real time bike sharing data from a partnership with ITO World  to be able to locate the nearest bike sharing station in 23 cities.  Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Budapest, Chicago, Dublin, Hamburg, Helsinki,  Kaohsiung, London, Los Angeles, Lyon, Madrid, Mexico City, Montreal, New Taipei City, Rio de Janeiro,  the San Francisco Bay Area, San Paulo, Toronto, Vienna, Warsaw, and Zurich.  You will search for specific bike share service.  So you start with the service, but it'll show you a carousel of services and then it'll tell you.  The app, if you use Lime or any of the other services, the app will  show you where a nearby bike is.  So this isn't, you know, you can use the, you probably will use the app because in most cases,  these bikes, you use the app to check them out, to unlock them.  So that's nice.  It's good to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a quick question, Leo.  One more story.  Yeah.  The Nielsen podcast monitoring story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  There's actually two big stories in podcasting.  One, a rumor from Bloomberg that Apple is going to start funding original podcasts.  Oh.  And it's Mark Gurman who's very good.  So I think it's probably accurate.  That would be exclusive to Apple's podcast service.  They have a podcast app now on both Macintosh and on phones.  And this to me is exactly what I would expect from Apple.  It's what Spotify is doing.  They're treating podcasts like television shows and it's because of serial and shows like that,  that have seasons and big rollouts and I guess Apple will give them big budgets.  And even though they're not video, that's kind of a television model.  You know, it's a must-see TV model.  Oh yeah.  I'm watching serial.  I've got to see episode two, episode three.  We're more, we're really, our model is radio.  This is like a radio show.  It's on every week, right?  And that's always been more my model.  And I think almost all podcasts are on that radio model.  Makes sense though that Apple, given their background, they're going to treat this like  Netflix, like they do their own television operations.  We're going to give Sony $100,000 to produce a podcast, you know, and we'll tell them  what it is, the James Corden show or whatever.  So I expect that.  My biggest concern about Apple doing this, you might remember a year ago,  Apple added podcast metrics.  This is how it's going to tie into Nielsen, added podcast metrics to its podcast app.  And so podcasters can get those metrics, but so can advertisers.  The problem is it's limited to people who used Apple's podcast apps or iTunes to get podcasts.  And listen, by the way, you have to listen in the app.  So it's kind of limited in its value to us because that isn't even a majority of our listeners.  If Apple decides to like really double down on this, advertisers could put pressure on us  to use those metrics.  And that's kind of the answer to the second story, which is that Nielsen,  which is the big television ratings company, and with Scarborough, they do radio ratings  as well.  They're going to it's really, you know, the only way I could measure how you listen to  the show is if I had the app that you're listening to, then I would get that data back from the app.  But our audience listens on a huge number of apps as I want them to, including Spotify  and Apple's iTunes.  I want you to listen wherever you want.  An old fashioned RSS.  And download it on your computer or listen on an Amazon Echo.  I think increasingly Echo and Google Assistant listens are going to become a big part of our  downloads because it's so easy.  You can just say, you know, Echo play the play the this week in Google podcast and it'll play it.  So Nielsen realizing that says, well, we're just going to call people.  They already do this.  This isn't, you know, a big addition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is it's not like you're doing three networks.  The sample could not possibly be large enough to find this show.  Yeah.  The odds of finding somebody who listens to this show  through sampling.  Well, and there will be huge pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There already is pressure on us.  The Nielsen has already kind of signed up.  I heart podcast network Cadence 13, mid roll Westwood one and Cabana.  And by the way, all of those do their advertising.  In fact, some of them are agencies.  So it's going to put pressure on us from advertisers saying, well, mid roll has that information.  Why don't you?  This is, you know what?  This is part of a medium becoming mature, but it kind of squeezes people like that.  Yeah, that's my fear.  The little guys and the new guys can't won't be seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll they'll not exist.  Yeah, it's making it mainstream media, but that's what's happened to podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's no longer a hobbyist thing.  You know, you can still do it as a hobby as long as you don't need to make any money at it.  But if you decided you want to make a business that's not a hobby, you can still do it.  But if you decided you want to make a business out of it, you're going to have to become a player.  Right.  That's sad.  YouTube will continue.  That's a good place for people to go.  There will be places that people can make stuff.  You know, anchor, which was bought by Spotify, but anchor.fm facilitates people making shows.  Couldn't be easier.  If you've got a smartphone, you can make a podcast and anchor gets numbers and they  sell advertising for you and all that stuff too.  So you can monetize it.  So it's just the way it's.  Thank you.  I was curious your thoughts.  Yeah.  You know, I have no idea what the future is going to hold.  We're going in August.  We're going to the big podcast movement show, which is the last trade show for podcasts.  It's in Orlando.  Lisa and I are going to go.  We're going to bring some of our staff.  All the agencies we know are going to be there.  I think it's going to be a very interesting time because on the one hand, it's time for a victory lap.  Podcasts now, they're hot, right?  It's a victory lap for podcasting.  This is a true medium.  And frankly, I think is on par.  Notice, by the way, a couple of those companies I mentioned are radio companies.  It is now radio companies, Spotify, Apple.  They're all saying, oh, you know, this is the new medium.  So that's really good in terms of the stature of podcasting.  The downside is it also, you know, I don't know what the amateur podcast are.  I don't know what that's going to do to them.  We've been very lucky.  We've kind of found a way to survive over the last 15 years.  And maybe, you know, maybe that our path is to acquisition by one of these companies.  I wouldn't be surprised if in the long run that's what ends up happening.  It's just it's kind of what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you for one, welcome your new master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if I get a welcome by new corporate overlords, but they need to work for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The whole reason I did tweet 15 years ago was so that I would be the corporate overlord.  I didn't have to modify.  And you can tell if you listen to any of our shows that go on and on and on.  They're completely discursive.  No corporate parent would have allowed us to spend half an hour talking about  language changes at the beginning of the show.  No one toast or toast.  So that had a tech angle.  Toast at least had a tech angle.  It's a commerce opportunity.  So there you go.  You shouldn't have asked me that slowed us down.  All right.  Hey, this was a lot of fun.  Stacey's mad.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not mad.  I am getting hungry though.  I'll be honest.  Yeah, I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you see what I have here?  Oh, is it a...  I have Stacey's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us about this.  This is what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are the Wyze bulbs.  These are a package of four bulbs made by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Now see the lights above me and these lights here.  Now you say out loud as loud as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  Turn off Wyze.  Oh, they're already off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're already off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turn them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  You want them on or off?  They're off now.  They're off now.  You can turn them off.  They're off now.  Do you want to turn on the lights or do you want them Wyze?  Turn on the lights.  Okay.  Okay, Google.  Turn on the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Turning on three lights.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yay.  That was a long way to go for nothing.  Okay, Google.  Set the lights to warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Google.  Make the lights cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  I'm not sure how to help with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's so nice.  What am I saying wrong, Karsten?  I don't remember what the syntax was.  Anyway, you get the idea.  Because these are white, right?  These are like hues but they're not colored, right, Stacey?  The Wyze bulbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're tunable and they're dimmable.  So tunable means they can turn from, I think it's 2700 to 6500 Kelvin in the color temperature.  So super warm to super cool.  And then they are dimmable but they do not work in a dimmer switch.  So do not put them on a dimmer switch.  Okay.  But you can dim them from the app or from Google or Madam A.  And the catch here is that these are four Wi-Fi bulbs that you can buy for $29.99.  Oh, what a deal.  After shipping, it's like $41.  Shipping and tax is like $41.70 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, there's cheaper LED bulbs but they're cheaper than the hue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're cheaper than any Wi-Fi.  So any Wi-Fi bulb that is both tunable and dimmable in just white,  that is the cheapest price I've seen.  Okay, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, Google, set lights to cool white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got it.  Changing three lights to cool white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They look exactly the same but trust me, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here, let's see if you can tell the difference because I'll turn mine to...  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your camera might sense it better.  We have so many lights in here that overwhelm these that it's not going to look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the coolest setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm getting warmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can tell you, looking at the light, it's definitely noticeable.  So cool is like daylight and warm is like sunset.  And so if you wanted to wake up or pay attention,  you'd set it to a cooler temperature, a bluer temperature.  And if you want it to be more restful, can you dim these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can.  See, I just turned mine to the orange setting.  Here, I will dim it.  Here I am.  This is 50%.  And then I could turn out all my lights.  Should you get these instead of the Hue...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not obviously the Hue color but the Hue white bulbs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's my take on these.  You should buy these if you want to play with smart lights.  I actually just did a post in my newsletter last week about how I think  why is the smart company to watch, smart home company to watch because...  I totally agree.  I'm glitching all over.  It's amazing.  Because it's so cheap.  You can play with this stuff without really risking a lot.  The lights, you don't actually have to have the camera for it to work.  If you do have the camera...  Well, let me ask you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does this need a hub?  Because Wyze sells a hub.  You don't need the hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wyze sells a camera and a bridge, but you don't need that for the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So that's another reason to get it.  You just put these in your bulbs.  And if then I have the Wyze app on my phone, I can control them or I can use...  It says it works with both Google and Amazon's Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does.  And it works with IFTTT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one of the things I like about the Hue bulbs, once I have the Hue hub on there,  is I can tell Amazon to look for the Hue hub.  And if they're all on the same network, it'll see it.  And then I'll be able to control it from that point on.  How do I get Amazon or Google to find these?  Does it just see them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just...  When you link the...  You set it up so you link the accounts.  And then with Google, it just found them.  With Amazon, I did a device discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So you have to tell it to search.  And I have controls here, which is kind of nice.  I can turn them on and off from the app.  And would that be the case over the internet?  Or do I have to be on the same network as the bulbs to turn them on and off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you can remotely control them because they are, again, Wi-Fi.  So, yay.  And then let's see if this...  I set mine up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Wyze is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's the right sensor.  I was showing you what happened with the sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it has a sensor?  Because I love that with my Philips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I bought the Wyze Sense Kit and I'm using it open and close right now.  That's right.  And that's 20 bucks.  It's $19.99.  For that, you do need the camera.  But here it is.  Ready?  This is how fast it works.  This is me.  Oh, this is really slow right now.  Oh, it was so slow that time.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But normally it's pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Normally it's faster, but that was like a good, what, seven seconds of latency,  five seconds of latency.  I didn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is cool.  So Stacey's review is on the web at stacey on iot.com.  I think, honestly, I think I'm going to stock up on these.  I think that's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are a couple things.  One, the scheduling is a mess.  The scheduling is not where you expect it to be.  So if you do buy these and you want to schedule them for a time,  know that you have to go to the shortcuts, not the bulb itself.  The bulb itself has weird timing.  I don't know why they do that.  They'll fix all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  WISE is, but this is WISE's story, which is they get this stuff out really cheap  and then they've incrementally improve it.  They just added people recognition to their $20 cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know with a company called xnore.ai and I think I may have introduced them,  but I'm not 100% sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should get a finder's fee.  No, no, I'm just happy that that's this is a Seattle company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Both of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like they've really done a great job of making this stuff very, very accessible,  at least price wise.  And the features are great and the cameras.  There's no subscription fee.  So this is these are these are really desirable, I think products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And record locally if you want.  If you if you want to, you can actually not have it like the sensors won't work  without the internet.  And neither would these bulbs.  They won't work remotely or there'd be no point in having them.  But the camera you can pop an SD card in and you don't have to have anything go to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that.  It does not use five gigs.  It uses 2.4 only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then it has a proprietary protocol for the sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not using a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a sub gigahertz thing.  They're doing it because range and power consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But at that price, something you could play with.  You know what I'd love to see is LED strips and stuff like that.  The additional accessories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would like to see an outdoor camera.  Outdoor camera would be great.  I just bought an outdoor housing for my camera.  So we'll see.  Their Home Depot just put a Wyze smart plug too for 20 bucks on their website.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's as a as a possible product leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty good.  Thank you, Stacey.  And thanks to Anthony Nielsen, our producer, who set this up so we could show you in studio  what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I screwed it up.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, you did great.  I think these are really cool.  And you know, LED bulbs, these last forever, right?  I mean, they're really good.  Should last a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of them do.  Some of them don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.  Sometimes they do burn out.  Every time I change a light bulb in the house, I tell Lisa,  well, this is the last time I'll be changing this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My biggest issue is my radios fail more often than the light bulb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  Maybe that's what's going on.  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis, a number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on.  It was two of them here.  Google made 3200 changes to search last year.  Wow.  This from search engine land.  Always a great resource.  Oh, yes.  Versus in 2010, they made 350 to 400 changes.  All right.  Back in the days of bad cuts.  This was a big one compared to that.  So it's just all kinds of things that they do.  And again, this goes to the notion that show us your algorithm.  Well, OK, you want all the additions to just the API is all I ask.

Transcript:  My pick of the week I already told you about, which is start page,  which gives you Google results without giving Google any information.  And it's easy to install if you're using Firefox.  I've moved from brave because I wanted a private browser,  but I think Firefox is really on the forefront now.  There's including the ability to use start page in the search bar  as a search default search engine.  It's very easy to configure if you go to start page dot com and you got Firefox.  And there's one other thing I want to mention.  Steve Gibson's been talking a lot about DNS over HTTPS.  If it's at the very bottom of the network settings and the general settings of Firefox,  if you enable DNS over HTTPS and use CloudFlare,  what will happen is it'll use CloudFlare's DNS, not your ISP's DNS.  Your ISP, every time you go out and look up a site,  your ISP gets the information about what sites you visit.  And many ISPs sell that information to marketers and other people,  and maybe that's something they don't deserve.  So they don't like it.  In fact, the British Internet Society or whatever said that Mozilla  was the enemy of the year or they nominated them  because they were enabling DNS over HTTPS, secure DNS,  because it would make it hard for the British authorities to filter sites.  Another good reason to use it.  I'm starting to really feel like Mozilla with its sync,  with its features, with its privacy, is my choice for a browser.  If you want to block trackers, cookies, crypto miners, and finger printers,  all the features that a privacy advocate would want are in here.  And I'm starting to think with Brave with its cryptocurrency  and some of the things it's doing.  Maybe I want to go with somebody who really has no axe to grind,  and that is, of course, Firefox.  So Firefox plus Startpage, that's my new default  for searching the internet.  Startpage.com.  Thank you, Stacy. Go eat.  Thank you, Jeff.  Go do whatever it is people of your age do.
