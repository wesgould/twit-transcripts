I just googled with the cloud  Facebook Twitter  Anything happening up there?  Sky Kevin Marx is down to earth, but he is in his garden with a lovely sky behind him. Hi Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know many clouds though. I'm afraid it's pure blue sky here. Great to have you that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and if it starts raining just you know, I don't know you have an umbrella. I think you'll be alright  Not much chance that hit I  Love the orange tree behind you though. Also with us from Canada where it's not quite so balmy  Mr. Matthew Ingram giga-ohm.com  No orange trees in my orange trees in your backyard, but there's always a place for you if you want to come down here  Matthew writes for giga-ohm and both of us have been talking before the show about I think the biggest story of the day  Which has nothing that has little to do with Google actually in some ways might have a lot to do with Google which is Microsoft's  Windows 10 announcement, which we've been covering live most of the day  Just the the the shorthand version of this  Microsoft has announced that it will be giving away Windows 10 when it ships later this year probably the fall to anybody running Windows 7  Windows 8 or Windows Phone  And that in effect what they've been talking about for some time one Windows is going to somewhat come true that there will be  Universal apps that will run across all platforms. They'll be a form of  Mike Microsoft calls it what continuum but it's really like my Apple's continuity that allows you to run apps  Across all of the different platforms and the data the same way  They also announced and I think this will get a lot of attention a holographic. They call it the hollow lens  Which I guess is designed to be used by hollow men with apologies to PS Elliott  The hollow lens is a heads-up display which offers 3d holographic images  In your field of view as you look around is being used apparently now by JPL at NASA  help scientists who are designing the  Plotting the plans for curiosity the Mars Rover literally walk around mark rocks say hey go get that  Here's what a pretty amazing uses  That's gonna get a lot of attention, but I think really the big story is  kind of a revitalized Microsoft under its new CEO CEO such in Adela and  They did there is a Google angle here because very early on at the very beginning  Microsoft it was Terry I want to say Richardson  Was he's the senior vice president for operating systems speaking. He said at Microsoft you're not the product and  I think that's a pretty clear shot at Google Facebook to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way they were cancelling the screw would nonsense they did cancel the screw

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is this is really the new screw gold which is  Not to go after Google in advertising and was snark, but to go after them with better products  What an idea what a concept?  they showed off Cortana, which of course is directly aimed at Siri and and  Google's Google now does many of the same things Google now does and again they emphasized  But it's in a trustworthy way you privacy is protected  Cortana was very a conversational. I know you Matthew you didn't see the video either  No, I didn't know I know neither of you saw the stream, but the demo was pretty impressive  Very conversational of course it's always hard with demos  Yeah, but it it seems to me that Microsoft is looking at Google as a serious competitor and doing everything they can  To bolster their product line in every way they mention a new browser. They're gonna  not exactly a read  Redesigned Internet Explorer the same engine running the same rendering engine running it  But but Sparta Spartan will look very different much cleaner in fact look a lot like Chrome I  Imagine Microsoft loses some market share to Chrome with new Windows users

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing that that sort of bugs me about I mean you're right Microsoft is is you know offering a lot of interesting things in the  Free Windows is a great way to get sort of people onto the platform. I feel like  You know and and you could say this about Google too, I suppose you have to it feels like you have to pick  Someone to get married to you know have to basically be absorbed into a platform and use everything  Right that that platform has to offer you have to have the mobile device you have to have the desktop software  You have to have the and they have to suck in all the data about your life before these  You know things like Cortana can become useful so you really  You have to choose who you're gonna sort of get married to because a lot of these things are not gonna work unless  They have all your stuff and all your objects and all your devices  Yeah, Apple invented this didn't they the whole idea of a complete ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and Google has done their best with Android and Chromebooks to do the same although  They don't really have a desktop operating system, but they have Chrome which is  Certainly a wedge into the desktop operating system, and it's very clear at today that Microsoft plans to do the same thing  such an Adela said  We plan to be cross-platform  Everywhere you our customers are because we're getting a lot of people to be able to get into the platform  Our customers are because we're a customer centric company  He even said instead of having to use Windows  We want you to love to use Windows, but he said that the most the best experience will always be within Windows 10  He also told developers, and this is a really important message  They have been shedding developers the fact that Windows Phone didn't take off  I think you can ascribe to a great degree to the lack of apps the lack of developers for him  He said we're gonna have a universal platform  To write for all the devices and and then the pitch to the consumer is  Cortana and these other things work better is the more you spend more time you spend with Windows devices everything will work better  So you're exactly right. I think all three companies Apple Google and Microsoft are  positioning themselves to be  the universe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Microsoft and I guess go ahead. I mean the main reason I stopped  Being so exclusively Apple was that started to bug me  right sort of the fact that you had to use everything Apple and that certain things just wouldn't work if you  didn't use Apple or  Plus just the sheer expense of buying all these Apple products because they're not exactly cheap  And I wanted something that was more  You know where I could hack together  Networks out of different things as opposed to having to have everything Apple  And they are actually getting better than they used to be but that was the thing that sort of pushed me away  Because it felt like Android was a much more open ecosystem  Is it?  Good question, I mean is it I don't know and certainly when it comes to things like Google now  You know, I use Gmail and I have a Google device and and all that stuff and so everything I use Google Drive and he's Google  Plus and Google Photos and so I am sort of you know, I've bought into their ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that that different? I don't know your your original premise was this is wherever and actually do we add  Amazon to this too isn't Amazon trying to build that same sort of total ecosystem now that they do hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the only thing I could say about Google is they do  They do tend to be better at letting you  Get access to your data and take it with you that I don't know if they're if that's changed or not  But that was a pretty core principle. Absolutely. Yeah, go ahead Kevin. You're a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Low, I don't know if it's at us. Um, I'm not sure. Okay, we hear you now. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, maybe a little bit of typing so I was I was writing the fader. Sorry about that. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry  We point the mic. Um, so what I was what I was saying is that that's the thing is that each of them has has  Is having to build the whole set because they've stopped trying to interoperate which is which is kind of sad  So everyone's building their own cloud services their own hardware their own operating system  their own, you know  desktop  Applications things like that and it's it's it's all a bit odd  Because we've you know, we've had the web as the unifying platform for a while, but they've they've all seem to have said  Oh, no, we can't actually work with each other anymore  Which is which is is odd because it leaves a sort of gap in the middle for  Someone like Dropbox to be the cloud that works on all the clouds  She's which is kind of strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and in fact Dropbox is a great example. I mean, I just said the other day. I've got a Macbook air  I've got I'm running  Linux Mint on my desktop and I've got Windows devices in the house as well. And I was trying to share  folders on on my network, you know, which I control and  It made me want to shoot myself. It's so  Even a simple thing like that is so hard and they've made it hard apples actually made it harder than it used to be  And so Dropbox becomes like a godsend, you know, you literally just put stuff in there and it's everywhere  It's it's as simple as a sort of cross-platform, you know networking and fostering should be or could be you can't really fault them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean  The best way to profit is to force people to use your stuff exclusively  Yeah, although I it is encouraging that there's a there a company like Dropbox  Can make its way by offering a true cross-platform?  solution

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I mean Apple's Apple's argument has always been you know  It's similar to the one you described that Microsoft is making by doing this we make it better for you the user  So your experience is better things work properly  You don't have to worry about you know  Anything getting damaged or any your data flowing to other people because we control the whole thing  from soup to nuts from one end to the other and  You know, that's why the walled garden is such a great metaphor because it's a beautiful garden flowers are amazing  Yeah, and it's really well  It's clean and and no one mugs you and you know  You don't and you can barely even see the walls until you get up close to them and even then you think  Oh, this is such a great garden man. These flowers are amazing  But you know the minute you want to do something outside the garden. It's like you can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say though  I look at Dropbox and then I look at Microsoft offering unlimited storage on one drive  prices dropping at Google  And I wonder what how long my Dropbox is business plan as a storage company alone  Can survive in that yeah, I mean I wonder how much longer there Kevin you're an advocate for open you're an advocate for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know exactly the opposite of what we're seeing here, right? I mean, so that's the thing. I suspect that we're  we're at one end of the pendulum swing and we can have another swing back to the other end and we  The web is still there. It's still an infrastructure for all of this  It's just that these different companies are sort of approaching it from slightly different angles  Google was the one that was approaching it from that angle  But because as as they grew they got more locked out by the others and so they had to build their to some extent  They had to be the only operating system as a defensive move  And they've built them as open source operating systems whether people can use them, too  So the biggest OS in the world may well be  AOSP rather than Google Android and sometime this year that that line looks like it's gonna cross explain what the difference is  so  Android is two things Android is an open source project. That's an operating system for phones  And it's also a set of cloud services that Google provides  So if you have an Android phone that has with Google on it somewhere, which when I suppose this is Nexus  So just as Nexus and that's implied that means that they've signed the deal with Google  They get to use Google cloud services and there are certain which means that you can run  Without that you can't run Google's apps that rely on their server  So you can't run Gmail or Google Maps or  drive or  The app store and so on so a big chunk of the Android functionality  AOSP is Android open source project  Which is all the bits that you can freely create and build your own stuff and Google has been moving bits back and forth between the two  so, you know one of the reasons you get on a non Nexus phone you end up with two copies of everything is that you have a  A  AOSP derived email client and Gmail and you have an AOSP derived browser and Chrome and so on and this is this is  This is if you buy a Samsung phone this gets confusing because you end up with two of everything  And it's like because Samsung has decided okay. We don't want to be fully dependent on Google  We want to make sure you have got some you know, it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just saw a browser benchmark with SunSpider only which I think is a JavaScript benchmark that showed the Samsung  Browser on the note for to be literally twice as fast as the Google browser  And so, you know, I mean it is possible for Samsung to say well we're gonna make better apps  It's not just right not just Samsung apps, but better apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they're plugged into the hardware, right? Right and use all sorts of things that Google can't you know Apple has chosen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to make  Its its solutions barely interoperable. I mean really Apple is Apple  You're not gonna try to use cloud iCloud on any other platform  Google would you want to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nor would you want to but that is a change, you know at the point where Apple weren't the  The ones who are in the league couldn't do that  they had a disk and I just you could you could work use on Windows and you could use another places because it  Influented web dab and there was a standard way of using it  And it was a web server and it was great and I miss it and  Especially as I was paying the money and they delete all my files, that's not very nice  But but no that they've but they've gone the other way and said, okay  We're gonna build something that works for us and Apple and Apple has a lot of good open standards work as well  There's a not don't miss  But it the companies tend to do that work at the point where they're not on the you know  On the largest end of the market  So one of the things Apple did to get itself out of its trough was to adopt  Free BSD call to the operating system and a bunch of open standard stuff at that layer and  built a lot of very good networking protocol stuff and things like that like  MDNS and and you know  The stuff that makes up Bonjour is a set of internet protocols that they they helped establish and there's a huge amount to establish Wi-Fi  They can forget that now, but it was Apple who decided yes  This is really important and we are going to make the base station a quarter the product  Anybody else's base station to ensure that people have lots of base stations and we put it in by default on all our machines  So there's a reason to buy the base station and bootstrap the way up and that  Created the ability for everyone else to follow along and join in so that is Apple is very good at pie at making those choices  Making the integration good enough people understand why they want it and then ramping the industry forward  You know, you can say this you can say the same thing about USB to some extent USB exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think you're right that they did a lot more of that when they were  Relatively smaller not the world's most valuable company and they felt like they had to try harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as you have market share you go screw the other guy  Right. Well as a Jay dog Noonan says in our chat room  Microsoft has walls. They're just not as high as Apple's wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. Well, I think now Microsoft is in that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kevin also has walls Kevin is in a wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin's literally in a wall garden

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the houses aren't very high here so we're not actually overlooked which is nice so  So Microsoft is now in the situation that Apple was then right in a way they flip-flopped  Yeah, yeah, and you know and and Google was a few years ago where they are the  Outsider trying to get people to come back to their platform that they think is great  And so they're gonna have to do things differently and they are that's one of the things that has been refreshing about the last  Year or so with Microsoft is that they've they've been doing things like oh, yes, of course  We support running our software on Linux. You're like great what?  Oh, yes, our cloud will it will support and then its images as well as Windows images and you're like, hmm  This is not the Microsoft I remember and it's encouraging and I'm hoping that they will see some more of that and again  Obviously they restarted browser development with IE and have been doing good work and standards there as well  So I'm hoping we'll see more of that and yeah with the other shooter drop there has been they've been releasing  versions of office and so on for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android and iOS and even before they release it for Windows Phone and Windows desktop  Touch first office came out on iPad is now coming out on Android still is not available for Windows or Windows Phone  That's but that's what Nadella was talking about. He says we're gonna be cross-platform  We're going to focus on what the customer wants. That's nice  But the best experience will be in Windows. Is that the is that the best we can hope for really in this modern world?  I know is there a chance Kevin of  This kind of wonderful idea open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google tried very hard to put stuff out on iOS for quite a long time  And and then at the point where Apple started running interference on them and cancelling apps and they got into a huge fight about  According to the FTC at that point. They said well, okay  If we've got to spend, you know six months getting this into your app store  We're not gonna do iOS first anymore. And I think they swung back a bit from that again and they've you know with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was a market ultimately. Yeah, I know there were court cases, but ultimately that was a market share  Decision Google did that I remember this was Andy Rubin was pissed off about this  But it was ultimately a market share decision. Yeah, we've got Android, but where are all the users there on iPhone?  We need users, but as soon as you have market share on Android, it's in fact, look how Google has treated Windows Phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I mean really they don't exist from Google's point of view. Yeah, no and then that that's I mean, but that's a that's a reasonable decision  You know, that's that's like well there was barely any use of Windows Phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's why my question is is there any hope of true openness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is going to be how Google is with AOSP and I think they're gonna have to  Start support running their stuff on AOSP or they're gonna lose a lot of market share  Which is and you know and to some extent they're already turning a blind eye to that in in China  In the same way that my office used to turn a blind eye to windows being parted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems to me everybody will be a bully the minute they can be the biggest kid in class

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that's always been the case. I mean  I can't remember if it was Tim Wu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't you see my bodyguard the big kid turn? He never mind. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I mean if you're if you're the underdog  It's in your interest to be alright because you're only as long as you're the underdog  Exactly as soon as you stop and in some cases, you know, Google is very open with all sorts of things  But it's not open at all when it comes to search in the algorithm because that's its core  right, you know, it has to build a mode around that and and keep people away from it, but it'll be  Open with other things that aren't as relevant  The thing that that I'm sort of wondering about is it was one thing when we were talking about hardware  So a phone, you know a laptop does your phone work with your laptop does can you you know?  Even one drive or those sorts of things?  That's one thing but if you're talking about things like Cortana and Siri and Google now  They're they're basically ingesting all the data about you that they possibly can from every point of view  Where your phone is what you know, are you in traffic? Have you turned on voice recognition? Are they reading your email?  Are they reading your voicemail and that's so once they get access to all of that  I think that the idea that it's a silo and we're gonna protect you walked into them  That's that becomes more of an issue than if it's just a piece of hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's an important thing to walk to take away from this which is these companies may currently say oh, we'll keep it private  Trust us, but there's there really isn't a financial incentive for them to do that in the long run at some point  You can pretty much assume they'll give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there is in that if they have a huge breach is gonna be very bad for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a breach and then there's them saying we've changed our privacy policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would love to see Google say something like you can take all the data we have  From Google now and delete it from our servers  Yeah, or you can take it from us  We'll package it and give it to you and you can go to a different service and they'll ingest it wouldn't that be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what there is there any incentive them for them to do that? There's none

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get a lot of the data out with takeout, but what you don't get you can inferences, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't then apply it to Cortana or Siri

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't get all my GPS coordinates from using ways, you know for the last two years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no standard for that anyway, you can get all your if you turned on Google location history  You can get all of that. I downloaded and you get as a KML file  But then it was yeah, it's like a gig. Yeah, but then what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it's not like you're you're  Yeah, so I guess my question is Kevin is there any way to convince these companies who are acting in their best interests  Financially  Is there anywhere that convinced them that it is in their best interest to keep it open or is it?  Is it isn't it always the case that from an economic point of view once you're big enough create a silo create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The challenge is with them realizing that that isn't true. It's not true isn't true  If you if you do create the silo, then you then you create fragility and you're you're storing up  Like massive massive problems and you don't see it until like suddenly the sun goes  Yeah, this is the site deaths problem that that you know, oh this is every this is great  They're looking after all my stuff. I don't have to think about it. Wait, where did it go?  Which is exactly what happened to me with IDISC. It was like great Apple's Apple's a big company  I'm paying them a hundred bucks a year to keep my stuff on their servers. I'll be fine  I can make links to it from all over the web and do that and then one day they're like, oh, yeah  No, you we're not doing that anymore. You can download it if you're quick  and all those things are now dead and  Homepage Mac.com doesn't exist anymore and screw you right?  And that actually I think you know, that's just this that isn't some little fiber. I start up that's Apple  And I see other day lack of money just from my corporate decision-making

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was a Neil Dash said his iCloud all of his photos his wedding is his child  All those photos gone. So I photo upgrade  Library not not found horrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's just bad customer service  There's no I mean that's not what we're talking about here a sensible company would not cheese off its most devoted users by the leader

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the problem. This is the long-term argument for open versus closed  You know, yeah, cuz you take it with you. Yeah, you own it. It's the fragility of something is not just is it well designed?  It's also the corporate structures that own it and contain it  And so when if you if you build something that's on the platform owned by a large company that they can take away  then you're building it on sand because they can take it away and  They've all done this they've all deleted things and right and vice versa  Microsoft is actually better at this than but than most of them  Because they have been a developer for a long time and they tend to keep things going for longer than you'd expect  But it's it's it's  You know Google has defeated all kinds of things that we put stuff on Apple has taken things away to  I'm sure I'm sure Amazon at the Amazon at the moment hasn't done it that with  AWS at all  Its business is that but there's the potential that they could do that and they have done things like  Delete stuff for political reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the wiki-leaks stuff down for example, is it conceivable that the open source community could come up with a  Response to this and create an alternative to this. I think they I think they're trying  Yeah, there's certainly open cloud, you know initiatives. I think it's interesting that you use Linux on your desktop for instance, Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and one of one of the things one of the reasons I wanted to do that was I wanted to explore as much as possible of  a more open  Community and a sort of more open ecosystem. The the problem is it's still so much work  You know, it's just and you so you spend a lot of time, you know, it's like building your own kit car or something  It's great  But you can you spend all this time maintaining it because no one could figure out how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2015 will be the year of desktop Linux. I'm I'm convinced it. No, I'm joking. I  Think I think that that ship is sailed

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean I switched to mint because you Buntu was becoming such a crapped up piece of garbage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Loaded with all the stuff, you know the driver we have mobile Linux, you know Android is Linux right?  It is actually the biggest operating system in the world now  Yeah, yeah, I mean Mac is Chrome is Chrome is gubbun to underneath isn't it?  So, you know that there is a sizable set of computers out there running desktop Linux

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that what does that mean from the point of view of what I was saying that can the open source community?  See the risk create a credible alternative this Android is not a credible alternative

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To the problem is the users users in general do not care whether something is open. Well, I mean  Right, but so the vast majority of users just want something that works, right they don't really care whose ecosystem  They don't care what standard it operates on and so if you can provide a totally siloed  Ecosystem experience and it works great, which is what Apple has done  Lots of people are gonna say that's fine. I don't care  So then how do you make them care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe they care when their data gets deleted and the next time the next time they care  But there are a lot of people who maybe it's Stockholm syndrome  But there are a lot of Apple users who have been bitten by Apple's crap cloud services for years who still  Most still embrace it use it and say this is I'm loving this

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, I raised the question. Is there any way that I mean, maybe we should raise the white flag the idea of a  cross-platform  Nobody owns it, you know non-proprietary  Solution, I'm not just talking cloud but just for everything as an alternative to the to the walled gardens offered by Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple and Google can can survive. I mean Kevin knows better than anyone the history of sort of open  Yeah, he's been there  Open ID and you know open this and open cloud and open and and they're they often get certain amount of traction  But they don't get  Sort of mass acceptance. They just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So forget it we should give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do and they don't I mean the successful ones disappear and you don't you forget you don't think about them anymore  We don't think about oh  Open web, but it's you know, we're running we're running open source browsers on open standards HTML and  and  Open-source servers as well primarily. Yeah  So there's there's a there's a huge, you know  layer of stuff that's gone there to the point and and the point is the point I was making is that and  The original thing about open source was it's great for programmers because you don't have to write the code  someone else has already written and  Then there was this interesting interaction which was that if you manage to convince your company to open source software  then  It was great for you as a programmer because you could leave the company and still work on it and that was like great  Well, that's that's a real advantage for me as a programmer  So programmers like that because they meant they didn't lose their like code libraries and things and then their knowledge base when they move  Companies and that that I think that helped contribute to the dynamic interesting  Yeah  But then the thing that then the companies at first were like we're losing all this precious IP then they realized  Wait, you're leaving the company and you're still working on this code that we're running but we don't pay you anymore. Oh  That works for us great idea what a great idea. Let's do more of that  You know to the point where I know we end up with stuff like heartbleed because everyone's running the same code base  so no one's actually like kind of security order on in ten years because  They forgot they were even run somebody already wrote this so let's just use it  But you know that that's that's usually a good thing when it when it becomes a you know  Monoculture risk it can be a problem  But it's generally less of a monoculture risk than everybody running Microsoft's code or everybody running Apple's code or  Everyone to me like it feels to me like the web was almost an accident

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know  An accident, you know  Utopian period well, no one realized how important it was going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what Tim Wu says you mentioned you mentioned Tim with  That's kind of what he says is that in the nascent period of any of these new technologies and he starts with the long-distance system  It is free and open and magical  Because nobody's making any money at it and then as soon as the the big companies come along and they take it over it goes  from proprietary to closed  Now he says that it swings

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right take over as well  the other thing is that he describes is that part where they go and get the government to mandate them and  What the competitors as well and then they become the incumbents?  And that creates the innovation pressure for the new things to occur and I guess that's what I was asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there space for an innovative?  Maybe it's open source, but maybe it's somewhere else innovative solution. That isn't a walled garden that does  Allow users to take their stuff and move it somewhere else, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there always is I hope so we may be seeing like I think if you what I took away from Tim's book  Anyway, was that the pendulum often?  Swings or shifts when there's a new when something new happens, right? So the web is a good example, right?  Is there something new enough is it going to be you know virtual reality is it going to be the cloud or is it going to be?  Automated assistance like Siri and so on that will that will kind of someone will come along at the same time as people are starting  To feel locked into these silos and the two will find each other the need or the desire to be  To have your stuff somewhere else or to be outside this walled garden will meet someone who has an offering that's powerful enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're talking about Google the cloud everything to do with up there the sky  Matthew Ingram of Giga Ohm Kevin Marx of Kevin Marx and  And you note that Jeff Jarvis isn't here. He is in Davos  Enjoying a lovely dinner right about now  And he'll be back next week. But hey, we've got two great people to take his place this week somebody  Where do we find this great hyper land video? Oh, I threw that in so that is lovely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wanted to make the point they would one of the part of Microsoft's and thing was  They said look and NASA is using our VR stuff to explore Mars  And that my hyper land is a documentary made by colleagues of mine at the BBC in 1989 and broadcast in 1990  It's written by Douglas Adams and here's the guy from NASA doing this for Douglas Adams of the hitchhiker's guide and you may recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dr. Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Baker who was 81 yesterday  It peers in this much more sprightly looking as it's the fourth doctor who so this is from what what year 89 Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is NASA using virtual reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really kind of medium resolution  And there's one for each eye we look at those for very wide-angle I've worn these I remember going to SIGGRAPH

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember fighting the dragon at SIGGRAPH with that helmet on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can see about 180 degrees field of view these optics give us about 120 degree with a true stereo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried one and it's three days like look

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I played a sort of 8-bit video game and just about threw up, but this was Jaren Lanier

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the the early days of VR the actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Working here and W industries remember that  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actual not yeah, that's not the dragon the pterodactyl. Yeah. Yeah, so the founder of that's a friend of mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's he's over here now. I saw him over Christmas and he says oh, we're still doing interesting things in this space  Keep it keep your eyes open for  VR and AR so I said I suspect he's he's been doing a lot of work on the optics of it  Yeah, and one of the challenges is not doing this not having these big opaque screens that are across your face  We're doing the thing that Microsoft showed off today where you've got some glass in front of your face  That is about as opaque as sunglasses. I'm wearing  But is able to inject light in from multiple directions so you can get a realistic overlay on the outside world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always thought that was the best way to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but there's a bunch of really hard things to do with that because if you do the the classic  Headset thing like the NASA guys wearing there or like oculus what you're doing is you're putting screens there and using lenses to put them  at infinity  And then your eyes have to relax and look at infinity right and because they're and then you your so you're creating a tension between  your  Your eyes sense of where it should be looking because it assumes that it should be focusing closer for things when it's converging and so on  So your eye ends up with getting muscular strain as it's trying to resolve those things you and you often end up with a headache from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if oculus rift makes you nauseous because of its poor frame rate this thing the frame rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rific oh  This this stuff was yeah, it was very slow. Yeah, but the but the other thing was that um  What they're able to do now with optics is they're able to by having  multiple lenses multiple light sources  From actually produce light that is focused at different distances so they can make it so it is so it's like the  What's that camera called that takes the photograph that's always in focus?  Yeah, it's that same technology of light pipes and having lots of different  Distances you can you they're starting to be able to construct glasses that can actually give you  An overlay that isn't going to give you parallax errors  Because of that problem, so that's the thing  I think I'm not sure how much of that Microsoft had in what they chose to but I think they had some of it and  It's some very subtle and deep optic stuff going on there. Here's the first. Here's the oh no, that's not dumbbaker. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thought I saw it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah the fourth doctor who  Tom Baker in this was the second narrator was what's the Cortana? No, he's he's he's your intelligent assistant  Robert Abel developed a pioneering if I reckon if this is up on Vimeo to search for hyperland  It's worth watching  It's because it gets huge amounts if part of it is a history lesson of how hypertext happened and they be they interview Ted Nelson  In Vannevar Bush and show a bunch of stuff  But a chunk of it is then comes into speculation and what might happen and it's fascinating because the web isn't in it  It's all these things that aren't quite the way they didn't find Tim Berners-Lee  But it's like just before the web happened with all but interesting  The parallel all the parallel universes that around that and it ends with a lot of VR speculation  Which is you know, I mean now starting come to reality as the stuff catches up  So if you've if you've got an hour, I would recommend I remember seeing it way back when this yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what's so interesting about  Technology is the kind of the discontinuity of inventions you can predict things like VR  But you can nope not tell when it will happen and and you can say well hyperlinking might make a lot of sense  But you can't see exactly how it will emerge  This movie was made exactly as Tim Berners-Lee starts to create the first worldwide web

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I remember writing I was writing about business and the stock market for for a newspaper here  And and I was writing about the the big cable companies  What trying to build their own internets? So they they saw the whole thing, you know people  Buying TV shows and people downloading movies and people listening to music, but they each wanted to build their own  System and so like like the the one in France where you'd have to have a specific terminal and it would be run by your cable  Company so the exact opposite of sort of the open internet, but they were building them  they were spending billions of dollars to build these things and  Luckily, you know the web came along and and it got traction before those things did or we'd be right where we are now  Except it would be you know CompuServe instead of right Google Cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are many many universes all happening at the same time. I'm just yes picking one to be in today  Matthew Ingram from Giga home Kevin Marx more to come with this week in Google our show today brought to you by my mattress  Hey  When you get a great mattress, you got you got to tell the people you got to tell the world my mattress Casper  You don't believe it's my mattress  We've got a video to prove it Casper is an online retailer of premium  Mattresses for a fraction of the cost because they don't bother with showrooms.

Transcript:  Noticed you were wearing the fancy pajamas. Yes  those are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  SpongeBob no, no that's sponge Bob. Are you saw me in the SpongeBob jammies? Yeah next time I'll use this  Yes, those are my thirst and how the third jammers  Actually got those  Worth telling the story, but I got those I did a commercial many many years ago for Clark's shoes  a TV commercial in which I had to hang from a bar and  drop into a bed they were showing how she's comfortable Clark shoes were and  They shot it with a soup. It was still being shoot. They're still shooting in video  That's how long ago was super slow-mo camera  so and then the bed would collapse under me and they had all this smoke and dust would come up and  I did about 20 takes but they got me special jammies. That's them still have the jammies. Yeah  Someday I'll find that Clark's shoe ad  Thanks to YouTube it probably exists  Moving okay, so we'll talk more about Microsoft  I think there's a lot more to say it was a very very significant. I think announcement today from Microsoft  But of course, it's very easy with these to get kind of sucked into the reality distortion field  So Paul and Mary Jo will join us just a little later on this afternoon. They're in the briefings right now  We'll have more to tell us about  Microsoft's plans for the future  President Obama gave his State of the Union last night and there was a lot of concern about what he would say about hacking  They had telegraphed that  That they were going to strengthen the hacking laws using the Rico act and racketeering laws to make it really problematic for hackers  He he actually did talk about cybersecurity  In the State of the Union if we don't act he said we'll leave our nation and economy vulnerable if we do  We can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities. Blah blah blah new cybersecurity  legislation  Which  At this point, I think after the Sony attack  Might be easy to push through and maybe that's why  The White House and the FBI were so anxious to pin it on North Korea  Makes it a lot easier for them to get this legislation through no foreign nation  No hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families  And this is when you know, this is BS, especially our kids  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As soon as they mentioned the kids, you know consider the children hacking takes such a toll on our children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when you know  That they're trying to pull the wool over your eyes  So they don't they do want to raise the punishment for hacking they do want to bring  Racketeering into this which means that you could for instance have all of your personal effects confiscated by law enforcement  Even without being charged of a crime simply because you say we're in a hacking chat room  I  Think nobody's gonna oppose the idea of protecting American soil against the you know evil hackers  But this will be interesting to see what the response is to this you any thoughts  No, no  Just me sitting here  Consider the children. I think Kevin's talking Kevin's talking but not nothing's coming out of his mouth because yes, sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is more of it they want they want to opposing things which is the problem and this is the problem of all security  This is like Cameron  except Cameron and  To some extent both Obama and Cameron electioneering now  Obama can't really get much past so he's he's able to go back to campaigning which he's really good at and throwing out ideas  And saying well, here's these great things to do but these guys will stop you doing it  and so he's able he's able to go back to  Proposing things that are slightly less practical, but he is still pushing some of these in security state agenda things  Well, this is coming up in May  I get this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead do can't do Cameron. You've got a British accent. You should do Cameron. So Cameron is he's your prime minister not mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's  He's campaigning to his base  And so he is the conservatives campaign on law and order and so he they are saying  We should not that these terrorists have any ways of communicating that no we cannot intercept  Even though he is a been briefed by people understand this properly and knows knows what's going on  But he doesn't doesn't matter too much if he can be can write the soundbite

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even think he believes half the stuff he said. Um, I I'm not sure that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he believes some of that stuff, but he knows that but also he's saying stuff that will play well to the  conservative base which is law and order and  Terrible foreigners and things, you know  There's a little set of Senate tropes to come out there and where whereas Obama's doing the opposite and doing the things that played at  His base that what to wind up his opposition. So there's there's a bit of politicking in it, but there is some underlying  you know problems here that are  actually very hard, which is how do you decide between the  the interests of the people who want to keep stuff private and the interests of law and order and trying to see what we have and  The answer is you have due process  You have  The notion of the fruit of the poison tree you have the Fourth Amendment you have the Bill of Rights in the UK  There's a whole year the European Court of Human Rights do all this  and  this upsets that the professional spies because they're  You know, they believe that they are above the law because historically they have been and so there is this tension where you get  strange things being you know defended by  Groups because they're being briefed by the spy saying we have to do these terrible things to keep us are safe  and  You know, we have to intercept communications and you know, they're there they can point to you know  Turing and the imitation game and saying look if you hadn't cracked the codes with we wouldn't have won the war  But that in some ways and that's that's that's that's broadly true  But in some ways that's also like the sort of scary mainstream  Propagandizing for torture that we've had in US media for the last 10 years 15 years as we have programs like 24 and  Too many to mention where at some point there is a they use the plot device of this person know something we have to torture  Him until he tells us they're dark 30. Yeah. Yeah  But you know, it's just like alias, you know that did it it's not it's not like some it's not just the dark ones  It is like this is a mainstream trope in  In police investigations stuff as well. So there is this there is this problem that  It is very easy to write these good and evil narratives and say if they're the bad guys then anything we do is justified  And that is that is what what draws this in and it worries me when the politicians are dancing along that line as well  But particularly it worries me for the encryption stuff because in those cases  It's less clear-cut than the torture stuff torture is fairly obviously  Appalling and that you'll you they to some extent they understand  They're defending something completely appalling and therefore they are they have to assume the lack of humanity in the other  To do this so the American sniper debate at the moment is is literally about  Clint Eastwood making a film that presents  All Arab people as subhuman and therefore you can this guy is justified in shooting them on sight  And that that's pretty much the message of the film and it's you know  It's a very well made film and lots of people like it like it and that is not that different a message from  Mainstream, you know war film police film whatever that you have the good guys who  Who are somehow impervious to bullets, but they can they can kill people with one shot?  And that's and you know, you don't think about that because they're the bad guys and it is it is a you know a  Video game worldview that plays out as a media trope as well. And that is that is a more  Worrying one that the encryption one is harder to explain to people because it doesn't map to their experience as much  People do understand that they want their own stuff to be secure  But they do want the police to be able to keep an eye on the terrorists and that is it's going to be very hard  to explain this particularly as  As we get to the point where they're saying you have to provide a way for us to read these messages and the companies say  We've designed it so that we don't have any way to read these messages. That was the whole point of that software update  That's why whatsapp and iMessage can no longer read the contents because we were sick of having to give them to you lot  And it's that and it's doing the exact thing that we were talking about in the first stripe  Which is damaging the customers ability to have faith in that the company is looking after the stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I got to admit if I'm  If I'm in the NSA and all of a sudden, you know  The terrorists are using whatsapp to communicate and I can't see it  That's of concern, right? Mm-hmm. I can understand why they'd be worried about that admittedly  I'm sure the people at the NSA understand the implications of what Cameron called for but admittedly it doesn't seem an unreasonable thing to say  We should be able to see into whatsapp  and if there's and you said if there's due process, so maybe I have to get a search warrant and  And you know go to the FISA court and say I we think that there are two people having a conversation planning an attack  They're using whatsapp. I want to be able to see what they're doing. What's app maintains a  special  key in escrow something like skipjack where  Given due process given a warrant they can hand that key over to government which can then read those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Transactions, is that unreasonable? Part of the problem is that the  Five as a court and and those all those deliberations are completely secret and they  Apparently routinely rubbers but they have to be secret or the terrorists will know what we're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm by the way, but if you haven't figured this out playing devil's advocate here, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think there's a there is a pretty good argument for against  sort of mass  collection of of data and surveillance that that is not targeted at anyone in particular because  Some evidence at least to show that that that is almost completely useless great article in the New Yorker this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Along this line called the whole haystack by Mathias  Schwartz in which he makes a very strong case that in fact  There is no value to mass collection of data that you cannot yet use that data in any way that will help you and  What he uses is an example the fact that we have already known almost every major terrorist attack in the last 15 years  Has been committed by people we already know about and are already watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in fact, Paris is a good example. Those were known  Those people were known to police known to the authorities right and yet still it couldn't be prevented

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The size of the data is not the lack of data is not the problem. No exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's filtering it and understanding it and we just don't have  Tools and I think what the NSA is hoping is that they can just accumulate this data and then eventually  They'll figure out how to actually go through it and find the bad guys  But at least to this point there is no evidence that that has occurred right you'll hear a quote often from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress or perhaps law enforcement saying  Cases there have been 54 cases  At least 50 threats that have been averted because of this mass collection of data. President Obama said that at a press conference  He says lives have been saved but in this article Mathias goes through those 54  Cases and he quotes Patrick Leahy senator from Vermont who says that number is plainly wrong  These weren't all plots and they weren't all thwarted  According to a deputy of  CIA director  Alexander only there's really only one example  Of a case where bulk phone records stopped a terrorist activity one  so  and that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What also there's the fact that most of these stopped terrorist plots in the last few years have actually been organized by the FBI  There was not the NSA not the NSA, but nobody there was an intercept article about this  Which basically they said yes  They've stopped all these terrorist plots except that these terrorist plots involved an FBI informant  right finding some loner and and offering him a quarter of a million dollars to  Go and blow something up and then arresting him before he blew anything up and saying look we stopped a plot  It was like I think you actually started a plot and then stopped it as well  This is what happens when you get credit for stopping plots, it's like we haven't have enough plots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We better find some more plots and stop them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I just don't see how even if there were a dozen cases  Which there are not so let's say there's five  Even if there were does that justify the kind of routine?  you know surveillance and breach of  Billions human rights that we're talking about  That's unprecedented

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  General Alexander is the head of the NSA or former head of the NSA by the way not this guy  He called it and this is the name of the article the whole haystack which is basically all electronic  conversations going on  Not just in the United States  everywhere at all times forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time I think about the NSA's bulk collection unbelievable  I think of I think of that scene in in Indiana Jones when they take the the  Yeah, and they put it in a box and they hide it in a way in a government government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll ever that's where the data is  Legislating for unicorns. I don't know what this is about. I've got to read this here real quickly. Oh, this is the idea of  This  Is good should we play this video this was you must have put this in here Kevin Marx  This is from from Parliament

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This would cause huge problems for anyone who relies on secure online transactions for their banking for online shopping or anything else  Jeopardizing Britain's reputations safe place to do business. Let me let me get out  This genuinely what the Home Secretary wants to do and does she really want to join the small group of countries such as Iran  Belarus moldering Kazakhstan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get that those are the big four by the way, let's go let's go  Let's let's go once more and listen to those which countries are doing this spanning encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Say mold over I think he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Belarus moldering Kazakhstan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boulder Boulder, I don't even know what that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say to my honorable friend that we are determined that as far as possible  There should be no safe spaces for terrorists to communicate. I think would have I love Parliament should be a  Principle of view and it was a principle that the Prime Minister reiterated in Prime Minister's questions today  I would have hoped that that would have been a principle that actually could have been held by everybody across all parties in this House of Commons  Certainly as far as I'm concerned as far as the Conservative Party is concerned our manifesto will  Make it clear that we will introduce legislation needed to restore our declining communications data capability that fellow by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Julian Hubert

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Member of Parliament from I don't know where and security and intelligence agencies  Right right ensuring that such intrusion well that explains a lot. Yeah  properly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that woman is Teresa May she's the Home Secretary  The woman who in fact would according to David Cameron be signing the warrants that would allow them to crack

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Into encryption. So I mean the problem is when she says there will be no safe place  When she says there will be no safe place for for terrorists to communicate that means there will be no safe place for anyone mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Communicate

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because how do you differentiate right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right that came from the from the post  That described this as legislating for unicorns. It says you can say there will be no safe place for terrorists  But it doesn't mean you can actually write legislation  Does this this is you can say we will create introduce legislation that makes sure we have plenty of unicorns in the UK  But it doesn't you can actually make it happen and that's that's effectively what they're promising  That they and so they're being a little cynical about this because they've come up with a nice nice  Formula of there could be those safe space for terrorists, right?  but if you actually want that to be true, you need to  do that through a lot of that through physical surveillance as well as through interception and  just to say that we can take just  To say they can do it purely through interception is nonsense  But what you have to do then is follow that up with you know, look detail surveillance and you know  Planting cameras on people and those kinds of things which is also enormously intrusive and requires warrants and things like that  and part of the the sort of  Reason that NSA and GCHQ have such enormous budgets is if they've if they've they've  Represented to politicians that they don't need to do that anymore because they can sniff all this traffic and do this  Do this without doing that and it should be cheaper if they just invest all this money in building these giant haystacks  So they can sit for needles. What is what about President Obama's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Proposals is that also legislating for unicorns or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I haven't it has introduced a new proposal I hadn't seen one well of course syspas back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whether syspa has a chance of passing is unknown  But that's the the bill that has failed Congress several times that proposes  Sharing of data from the NSA with companies like Google and Microsoft  So that Google and Microsoft could get right in there and help them fight terrorism  That has been turned down several times due to lack of privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the British equivalent has been called the snoopers charter  much better name  That's not the official name, but that's what it's been successfully labeled  If the last five times they're trying to induce into Parliament over two different governments

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I did sound like that Obama was endorsing it he endorsed enabling better communication between the government and companies about cyber threats  That sounds like syspa he had he had said before I will veto this if it passes never did pass  but perhaps he's changed his

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the  The cyber threats that there's a bit of a dance around that one because of the cyber threat stuff  the better communication  Communities and governments about cyber threats was a separate program where they would was talking about data breaches and  Information pooling about that that was that was where that stuff came from  So they may be blurring lines there deliberately to make that to make that use that form formula, but you know  We do a few meetings and things about that and the idea there was there is this problem that  Companies have information about data breaches and  Advanced persistent threats and those kinds of things and it would be useful to share those with other companies  But they don't want to share the competitors can the government be the broker for even information back and forth  Which actually ignores how security really works?  Which is there is a network that shares that which is all the security ops guys at your company?  Who know all the security ops guys the other companies and when some of this stuff shows up  They call their mates and say look out for this one  I think it's just fascinating that Obama  Won't actually work and that's that's you know, the read the way the internet has been secured  Reasonably well so far has been through those kinds of  back channels and  security communities and risks and comp risks and although the security community that we know and love and  It's very hard to reconstruct that in legislative form and the government people know that too  They are they employ people who in that group of people as well  So there's a set of people who understand that and there's a set of people who are trying to build a you know management structure  on top of it that makes it and  That historically has been very hard to actually do successfully if you if you start trying to tell your security people how to share  Things with people that you're gonna have a bad day  Because you will lose you will lose the better security engineers if you tell them they can't talk with people outside the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this what's really amazing is this reminds me of  1984 is what do they call it truth speak where you know truth is lies war is peace Obama says  In order to protect our the privacy of American families  We have to snoop. Yeah, and it's just it's like this. No, though. That's the opposite  It's like nobody's listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've always been at war with Eurasia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly  In order to protect no foreign nation  No hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade tickets or invade the privacy of American families  We're gonna do that. That's our job

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anybody's gonna invade everybody's provide privacy. It's gonna be us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  And also the the the other thing is the shout out there about American persons non-american persons because all the all the  Legislative stuff says oh we must protect because of the Fourth Amendment  We can't snoop on American persons, right?  And which is it you know has a slightly generous definition includes me despite my lack of citizenship because I live here and so on  well, they but they interpreted that to say if  We can assume that more than half this conversation is not American persons  We are allowed to snoop on it. Oh, and then we'll take the whole thing anyway  So that was how that was how they danced their way through that foot at the NSA

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they're also allowed to use a sort of best guess as to whether someone is a foreign citizen  So if you say something if you mention Saudi Arabia, boom your foreign citizen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must be a foreign citizen while I'm sitting here with two foreign citizens. This entire show is being recorded by the NSA  For future reference because clearly I'm communicating with foreigners

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Luckily, the NSA is collecting the non US part and the Canadian and British governments are acting the non US part

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sharing agreement so that's true. So the US  Can connect information on non US citizens and the Britons can connect information on non-british citizens  I think they just great on persistence do because they don't have a Fourth Amendment there  But they have an information sharing agreement so they can share the information that they have on each other citizens with each other  And join the dots up. So that's the that's how they circumvent that particular reminds me of a great novel and later

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sean Connery movie called the Anderson tapes Sean Connery  Creates a plan to rob every  Apartment in a large wealthy apartment building and it and as soon as the robbery happens all the law enforcement agencies that have been tapping  Every phone immediately races all records of this thing being planned. They don't want to know I don't know  We were listening, but we don't want to have anything to do with it  It I should point out that there's an even more  sinister nexus that between Hollywood and  Content creators who would also like to use these laws to protect copyright and there's been no attempt by the federal government to separate the  Interests fighting terrorism with the interests of fighting copyright when they talk about hackers. That's just as much people stealing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  HBO go passwords. Yeah, and we've seen that from SOPA and PIPA and even before  copyright maximalists and sort of you know content  Massive content empires are more than happy to to to cozy up to whatever it takes to get sort of strong  Legislation passed and if they want to kind of foment fear about about terrorists and so on because that's what it takes  They're more than happy to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to add racketeering any act which is indictable on any of the following provisions, etc, etc  Means that you know, if if you share your HBO password with somebody else you can get ten years and they could take your house  And it merely relies at this point  We're merely relying on the goodwill on the kindness of the court system to keep that from happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if you brief the terms of use of a website, you know, that's effectively hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Such a person's interest in a property real or personal that was used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the commission of  Such a violation any property real or personal constituted or derived from any gross proceeds all this goes to law enforcement  In fact, even without an indictment if you're a co-conspirator  Unbelievable  Unbelievable and so this is this is this is the these are the proposals  The White House has put forward  To protect us and our privacy against the inferners and while we're at it, let's just shut down all the BitTorrents to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's gonna be the same as as you know before it was if you had tools that would allow you to break  Encryption on a CD or DVD that was a crime  Yeah, if you have encryption tools that will allow you to protect your computer from snooping by the government that will be a crime

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's it is a crime that section 1201 and  Cory doctor I just announced that he's going back to the EFF to try and get that repealed that was good for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that that's encouraging because he's he was the EFF's international ambassador for goodwill or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did wonderful that basically he would go to all these DRM meetings and  Understand what was going on and write it down and publish it  this was this is  And also like gather all these like drafts and things that  That they were trying not to publish and publish them and that that so that was a big part of like trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stopping this stuff being much worse than it is Cory doctor. Oh and the EFF aimed to eradicate DRM in our lifetime  That's a good goal we pledge before this decade is out  To eradicate DRM. In fact, they even use a rocket ship Apollo 1201  They clearly understand the reference a mission to eradicate DRM in our lifetime. Well good good on you Cory we Cory is  so well-spoken so smart  and I  Agree with him. Absolutely 100%  Although I have to admire, you know, I have to point out that Larry Lessig who for a long time. This was his his his call  Realized that then nothing was ever gonna happen unless we fixed how we finance elections and has focused everything that he can  All his efforts now on on campaign finance reform even creating a pack. This is brilliant  We've talked about this before a pack a political action campaign to raise money to lobby  members of Congress to eliminate lobbying and packs  You got it, you know, it's the only way to do it. Good feel like Larry maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fighting that one sort of dragon was was almost too easy. And so we decided to take on an even bigger  even harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not enough just to get rid of DRM let's  Get rid of corruption get rid of corruption entirely cuz but he does make a point, you know  As long as the Hollywood is spending money on these members of Congress  You're not gonna get anybody to do anything and it's great if you can add the children and terrorism  everybody wins  All right, we're gonna call this episode legislating for unicorns, I think let's take a break  We come back more. We also have a mini changelog some new stuff from  Not much much and I scoured a short change. I have a changelog, but we'll okay good  I'll save that for my my tool of the week  We're talking right now  about  Google the cloud and the Google verse with Kevin Marx Kevin Marx comm on the Twitter  He's at Kevin Marx always a wonderful voice a passionate voice  For open standards and Matthew Ingram who covers all of this stuff so beautifully on giga ohm  Comm always great to have both of you guys on the show Jeff Jarvis will be back next week  He's in Davos probably snoozing right about now  This is this week in Google our show today brought to you by Linda comm a nice way to learn the stuff you need to know  To get as smart as these guys  Maybe there are millions of people around the world use this over 4,500 courses  With topics like web development photography visual design business  As well as software training like excel and WordPress and Photoshop all their courses are taught by not only experts in the field  But great teachers. It's a nice combination. They're shot beautifully. They're not like kind of junkie YouTube videos. They're really great plus  They have full transcription  so if you were looking at a course at Linda comm you can see what each chapter holds you can jump right to a portion of  The of the content which makes it very easy to get exactly the information you need  You're gonna love it. You can learn everywhere too on their iPad app. They just got a new iPad and iPhone app  Android app it works with Chromecast Kindle app so you really there's no limitation  You can watch it everywhere you go. I'm taking a course on Swift  The Swift programming language the new Apple language. That's the other thing about Linda comm  They're fast. They come up with new stuff  all the time  Up and running with the Google Cloud platform. That's a course  Simple Android development tools. That's a course. There's a weekly series called small business secrets. That's Dave Crenshaw is great  He's a he's like a small business coach. It's great course on accounting marketing management things like that. I  love Linda comm and I think it's a great deal because you pay once and  For each month and get everything the run-of-the-place all 4,500 courses and their new courses added each and every week. I  Do fundamentals. I wonder if Mary Jo Foley has studied that I  Have to say we've got a special deal. That's pretty good. We're gonna give you ten days free  when you go to Linda comm slash twig l y n da comm slash  twig you'll get unlimited access not only to every course on Linda, but  Including access on your iOS and Android devices, but you'll also get new courses as they're added each week and they're always adding new stuff  Linda comm you can learn it. How much can you there's Linda? Oh, no, that's I'm sorry. That's Lynn Langett. She that's the Hadoop  I wonder if they have a course in micro formats l y n da comm slash  Twig free for ten days. There's no better way to learn  Than Linda comm we love her  And we thank Linda for their support  Google wants to become well, we know they want to become an ISP. They've gotten a little more serious about  Google fiber and more communities and now  Google wants to become a wireless carrier  exclusive story from the information fact, let me log in because I I pay for the information so I can I  Can read the whole thing instead of the lecture?  exactly  It's worth paying for if you're not not already doing that is she'd let Jessica lesson and her team would do a great job. I  Asked her said aren't people gonna do just what I'm about to do, which is subscribe and then read the article out loud  She says all right  People will subscribe because they want to get access to it  So and by the way they mirror Friday who works with the information has such great context at Google he's often  Breaking scoops Google plans to shake up the US wireless market  He writes by selling voice plans to consumers directly from Google through T-mobile and sprint  So I guess to become an MVNO  Yep. Yeah, it's the latest example of how Google tries to prod incumbents to change their business business to benefit Google  That's what they do with Google fiber show you that it's possible to have a gigabit ISP and make money on it  Google's expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to the carriers mobile voice and data networks. It's code named Nova  Nick Fox is leading in a long time Google executive and  Amir says a launch this year seems likely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes sense in a lot of ways. I mean, I'm I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried it before now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Disney's an MVNO. I mean virgin. I mean, there's so many MVNOs. It's an easy thing to do  One of our advertisers ting is a spring MVNO. It's an easy thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that is a timing issue here because they couldn't at the point when they were trying to launch Android across all carriers  They couldn't do this  Now where the carriers aren't gonna drop Android they can do this. Yep. Good point  It's interesting that sprinting mobile or these carriers already right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Explain to me why sprinting T-mobile are willing to have these third parties lease wholesale data and sell below their  retail prices  offer better plans

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think both of them are struggling. I guess they need to huh, but it feels like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's there's a you know, there's a fixed cost and variable cost  So the fixed cost is maintaining the network and growing it and they want to keep doing that  And then there's a variable cost which is running all the stores and signing people up and recruiting them and so on  And so if they can offload some of that variable cost stuff to somebody else  They're happy to do that because it helps them the fixed cost. That's basically how MVNO stuff works  The other thing is that the reason it's those two is that they're the GSM ones  so they're the ones that  It's actually straightforward to interoperate with as opposed to  Verizon which is weird as anything an AT&T which is which is not quite as weird  But still slightly odd, right? Whereas GSM is like the global standard, you know  The reason you can pull Sims out of phones and put difference in have them work  Broadly is that they use they use GSM and yeah, there are different bands and you have to have different radio frequencies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually slightly more complicated not those prints a CDMA carrier so they would have one GSM and one CDMA carrier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so it's been spent  That's what's interesting about this is it's both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, and I think that's probably why it is both because I think they want to be able to say  Whatever kind of phone you have you can bring it over. You can make some sense. Yeah the risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean as Amir mentions sprint and T-mobile their networks are not as robust. They don't have as good coverage  Yeah, they also ran that's why they're willing to do it exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason that Google has held back on this Amir writes is because they didn't want to upset wireless carriers  They needed them to carry Android phones. Now. It's not such a big deal because what's  You just said that sorry  And the other but okay, then I'll add you just say this the other reason is antitrust  Okay, I think if Google were to come along and say why don't we just buy T-mobile they could do that  But the likelihood of government approval, I don't know might be might be an unknown  So this is a great way to do it and they can and as you point out cleverly  In advance of my insight that now they don't have to worry about pissing off the other guy. You just said it so eloquently  I didn't understand you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't want to piss off the other guys I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think I'd be tempted it wouldn't even have to be less expensive if I thought Google was going to deal with me more  Fairly and have better customer service, but Google's not exactly known for customer service, are they?  No, right, but well, it's a trade-off, right?  so I had a problem with I used T-mobile because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they've actually services their deals are pretty good. No service is good  But a problem last week where my phone stopped working on Wednesday  Just I was getting on getting on the train to San Francisco  And so when I got on the train to San Francisco  I was like  Tweeting them saying oh, hey, my phone stopped working. What's up with this?  They're like, oh try turning off my against like yes  Yeah, what else?  I've also tried to take this thing out and put it back in again. You know, it is not a physical floor  It's a network floor  And then then you know after doing that with the customer service guy said, okay. Yeah, you're right  I'm gonna have to have transfer this to engineering. They'll get back to you within 72 hours  It's like  I  Was like  And yeah, I I wasn't actually going to San Francisco for the rest of the week  So I let it sit for 72 hours  But that got me to Saturday and Saturday was like they still haven't fixed this and they haven't responded to me any further  For up with updates. So I went to the shop and said, okay, give me a new sim now, please  And that straightforwardly give you some and then it worked. So clearly it was  Not necessarily the sim, but the network's knowledge of the sim, right? But it's like  You should have told me to go to the shop you have retail shops for this exact purpose  Why did you tell me to wait 72 hours for engineering to look at it?  So this is what it's one of those like yeah, but thing is Google doesn't have retail shops  So if that happened to me with Google, they would have to mail me one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Erica G and our  Chat room says she has Google Fiber and the service is excellent on Google Fiber  So Google has figured out in a consumer facing business at least how to do it, right?  Presumably that would apply to an

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  MVO know and I wonder whether you know would Google would they be prepared to help sprint and T-Mobile?  With their networks. I mean if they Google has lots of people who understand networks lots of people who they've got tons of fiber  You know, maybe they can actually help improve those services

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intriguing and  Then buy them  Well, I think that's gotta be the ultimate goal is how can we just buy head of Deutsche Telekom was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flying a kite about selling T-Mobile this week. So wasn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they've been trying to sell that for ages remember soft bank was gonna or was that sprint?  Yeah, wasn't soft bank gonna buy them and then they were their sprint T-Mobile merger and  Mm-hmm, but historically the US government has not looked too kindly on these things  They don't care if Comcast time Warner merge. That's fine  Apparently, you know, tell the lobbyists are not as effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but Google buying T-Mobile would be less of an issue  Because it wouldn't reduce the same business, yeah, they're not in the same business  I mean it would it would create vertical integration, which is not a kind of problem, but it's that's that's  They're less worried about these days. I think I'd be all for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sprint not so much not so crazy about sprint

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm I haven't tried spin. I've been on  the other three and  Demobilization have been really good. I like T-Mobile. They don't bill you for stuff  You don't want they don't force you to buy a plan that has it end the point you can bring any gadget to you like  then  They they did you don't get overage charges for the data. You can actually get actually my limited data though  They do throw up you a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't they have a global roaming plan ready doom it's not very fast, but it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's limited to hundred three kilobits, which is good enough for you know  normal like textual stuff  but  You're supposed to again you're supposed to be able to upgrade it. So last time I was in the UK, which was  I'm actually quite a while ago like middle of last year. I thought okay, let's try this upgrade path  So I click the upgrade Lincoln doesn't work doesn't resolve properly  Yeah, no way to know who I am or connect to it properly  So, you know it I think they to some extent they realize that these billing systems are actually gigantic creaking bits of crap  and so if they simplify them then  The customers are happy because they don't have to interact with the crappy billing systems and they don't have to employ people to be on  The phone with them and it probably works out better for them to do flat rates

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what be interesting Google already does something kind of cool with the Android device manager  You'd use that on them all about Android right Jason. We're well, we actually used it when I was hosting twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you did it on twig. Yeah, okay. Yeah that happened on twig. Yeah, I saw it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's very cool. So Android device managers only available on Nexus phones right now  Presumably if Google did do an MVO and oh they would be offering you think they would sell it just through the play store  Would they have?  Brick-and-mortar storefronts, how would they do it? I don't know but the device manager what's cool is it's kind of like the fire phone  Where you can you can get help a live person, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you just hit a button and it asks you a couple of questions and then connects you like within a minute do that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T it was pretty seamless very impressive actually you can do it on AT&T, but I mean never mind, but there's no one there  Well, I'm on AT&T, you know, it still works. You have to have a Nexus phone. It's just it's on the internet. Yeah  That's kind of internet on phones now they have the internet on phones. It's an amazing  Amazing thing that's tiny but it's there the little internet. Apparently sufs Google makes itself driving cars in Livonia  Is that near Moldova and Kazakhstan I don't know what  It's near it's near Detroit, yeah  So I think that's kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that means they're gonna actually be able to test them in snow now. So that's really good. Oh, they didn't work in snow, did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Autonomous vehicles don't work except for California drivers only in California  The goal is to have driverless cars on the market within five years says Chris Irmson director of self-driving cars  For Google. This is an article from the Detroit Free Press  Apparently if you if you live in Detroit, you don't have to be explained where Livonia is it sounds like Fredonia the  fictional country where the Marx brothers lived but apparently is near Detroit or  Elbonia

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Elbonia  That's where all the programmers work in Dilbert

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Within five years, are you ready? That's a 2020. I'm ready. I'm ready  Would you get really would you get one of these and and just there's no there's no steering wheel  Yeah, you just get in the car and you say  Take me home. You say okay Google. Oh, no  We've all seen that Silicon Valley episode with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just realized it could be the problem you're listening to twig and then Leo starts to okay Google take me to Livonia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take me home is Livonia  Right now it's legal driverless cars are legal in Nevada, Florida, Washington DC, California and Michigan  I think though I may be wrong but I remember seem to remember it was for research purposes  Not just you know, you could take it out on the road  It's just you can't just get in your Atenas vehicle and drive around

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Google's gonna have to come up with a like the the one they have now is cute and everything  But I think they're gonna have to come up with something a little more  Jetson style or you know Tesla style for a bunch of people to bother getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean  Somebody I think was Megan McArdle said it's not so much a driverless car as a driverless golf cart  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Asked Ermson about that  They asked about that and he said when you first see a driverless vehicle in your neighborhood  Do you want it to be a big black SUV?  Do you want to be a hummer?  No, you want it?  He says we chose that design because it looks safe and friendly and unintimidating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also that golf carts have different rules about them than maybe that's it  Yeah, so that you know, there are there are categories of cars, right?  I suspect that they're hedging their bets because you can drive golf carts all over the place  And you can drive them on roads in dollars jurisdictions, but they have different constraints on them from  You know cars and trucks and so I think these are also urban primarily urban vehicles, right? They're really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they need to be small for parking and from getting around

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but these have this I think these have a smaller range than the ones that we're using before right?  But that you know the other half of that  Thing is Tesla isn't it?  So to Tesla is building the electric cars that people actually want because they're very nice cars  And they're talking about driverless Tesla's and projection that into the future as well  And the thing is this isn't going to be like a sudden thing is this is you know  The people who bought Tesla rosters don't want driverless cars. They would they want to be had a full control and do not as 16  three seconds or whatever the hell it is, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uber is gonna buy some driverless cars  Oh, we're should so the first place you're gonna see them is stuff like that  I think cabs delivery vehicles and then eventually they'll start becoming you know more consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of key too because the autonomous vehicles that Google showed us all had steering wheel  They were regular their retrofitted regular cars. They had steering wheels and brakes and accelerators these new little pod like ones  They don't have a steering wheel. Well, that was the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the in order for them to be able to drive them on the road  They had to have someone sitting behind the wheel and have a wheel and have a big red case just in case  So this iteration is we're building them without that  But we're building little cuddly golf carts that won't hurt anyone if they hit them. Well, what about the person inside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think there's psychologically this notion that I am at the mercy of this computer  Whatever it wants to do. It's gonna do even if it's drive off a cliff and there's nothing I can do to stop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still like what you and I and Jeff were talking about the question about whether the Google smart car AI  Would make a decision to drive you off a cliff if the only alternative was you're gonna smash into a bus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had some visitors yesterday  From Switzerland and their two sons were studying in the United States. I said, what are you? What are they studying?  They said philosophy. Oh boy, and I said no no, wait a minute  That is the that is the new thing to study because we're we're in a world now where ethicists  People who are you know deciding what artificial intelligence can and cannot do it is a realm of philosophers and ethicists  That's a perfect thing to study right now  There's gonna be a huge there's gonna be a huge demand for people to solve things like this like well, okay  You're writing the software the car is is could avoid collision in two ways one by steering into a bus full of schoolchildren  two by driving the  The person in the car off a cliff  occupant the occupant  So, I mean the ethical moral right thing to do would of course be to drive off the cliff save the children's lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But but that they're prevented by the third law of robotics. I'm the occupant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do? What do you do? Well, you know, there's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These these like throw the fat guy under the train things  And tend to be done by philosophers who don't actually understand physics a fat guy would not stop a train

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they make them so small you're gonna die in the occupant dies no matter if you search for car hit school bus on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google photos you'll see what a car looks like  There's a reason school buses don't have seat belts and are way five tons  Right, it's because if they hit anything the thing suffers a giant battering ram

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The  Cost could be an issue the lidar that these things use is seventy thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but that's you know, you can scale that that's because it's don't make many at the moment, right?  They're coming down all that is, you know, it's it's it's maca optics and  Sensors and okay. There's a mechanical thing that makes it rotate. That's actually what this guy said. He says not made of unobtainium

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you read the piece one of the only accidents that a Google test car has had was when a driver manually moving one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rear-ended a Prius. I think that's really that the the truth and the answer that ethical question is  it's pretty clear this will these will save lives in net because  You know if it's usually yeah six thousand people die each year while texting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that was the point I was trying to make with the Tesla's is that and we've already seen this with cars is that  This isn't a  Once for all change to drive those cars is an incremental change cars do more  These deaths from cars are down a lot because the cars have more and more stuff built in now they have they have  Lane following they have overtaking radar warnings. They have you know a whole set of  ABS systems and things that that can detect what's going on and there's more and more  computation going into the cars to make them safer and  The driverless thing is just you know an extrapolation point on that curve where at some point like okay  Keep following the lanes through that and okay, maybe I'll take over  You know and also parking parking is the one that you can you can just press a button the cars will do that now  So there's a there's a whole set of cars that have  Pieces of this where they've solved a small part of the problem space and the question is can you solve the entire problem space?  And at the moment it's hard and it requires  basically Google to scan the entire road in 3d three times and decide which bits of  permanent which bits of temporary  But that that may change over time as they get better at this  But the thing is of all the things to try is oh, it's not that it's not that higher bar  There's so many people are really bad drivers and and crash cars into things  And so many times that it shouldn't be that hard for them to do a bit better do better

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think there's gonna be about you in cultural terms  There will be a huge upswing in people driving giant gas guzzling, you know, yeah  Chargers and good for the Hummer. Yeah, yeah because they want to maintain control over the  My destiny so they'll pay people to remove all the automatic, you know driving things so that they can drive wherever they want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually have been in the self parking Ford and you would think that that might be a little creepy  It's not it's actually kind of it's really cool  the wheel spins and it does the whole thing and it does it perfectly and  Admittedly that's not the same as driving down the road, but I think we can get used to this idea that the car drives itself  We might even like it  Google is now more trusted source of news than the websites it aggregates  This is something the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos will see this is from the 2015 trust  barometer  Search engines are now more trusted than news sources traditional media on this graph  The blue red is online search engines and the line has crossed and by the way  Online search engines don't just be traditional media. They bit beat whatever hybrid media is social media and owned media  I don't know what these other things are. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually had a friend who used to be in the newspaper business say that he he didn't understand these results  He said how can the aggregator of something be more trusted than the thing that produced the content?  And that's it makes perfect sense to me because if you go to a single news outlet  You get their news and their version of the news you go to an aggregator sure you get news from all over and presumably  It's you get a broader sample. It's it's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Objective I think it depends how you ask it because if you ask do you trust the media then you get a note then you get  A note I trust Google more, but if do you do you trust, you know?  This particular media out of the you're a big fan of whether it's with Fox or MSNBC or whatever it is  Then you get a different answer because people you know people still do like  People buy them the media or subscribe to the media that reinforces their worldview and they will like those ones more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, and actually Emily Bell and I had this conversation about when trust came up before  She said, you know some of the best  newspapers  Probably wouldn't score high on the trust ranking because lots of people hate them because they are continually  Coming up with investigative stories about how they keep going my country or are corrupt and whatnot  So, of course people would say they don't trust them and yet they're clearly  Better than some of the other ones that you know people's fans of Fox News would say oh, yeah  I totally trust Fox News because it tells them what they want to hear but that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you if you use an aggregator, you're gonna see them. I think see them all I think we all use aggregators now  I use aggregate. I don't go straight. I don't go to the New York Times site to read New York Times articles

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in fact, that's whether it's Twitter or Facebook or flip or  Prismatic  All these tools the the the default I think for lots of people is I want to see  Information from more sources  So the idea for newspapers at least that your app is gonna be so good that  People will just download that and then they'll just pay for the stuff that comes from your news organization  It's just it's farcical like people just aren't gonna choose that I don't think or not enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what they're doing is they're saying okay  We've got a you know  They're starting to realize this and starting to say we need to build loyalty and we'll give you things and make you feel special  They were being part of our club, which is things that's something Jeff's been promoting to them  Sure, it's kind of we do here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we're not the only source of tech news by any means and most actually in a way we are an aggregator  Aren't we?  We aggregate news from a variety of sources and it's the commentators that we add

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And actually New York Times has had a fair bit of success with with its app New York  NYT now in which they have content from other places that is selected by their editors  That's a form of aggregation something they used to despise. That's where value is added

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's I would presume the ad value we had which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Analysis commentary and in fact newspapers were the original aggregators. Let's face it  I mean, right took stuff from news wires and all sorts of places and packaged it up for you and gave it to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quick Google change log some new things from Google actually there's only a couple first Google Chrome  version 4 0 is out Chrome 40  I'm on the beta. So my beta is 40 point 0 point 2 2 1 4 point 8 5

Transcript:  a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Handoff now available in OS 10. That's kind of neat material design as well  The new Google Chrome is here the new Google Chrome is here and as far as change logs go  A change could be a negative change the death of Google Glass  Google Glass sales are halted. That's it. It's over  But Google says we're still committing to launching a consumer product  But we're not going to make the glass Explorer edition anymore. That's good because it cost  $1,500 was launched two years ago  the almost two entire years  The glass team will move out of the Google X division. That's their R&D blue sky division and will have its own department  We're reporting to Tony Fidel  Chief executive who was part of the acquisition of next  So that's kind of interesting and I guess this what this says is Google's making a devices division

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting that they're sort of de-emphasizing glass and Microsoft is coming out with this  Yeah, very sort of glass like yeah thing that they're clearly betting hugely on. Yeah  Well, I suspect this isn't a coincidence. I suspect Google got some rumor of that and like, okay, let's let's get this out of the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because obviously the  Google Glass is a very imperfect AR in that it's it's not doing the complex problem of overlaying things directly on the world  It's just giving you a little screen in the corner  And that's that's a sub feature that the Microsoft does  But what it will actually do is say that thing over there and draw a red ring around it and let you go and get it  And that's a much harder problem. And you know that Google is working on that too  And that the reason they're earwalling this hardware is they're probably going to be really bad  In this hardware is they're probably going to be releasing something like that, but  They're possibly being cager about it and then Microsoft has been with this. Well, there's the magic leap, right? Isn't that the thing there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sort of oculus style. Yes. They bought magic. Yes, it makes sense that Google would separate all of these into device a device division

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magic leaf is more like the stuff that Microsoft shows because the Microsoft stuff was built by the people did connect and a lot of that  Is about the 3d sensing and getting that stuff right and magic leap is that piece of it? Not the 3d rendering side of it. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magic leap it was a two billion dollar  Startup that was basically in stealth  Mm-hmm  Raised a lot of money and it turned out they were building  Kind of augmented reality glasses, right? How how close are these to what Microsoft showed off?  I mean, I see the finger commands and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very similar. Yeah, I mean, you know the given the video I showed from  25 years ago is you know, this isn't these aren't that novel ideas  In fact, the pants on a lot of this stuff have actually expired right?  All right, even this is showing a data glove there that NASA guy was wearing in the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it had wires coming out of it right no wires. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the difference is that this stuff is that the  The connect thing and the magic leap thing are both doing  Lidar type things of saying okay, your hand is there your hand is there your hand is there  I can model where your hand is and understand what you're doing with it and therefore use that as the gesture without you having  To actually strap yourself in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think I mean it looks so weird like so they're showing somebody typing on a virtual keyboard  And and and so really it just I mean you're standing there going like this  Hmm, do you think people will accept that notion and just get it kind of used to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People accept a lot of weird things except it type you on glass, which everyone said they wouldn't but there's a physical thing you type it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but doesn't have any resistance. Well, I'm thinking about people looking at you thinking you're such a dork

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would probably do it on a table surface or something. Yeah, and you do it in private I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this better? I guess it's better because it's programmable and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's that finger thing go up? What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone wearing a keyboard I've got productivity in my middle finger and I'm not afraid to use it  I don't know looks painful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That doesn't actually look I guess you stick your hand out and then you can use your other hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay  It's showing you menus on your hands for you to click. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to remember which part of your finger has the

Transcript:  Yet, there's no mouse damn kids, but it is exactly this reminds me so much of so many, you know  fantasy videos we've seen  Apple had the knowledge navigator thing  I mean, this is all kind of in that Microsoft to be talking about this for a while actually  You already have a room opened. Would you like to close existing room and automap contents of room?  Would you like to automap contents of room in existing room or would you like to cancel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wonder why bother being on the couch if you just lie down in bed line, but I don't want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right. And I don't want to have to hold my arm out either  Then it's Wally right you're floating on a levitating couch that I want to I just want to think it and it happens  I don't have to move around. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think the the first thing I thought of when I saw the HoloLens  Was a project that I think MIT was working on years ago because I think they were using  Quake or doom or something like that as a as a model and they were trying to get VR or AR  Goggles that would allow you to play  Quake  Except in the real world so you'd be able to run around and see monsters, right?  Basically hallucinate and then shoot them with a sort of her to a weapon. I would pay money for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd get sick just very quickly. I can promise you. How about socialization? It says oh, don't worry  You'll never do yoga at home alone again when virtual people can appear besides  You  Know I we were reviewing yesterday the Samsung VR glasses that are based on Oculus Rift and use a galaxy note 4 and one of  The toys in there you can watch a movie you can watch it just like on the screen  But they also you can be in a movie theater  You know, there's chairs you can look around behind you. There's the projectionist. It sounds so cheesy, but it's strangely

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's comforting. It's yes because there's also light effects like they they  Kind of thought about the fact that they're watching a movie on the big screen reflects on the seats beside you  So the action on the screen actually illuminates and darkens everything that surrounds you and it's it's very  like normal  Stray talking or I know a cell phone ringing in the corner. Now. Here's something I can get behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it what is it it's a British TV show which is kind of like the Twilight Zone but modern world  and  It they just released on Netflix in the in the US  So it originally came out in 2011 in the UK and then they did a second series last year  I think and they just did a Christmas special this year  but it's a series of  Standalone episodes that are little science fiction stories and they all involve technology in some way. So the  So the second one is the completely gamified world and everyone is  Going around earning earning credits for things that they didn't have to spend on media and other things and so on  So that's the model of the second one. The third one is you have a little AR thing in your head  which it records everything you've ever seen and done and lets you throw it up on TV so other people to see and the  How that affects people's relationships and so on says it's a series of different  It's worth seeing it's dark as hell  It's like it has the same like darkness that the original Twilight Zone has  but it also has and it's it's the presumption is is is you know  Projected for technologies of the kind of things these that's being loved this and these are not they're all standalone episodes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to watch in sequence. Yes, you have to watch the only one I heard you do have to watch in sequence

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you don't you don't okay. The only one I heard about was hackers threatening the Prime Minister and yes  Sex with a pig or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That tends to be very  Dividing episode people either like that or I hate it or and it puts a lot it has put a lot of people of the series  which I'm and  Then you know, the premise is is farcical. But the point is that it's it's it's fast  That's well acted which is this and played very straight which is very British tradition and the actors in it are brilliant  you know, it's  Rory Kinnear who won like the best actor award last year is John Hamm in it John Hamm is in the Christmas special

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Madman, I must admit the first one the description put me off so I have not watched

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a description you you gave sounded fascinating if the description puts you off then don't then don't watch that one  I mean necessarily because it may put you off the whole series  It's because the point of it is it's about  There's actually if you listen to on the media this week for Gladstone interviews  I'm Charlie Brooker who created and he explains the the invention of that idea which came from the 19th in the  2010 election where Gordon Brown went out and sought to a voter and then got in the car with his microphone still on  I remember that in front of that bigoted woman. Yeah, and then he had to go back and apologize to her and  Brooker was surprised that the Prime Minister of the country was so driven by the media that he was forced to do these need  To do and he says okay, how do I extend that into farce?  And came up with this concept for that. Yeah, so if you if you know that context  It makes a bit more sense, but it but it is very much  You know that one is is in that sort of uncomfortable Dario faux territory. The others are more  And it's that that was not directly about technology really that one's that one's about media and people  Yeah, I mean it is society  It sort of shows the sort of the Twitter mob encouraging him to do it effectively  There's that that that thing that goes on that's that's the sort of sense that it's about technology  but the the  The second and third ones are actually very strong dramas and then they keep that going for the for the second series as well  There's that they are they are  Not what the word is they are  Exaggerated in the same way that Twilight zones are there they're in that what if we took this thing and push it too far, right?  But they're also acted and directed well enough that  That they can sustain quite a lot of it. So I think it's definitely worth watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix in the US black mirror Netflix in the US black mirror

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they I'm not sure they've got the Christmas special yet. You may have to I went to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to channel four site and this looks like it's blocked. I couldn't get any video to  get play so  But you can't see it at least the first season on Netflix  Miss piggy and a politico together at last  Wow, and  Oh, is there one more thing in the Google changelog? I forgot. Let me look um, there's those I think three of these are the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they did a new  Google Knowledge Graph there. Yes  and there's this pluses and minuses to this so that they're trying to get you to  To give you more useful information so so they're giving you stuff like  Marking up upcoming events and letting you book tickets from it and provides that directly in search results and  Send them outside. So they're doing a big push on events, which is good  but the way they're doing it technically is a bit weird in that  Instead of instead of marking up the HTML. They're saying inject this giant blob of Jason into the top of your thing  The only girl could read and we'll read that and do this thing. So they're basically it reminds me of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is the thing this is that bar on the right the Knowledge Graph on the right, right so  I just search for Beyonce and my god  I mean you get songs you get her social media profile you get recent posts and if she were on tour  Which apparently she's not you could even buy concert tickets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure he's actually on tour at the moment. Yeah, who's on tour?  Mid sure is on tour, but he may not be big enough mid you're well  Francisco last weekend  I'm like should I go to this? I took it. I'm sure I want to go to San Francisco that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grateful dead. Oh, yeah, the Grateful Dead is reuniting. Yeah, even though one of those dead coming events. So he's playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Halifax, Canada New Haven, Connecticut

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some of some also controversial is this appearance of the social media profiles as well for whoever you search for so  Even if it's a brand so if I search for it not Pixar, but Pixar  This is Danny Sullivan's example on the search engine land not Pixar, but Pixar. I will get their Facebook YouTube and Twitter  Profiles, but isn't this what people want? I mean, this isn't I don't have a problem with this. It's  It's it's though I would someone have a problem making search more useful I don't know do people I thought I thought you said  Somebody had a problem with it  Let's see if I can find some tickets all you can also get maps  If you search for Starbucks, you'll get not only a map of Starbucks, but their social profiles same thing with Google

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so and now and this is important if you are a brand who will has  Added some markup for this  So right so you want to on your if you're a brand you want to on your pages  Make sure you use the markup so that you will get these social profiles embedded  Structured markup markup  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is my markup is one of my hobbies. So I know  The way they're doing this is really odd  So, you know, I'm going to get too much in the weeds here  But the normal way you do markup is you do HTML so you have human facing visible stuff in your HTML  And then you have invisible stuff. That's not for the humans  as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Attributes on that so author equals would be an example, right?  The art the author  So and Google's deprecated this alas, but they used to you put it on your page rel author equals Leo Laporte  And then if people search for my name, it would show a nice  I mean there was it would display it more nicely. I'd love to know why they deprecated it  Yeah, it's well, it's weird, isn't it? Because it used to be a great feature. You'd have your picture next to your blog  I mean, you know, that's hey, that's Leo's there's his picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we all like that and they they decided didn't help people click through things  They wanted them to click through right? So now they're not using HTML. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a  JSON and it's JavaScript. Is that what it is? What is it? Well, it's not quite JavaScript even

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is the weird they're using JSON LD, which is  Jason link data. It's a JSON variant that has some  Break pre-processed directives in it that says this is if things that start with that is a special kind of thing that says

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How to interpret this and translate it. So for instance, if you're an organization you would have at type  Colon organization and then and then it would know okay, this is not a human, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is this is the schema org stuff  But the way they're doing it and so schema has its own problems  Which I can go into it link if you want but broadly it  It defines inheritance graph rather than a set of properties  Which means that everything is a member of a thing of a member of a thing of a member of thing  So you have a place which has a subclass of something which has a subclass of something and so on  So it has that sort of data architect overkill thing going on which is you know  So if you if you look up volcanoes on schema org, they have fax numbers because they inherited that from places  So it's one of those like this kind of almost makes sense doesn't quite  So it's a little over overdone and it's also not  Defined by a very open process  It was it was basically written up by fiat by Google and then they have a mailing list where you can send the suggestions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's very unclear how you add something if the big search engine says this is what we want  They're gonna yeah, you don't have to use a JSON LD. You can also it looks like use micro data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but but the the way thing about the JSON LD is they're putting and Jason into the page  But they're not assigning it to anything, right?  So they're putting a script type here, but they're just putting a struct in there that isn't actually assigned to a variable  So the page can't access this. Oh, wow  It just declares a bunch of stuff that hasn't got a variable name  So it's completely  Only Google can access this  The page would have to pause it new if you get the page would have to you'd have to have some more scripts that would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to write some script to say look for a script with type application

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll do plus Jason and then get the contents and then pause it and it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This surely you could embed this in a larger script, couldn't you?  No, because it's got a different type. It has to be its own. It has to be application LD plus Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's it's this very weird thing of like and this is  there's a long philosophical debate about this, but this comes down to  The is the stuff that you're adding to this  Design to make sense to the people who are looking at the page or is it just for the the the search engines, right?  And the the drawback of doing stuff just for the search engines is that you can say different things to the search engine than you  Can to the page?  That's a big which is a bit tricky and you know  They're assuming that they can make smart enough to penalize people who do bad things with this, right?  But what that tends to mean is the search engines decide whether you're a trusted source or not  So if you look at Twitter cards are like this, this is not quite the same syntax  But it's similar you you dump a bunch of craft in the or in your head with meta tags  That says I'm a Twitter card and this is my URL and this is my I'm this kind and so on  And then Twitter can process it and give you if you paste someone paste that link into a tweet  They'll get a better preview  Except that because that's letting you inject stuff into Twitter  They will only let you do that if they've approved you right so it becomes a way for them to exercise control over the rest of the web  And to some extent this is that same trend showing up in Google  historically Google has been will make sense of the whole web and  present the results as best we can and crawl things and  apply heuristics and AI and  This and this is more of the we will tell you how to mark up your page and then decide whether you're worthy to be  included in the knowledge graph or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ticket the ticketing links are done exactly the same way so and it's not that Google is creating  Links and then giving you a place to buy but the in fact the artist here's an example with Ariana Grande  There the artist would use special markup to show a card that includes on sale date

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Availability and the link goes to your preferred ticket sale ticket site right but the point is that the artists will already have that on the page  So what they're saying is okay. We gave up trying you don't have to go to the page  The artist the artist is happy with that yeah, the point is they're they're saying  We're not going to try and make sense of your page  In order for you to appear in this you have to add this special magic markup  That will then make it appear in Google right and if you want to appear in Facebook  There's different special magic markup that will make it appear in Facebook and you want to put in Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got a third set there's even a comedy event markup. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is schema. You would not believe scheme dog. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a comedy is a different category than music apparently Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what is this is they've got this subclass mentality, right?  So they're trying to they define an abstract base class and then they define subclasses of the things that they actually see in the real  World and it's it's a bit of a it's a bit weird  So I  Can see what they're trying to do, but it reminds me of Google Base which you may remember from a decade ago  Which was a similar idea which was like okay parsing the web is hard  How about you just upload your stuff to Google and we'll use that to  reference to create better data here  so they've and  They cancelled that a few years afterwards because they realized the infue bother to that were the spammers and then they had this like giant  Database full of things that didn't matter that much now. They've the  Where this works is whether in these kinds of examples where they're giving these  The clear incentive is like if you want to sell tickets  Well, we'll make it you'll make you able to sell tickets from the front page of Google before they even click through and that's people  Dash to do that. So that's a that's probably a benefit to both parties  but  Where it's what it's doing is putting slightly more control over the  presentation of the web to Google in the same way that we  Discussing at the top of the show where we haven't having this problem with the different silos doing different things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that actually plays into some of people's  Criticisms about where Google is going with search is and not just competitors  But even users where they're trying to to pull more stuff into their box  From wherever to give you the stuff you want, which is good  but  You know, they choose what information goes in there and they choose  Who it comes from and those choices sometimes benefit Google  Sometimes they benefit someone else and they it sort of moves beyond the kind of purely  You know objective search that people thought they were getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's always the risk as there was with the author tag of it being deprecated and you've spent all the separate doing this  Suddenly Google says yeah, we're not gonna show that anymore and since it has no place on your own page

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's completely lost now, right? That's that's the thing. So, you know the  The micro formats which is the way of doing that up that I favor and I help found so I have I'm biased here  Michael Max works on the basis that  What you want to do is annotate the web page with the smallest possible change  To give the computers a hint how to pass the content that's already there  So rel author is an example of that rel author says this particular, you know  There's a way of marking up a page to say that it has an address book entry in it  We call it h card you can mark that up to say this is the person. This is their URL is their photo  Yeah address whatever else you want to do  But how do you know which one's which well if you put rel author on the link  Then you're saying this one is the author of the page or point to that other page as the author of this page  And that's that's a hint that is it should be obvious from the layout of the page to the human but isn't obvious to the computer  So when you when you have an article on the web it'll it'll have you have the title and the byline somewhere on it  And the byline might be the top might be the bottom. It's usually clear what what's meant by that. It'll say by whatever  By putting the rel author you can say this is the author of the page  Give a hint to the computer and they could pause it and display the author in that way and where that becomes useful  If you go to  Concrete example if you go to Kevin marks.com my site and scroll down to the bottom  There's a bunch of comments there that have been created  By parsing other people's sites that have an h card in them. And so when they when they present the comment  It'll show their face next to the comment and that's that that's that's the indie web way of doing this  so which with we're trying to mark this stuff in a way that  Isn't just defined by one company and but is defined by common practice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So instead of something like gravatars using a third-party service, it's just in their page markup  So if it's yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you know this we look to the people the most one of those problems on the web is little little people and  It'll icon icon plus name, you know face plus name plus link  And so the minimal way you do that is you just put  Class equals h-card on the  Element that contains that and if it finds a photo it's the photo if it finds some text is the name it finds  The URL it's the link so you can do that by adding one value  But if you want to add more detailed ones  We want if you there are six photos in there  You want to say which one is which you can put explicit classes on the elements that represent those so the point  So there's two there's two factors one is it's not designed to be here's a data structure  You have to populate to propagate into the system  It's like here's something you're already doing here's some extra hints to make it easier to pause  But the the second thing is that the information in it is the information that's already being presented to the people looking at the site  So you're not going to forget to update it  so the other problem with this hidden metadata stuff is that when you go to  Change the site you will change all the stuff that people can see  Or it may be updated by another process and you can't tell it's wrong until someone search you on Google and  sees a picture of the other customer of the service that's doing it because  IDs got crossed or something so it  You're better off that this basic principle called dry which is don't repeat yourself  Which is if there's information about something that is being presented  presented once rather than twice because you can present it twice you don't know which one's correct and the problem we're getting now with with  This kind of markup is that if you want things to be presented correctly by Google and Facebook and Twitter  You've got to be three times a proprietary markup in there  If the title in three times put a link to the photo in and you they have different rules about what?  What size photos they accept so you often have to make a different photo as well  I like if your photo isn't big enough Facebook won't show it  If and if it's if it's the wrong shape for Twitter, it'll crop the middle out and make it look weird so there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And rel author is a great example like Google went to a lot of publications including ours and said  You should implement this thing and here's how to do it and you you have to do it because if you tag the author  And connect it to their posts  They'll show up higher in Google and there'll be a little picture of the author and everything and it will help your rankings  Blah blah blah, you know because everyone wants to help their rankings and no one knows what helps and what doesn't so if Google specifically says  This will help then you better do it  So then lots of people did it and then Google was like well  This isn't achieving what we wanted to which is to get more people to click or whatever. So now we won't support it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the Google change log  That was good that was good, I'm glad we got into that although I think microformats is a dim dark area of the web  Well, we're trying to make it I wish I wish you all the best I think it's it's obviously brilliant  It's cool. Does Google not  Acknowledge it. I mean when I search for microformats the first thing I find is a Google page about microformats

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google does index microformats. Yes, but it indexes  They haven't updated we've made some changes to microformats markup as we learned stuff and they didn't and they haven't caught up with that yet  So they're indexing my performance one my performance two has less arbitrary declarations in it  So it's easier to write parsers for but Google haven't updated theirs to is that what Christmas scene?  I was doing a Google and see try to Christmas somewhere else Chris was inside G plus trying to make it sensible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and I know Christa bonus they're promoting open source, but I don't know if they need somebody they need an advocate  Well, was that what you were doing at Google? That's what you were doing. I was doing some of that stuff. Yeah, you're advocating micro

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was doing I was doing some I for my spirits. I was doing open social a lot, right?  I did get microformats into blogger  That was one thing I did nice and I did encourage the search people to index it the time and then they've had done more with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know Google kind of works is there needs to be somebody in there who's advocating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like any company, you know  It's a mixture. They will find stuff from the outside and use that as a  thing to look at as well  But if if there isn't someone making a case for it, it's unlike to get done  They will do is look at the  You know is this stuff widespread so  WordPress WordPress is default templates have microformats markup  Which make it easier to make sense of WordPress when you're parsing it  So there is a large chunk of the web that has this on that that means that that's a useful thing to do  So Google still passes my force from that  Yeah, but there's also there's now a large part of the web that has Facebook markup on  Because Facebook has encouraged people to put this stuff into the show up in Facebook  So the the prisons don't know for Google is do they index the Facebook markup as well and thereby  Cement the Facebook markup as a way of doing it or do they invent their own thing?  It's so difficult when you're the big search engine to know what to do  And you know, I suspect they'll do both. They'll try to make sense of it and they'll challenging them  And yeah, it's an almost a high problem and the point of this the  Part of my performance was us coming up with ways of doing this that didn't involve a separate file  But this other thing was I was writing a search engine when we first started doing this because I was doing techno Rati  And it was making my life easier if we do literally this thing of well  If you put this markup in then your face will show up in techno Rati was one of our use cases for that  And that was you know  Very like the real author thing that you were talking about  And the point of that was trying to do it in a way that was the smallest possible change to what people already doing  so that  The thing that we found was that we were trying to do it in a way that was  The thing that we found is the more complex do you put in this the less likely people get it, right?  and the better chance you've got of  Presenting their search result with some weird strange noise in it because they accidentally put the wrong thing in the wrong place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon Musk is going  Gonna compete with Google but not on the on the ground. He wants to build an internet in space  What a character he's iron man. He's iron man. He's stark  Elon Musk a SpaceX event in Seattle a few days ago says he's gonna spend 10 billion dollars  Of course of other people's love other people's money because he doesn't ever spend his own money building a space internet  The Hyperloop by the way is not his either he's just he's saying we should do this  so  Hundreds of satellites the idea is and by the way Bill Gates tried this a lot of people tried it hundreds of satellites would orbit  around 750 miles above the earth  That's actually closer than geosynchronous orbit  Which is up to 22,000 miles above Earth the lower satellites mean less latency, of course  It would give you fiber optic speeds he says  Well  Depends on what kind of fiber optic I guess well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was a though I didn't see the director announcement with masks. I'd like to hear what he actually said, but I'm mind  He's got red giga. I'm usually reliable about about getting this kind of thing  right and his point was that the speed of light in air is higher than the speed of light and fiber by a factor of  two-thirds  so  Well, I went on a half which been a week which way up you look at it  So we even though they're you know, 1200 miles up they should be able to get pretty good latency out of this compared to fiber  The speed of light in in copper is  Even slower its factor of three there is so it's half the speed again  So it should in principle should be faster through the air should be faster  Right and that's true as long as there aren't too many Hobbes  I'm I suspect is only actually true if you're getting to a server that's far enough away  So it'll  You know, it probably makes sense that they have like ground stations near data centers or something but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is kind of like project loon. It's the same idea, but instead of balloons use satellites  They're a little higher but not much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My plan was interesting. It's like 200 miles 12 miles, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you read that story it down lower it says there's another  Competing effort right I'm a guy named Greg Weiler right called one web. They actually know each other  They're working on two competing  Multi-billion dollar great satellite some money projects. Yeah, it just makes no sense to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DRY is that the acronym?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't repeat yourself. Don't repeat yourself  Well, no, that's this is different. You actually want redundant satellite networks. So we won't run redundant, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  choices Greg Weiler was a  satellite chief at Google  Virgin and Qualcomm are involved in this so they've got some some big money  Is is Elon Musk proposing doing it all by himself I doubt it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it'd be in consortium, but the point is that you know, whoever's doing this  They have to launch a lot of satellites and that's good for him because he's trying to make launching satellites. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well in Richard Branson said that he doesn't have that Elon Musk doesn't have the rights to the spectrum that he'll need. Oh boy  But Greg does like one web does

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting  Okay interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That will spectrum rise is tricky when you're trying to global satellites. Yeah, I think that was part of the problem with  Part of the problem with the reading the other problem with the reading was that it was conceived way too early and it was thinking  About voice. Yeah, but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other medium exists by the way that went bankrupt technology wasn't there though  It was only I think was 60 some satellites. We're talking hundreds of satellites in this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and every time I think of satellites, I think of Sirius and  XM yeah, you know, they both spent billions and billions of dollars blew their brains out building two competing networks  That was a really bad idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I feel like though the the notion that of ubiquitous global internet  Is certainly an idea whose time has come and there's if there's a way to implement it would be great to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it'll happen. Yeah, I don't see why we would want two companies spending billions to do it  Well, it depends competition is good, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know we've got one GPS system, I mean there's there's a secondary one that's not quite there yet  But that's that but we have one GPS system because it was built by the US government for its purposes and then realized that civilian applications  and I  Think there's you know, there is potentially value in more than one  Competing satellite network in the same way as there's value in more than one competing ISP  The question is you know, do you then it becomes a business decision whether they can roam to each other or not  Unless the technology is radically different  but the other thing I think that there's a difference in thinking about  What is this something that you put a satellite dish on your house for or is this something that talks to your phone?  And those are that those are actually very different use cases. Iridium was designed for a phone  There to be very mobile and therefore you had to have this thing that looked like a  1980 cell phone yeah  To have it to be able to pick up the signal and not fry your head  Whereas if you're doing something that's designed to have a dish on your house like a satellite TV dish  That's a different proposition and that that's more viable because you can get a lot more signal through that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do that and then we'll use mesh to get it mobile and we'll be done  And then you and I can go home and and use our hula hoop keyboards. Well way back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Christ when was it 96?  Astra who runs the satellite?  networks for sky over Europe  They added data capacity to their satellites, and I was doing the new media stuff in the UK at the time  So we got to go and talk to them about  Well, I think we helped we were helping to build a presentation then and then talking about  what are possible applications for this and at the time the applications were really crap because  they didn't have much bandwidth left after they used most of it for television and and  Comes that they were already doing so they had this weird ability that you could basically  multicast a packet to the whole of Europe  Simultaneously and in fact, that's what they had to do because they had all these satellites that were pointing down and these dishes  That were receiving all the signal then they had to like demultiplex that and decide who got which packet  so  It doesn't it didn't make much sense for actual, you know  Sending ordinary internet traffic over that because you're massively wastefully sending packets to the whole of Europe  But it would have except that that's exactly what they're doing with a satellites anyway, they've got a TV channel for that  but it will be great for you know, like a  CDN where you actually do want to send the same image to everyone where you want us to send

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft could have used that today for their windows 10 announcement, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could use it for you know, if you've got a software patch you want everyone to have or those kinds of things it would make sense  But it would be very hard to actually  Set the infrastructure up for that. We spent a long time trying to think about  What could you do?  What if you could send a data packet to everyone in Europe who is attached to this thing at the same time and couldn't come up  With any good ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure you should have asked the if you just GCH Q. I'm sure they would  Something  Something you could do with that. We're gonna take a break when we come back our  Our tips of the week Matthew Ingram from Giga Ohm Kevin marks Leo Laporte our show today brought to you by legal zoom  You may say I need a lawyer because I want to make a will I want to form a corporation  I want to get my trademarks. I want to get my life organized, but you know, you don't need a law firm  You need legal zoom. They're not a law firm  They provide self-help services at your specific direction a great place to start protecting your family with a will or a living trust  Legal zoom can help they make it easy. They make it affordable  Getting your life organized can mean taking control your financial affairs too  So starting that business or you know  We were talking on Monday had a great triangulation with one of the three founders of Apple the lesser-known  there was jobs and was neck but then there was this guy named Ron Wayne and  When Apple first started they formed as a company and  Ron said I had to get out because I was liable because it wasn't an LLC or a  S-corporate secret wasn't a corporation  So because they didn't have the sense to create a limited liability company in the earliest days of Apple  They lost one of their three founders and Ron lost a fairly large fortune as a result make that LLC make that it's easy  It's affordable. You can do it. That's how I did it ten years ago and  It I'll tell you it was great advice I got from Kevin Rose. He says when you start twit make it an LLC  At legal zoom calm for more than ten years legal zoom has have millions of people get the personalized attention  They need and if you do want more help, they have a fantastic  They call it the legal zoom legal plan where you can actually talk to an independent attorney in almost every state  These are attorneys they've vetted you can read their profiles online and you can even read the  Unedited customer reviews pick the attorney that's right for you at pre-negotiated very low low rate  So if you you know, you're just starting a corporation you want to say well  Should I can incorporate in my state or in Delaware? You know, you can find out what the pros and cons are in each  if some  Legal zoom again not a law firm but better frankly self-help services at your specific direction  Don't let another year pass before you get your life organized for legal help you can count on for your family or your small business  legal zoom comm  And by the way, if you if you tell them you heard it on twig use the offer code twig  They'll take ten bucks off at checkout and we'll get a little credit  Legal zoom.com. We thank you for your support of this week in Google. I used them. I  Cannot recommend them more highly been great  This is the time in the show where we'd like to give you some tips or tricks or tools  I don't know if Kevin you got something you the last time you were here  Maybe a few times before that you showed us a game that I couldn't stop playing. So be kind

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're muted unmute  What was the game is it was like was it threes or no, it was it was 2048 2048. That's right. All right  Don't do that again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I was gonna show you that  Have you seen link bubble? No  Okay, so I may have to change some settings on this to see this but it's an Android browser  And the the fun thing about it is that you know the bubble heads in Facebook  That it shows for the chat. Yeah, it does that for the browser. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why would I want to do that? So I have a little look at that. So you get a little  Like a little pop-up for the page you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're browsing Twitter or Facebook or the web or whatever and there's a bunch of links you click that and a little  Bubble appears on the side and then you want to read them you click that and you get a little set of bubbles  You can go back to them. Oh  Nino  Look at that. It's kind of cool  and then you can take the bubble and throw it and you can either throw it to  To share or throw it to insta paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm gonna get this because that would be useful because we do this all the time going through stories for other shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's one of these it's a it's a it's a it's basically the embedded web browser view  So it's good. It behaves mostly the same as Chrome  Except that it has this little UI change to the browser that makes it quite quite quite fun and useful  So I recommend that I think it's it's it's free if you only want one bubble at a time  There's a pro version which is three bucks or something that  That'd be five bucks that lets you have access to multiple bubbles and I've I've I tried it out. I thought this is really useful  particularly for that use case of  It's quite hard to do the read later thing reliably right inside another app and  Because this is Android it can hook into the URL thing and give you them at the side  And then you've got the secondary thing that you can throw them out to the to the relay the thing if you want to  So it gives you a way to entry ours the links as you click on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've already downloaded and installed it. I should also add on that Chris Lacey's the developer. He also  Released for another dollar an app called tap path  Basically what it allows you to do is you can program either one tap two taps or three taps on a link to do different things  So one tap would go to your browser two taps would go to the link bubble three taps would go to share or something like that  So they play really well together  Probably already featured on Android app arena had Chris Lacey on all about Android  There you go, this is why you watch all about Android your way ahead of the game

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason of course is not only my producer Justin Halbert  He's also the host of all about Android and Android app arena tap path browser helper by Chris Lacey  Which works in conjunction with link bubble and other apps, but it works really well with link bubble. I've just bought both  It's just getting to be a pricey show here. How about you Matthew anger anything you'd like to give us a plug for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, actually that you probably all heard of or use or have talked about this before but that reminded me of  One of the tools I really like on my nexus and that's and made share it's called so it's a it replaces the share menu  On an Android device and you can create your own sort of custom share menu  Reorder the things in your share menu and then you can what I do a lot is I I'm looking at a webpage and  It's something I want to save dance to paper. I want to share it on Twitter. I want to share it on Google Plus  I want to post it to Facebook. I want to post it to Tumblr  You can you can do all of those things by just clicking checkboxes  So take this item post it to Twitter post it to Google save it to my insta paper and put it on my flipboard magazine  It's it's a massive massive time saver sounds fabulous and it's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's like handmade without the H and made  Share I've been dying for something like this. I wonder if it'll work  You know, it's really annoying the Samsung share menu, of course puts all the Samsung stuff on top and you can't see it  If that would work with that, I would make it a lot more  I would take one of the many pain points away from the note for but now that I'm using a nexus who cares  the heck with that  My tip actually is something new whatsapp  My tip actually is something new whatsapp is messenger service  You we mentioned it earlier because like a couple of other messenger services. They've added encrypted  Transactions, which is fantastic. You can use it as a messenger  A lot of people worldwide use it who are trying to avoid spending money on costly SMS plans  But one of the drawbacks of whatsapp it was available, you know on every platform including iPhone Android BlackBerry  Nokia systems  60 phones and Windows phones, but you couldn't use it in your browser until now and they've actually done this very cleverly  They've created a whatsapp client that will work with Chrome. So if you go to web.whatsapp.com  And I've set it up. It looks just like whatsapp  I actually don't have a chat going on but you would see it you link it with a QR code  So you'll have to have the newest whatsapp version. I just  Installed whatsapp. I've had it on Android. It worked fine with the latest version which was pushed out today  And I was just checking on my windows for my Lumia 15 20 and there's a it works with that too  in fact, the only thing it doesn't work with is and they is  iPhone iOS iOS and and whatsapp says because of restrictions Apple places on the iOS platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I just I just set it up to it was super easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super easy just it was clever way to do it. I thought because you're very much tied to  Your phone number and whatsapp whatsapp uses your phone number identify you and so  This was just a clever way of kind of saying to the to the Chrome browser  It's not an extension as far as I get I'm sure how they're doing this  It's just a web page, but it's a good way to tell the web page  This is the phone number I'm gonna use this with I have whatsapp on all my phones  Which means I have it on many phone numbers. I actually had a friend tell me the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said he was texting with someone and I said why don't you use whatsapp?  And he said because I can't whatever he was using had a web client

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said I can't use it on my desktop. I put that's one of those I use hangouts for my  Or push bullet you could use or there are lots of what mighty text lots of ways to do that  But now whatsapp will do it as well. No, it doesn't see I don't I asked my kids and their friends  They don't use whatsapp nobody in the states  I think really has picked up on whatsapp  But the but but I started installing it because it's secure and I think that that's really great that they built encryption into it  Strong encryption into it. I think they're using the the  What's the technology the red foam guys created they're using that so  It's it's public. It's open source

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Publicly crypto, which we actually have our whole family  I've got three daughters who all have phones some of them are iPhone some of them are  Android I'm Android my wife's iPhone. So we all use whatsapp  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's pretty cool  Actually, I don't know if that's what whatsapp is using now, I don't know what technology they're using  But I'm pretty sure it was open source public key crypto  Of course once it's in the whatsapp app. You don't know what it is. So I  Don't know what if it's  Closed source is always a little tricky with encryption  Open whisper systems is what they're using. That's what they're using open whisper systems  Matthew great to have you as always Matthew Ingram  He scribes at gigaom.com  We really appreciate the time you give us and we hope to have you back soon  Also Kevin Marks in his garden with his birds Kevin marks.com. What are you up to anything you want to?  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  The indie web stuff the market from its stuff is interesting so it's the 10th anniversary of technology tags Wow  That's like rather that's a long time ago  And that was that was one of the first examples of this where we got the people to mark up the web  We're market the blog post with tags in them so that we could  Pass them and present the back to them and that that syntax is still quite widely used  It's used by blogging platforms already to link to the tag pages  Though the hashtag has become a even shorter shorthand for that people know just grep the  hash tag in the hash and the tag inside the post and  But one thing that we've we've added recently in the indie web stuff is how to mark up a tag of a person  Because you this is a thing that you can do in Twitter where you at reply to somebody or where you  In Facebook where you can mention somebody it'll do a link to them and Google plastic if you plus them  It'll do the link create a link to them in the page  But there wasn't a distributed way of doing this that reliably  So what we did was we just used the h-card thing we talked about I'll give you a link to this  I'll stick it in the chat  Find the chat window  What it does is it does the h-card thing we were talking about earlier  Where we were using it for the to show the author of post, but if I want to mention somebody else in the post  Then I can do the same thing of linking to them. I put h-card on it to say that this is a person  And then I can if I put classic was P category. I'm saying this is a person tag  I'm intending this is a tank of that person  and I did that on the I  Did that on my last set of?  Homely website Club notes, so they're all marked up in that way, which means that  And when the when people get mentions from that they can know that I was tagging them in as a person  So at the point when I post it it will send mentions. It can send mentions to the people I've  Marked up in the post and they can know that I've been talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course as always with Kevin I have no idea what he just said but if you  Take another pass through it. No, you're just too smart for me Kevin. Don't even bother. It's indiewebcam.com slash person dash tag

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And well, it's like it's like app mentioning or plucking someone on Google but it's but it's open not restricted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a combination of two. This is it  The nice thing is a combination of a set of building blocks already had so we already had the building block for marking up a person  We already had the building block called web mention for mention for saying I've sent that I've already linked to this page  Here's here's the page. I've linked to you from  so the combination the two means that if someone  Links to me on the web and puts this in  And then can send a web mention to me then I wonder they've linked to me and I can that's really great  Does ever but will this work everywhere? I mean  There's it'll work. It'll well you need to you need to be listening  So you can they they need to be sending the mentions you need to be listening to them. So if they're using  Indie web stuff  then  So I could do this in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My leoville.net, you know  Yeah, no one will send the web mentions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
