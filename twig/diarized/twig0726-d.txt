Thank you for braving your survive that and the bridge  I now have a fear of the letter X  What the  Hickety-hawk is going on  Over there on the Twitter. It is now X comm how much did he pay for that domain?  Not enough because Microsoft and Facebook both on the trademark  And apparently they didn't bother they didn't they because I think and this is Elon to a tee in  His mind he invented X because back before PayPal  His company was X comm he's owned X comm ever since  They merged with PayPal and it was his goal the time to take  Cofinity which is the company that was run by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin merged with  X.com and they named the merged companies PayPal, but but even then Elon wanted to make the everything app  He said it's a trillion dollar idea  I'm gonna call it X comm and Levchin and teal basically forced him out because he was nuts  And if they think  They they said no no no no we're not gonna do the everything company we're gonna do PayPal which turned out be the right thing yeah  And so he's always wanted to do this and I'm sure in his mind. He thinks well, I thought of this in  2000 so it's mine tough noogies. It's not how it works unfortunately  He's already banned in that was it Sri Lanka or Malaysia because you can't have a company with the word X name X  Any porn restriction  Is there if you go to X comm a redirect you still to Twitter comm  But they did rename some Twitter things to X  It's a very weird  ill-planned conversion

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yesterday morning saw Steven Johnson and saw the team that did notebook.

Start time: 1239.68
End time: 1259.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Research all those things to be a Google is selling advertising to businesses. They're not selling it to individuals, right?  That's right. So because so Google really is a B2B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, well Stacey let me try this let me try this scenario  If if Google were to break up not that I'm a favor of that  I'm not because I'm gonna accomplish anything but if they were to break up  The presumption in the past is they would get rid of part of the ad businesses like that. What if instead they said, you know  Google and YouTube are consumer facing and we're not very good at that. We kill services all the time  we'll make that a separate company and  Alphabet  becomes purely B2B  Advertising services advertising sales all of that plus hosting plus research plus those things  That's what I was just I was starting to think that I had I had the notion of Google kind of reversed where the consumer  Businesses are there almost as demonstration projects for what has become their real business. That's my point Stacey

Start time: 1324.28
End time: 1337.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The okay. No that that makes sense and I mean YouTube though is consumer facing but again  It's a I think what then it would do is turns Google into from a tech company to a media  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  well, I do if you want I do if what Google is is a is a search engine, but really honestly if it's an ad  If it's an advertising company, of course, it's a media company  You have to have something to put the stick to glue the yeah, stick the ads to like a stand. It's billboards  Yeah, ad sales rose four point four percent for YouTube in the quarter after I think a couple quarters of down  Yeah, so that's a big deal. Yeah, the other big news Ruth porat who has been the  the slasher  Has a new job  She's the one who's she as CFO was cutting all of the dead weight  At least yeah, I mean, I don't we don't know how the politics works inside.

Transcript:  Users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in  Your browser is running on your computer. They they you know, you trust it right this trust may assume the client environment is honest  About why wouldn't it be about certain aspects of itself?  uh  Keeps user data in intellectual property secure and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it

Start time: 4205.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you  It got described as a as a as a form of drm. Yeah, I don't know if that's accurate either

Start time: 4228.42
End time: 4289.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So here's some examples of the scenarios where users depend on client trust and I think when they say this  What they're saying is when you go to a website you trust  That the website itself is reliable. Okay, you wouldn't go there otherwise. Yeah. Well  But except you do all the time right even though you know  The website might be spying on you in effect with third-party cookies and things users like visiting websites that are expensive to create maintain  but  Those darn users they often want or need to do without paying directly the websites fund themselves with ads  But the advertisers can only afford to pay for humans to see the ads rather than robots  This creates a need for human users  To prove to the websites they're human  Sometimes their chat has like challenges or logins. Yep  So that's the i'm not a robot thing is not a security thing  It's to make sure that that's an eyeball looking at that ad. Oh my god, that drives me nuts

Start time: 4290.98
End time: 4300.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's another example. There are people you can hire to  Like you can screw your competitors over by hiring companies to click on their ads

Start time: 4300.48
End time: 4466.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is more of a google problem than a you and me problem, yeah, this is google's google's problem is ad, you know click fraud  And and you know advertisers rightly say to google well, you know, you say that 400 people clicked that ad but or saw that ad  That's how they bill  But did they were the humans? So that's a this is why google's worried about this users want to know they're interacting with real people on social  Websites, okay. This is more our okay in our  Bailey wick, but bad actors often want to promote posts with fake engagement to promote products make a news story seem more important  Get it get your favorite guy elected  Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people  If websites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment  Okay, here's another scenario users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players  Are using software that enforces the game rules anti-cheat. That's a big issue in gaming, right?  Users sometimes get this a fourth scenario users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software  Because it imitates software like their banking apps  To steal from users the bank's internet interface could protect those users  If it could establish that the requests it's getting are actually coming from the bank or other trustworthy software  So you might say, you know, you're going around and somebody says hey, I just got the latest fast pay app  It's called, you know zonk  and um  Use it and it might be draining your bank account without you knowing the bank should know this is not real  Right. This is not legit  So it's really again getting down to kind of authentication the trust relationship between websites and clients  Is frequently established through the collection interpretation of highly reidentifiable information  Cookies cookies. However, this is all about cookies. It's all about this is google remember google  Did a whole bunch of different stuff remember the code was the flock flock remember that they're trying like hell  To to to support advertising on the web because it's what is it 79 of the business is their money  without pissing off us users  The trust relationship they write between this is all google explaining it  The trust relationships between websites and clients is frequently established through the collection interpretation of a highly  Reidentifiable information. However, the signals that are considered essential for these safety use cases can also serve  As here's the insight some bozo had as a near unique fingerprint that can be used to track users across sites  Without their knowledge or control we've heard a lot about fingerprinting  And this is one of the reasons I thought in the long run google didn't mind losing cookies  Because they knew there are better ways to identify us as we travel around the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  With the web environment integrity api websites will be able to request a token  I guess for me  That that that attests key facts about the environment their client code is running in  For example, this api will show that a user is operating a web client on a secure android device  Tampering with the attestation will be prevented by signing the tokens  cryptographically, this is just  a  Unique identifier. Yeah, this is just a fingerprint  Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester  It is expected the attesters would typically come from the operating system as a matter of practicality  Imagine this will be built into android  post-haste  However, the this explainer does not prescribe that  Okay, so they don't say how it's going to happen multiple operating systems may choose to use the same attester

Start time: 4537.33
End time: 4562.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, we may not be able to opt out. They're building it into chrome. There's a tension between  utility for anti-fraud cases requiring  deterministic verdicts and high coverage and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters or  Non-attestable browsers we look forward in other words. I'm on firefox. I'm on the brain do that  Well, where you can't come in we look forward to discussion on this topic  I wonder could you also use it?

Start time: 4563.40
End time: 4570.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4572.85
End time: 4581.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Transcript:  The goals according to google are to allow web servers the sites you visit to evaluate  the authenticity of the device  The authenticity of the device the thing you're using to visit it with an honest representation of the software stack your browser your operating system  and traffic from the device  You can see why that's something they would want but this is this is what advertisers have always wanted  This is what cookies were being used for offers an adversarily robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution  That's what you were talking about stacy  Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities, okay through attestation  Continue to allow web browsers to browse the web without attestation so you wouldn't have to use it  That's you know, this is this is the replacement for flock that's you nailed it which was exactly cookies, right?  Here's from apple insider maybe something, you know, they're talking to a fifth grader  So maybe this will be a little bit because you know apple users  Uh just wrong  Google might not be completely ready to give up website cookies just yet  But the company is certainly investigating alternatives like a user tracking ad platform built into chrome  That's that's a little more to the point, isn't it?  Uh, and of course, they're dressing it up with all these security and

Transcript:  Here's somebody on hacker news says i've been thinking carefully about this. I really don't want to say it's absolutely heartbreaking  Watching something I really care about die by a thousand cuts  Google will just strong arm them implementation through chromium  Okay, and when banks and netflix etc start using it, they've effectively cornered the other engines into implementing it  You know, it's a problem right now. I use firefox on linux often can't watch videos  All right, for instance, I couldn't watch netflix on it because the drm isn't you know, they they don't get their drm protection

Start time: 4787.08
End time: 4804.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We demonize cookies because we were like the heck is happening because up until cookies  We didn't realize or have something that tracked us forever across everything we did in a place like it's like  The original no, no, no, no, no, no, no the original spec for cookies was not intrusive, right?

Start time: 4804.78
End time: 4866.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It specifically said then firefox or mozilla which created these specifically said there's no cross-site tracking if a cookie is issued  Uh by starbucks peets can't see starbucks cookies. This is where it became a problem because facebook  Being the tracking geniuses they are said well  But if we put a facebook thumbs up like button on every site, then it can be a first-party cookie  It can be from facebook loophole and we can every site that has the facebook thumbs up  Is is for that thumb a facebook site so it can say oh he's on the starbucks site. Oh, he's on the pete site  Everybody uses it right? Yeah, so it's cross-site tracking cookies that are the problem  And you can turn that off. You just turn off third-party cookies every browser does it  And that won't work anymore  And I you know, I mean I use firefox and firefox will sandbox the facebook thumbs up for that reason  It'll isolate it to prevent it from working. So there are ways to do to stop that cookies  Are necessary though cookies. Oh, yeah are very that's

Start time: 4879.04
End time: 4900.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sorry, I agree with you tracking pixels and this is just the problem with tracking pixels. Google says as well  We can't be sure it's human. So we got an even better way of doing it, which is a fingerprinting technique, which  Basically attests you are leo laporte. And you know just like flock they'll say oh, but it's anonymous  We've anonymized it. It doesn't say you're leo laporte. It's just you're 1749333

I was so confused about it. Yeah, I didn't really understand it  But this is their replacement for flock and you know, I think  They are somewhat trying to make it more confusing and obfuscated so that you don't really  They did a good job of that. I'd say and good on people like ron amadio for reading and saying whoa. Hold on  This is a nightmare  It's a drm gatekeeper for the web

Start time: 5018.24
End time: 5069.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So  And this is how google's dressing it up too is it's for security as well  That's why they mentioned you don't want and it's anti-cheat  It makes sure you're a human that it's not malware that's logging into your bank  It's really you see all the good things you get from this  And all that's true and apple's doing the same thing. You know, we want to make sure that the phone integrity has not been breached  um, yeah, you know the play integrity api  Uh tells you if your device has been rooted  Right. Yeah  Um, and so if it's been rooted, it's presumably not secured not secure  Apple same thing if it's been jailbroken. Well, you can't trust it now  um  It it kind of it it but I get that it's good for business. I get that it's good for you  I get why they would say it's not secure since this is interesting. Yeah, well in

Start time: 5070.90

This is a terrible idea  And we got to make sure this fails. He also called it drm, but drm. I don't think really  Says it it really is fingerprinting  Yeah, really is a big difference. Yeah  Uh, all right, let's see what else  A lot of talk about ai safety the white house has an ai safety agreement. I want to hear stacy cut that to ribbons  voluntary commitments from leading ai companies to manage the risks  Posed by ai the only question is did they identify the correct risks?  The companies are amazon anthropic google inflection meta microsoft and open ai  And they have they did not voluntarily  Said for the most part probably  in all likelihood  Going to agree to this  right

Start time: 5206.48
End time: 5258.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They are committing  They are pinky swearing  That they will ensure products are safe before introducing them to the public  Whatever that means sure how  They commit to internal and secure internal and external security testing of the ai systems by independent experts  biosecurity cyber security and broader societal effects will be  monitored the companies commit to sharing information across industry and with government civil society and  academia on managing ai risks  I  Think the devil's in the details though. What are the risks are the risks?  The ai borg is going to take over and will all be in assimilated  Or is it that black people are going to have to end up going to jail in a much higher percentage because they'll be  Misidentified by face recognition technology. Those are two very different levels of right

Start time: 5260.00
End time: 5273.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's the risk side and then there's also how do you get access?  Do you have to be somehow certified or like part of like an established institution to get access?  Do you have to pay money like hey, sir is open, but you have to pay a lot of money to get to it, right?

Start time: 5274.48
End time: 5285.90

Oh, this one's for you stacy and protecting privacy  So they do admit at least talk about it  pinky swears  Companies commit to develop and deploy advanced ai systems to help address society's greatest challenges  Why are you laughing from cancer prevention to mitigating climate change?  Okay, this all it's anodyne. It's all fine. So right, of course

Transcript:  With this and with other like ai with you know  More data coming from connected devices about people  We're talking about trying to regulate things at a very high level and I think we need to move to an outcome-based  Regulation and I know that sucks. It's the worst  But that's like we're talking about basically right is what you're saying. We could say  No, i'm saying we can look forward and saying  We can do a couple things. I think it's important to put audit mechanisms in place to understand what's happening and to whom right?  We could also say look  Because you there there's like when we talk about cyber sick or  Not having open models. There are cases where we don't want our models and weights to be open  There are cases when we do okay, we need to actually go in and establish  Probably not through legislation or probably be a regulatory thing and every government body probably will have to figure this out on their own  Like what matters for their for whatever their jurisdiction expertise?  But we're going to have to make those rules  on a  Not a case-by-case basis, but on a  Maybe industry industry specific basis, maybe it'll be like  And I I think this is going to be really hard for us  Especially because we have a congress that can't act and we have regulatory bodies that are really beholden to the companies

Start time: 5643.98

Transcript:  Seen what happens? I remember in the early days of the internet that congress is reluctant to regulate it  Remember amazon didn't pay sales tax right for a long time because it was a nascent technology and let's not regulate it  Let's see how the baby develops before  We tie it down with wasn't wrong. I think it wasn't wrong as long as you're willing to regulate later  Eventually amazon did end up paying sales taxes in every state

Transcript:  I think that's the wrong way to go about something like this for two reasons  One this is already infiltrating ai is not new. I'm so sorry to tell you all this  We have been  We've been making data driven and analytics based decisions for quite some time  and so  One we have a sense of where the problems are we have actually seen them so now  In probably a couple years ago was the time to start and then two the big issue is it takes us so long to make regulations  The ftc saw this happening in 2013. They called for congress  Actually, it was 2015 when they issued the report they started the report in 2013 they called for  Regulations around ai we are 10 years later  and we've got nothing and I don't see it happening so  And it's fine to be like, oh, we'll let it go for a while but  Technology moves much faster legislation takes much longer and it also has a greater impact on people's lives  and  So I don't think that's an okay thing to say anymore or to even  a spouse really

Start time: 5739.26
End time: 5758.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But also stacey, isn't it?  the case  Given all of that to think that the legislation and regulation can be very specific  is  probably  Not possible and we need frameworks to more flexible frameworks to regulate in response to things that happen as they happen

That's what they're doing  I mean, I don't want them to rush because I don't think we're in a rush. They're not  Yeah, well, I know they're not they're not rushing to do anything except find ufos. Well, thank goodness. She's um  Here's a great article which I think jeff put in  Let's just add this to the stew  This is right up your bailey wick  Chat there was a great bailey wick in the art. He's a fine attorney stew bailey wick of bailey wick corpora and jones. I remember him  Nature magazine  Uh article about chat gpt. The title does not tell you what it's about that what it's really saying is  And something we've said a long time ai can do some things really surprisingly well and other things it's terrible at right, right  This isn't news to any of us in a test consisting of a series of brightly colored blocks arranged on a screen  Most people can spot the connecting patterns  chat gpt 4 and the search engine bing  Get barely one third of the puzzles right in one category of patterns as little as three percent in other words completely baffled  in another  Uh  It goes on to talk, uh about the two camps  And this this is why I bring this up because this is relevant to regulation if we can't even understand what it's doing  Or how it works. How are you going to regulate it?  So  There are two camps of researchers according to this nature article that have opposing views about what's going on under the hood  Of llms and they're quoting a cognitive scientist a scientist at harvard tomer ulman  Some attribute the algorithm's achievements to glimmers of reasoning  No  Or understanding says professor ulman others including ulman himself  Are much more cautious. There are very good smart people on all sides of this debate  The reason for the split he says is lack of conclusive evidence supporting either opinion  There's there's no there's no way of knowing what's going on inside. It is kind of a black box, but  Tests like that those logic puzzles can really reveal the differences between  humans and ai systems

Now if a hummingbird had built an ai it would have different tests and I know you're like hummingbirds can't build. Yeah  where does that come from?  I i'm just the point is like  Where'd that come from?  We're we're measuring we're assuming these things think like we do but they don't they think like something completely different

Transcript:  Yeah, you know you take people off the street and say is this an ai or not?  Okay, but if you take an somebody who knows what questions to ask they can quickly break an ai  An ai by taking advantage of known weaknesses of the system  so, uh, they're quoting a  Guy named charlotte. Let me see what his where he françois chalet software engineer at google based in seattle  Uh charlotte says he'd find it easy to detect an llm by taking advantage of known weaknesses of the system  If you put me in a situation where you ask me am I chatting to an llm right now?  I would definitely be able to tell you  But that's because he's trained as opposed to the somebody off the street  The key is he says to take the llm outside of its comfort zone  Give it scenarios that are variations on ones the llm will have seen a lot in its training data  In many cases the llm answers by spitting out words that are most likely to be associated  With a question and knows the answer to rather this is where that hallucination comes in rather than the correct answer to something  That's related, but not the same  Anyway, it's very interesting it but the the reason I bring it up is is this article in nature kind of  Tells me why it's hard to regulate this because we don't know  What are we what are we trying to prevent you can't make a regulation and unless you know what's against the right

You say to you don't need to identify the ai you say hey if you're you  say to a police state police municipality or you  you say hey when you're using this for you know, it either for evidence or to  Bring a person in you have to disclose it in the warrant  Yeah, you have to disclose you can't do that secret.

Transcript:  protections, is that what you're you have to build in a person you have to build in  a system where people make  Judgments and then have the enforcement power, but then doesn't that put you right back to where you were before you had ai  Yeah, it kind of does it basically well no it still speeds things up right you still have a tool  You still have a tool but you you can't you could never I mean you would never outsource  Manufacturing completely without any qa  On a product line right this is the people are the qa so you can speed things up  You need methodology for that qa, right?  Yeah, so that's the sort of thing congress needs to give agencies power  To develop that qa and then the ability to enforce whatever the regulatory agencies deemed to be the appropriate outcomes  Right because those people are experts. We can't let congress get into the nitty-gritty because that's not what congress is good at  There and and that's that's and right now we've got congress like wanting to be involved because it's sexy and it's fun  But they don't actually want to make the hard decisions  They want to pump that to the regulatory agency and they should you will approve this latest action from the ftc

I could go to microsoft office and make up deceptive stuff  The the intermediary of the tool in either case  Is not liable and if what what I think you would argue next is what if I didn't know like a schmuck lawyer  And it made up stuff. Well as the judge made clear  He had multiple opportunities to just google these cases and find out that they weren't true  And that's where the the liability lie. That's why he paid maybe and maybe though. Yeah, and and there's such a thing is like

Transcript:  What?  Pushed the button  Our show today we're gonna take a break and when we come back we will get pics and stuff  Our show they brought to you by fast mail. Oh, I love fast mouse  How many times have I said this if email is important to you do not use free email?  You get no support  You're not the customer you're the product with fast mail email works for you the best support in the world  They treat you as a customer to be serviced and supported  And cared for not as a product to be exploited no advertising  In fact the anti-spam features of fast mail are second to none. It's actually the reason for a long time. I  I would have my mail go through gmail just for the anti-spam and then into fast mail  I've been using fast mail for more than a decade. I finally just said I don't need google anymore fast mail  There's a better job fast mail uses mail a sieve and you can of course use the automatic settings very easy  But it's very powerful  I actually have a bunch of code that I use for instance  If an email is in french or chinese, I don't want it. I don't want it  Things like that, right? Because I can't read it. I don't know what it means the point and because my last name is leport  I get a lot of french stuff. Yeah  But that's a simple sieve command and it's very easy  If you like using your email client, of course, you can keep using it fast mail is real imap  In fact, they they are part of the open source community. They use the cyrus  Imap server and they contribute back to it  In fact, really fast mail is a leader  In the internet community. They are very active creating new standards for email new authentication settings  Things that will end up being in all of our email often start at fast mail  If you want to use their app, they have an app on ios or android. I stopped using anybody else's apps. It's fantastic  They also have a web app so you get your choice  You can get your mail any way you want the fast mail web app has quick settings  Which makes it easy to install a new theme or switch between  Dark mode and dark mode, baby change your text size without leaving the fast mail screen  So, you know exactly how it's going to look. Uh, you can create a new oh, I love the mast email addresses. So this works  Uh standalone or if you're using a bit warden our sponsor bit warden or one password  When you create a password for a site fast mail will create a new unique email address  Which doubles the security right because they'd have to know that unique email address as well as the password and that address  is unique for every  Company everything you sign up which is a great way of finding out if they're selling that address on right? Yep  You can show or hide your reading pane. You can switch between folders and labels. Well, this is another thing  You know gmail isn't real. Uh imap it uses labels  Imap uses folders some people prefer labels. You can switch back and forth  You can use either one on fast mail. They support both you can auto save contacts  I do that that way if I have an email conversation going on that person doesn't go into spam  It goes into my important folder because I say everything everybody in my contacts  That sends me an email that should go in an important folder because I know them right at the very least that should go in important  Of course, I have a vip folder so mail from my mom and my wife and my daughter automatically go there and me  And of course aunt pruett's email goes in there and you have your own folder. It's called  ignore, uh, no, no, i'm just teasing you you go into vip  Absolutely  Uh, and in fact, I even see a little picture of amp because it supports services like a gravatar so puts that right in there  Uh, I use it for my calendars and contacts too. Forget google. I've got it all syncing with fast mail notes, too  It's great total privacy  Now you can add or buy a domain through fast mail now i've done this I have about 20 domains that i've  Purchased elsewhere now i'm going to buy them for fast mail that I have fast mail doing the dns for  Which gives me authenticated email from fast mail automatically they set up the records so it works right out of the box  I just think this is the best way to have a custom domain and by the way, you know, like I have leoville.com  Anything for gets get sent to at leoville.com goes into that inbox. So I another way I can use unique emails for everybody  Um, I just i'm having to go on and on I have gone on I finally got migrated over
