And it's going to be a good show, I can tell you.  Let's start by saying hello to our panelist, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org, back from  the White House.  Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes I am.  Hi, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to tell us all about it, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I will.  All right.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor from the City University of New York and the  author of Public Parts, his newest book.  Good to see you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And with my hair, I'm always appearing in black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you look good in black and white, actually.  Also Matt Cutts is here from Google, one of Google's earliest employees.  He works in the spam fighting division at Google and a good person to have on today.  Hello Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, good to be here.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks for joining us.  Besides turning off the logo, do they turn off your lights, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a dark day today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fine.  Those of you who are just tuning in or downloading the video might be slapping your computer  or your television set.  No, there's nothing wrong with your set.  We are in black and white today because we're recording this on January 18th, which is the  day the internet fought back.  And with some success, I might add, we just learned, we just talked to an activist at  the Electronic Tier Foundation that today alone, 29 members of Congress have reversed  their position on the internet.  I'm Kevin Purdy and I thank you for joining us.  Thank you.  I wasn't quite there yet.  I just rolled with it.  I like the black and white actually.  I think it looks kind of good.  Yeah.  There's something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to Google.com, there's a nice big, it looks like a piece of duct tape over the  logo and a link.  Tell Congress, please don't censor the web.  And look at this.  Nearly four million people today signing that petition.  Let me just do that right now so that I can make it four million and one.  And I encourage everybody while you're watching the show to do that.  Matt Cutts, why doesn't Google want to stop piracy?  Are you pro-piracy, Matt Cutts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course not.  No, we hate piracy and we actually spend like $60 million a year trying to get bad ads and  other things out of our system.  So nobody wants piracy, but it's pretty crazy when you're trying to solve a business model  problem with a technological solution that just won't even work.  And I think that's one of the big things is people don't realize that pirates will just  quickly get around this.  In the meantime, it will absolutely, of course, hurt jobs, but basically put a chilling effect  on the internet where a lot of people, a lot of sites that rely on user-generated content  will be incredibly affected by it.  My wife, I sent her an email and I was like, hey, would you mind calling a senator?  And she's like, oh yeah, yeah, I should.  And then she went to Craftzine, which is an O'Reilly site, and it was shut down for the  day.  And she's like, oh, no, that's right.  Regular sites are going to be affected.  And that was the tipping point for her to call her senator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I care a lot about this.  Our news program, Tech News Today, I mean, we get pulled down from YouTube all the time.  Our news program, Tech News Today, ran that Mega Download.com video, even though that  video itself was not an infringing video, but Universal Music Group decided it was.  Universal Music Group also asked Tech News Today to be pulled down.  We appealed it.  They pulled it down again.  We appealed it again.  Finally, it was put back up on YouTube.  It's funny, Matt, because you do work for the company that owns YouTube, and YouTube  has in many cases been hand in glove with the music and the recording and the motion  picture industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting to me is I went to DC last year and did a Q&A, and it was just  for staffers.  And most places, if you say, ask me anything about Google, they'll say, how does Google  work?  How do I rank higher?  How do I get my word out to constituents?  And I was pretty shocked at how many questions were about YouTube and DMCA and copyright  infringement.  Oh, isn't that interesting?  Wow.  Yeah.  And what I realized is a lot of people have this conception that YouTube is still this,  you know, like it was in the very early days where you could find all these shows.  And Google has done a very good job of trying to make sure that, you know, if you're the  copyright owner, you can make sure that copies are down or you can monetize it.  You've got a lot of different options.  So we've worked hard.  But at the same time, you're absolutely right.  Like with TNT, it's totally the case that you sometimes see overly broad takedowns.  You can see mistaken takedowns.  You can see takedowns that end up almost looking capricious because it turns out the person  didn't have the copyright.  We've seen all kinds of fake DMCA requests where people are just trying to hurt either  competitors or trying to basically do some prank or something like that.  So the notion that this process won't be abused when we already see it abused under  DMCA is just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess that's the point of that.  One of the points of that video that we just aired and we didn't air it on.  I'll tell you what, I'll play it at the end of Twig so you can see it, but it explains  why SOPA is bad.  And one of the things the video points out is, well, there's a lot of things the video  points out, but one of the things the video points out is that there are laws like DMCA  and pro-IP that are already in place.  There are anti-counterfeiting laws that are more than adequate and have problems already.  We don't need to go a step farther.  Tim O'Reilly, we're trying to get Tim on.  He's in a plane and when he makes his connection, we're trying to get him on by phone, but he's  been really great on Google+.  A lot of posts on Google+.  But one of the posts he put up a couple of days ago that I thought was great, before  solving a problem, make sure you've got the right problem, he talks about the, unfortunately  the people who framed this debate often frame it around, is it about piracy?  But in fact, he says, really, that's a mis-framed argument.  The losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the internet, by the free  flow of information.  History shows us again and again, frontiers are lawless places, but as they get richer  and more settled, they join in the rule of law.  American publishing, listen carefully, American publishing, now the largest publishing industry  in the world, began with piracy.  Began by stealing others' works.  He says we've got to reframe this conversation.  Piracy isn't the problem.  And even if you thought it was, these bills won't make a difference, because pirates just  go ahead and go around anything like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just earlier this month, where digital sales are now higher than physical sales of music,  and early on you definitely saw a sort of antagonism towards digital sales by a lot  of people in the content industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just as they hated VCRs, cassettes, MP3 players, freaking piano player roles, at the turn of  the last century they tried to stop.  Player pianos are going to put the music industry out of business!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I think one of the things that Tim makes so, he of all people can make this argument,  because he is a publisher, he sees the benefits, is that there's no, we haven't proven the  harm here.  Exactly.  How many of those, and it's proving a negative, how many of those people who did pirate the  work would have bought it had they not pirated it?  Probably very few.  How many people instead, however, did discover the work because it was pirated?  Could be very high.  And Paulo Coelho, the author, I wrote about this in the last book, he has sold more than  a hundred million books, yet he pirates his own works.  Because he discovered that when he put up, when people did pirate his works in other  languages like Russian before the book was out, his sales in those countries went up.  He pirated his own works and his publisher caught him, Jane Freeman caught him because  he said, oh no, somebody pirated it.  And it turned out it was the, you know, the editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They put it up on Pirate Bay, Paulo Coelho did it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was the wrong version, but he said, okay, it caught me, but let's look at  the business opportunities here.  And Paulo yelled at me, I was giving away books at an event, and he said, don't give  away books, sell books.  You know, so he's very much a salesman, very much believes in it, but he sees the benefit  of things being spread in this way.  And I think it's the lack of harm, too.  And I'm going to start the drinking game early.  But you go back to to this point about early publishing and Gutenberg, you know, this  notion of owning intellectual property is fairly recent in history.  And and I think that what's happening, too, is we're going through a phase in society  where we're going back to the idea that I just I just wrote about David Weinberger's  magnificent new book, Too Big to Know, and knowledge becomes the network.  It doesn't become the property of individuals in it.  And that's our old model.  And that's the way we used to do this.  And I think that this is really about trying to rethink the shape of our world.  And that's why the institutions are having such trouble with this.  That's why the Rupert Murdoch's are belching everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at this tweet from M.C.  Hammer, he says, stop SOPA.  And there is Hammer with two guys from Firefox standing in front of the Capitol building.  I love it. Need we say more?  So even artists, I think not all artists, but many artists understand that the Internet  has given them far more opportunities than it has taken away from them.  And you know, you say an interesting thing, Jeff, and I, Tim O'Reilly says this as well.  We often conflate the way the arguments miss misshapen is we conflate intellectual  property with real property.  And we think that you steal my phone.  That's real property.  But steal my idea is not real property and is not protected in the Constitution or by  the founders never intended to protect intellectual property.  In fact, they said very clearly that the copyright laws and the patent laws were designed  to protect the inventor for a limited time, a very limited time, just 14 years.  And that ultimately that intellectual property was the property of society and belonged to  society to promote the arts and sciences.  And so this whole idea that somehow something is like that it's real property that's being  stolen, even that is fallacious and especially in a digital era, especially in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  digital era, not only because it's not a consumable anymore, but also because the models  change. And I go through this all the time.  But in media, we've been brought up to think that all the value is encased in the product.  That's why we sell it.  And I've said this, I think, on the show before, but Mark Zuckerberg realizes differently  content has value, but its value is to get people to generate signals about themselves.  Why the hell do you think Google invented Google Plus?  Because why is it an Android?  Because we're using these things to generate signals about ourselves that allow those  services to give us more targeted and relevant content services and advertising and  extract more value from their relationships with us.  So content does have value, but it's only one value in a chain.  And the way media was structured for the five hundred fifty years of of of Gutenberg's  era was that content media were encased as a product and could be sold that way.  That's just over.  So what we're seeing is more than just old companies trying to protect their copyrights.  We're seeing right here two important things happening.  One is the other shift of a business model around media.  But second, and I'm very, very happy about this and very proud of our Internet, we're  seeing the beginnings of, I think for the first time, the creation of a public called  the Net. Yeah.  And I think that's very, very exciting that this is the first political movement that  I believe has started out of the net for the net's concerns.  And it's up to this point working.  It hasn't won, but it's impressive in what the people of the net can do.  So let's remember this, folks, and let's keep fighting for other principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I was going to say that.  I mean, what's going on today is just absolutely historical.  You know, what I was going to say earlier, though, I mean, I think that we need to be  realistic, though, and accept that we're never going to convince the MPA and the R.I.A.  that privacy is not a problem.  So I agree with you guys.  I just think that, you know, they're spending a lot of money convincing the powers that  be that piracy is a problem.  And this is why we need legislation this way.  So what we need to do with the tech community is to educate the government about how the  Internet works with as much effort and time and human hours as they're spending, educating  them about how much piracy is a problem.  You know, I was at the White House last Monday, which is the reason why I missed the show.  I was invited there for a meeting about an event that's happening in the spring, which  I'll talk about then. But after the meeting, I had a few moments to speak with Anish  Chopra, who's the CTO of the United States.  And we were talking about, you know, how does government reach out to its constituents  and engage with citizens online?  And Anish said, what's the issue of the moment?  And I said, absolutely so.  And I used, you know, I very strongly advised him to that the administration has to put a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  statement out there. And they did three days later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. And he gave what I was very proud of, Gina.  He gave the hat tip to you and Twitter, which was really so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did. Well, I told him that I would boost his follower count by mentioning him on  Twitter, which I did, and then said, oh, hey.  Hours, you're welcome.  And he said, OK, and then he.  Oh, when the White House responded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, say that again, because we lost we broke up a little bit.  We lost you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry about that. I had I had mentioned on him on Twitter saying that, you know, the  tech community should follow him.  Good. And I think kind of in return, he gave me that hat tip for the White House's  response. But the White House was working on that response when I was at the White  House. So I certainly don't take credit for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's his Twitter handle? I want to follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anish Topra. Anish Topra is his name and his Twitter handle is just his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A-N-I-S-H.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A-N-E-E-S-H.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  C-H-O-P-R-A.  All right, I'll follow him right there.  There we go. Chief technology officer.  So follow.  There you go. See, see the end.  But I do think this is it makes an important point.  And read, write web.  Scott Fulton writing a read, write web also makes this point.  All right. So we've shown we can be negative Nellies and say don't pass it.  But then the challenge is, OK, come up with a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's the problem, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I agree with you. And that says, Neela and you go back to Twitter about a month ago,  Neela Patel and I had a big debate over this and Neela, who is a lawyer by training, said,  you can't just say no, you have to offer a compromise position.  My position was digital technologies.  There is no technology that effectively prevents piracy.  The solution is to reinvent your business model.  Yes, not to break the Internet and computers.  And I do believe that the people who control content today wish computers and the Internet would just go away.  The reason we chose to go black and white today instead of black entirely is I want to talk it back to the 50s where there was no Internet.  There was no computer.  And, of course, at that time, people, those guys hated other things.  There were other technologies they hated.  But they would love computers and the Internet to go away.  And failing that, they know that's not going to happen.  Let's modify them in such a way that we don't have to fear them instead of reinventing their business model.  There's plenty of money to be made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem as they perceive it is that there's piracy going on on foreign websites and the United States needs a way to address that.  Well, is there a way, though?  I don't know. I don't have a better way.  This bill, this is an attempt to give the United States a way to address.  There's a foreign website, non-U.S. website offering copyrighted material, which is illegal.  And how do we address that?  This is not the solution.  But what is the solution?  When I brought this up with Anish, she said to me, do you know why this bill even started?  It's because we need a way to address criminal activity on foreign websites.  And it is, listen, offering copyrighted material is a crime right now.  Right. So what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Gina, hold on there.  It's not what happens in China is not a crime in the U.S.  It's a crime in China if China has the right laws.  And in fact, it's not a crime in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. That's what this is trying to do is to fill in laws and enforcement in lands where it doesn't exist.  But we don't have unless we want to do some extradition and we've done things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got no way of stopping the Chinese.  So we do what the Chinese did, which is create a great firewall of the United States.  Right.  And I agree with Leo here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, obviously, that's a terrible idea.  Right. But that's what this Read Write Web article is saying, that the administration is saying, like, OK, if this is a terrible idea, then what can we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the idea.  Leo is absolutely right, I think.  And you start to encourage and teach industries new models.  Now, will various of those companies succeed?  Not necessarily.  You know, the thing that I've been talking about and I think I've just decided today that we're going to try to build a demo of this at CUNY is to build embeddable units of content.  So I'm going to come back to Google Plus and and Richard Gingras and folks and try to get a Guardian article, let's say, off their API embedded not only in my blog, but also on Google Plus with their brand, with their revenue, with their analytics, with links.  You change the model, a movie that passes around, maybe it should pass around with advertising in it.  And if you want the clean version, you buy it.  Otherwise, you get some monetization with it.  I don't know.  But but but trying to preserve the old model in a new reality is not the solution.  And it is a misstatement.  This is where Tim Riley is really so right.  It's a complete misstatement of the problem.  There's not a proof of harm here.  So before we get demanded by the White House or we read web that, well, OK, then you go up with something better.  No, absolutely not.  You come up and show us the harm.  You show us the real facts that make it worthwhile to ruin the friggin Internet.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it's interesting because I try to I try to think about how to step into the minds of the people who are facing these problems, because I understand if you're a movie producer or someone who writes music, you don't want pirated content to take away from your your living.  Right.  So there's there's two different cases.  There's collateral damage, you know, really legit businesses that could be taken down by mistaken sort of practices.  And then there's the egregious sort of stuff.  And on the egregious sort of stuff, my spam fighting instinct kicks in a little bit.  So to be a good spammer, you need reputation like links.  You need content, something that the search engine can key off of.  But most importantly, you need a way to monetize.  And there's been a study where people looked at email spam and they basically figured out that most of the credit card processing went through something like three banks based in Eastern Europe.  And so a lot of the times, if you actually follow the money to either the credit card processors or the other payment processors, you'll find that there's some very small points where you could actually have a big impact there.  And so there is an act called open where people are talking about following the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Matt, how well has that worked in stopping email spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the interesting thing on email spam is I think Gmail has been a huge technological improvement over what was previously working with email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you're filtering it, not because you're stopping it.  Because we're, because we're.  What is it? 95% of all traffic on the Internet is still spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But for an average user, they don't have to see spam in their inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my point.  There are technological solutions, but you cannot stop piracy.  You cannot stop spam.  If black holes, if black lists worked like they're proposing in SOPA and PIPA, we wouldn't have any spam.  They don't work.  Oh, I'm totally familiar with that.  Yeah, we haven't stopped spam.  We just don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and what's interesting is the very first thing I worked on at Google was was SafeSearch, which is our family filter.  And there was a Dilbert that came out that basically said, so you're going to try to keep every 14 year old boy from getting to porn.  Did you know that a snowball lasts longer in hell if you put a little hat on it?  You know, you can't keep people who really are going to go to, you know, they'll go all over to find stuff, but you can try to make it easier so that people don't run across it on a daily basis.  But what doesn't work, because I've seen, you know, how the brittle aspect of black lists dealing with trying to mark explicit porn sites and not the idea of outsourcing that through a private right of action to other companies who don't necessarily aren't necessarily as tech savvy.  That just seems like a recipe for disaster.  Somebody in the chat room is saying, well, what about physical goods?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about Chanel handbags and Rolex watches?  I would submit that anybody who would buy a fake Chanel handbag or Rolex wristwatch would not buy the original under any circumstances anyway.  So what you cannot say is that Rolex loses money to fake low Rolex wristwatches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and in fact, Leo, I went to a meeting by Richemal in South Africa last year, and they talked about what they're going to offer is the danger there really is that someone thinks they're buying.  The danger there really is that someone thinks they're buying a real one and get ripped off.  Okay.  A phony gets passed off.  So what they see the need to do is to create new verification mechanisms.  So before you buy it, you can verify that this is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not the overseas website problem, because if you're buying Chanel handbags from an overseas website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right.  Well, you should just know better.  And you're right, Leo, you're not going to buy it.  You're not going to buy a real one anyway.  Here's another way to look at it.  I've been you know, there have been there were more cases today.  Zappos are we're looking at so many things the wrong way.  And I wish I'd been on with Steve before this to ask him this question.  I was slightly off topic, but but all the security breaches and oh, my God, people have my credit card number and my address and my my social security number.  Shouldn't we set up transactional methods so that it doesn't matter if anybody has my credit card, my social security number or whatever?  Right.  We're doing this wrong way.  We're trying to play the whack a mole that Matt's talking about of getting rid of the bad guys rather than creating new and better systems and models.  If we had some means that was biometric and informational to let me and only me do transactions under my name, then I wouldn't care if anybody has my social security number.  It's not the secret to my universe.  We're doing it the wrong way.  So same here.  I think that Matt's quite right is to is to try to stop that thing from happening isn't going to work.  So you create better systems that bring the good stuff up, make it easier to buy things.  Steve Jobs proved that that worked in music is the is the is the revenue the same as the as the monopoly pricing the same.  Well, no, but welcome to a new world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody have a chance to speak along to the these lines, Matt, you have anything else you want to say before we move along?  I think we're preaching to the converted here.  Yeah, I think anybody who's watching this show knows exactly why they hate SOPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is very cool when you were talking to the EFF guy to hear that 29 Congress people have reversed their position today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty wild.  And as you say, this is much larger than PIPA and SOPA.  This is I think you could look you'll be we'll be able to look back on this day and say this is the day the Internet showed its power.  And we the people of the Internet maybe do have a little bit of clout.  And we're not just a bunch of, you know, bearded, neckbearded guys in their underwear sitting in their basements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, one thing that made me very happy about the discussion, the White House statement was that it rose to the level of principle.  And that's what I talk about in my book is the need for discussion of principles, because we get down in the nitty gritty of trying to recreate an old model or protect one little thing.  We've got to deal with the full principles, the precedents that occur here and the why and the wherefore.  And at some point, the White House has to decide and Congress has to decide, is it more important to protect an entertainment company or free speech?  And where are they going to put their capital and effort in doing this?  And we have to have this discussion at the level of principles and protecting these principles for a future.  And that's what I'm so delighted about is that we're having here is we're saying that SOPA is one of many bad things going on in trying to screw the Internet.  But this is the one that went too far.  And this is the one we're going to stop.  And we're going to have this discussion on the basis of principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I hope this strengthens our muscle.  And our protest muscle.  And now that we understand that we have we have some say in the matter that that we all stay involved and active.  We vote. We pay attention to these issues.  But now, you know, I think it's really important that we have a balance, a descending viewpoint.  So, ladies and gentlemen, we take you to Rupert Murdoch, who says,  So Obama has thrown in his lot with Silicon Valley paymasters who threaten all software creators with piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you do that with an Australian accent?  Yeah, plain thievery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Piracy later is Google, who streams movies free sells advertisements around them.  No wonder pouring millions into the lobbying.  So as you point out in your this is from Jeff's blog post saying Rupert Murdoch doesn't understand links.  He really doesn't.  It's all your fault, Matt Kutz.  I blame you.  I don't know what to say about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He thinks to link to things is to steal rather than sending them audience.  He does not understand that basic structure.  So he's always thought that aggregators were content kleptomaniacs, in the words of one of his recently ousted lieutenants.  And now he thinks that for Google to just link to bad stuff is is is Google doing it.  And he thinks the whole Internet is on by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw here's the here's the here's the here's the smoking gun post.  I've just been to Google search for Mission Impossible.  Wow. Several sites offering free links.  I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff Bercovici says that happened at CES when he got a demo of Google TV and was shown how to search for TV.  And he asked if I search for Mission Impossible, will you know these bad things come up too?  And the answer was, yeah, search.  And he went berserk.  He says in his latest post 19 hours ago, don't care about people not buying movies, programs or newspapers, just stealing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  So, OK, so if we don't buy anything from him ever again, he won't he doesn't care about that.  No problem. No problem.  Just don't steal.  Yeah, well, actually, you know that there is some internal consistency to that because the presumption being that if once stolen, that was a purchase that we've lost.  But he accuses Google of being the thief.  Right. You stole it instead of buying it.  Oh, he says AFL-CIO supports SOPA.  Well, we better talk to those union leaders.  How about that?  I have to say, though, I'm not I don't want to make too much fun of Rupert because at least he's tweeting.  I mean, this is him, obviously.  And how many CEOs only only a guy like Rupert Murdoch with huge amounts of power within his company would get the permission to tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't ask permission.  He just does.  Yeah, he gives it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to say what I want.  All right. But now it's Matt's turn to get on the hot seat.  And we're going to do that in just a little bit because Google made some big changes.  I don't know, Matt, if you saw Twitter this week, but we went into great detail with Danny Sullivan about this search plus my world and some of the real interesting conflict of interest issues that it raises.  And I'm going to give you every chance to respond to that.  So we'll do that in just a little bit.  This is, of course, the day the Internet fought back.  That's why we're in black and white.  We invite you to go to blackout.eff.org or American censorship.org or Reddit.com or WordPress.com or wired.com and learn more.  Wikipedia.org and learn more about this and what you can do, primarily chief of which is a call your member of Congress.  Now, of course, we're a global show.  More than a third of our audience is outside the U.S.  Don't think this doesn't affect you.  These laws are being passed all over the world.  Most recently, Spain, France, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the running dog of the U.S.  content industry is working on passing bills exactly like this all over the world.  So the fight goes on everywhere.  You're just as much at risk as we are.  So please do find out what it is that you need to do to make a difference in your neck of the woods.  We're going to take a break and come back with more with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Matt Cutts.  But first, a word from Squarespace.  I wonder, you know, I didn't look at Squarespace.  I wonder if they're participating in this.  Squarespace would be one of many sites that would be absolutely threatened by it.  No, they're not.  Because all it takes is one infringing site on Squarespace on a Squarespace.com server.  Oh, yeah, there it is.  There's the there's the black bar across the across the name.  Stop censorship right there.  All it would take is one infringing site at Squarespace.com.  The whole domain could be gone.  So that's why we've got to we've got to fight this fight for everybody.  Squarespace is web hosting the best out there in addition to the best content management software to give you a place for your website.  You could try it free right now.  Go to Squarespace.com, click the green Try it Free button and no credit card required.  You just fill out the name of the site, a password and email address.  You can set up a site.  You've got two weeks to use every feature of Squarespace there.  iOS and Android software, tablet, too.  So great. Allows you to post, manage comments, get stats.  Import and export from all the major blog APIs, movable type WordPress,  type ad and blogger, complete social integration for Twitter, Foursquare, Facebook, LinkedIn,  Flickr, just with, you know, very simple.  Drop a little widget in there.  Sliders point and click.  You can completely customize it to fit your site's look.  Templates that are not templated, they are professionally designer created templates.  More than more than 60 of them.  But that's just a starting point.  And then you make it yours.  You could even use CSS and JavaScript.  You could do e-commerce.  I just love Squarespace.  I want you to try it free for 14 days.  Click that green button.  If you decide to buy, this is the only thing I ask of you.  Use our offer code when you decide to buy.  It's worth your while.  Thirty percent off for the first three months of your site.  When you do so, Twig one is the number T W I G, the number one.  But that's only when you're ready to buy.  You don't even need that just to try it and see how you like it.  Squarespace dot com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  Thirty percent off for your first three months when you use the offer code.  T W I G and the number one.  Any site aggregator would be would be vulnerable to this bill.  And of course, we'd be very vulnerable.  I mean, I'm not I'm not implying that I don't have a stake in this.  I have a huge stake in this because every show we do, including this show,  frequently we run clips because we're a new show and it's very use allows us to do so.  Clips that illustrate the news stories we're talking about.  And often content creators pull those shows off of YouTube.  But and I think that, you know, that's a reasonable DMCA takedown.  I'm I'm content with that.  Because there's an appeal process to me that works.  Doesn't work perfectly, as Matt was saying, but it's more than adequate to protect.  In fact, sometimes way more than adequate to protect rights holders.  We don't need to go any further.  If we did, it would take merely a complaint from the Universal Music Group  to pull all of twit off the air.  And that's that's the kind of thing we're worried about.  Take me down off YouTube.  I can live with that.  We'll fight it and we'll appeal it.  And there is an appeal process.  But, you know, there's there's no appeal if ICE decides that  Twitter is an infringing site and pulls us off the air.  By the way, you know, Chris Dodd, former Senator Chris Dodd, who is now  spokesperson, actually is the CEO and chairman of the Emotion  Picture Association of America, was just on CNN.  Time Warner's CNN saying,  well, so was to protect jobs in Hollywood.  I think far more jobs have been created by Internet broadcasters.  We've created a dozen, two dozen jobs here.  Amen. Amen.  Those are jobs that be lost.  So SOPA cost me jobs, Chris Dodd.  What about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Leo, I just see that Trevor Tim, who was who you had on,  you know, just a few minutes ago from the EFF on Twitter, from the EFF.  Twitter says that he quotes Patrick Ruffini of saying that 26 of the 29  legislators who just announced opposition to PIPA and SOPA are Republicans.  He says the National Review refames reframed the legislation as a, quote,  bailout for Hollywood, which he says explains the sudden Republican opposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All he had to say is the word bailout.  Bailout. That's why it really Tim's right.  Tim O'Reilly is right when he says if you reframe this.  It's it's really a misunderstanding.  It's merely a misunderstanding of the problem that's causing this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. I love that bailout for Hollywood is is is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so you have Orrin Hatch, who was one of the according Trevor here,  who was one of the co-sponsors, is now removed his co-sponsorship.  Thank you. We were working on Dianne Feinstein.  Our hello Democrats. Hello, Democrats.  What's interesting, Schumer, Gillibrandt. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feinstein, also one of the sponsors, is a senator from California.  So she represents both industries, right?  Silicon Valley and Hollywood.  So we're just going to exert a little more.  Google Google's in in Washington, D.C., right, man?  I mean, you have an active  lobbying. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are in Washington, D.C. Yeah, absolutely.  But it's you know, it's a case where the longer you've been in D.C.,  the longer you have relationships.  And Google as a young company is doesn't have as many relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need to hire more senators.  I'm sorry, did I say that?  All right. So let's talk let's talk about search plus my world.  I don't did you get a chance to see Twit last last Sunday with Danny Sullivan?  You've probably seen Danny's complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yeah, I've we talked to Danny yesterday, in fact.  And it's really interesting to me because there's a lot of great stuff  in search plus your world where really useful things can show up.  You know, if I follow Gina, which I do, and and she talks about a router  and I do a search for router, it surfaces her opinion about  what are the good routers, what are the routers to avoid?  And I actually had that happen to me this past weekend.  And I think Danny and other people had some some very reasonable feedback about  what we wanted to see more Twitter or we wanted to see more Facebook.  And, you know, Facebook, they have a deal with Bing.  They have a deal with Yandex in Russia.  They even have a deal with BLECO.  They've talked to Baidu, but we haven't been able to arrive on a deal together.  And even Twitter, you know, we had started out with a product called Real Time  Search, which is was hugely useful that relied on Twitter a lot.  And unfortunately, that arrangement ended up rather abruptly.  I don't know all the details.  I know that a lot of engineers were working on the July 4th weekend  this past summer to turn that off.  And so I think when we were building Search Plus Your World,  you want to have a good user experience.  You want to have sharing that just works and identity that just works.  And as an engineer, you're probably a little bit reluctant to build something  if you don't know whether, you know, that other company is just going to say, oh,  you know, I'm putting in a robots on text and blocking Google from crying me entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you could I mean, it's true.  We know that Google can see a lot of what's on Facebook.  A lot of that's public. A lot of it's searchable.  But you just can't count on it is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Certainly with with Twitter, you know, given the experience of real time  search where that did end rather abruptly, you know, it was it was interesting.  I have a ton of respect for a Mac, the general counsel for Twitter.  He's worked at Google and, you know, he's a fantastic guy.  But, you know, it's hard to predict whether someone's going to say, well,  how dare you not use Twitter more from the open web data versus,  oh, we don't want to be in it at all.  And so I think we started out with a relatively safe assumption.  But, you know, definitely if people want to talk about ways to work together,  that's something that we can have that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something something odd has happened here.  I have to say I was able to demonstrate on my Twitter, my Google account.  I had search plus my world.  It seems to have been turned off now.  I don't know. I don't know why I am no longer getting those results  on the right hand side.  I'll give you an example of a search that we did do.  And you are seeing some of the some of what we're complaining about right here.  I search for Mark Zuckerberg right in the drop down.  I see Mark Zuckerberg's Google Plus account  pointing to a Google property.  And for a while, it was the first search result.  It's changed now.  No, it's first for me.  Yeah, something happened.  I think that I hate to say it, Matt, but somebody at Google has flipped  a switch on my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Try to do a search like like Linux and see whether that brings up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? It was another good search.  Let's see what happens is music.  Here we go.  This this is doing it now.  So let's do that. Let's show this one.  So first of all, Mark, the point Danny made was that Mark Zuckerberg's  Google Plus page is probably not a good search result  because he hasn't posted anything on it.  Yes, it's a Google property, but it is not a good result.  And this is this is precisely his complaint,  which is that you are now massaging search results to benefit Google  not to give the best search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think if you if you look at that page, it says people and places on Google  Plus. So I think it's in its own box.  It's on the right hand side.  And it very specifically says it's on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't do it for Mark Zuckerberg.  You actually gave it to me in a drop down and as a first search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But right. Yeah.  I think the suggestions are, again, people that we know  we know about because we actually know their identity.  There's a very common case if you're married with someone  and suppose you get a divorce, you know, on on Facebook,  you might have those permissions updated instantly.  But if you're crawling the web, you might not get that connection  that that these people are no longer linked.  And maybe, you know, it's really bad to show pictures of your ex  or something like that. Got it.  So unless we really have the sort of access where we can tell,  you know, at a given moment, does someone have access to this picture  or something like that?  Then it's really tricky to be able to handle that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me music is another example.  And as you say, this is people and pages, says people and pages on Google Plus.  Um.  What happened, of course, is if you search for Lady Gaga,  she wasn't on Google Plus.  She must have listened to our Twitter episode because she is on Google Plus now.  And there's good reason to be.  If you look over here, after I search on music, I get Britney Spears and Snoop Dogg,  both of whom are in one million plus circles on Google Plus.  Those are right there related to music.  There may not be the best search results for me.  Lady Gaga is not there, but as Lady Gaga.  Obviously recognized, boy, you better have a Google Plus account.  Is that not strong arming Lady Gaga into having a Google Plus account  by modifying your search results?  She just started. Right.  She she capitulated. You won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, again, you know, this is not my area.  I'm not a lawyer.  I'm a regular web spam engineer, but I don't think that the law requires us  to do things that help competitors, just competition, something that helps  showing these results is better than having any information at all.  I like the search Linux because it actually has Linus Torvalds,  Linux and Greg Co Hartman, who's a kernel hacker.  And it actually surfaces really useful experts that you wouldn't have seen before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but if Linus wasn't on Google Plus, it would not have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, absolutely.  But the problem is, you know, we forgot clear marking.  We've said this is people in places are people and, you know,  and pages on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at the bottom, learn how you could appear here, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. But it is on the right hand side and it's in a different box.  But I think the key thing for us is we already tried to build a product,  for example, that would surface Twitter data and had a contract.  And that had to end really quickly.  And a lot of people had to work really hard to pull data out.  And so I think if you are an engineer and you're trying to figure out,  you know, if you're just going to build a system  and then a year and a half later or two years later, have to shut it down.  In some cases, uncleanly or very quickly,  then you'd be a little reluctant, you know, to build that the next time around.  It's sort of like once bitten, twice shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So really, the call at this point, and I presume you make  somebody who Google's made this call is to Twitter and Facebook saying,  let's make a deal so that you can show up here, too, because truthfully,  it would be much better for the search results if you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's above my pay grade.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Matt, I believe me, I know I'm spanking you here  and I'm only spanking you in surrogate.  I love you, Matt.  And you know, we love Google.  But I have to say, a number of people said this on the net.  This was the day Google went evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's one thing that I disagree with.  Like Danny had published a post that talked about when some of the things  were pushing relevancy, you know, not as strongly because it was Google Plus.  But what I've noticed is your searches can change entirely.  If you do a search like photos, you can get the latest photos you've taken  and the latest photos that your friends have taken.  I find myself doing, for example, I went to Costa Rica about a week or two ago.  And if I do the search Costa Rica, now I get colleagues at Google  who have been to Costa Rica and have that picture.  And now I can do find out from them which things I should be doing.  So, you know, the notion that you should be able to search over  the sorts of things you've seen in the past.  You don't remember where you saw it, but you know, you can get really interesting,  useful stuff to still down and more importantly, searches  you wouldn't have done before.  Like, it's a different type of search that lets you find out new information  that you wouldn't have found for your friends.  I've had several of those epiphany moments where I'm like, oh, wow, that's,  you know, a recommendation from Gina is worth ten times as much in my mind  than just a regular web page.  And I've had several of those kind of.  No, and I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, this is what we've been talking about quite a bit for the last two years,  is how social search massages search results and makes them more relevant.  And it was clear that one of the reasons Google started Google Plus  is so that they could, you know, own some signals,  these very, very valuable social signals.  And you're right, you can't rely on Facebook.  You can't rely on Twitter for those social signals.  So I understand the the engineers point of view, which is, well,  we're going to have to create our own social signals.  We recognize that these social signals are absolutely critical to making search better.  So what do you how do you as an engineer, how do you solve that?  Well, let's start capturing social signals.  Google Plus.  But what it looks like to the outside world is a favoritism towards Google Plus.  I think you've responded well, Gina and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, you go first, because you've been silent for a while.  Then, of course, I'll jump in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have I have mixed feelings about search plus your world.  I think that it makes my search results both better and worse.  So I just read the Hunger Games series.  So I do a search for the Hunger Games and I can see all the places  where my friends have mentioned the Hunger Games.  Dorica example.  Valuable. And because I happen to be pretty  speed, a lot of the network and my friends  participate, a lot of the network and Google graph is very, very useful.  So so that that I like.  What makes me uncomfortable is like this this past week or the last couple of days,  I did a search for I want to look at Leo's blog because I knew he had done a post  about whether or not we should black out today.  So I searched for Leo Laporte and the first result is his Google Plus profile  because he's in my circles.  But that's not what I'm looking for.  Actually, it was. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where I posted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did an audio post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. You're right. The audio post is on the blog.  Now, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I didn't remember Leoville dot com.  So that's what I was looking for.  And I thought I follow Leo.  If I wanted his Google Plus profile, I would have looked for him on Google Plus.  I would have known to do that.  Truthfully, this this made me uncomfortable.  I have to say, I've been on Twitter since 2007.  I've invested way more time on Twitter than I have in Google Plus, right?  Just because it's been around a lot longer.  So Twitter has a lot more information about me than Google Plus does at this point.  So I feel like, you know, my Twitter profile and even to some extent,  my Facebook profile should should rank higher than Google Plus at this point.  And I and I, you know, I understand the issues with making deals with those companies  and all those things.  I just I felt kind of disappointed because I think that the best way for a community to grow  and for a social product to grow is from the inside and not from the outside.  Like, it made me sad that people are going to join Google Plus as part of their SEO strategy,  you know, because they've been, you know, because they feel like it will it will raise their ranking  because of search. Lady Gaga.  Right. Exactly. Rather than join Google Plus because it's it's a great product.  I actually think that Google Plus is a good product, but I don't think it's proven itself yet.  So this felt this feels like the right path.  But to me, it felt a little too much too soon.  I didn't love that it's the default setting.  I didn't love that even if you toggle to to disable personalized search,  it goes back to the default setting unless you settings and say don't.  So it made me uncomfortable.  It felt a little bit like a misstep, even though, as Matt said, I have had the experience.  It did enhance my search results in some in some cases where, you know,  I value the things that my friends say more than random dude on the Internet web page.  So that's my mixed review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and I think that that's absolutely fair feedback.  And one thing that some some people didn't realize in the very first wave is  even though we need to know who you are and able to surface your content or your friends,  if you link from your Google Plus profile to your Twitter account or Quora or FriendFeed or WordPress  or type that data can also be surfaced.  So it's not only Google Plus content.  But the other thing that I mentioned and I totally agree, it can be useful if you search for sunset.  I expect to see Danny Sullivan's pictures of sunset.  But there's a good story from when we first rolled out PDF or Acrobat search because PDFs are really long.  They had a lot more words and they had a lot more matches.  And at first, when we started to blend them, there were people complained you have way too many Acrobat files showing up in the search results.  And so I think we'll absolutely iterate because we totally know that if we annoy people like Matt Honan did a post where he said he's going to set his default home page to Bing,  we know there's no lock in and search.  You can leave in 15 seconds.  And so if we annoy people, we know that they'll start to leave.  And so it's in our enlightened self-interest to try to get the balance right and not to try to show you so much of any given thing that it annoys you.  So the goal is to show you those results only if they're really useful, not if there's something that's going to be annoying to you.  And it might take time to find exactly what that balance is going to be.  But I do think that we'll find that balance.  And in two or three years, people will look back and say, I'm really glad that I've got this kind of functionality where something that's private or accessible only to me,  I don't have to remember where it was.  I can go and I can search for it in one place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, as Danny pointed out on a tweet on Sunday, Bing's been doing this for a long time.  So going to Bing is actually not does not fix anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I agree with you that there's an issue here.  But the issue is not that Google is pointing to itself.  The New York Times does not point to the New York Post sports section, which happens to be better than the New York Times sports section, I'm told.  It points to its own stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I hear that argument, but that's a publisher.  And so this is my really fundamental problem.  Is Google a search engine or a content creator?  You can't have it both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I disagree.  I think that it is a service provider and it can point to its own services.  It points to it can point to Gmail and it can point to other things that can use its space.  That's what companies do.  But here's where I agree with you.  I think that Google's reputation depends upon it enforcing, having and then enforcing and living principles.  And so if I were Google, I would have done a few things.  One, I think I've been a little less garish about the pointing to Google Plus.  Two, I would have made a very clear policy statement that says as soon as we can.  I take a point, Matt, reliably get feeds from Twitter and Facebook.  We will include them equally because those are social signals that are equally important to you.  And if they're more important in terms of your social graph, then we'll put them there.  I think Google should make that kind of statement of where it's going.  But I also think that Google made some right moves.  You know, one, as Gina said, going toward collecting social signals is important.  And two, it was it got praise even from privacy people on its transparency about where it gets, what it gets.  I think they deserve some of that.  I think a lot of the problem here is a design and aesthetic problem because it's a little bit tacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's good feedback.  I think there's still absolutely room to improve the UI.  You know, if you have two results, maybe it's better to have one result.  And that's a little more compact.  We tend to go for lots of information in the given pixels that we have.  But what's interesting to me is like I love Twitter.  I post on Twitter all the time.  And yet some of these services, they're almost like private forums and that you expect it's your data and you can pull it out and you can take it wherever you want.  But if if the service can restrict how well we can crawl or block us entirely or something like that, then it's not as much your data as you think it is.  Right. Which is a little bit of a strange situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been very vocal in my criticism of both Twitter and Facebook because they are essentially silos based on our content.  And that isn't the way it should be either.  And so I am sympathetic, actually, to Google's conundrum.  I'm sure you'd love. Well, let me not put words in your mouth.  Would you love to include Twitter and Facebook results in this social search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can only speak for me personally, but absolutely.  I mean, I've tweeted something like 15000 times.  That's a lot of signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of signal stored in Twitter, which in theory you own, but in fact, you do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter owns and Twitter restricts or think of after something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was with some guys from the Google Plus team when I went out to my book talk in Mountain View.  And I'm not revealing anything behind any curtains, but they were clearly disappointed that they no longer had Twitter live search.  These were not business people. These were product people who were creating the product that we're using.  But more data is only good, is only going to provide better services.  So, you know, I think if Google had been more clever, this is where Google has a problem with both Washington and Silicon Valley.  And they've got to watch this out, especially in Europe, I think, is they should have turned around and said, we're about to release this amazing new thing.  We wish it included Twitter. Why don't you go ask Twitter to let us do that?  And it would have turned the focus on Twitter and sort of the focus being on Google, seeming as if we're, you know,  it's monopoly, which it doesn't really have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a fantastic point.  I completely agree. And what's one thing that's been a little interesting is whenever we rolled out real time search,  I found a post by Andy Beard, who's a guy who's not always happy towards Google.  And he basically said, I hate real time search. It shows up all the time.  It's on by default. The UI is garish.  I don't want to surface all this sort of Twitter information in my search results.  And yet, you know, a couple of years later when we turned it off, people were like, oh, no, real time search is fantastic.  How will I know that Michael Jackson died or whatever?  And so I do think there's a really nice vision if we can deliver on it of something that's useful and not just the public web,  but distilling opinions of your friends or stuff that only you have access to.  If we can deliver on that, I think people will really love it. But we have to get the UI right.  We have to get the balance right.  Ideally, we can work with other people to try to surface that information from wherever it happens on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clarify this for me. Did Twitter pull the plug on that relationship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My understanding is that Google did put out a statement that said that.  And Google normally tries to be a very polite company.  So the fact that we would even go that far means there's a little bit of this, you know,  left at the altar, once bit and twice shy kind of feeling going on.  But that's my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think you made such a good point, which we had not heard before,  which is you don't build a service based on something that could be pulled so easily.  People are saying, well, they can search Facebook.  You can today. But but and we've seen Facebook do this.  They did it to Apple with Ping.  They said, yeah, we got a relationship until we don't.  And it's very embarrassing for a company like Apple to put out Ping with Google,  with Facebook integration, which they announced, and then not to have it.  So I can understand why as an engineer, you're not going to build something on that.  You don't want to have the Twitter debacle happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's not even like it was a hypothetical.  We had seen it happen six months ago and on the July 4th weekend of 2011.  And so to have it happen once, you're it's definitely once bit and twice shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, you were going to say something. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room made an interesting point, which is that it would be nice if users  could opt in to having their Twitter data crawled.  And an easy way to do that would be to open up the Google Plus API to make it right.  So I could say, hey, any time I post to Twitter or Facebook, also post this to Google Plus.  But that's not that has not happened yet.  And I understand the reasoning behind that.  You don't want Google Plus to just be this echo chamber for what goes on in other networks.  But but that would I mean, I would love that.  I would love to be able to have Google search capabilities across across across all my networks.  And it might be giving the users a little more power to do that versus making complicated  deals with these companies. I mean, of course, not everyone's going to opt to do that.  But a publisher like all of us sitting here who spend a lot of time putting things online  probably would opt into something like that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't. And again, I'm just speaking for myself personally.  I would love that. We have seen with Buzz where if there wasn't as much activity and then  you had the API, then Buzz would just become things that were syndicated from the other services  where you posted. But even if it were something where you could upload your own data, you know,  so that search plus your world, whatever it was, you know, maybe it was an XML feed.  I think that would be fantastic. We have I mean, we've seen stuff like Facebook with  their version of data liberation was we'll give you the lists of the names of your friends,  no no profile pages or anything.  So it's not don't you dare import them into Google Plus.  Yeah, it's unclear how much data you'd be able to lose for different services.  But I personally would think that would be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're waiting at Tim O'Reilly, I think is going to join us. We are going to wrap very soon.  Tim, are you there? Tim is in between flights.  And so we're going to try to get him via phone. He was getting his headphones.  He's getting his headphones from the airport. Is that what that sound was?  That was feedback from Tim O'Reilly. OK. And then we're going to wrap up.  If you're just tuning in and you're saying, why are they in black and white?  Or if you're watching one of the downloads and you've been banging on your TV for the last hour,  we're in black and white because today is January 18th, the day the internet sat up  and started fighting for itself. And like many other sites, we considered pulling ourselves  going black. And I decided that this would be a good compromise.  Black and white, the banner on the lower left that says,  visit AmericanCensorship.org. But I think we have a duty to pass along information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really glad you made this decision, Leo. I think it's the right decision.  And an email beforehand, Gina, and you and I are in this.  Lauren Weinstein did some really great posts on Google Plus arguing, all for protesting SOPA,  but saying that, and I'll put it in my words, that if you're going to tell the world that you're vital,  then you shouldn't cut yourself off. And he made a post using the word hospital in place of  Wikipedia and said, well, we're very important, but we have some problems and we're going to be  okay for 24 hours, go somewhere else. That's not a good idea. On the other hand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I commend Wikipedia because I do too. That was the single biggest stroke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think they did the right thing. They did. But you didn't have to do the  exact same thing. I think you're talking about the issue. You're giving ammunition to the folks who  rose up as a public of the internet. And I think that's important. If you go to boingboing.net,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you'll see 503 service intentionally unavailable. They really went dark. But of course, nobody  died from lack of boingboing. But we are going to have two of the editors of boingboing. Corey  couldn't join us because it's so late at night in Great Britain. But Mark Fronfelder will join us  for triangulation tonight, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time. And we'll spend an hour talking about  this issue. We're still waiting to hear from Tim O'Reilly. I really wanted to get Tim on because  he's been so eloquent. We're just having a little technical. We're just having some technical issues  because he is in fact at the airport. And it was very gracious of him to make some time in between

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  flights. And in the meantime, can I just say that I'm going to use this as a litmus test to see what  is the most savvy magazine because there really ought to be a magazine that puts Alexis Ohanian,  co-founder of Reddit, on the front cover and says this is the new face of politics.  He was really one of the lightning rods. Wikipedia had a huge amount of momentum deciding to go  completely dark. But it seems like Alexis kind of narrowed down the day and really was one of the  first to say we're going to go 100% dark. And Reddit is building a platform for changing politics  as well. And even before that's built, he's personally won over a lot of congresspeople.  I agree. I think that it probably will go unnoticed. But truthfully, this is a significant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  step forward in politics and in the internet and the power of use of geeks, the political power of  geeks, people who understand the issues, who care about the issues and are willing to stand up and  be counted. This is a huge day. And I think that's, we absolutely had to recognize it.  And I just wanted to find a way to recognize that that would allow us to have these great  conversations. Matt, I want to thank you. Matt Cutts works at Google, keeping the Google search  results spam free. And I'll tell you what, without Matt, I don't know. We really are grateful to the  work you do. We really appreciate it. We also thank you for taking some of the heat by proxy.  And I think you did it as always. And this is why Google is always great to have you on  and why Google I'm sure loves having you speak. You did a great job defending  the search plus your world. Thank you, Matt. We'll see you soon.  Take care. Thanks for having me. One of the great guys in the world.  We love Matt. We love Matt Cutts. And we love having him on. And I love having these kinds of  great conversations about the whole thing. Still waiting to hear from Tim O'Reilly. Do you want to,  I don't know if we had planned a tip and a number and a tool of the week, but we could do that,  Gina, if you've got a tip of the week. Gosh, it seems so, such a heavy  seems so trivial, doesn't it? I know what your tip is. Call your Congress critter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. I mean, that really is the tip of today. I just have to say again, it really is amazing to  see the internet become this amazing platform for democracy. And I want to see more action.  You know, I want, I want the web to kind of have this API to these big institutions to change them  and to stop stop legislation like this. I want to see more of this in the future.  And we will have more of this in the future because I think Clay Shirky pointed out in his Ted talk  that, you know, SOPA is just the next iteration of the DMCA. So, you know, there are going to be  others in the future. But back to my trivial tip, I picked up this site notification control.com.  We all kind of get a little too much email. A lot of it is, you know, what they call bacon or  notifications from different social networks. This site notification control just has a,  it's basically just a list of links to various services, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube,  Foursquare, where you can control that exact page. Set what notification email. I like that email.  And you don't want to set up the filters in your mail account. You can just go do a quick,  a quick audit, very similar to my tip a couple of weeks ago to my permissions. Just do a quick  audit of, you know, what's sending you what for, you know, for what reason, what kind of notifications  are you getting notification every time someone mentions you or if someone DMs you, that kind of  thing. And my, the second part of this is a shameless plug. My, my app for Android to do dot  text touch has been ported to iOS. So it's available on the iPad and I hope you'll check it out. If you  go to to do txt.com, you'll see it for iOS. Excellent. Thanks to Dropbox and it's the, it's,  100% nerdware, proudly nerdware. So I hope you check that out. Thank you, Gina. We're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  get Jeff's number in my tool of the week. But before we do, let's say hello to Tim O'Reilly  of O'Reilly Media. Tim, are you there? Hi, yes, I am. Thank you so much. I know this is a hardship.  You're in between flights, but such an important day. And I don't know if you've heard the news  because you were on a plane. We just talked to Trevor Tim of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  29 members of Congress today have retracted support for SOPA. Yes, I did see that. And I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually kind of interested to see that 26 of them were Republicans. Yes. Now, so that makes me  wonder where are the Democrats and in particular, you know, being from California, I, I wonder about  Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein being on the wrong side of PIPA. Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tim, you've written such great posts on Google Plus about these bills and about reframing  the argument, which I think, as usual, you're really a deep thinker on this. I encourage people  to read your posts. One of the one of the issues being, of course, that intellectual property  isn't really property in the same way that we understand, you know, a car, a cell phone or a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  house to be. Well, I guess I don't even really want to go there. What I suggested in my post,  there were two or three things. First of all, I totally agree with all the issues that have  been raised about Internet censorship and the dangers of going down that path. But I thought,  well, there's a lot of people already talking about that. And what could I add to the discussion?  And what I thought I could add was the perspective of a publisher for whom, you know,  piracy is really not that big a problem. I mean, we know that our books are pirated. They appear  on torrents all the time. They're also just, by the way, the books that are most often stolen from  libraries, according to librarians, you know, interesting. Those darn programmers, they're such  thieves. Does that mean that we don't want our books to be in libraries? No. Does it mean that  we want to shut down libraries because they're, you know, havens for shoplifting? You know,  the whole idea is first of all, so anyway, I wanted to bring that personal experience in there,  but I also wanted to bring in a bit of historical perspective. You know, I found, for example,  in one of my posts, this wonderful letter from one of the Harper brothers back in the 1860s,  where he was responding to complaints from author Anthony Trollope that Harper brothers had pirated  his novel Orly Farm. And, you know, Harper went on to basically say, look, we're doing the best we  can. You know, it wasn't the international copyright treaty. And so they would just go buy,  you know, what they called early sheets of various novels. And in this particular case,  um, uh, uh, Trollope had sold them to Lippincott, which was in Philadelphia,  rather than the Harper brothers. And they were like, well, we have a series of Trollope novels.  You're interfering with our ability to do commerce. So they went and published a pirated edition.  And you look at this and you go, American publishing began with piracy. And now these companies are  complaining. But the fact is new markets begin in a very chaotic and disorderly way. And it's really  evidence of market failure. And so I want to just to bring that historical perspective in  and to say, yes, there are problems right now. But as, as a matter of industrial policy,  do we as a nation want to say, let's try to stop the future until our old line companies can get  their act together to serve the market in a way that satisfies it? Or do we want to just say,  hey, the market is moving, get with the program. Now I have been spending, you know,  I started publishing ebooks in 1987, you know, and I, you know, you know, been waiting for this  moment. And first, the last thing that's a problem for publishers, the big problem is they've been so  afraid of piracy is they haven't actually taken first mover advantage, right? You know, and,  and they're going to hurt a hell of a lot more from Amazon stealing their authors than they are  going to hurt from piracy. And so if they had been more proactive about embracing the market  and finding ways to deliver to customers what they want, they'd be way better off. So it's just  misdirected, you know, energy to try to get Congress to impose laws because you haven't acted to serve

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  customers. Tim O'Reilly, I'll let you get your flight. Thank you so much. Read Tim on Google Plus.  He's been using that lately. Of course, O'Reilly Media is also on the internet at OReilly.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google Plus... We're blacked out today. So yeah, you can probably read the stuff on Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus. Tim, it's great to talk to you. Thank you so much for making some time with us. Thank you for  being a great leader and an eloquent leader in this subject. All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks,  Tim O'Reilly from O'Reilly Media. OReilly.com. Yes, it's blacked out, but there's a lot of good  information there and of course on his Google Plus account. Thank you, Tim. Take care. TNT coming up  in a bit, but first, Jeff's number of the week. Real quick. Facebook finally exceeds Orkut in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brazil. In December, it's 36.1 million members beat Orkut's 34.4 million. So as Google becomes  more social in one way, the other way kind of goes a little bit in the sunset. My tool of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  week is I just have fallen in love with Google Currents. Google Currents is an app for iPhone  and Android phones that is a really great way and tablets, I should mention there's an iPad version,  great way to get news both from your Google reader account and other sources. This is in some ways the  flipboard for Android. Really a great way to read and consume content and free. Currents is the name  of it. You can find it in both the iOS and the Android marketplace and for the iPad as well. If  you haven't taken a look at it, I highly recommend you do. Some really nice features make it easy to  read, easy to share and very attractive. I have it. You know, the only request I'd have is can you  guys make an Android widget? I want a widget please. No widget means no desktop space. I've got a page  just waiting for you right there. Right there. I'd put it right there on my Google widget page.  Currents. Thank you, Matt Cutts. Thank you, Jeff. Have a great day. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Thank you,  Gina Trapani. Thank you all for watching in black and white. The facts are black and white. They're  simple. They're straightforward. Before this day is out, I hope you will all contact your member  of Congress. Phone them. It's the best way to do it. If you want a phone number, go to blacklist.  I'm sorry, blackout.eff.org. They will help you find the phone number you need and you can strike out  against censorship of the internet and stop those internet blacklist bills. In fact, let's stop it so  hard that they don't come back with another. What do you say? Let's hold the line.  And thank you for joining us. We do this show every Wednesday afternoon at 1 p.m. Civic, 4 p.m. Eastern  time. That would be 2100UTC at twit.tv. You can always get the show audio and video available  after the fact from twit.tv or subscribe on iTunes or the Zoom marketplace or anywhere podcasts are  available. We do appreciate your subscription. It helps us count how many of you listen and by  doing so, we can make a little money so that we can keep doing this show. We thank you very much  for joining us and we'll see you next week in color and living color on This Week in Google.  Trevor, Tim is an attorney with eff.org. Do you have a title, Trevor, or just an attorney?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, I'm an activist.  An activist.  Yes, although I am a lawyer, I'm not practicing. So I'm an activist and writer for eff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. Welcome. EFF is the Electronic Frontier Foundation. We've spoken, of course,  many times with many of its founders, including Mitch Kapoor, John Perry Barlow. We've told you  many times, support eff. We do. We donate every month to eff. And if you go to eff.org right now,  you can see a lot more about the internet blacklist bills, SOPA and PIPA. And of course,  they've put that big bar, stop censorship bar across the top. So let's actually do a little news  bit first, Trevor. How are these protests working? How widespread are they? Are they effective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is probably the most effective online protests  we've ever seen. We had major sites black out their websites and protests. Wikipedia,  obviously is the biggest. They're six largest site in the country. But we also had Craigslist,  Huffington Post, Wired, eff, a bunch of others. Reddit. Reddit was the one that started this.  And we've seen 29 congressmen change their position today already. And the day isn't even half over.  So it's been basically an avalanche. Every 15 minutes, it seems we're getting news that  a new congressman has changed his mind. And a lot of them are co-sponsors too. So that's where it  really hits home is when the people who supported this bill from the beginning decide, you know,  we're going to start listening to our constituents and oppose this bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, boy, that is a stunning number. What is it? 29 members of Congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  29. That was a half hour ago. At this point, it might be 30 or 31.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fantastic. And I think the key here, and I'm sure you would agree as an activist, is  people I think sometimes feel like they cannot influence Congress. Well, there is no greater  influence than your vote. So the key here is really being an activist, calling your member  of Congress, giving them your name, the city you're from, make sure they understand you are  a voter in their district, and being clear that this is your opinion and it carries some weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. We encourage everyone to call in. If they can hear your voice,  it's even better than email. Obviously emails are great. We have a petition for sending out emails.  It's already gotten, since last night at midnight, it's gotten 250,000 emails sent to Congress.  Apparently the Senate servers were knocked off for a little while today because their websites  were overloaded. Their phones have been ringing off the hook. Google actually participated in the  blackout too. They had their logo blacked out. You can still search, and they asked people to  take action. So far today, they've gotten 4 million signatures on their petition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's amazing. I think that that was job one was to raise awareness. Because unfortunately,  technical issues like this do not capture the public interest. Congress is embroiled in a debt  crisis, in an economic crisis. All of the news channels, when they cover Congress, and I've  been watching carefully over the last few days, cover that. They don't mention SOPA and PIPA.  So it's up to us to spread the word to everybody, let them know, and then have them call Congress  and put this on the front burner. I have to say, we cannot count on mainstream media. I was just  watching CNN. Who's on CNN to talk about this? Remember, CNN is owned by Time Warner. Warner  Brothers Films, ring a bell, and the Motion Picture Association of America's head. Former  Senator Chris Dodd is on saying piracy costs jobs in Hollywood. We've got to pass this bill.  He's effectively calling this protest terrorism. So I think that it's very important that we  that we treat this with the urgency that it requires. Can we declare victory, Trevor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We lost him. We lost him. Ah, shoot. We're trying to call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We think Skype is taking a day off. That's fine. Look at Google.com. I've got it up on my site.  It's, that is great. And right there, tell Congress, please don't censor the web. The link on the front,  that's the petition. And they have 14 million signatures so far. I hope this gives people a  feeling of power. I think I hope this. I hope this tells people, actually, 4 million, not 14  million. I hope this tells people that we can make a difference. And I hope that people realize that  this is not over. All this does is send the RIAA and the MPAA back into the trenches.  They're going to figure out a way to do this more gradually, more secretively. Now you understand  why the ACTA Treaty was being pushed in secret. They know that people don't want this. We got him  back. So my question to you, Trevor, was can we declare victory today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, definitely not. I mean, today has been great. The problem is that the Senate is still  scheduled to vote on this bill, Protect IP, next week. And the House has indicated that they're  going to continue marking up the bill in February. So the fight is far from over. We have to remember,  we started with the DAC stacked against us because Hollywood had outspent the internet 13 to 1 in  Congress. This bill was basically dropped on Congress's front doorstep by the music and movie  industries. They wrote the whole thing with no input from these internet companies at all.  And when you hear this bill will stop online piracy and you don't really read into it,  who's against that, right? The senators who originally signed on, and there was over 40 of  them, which is almost unprecedented for co-sponsors, never really read through the bill. They didn't  understand how much free speech it would censor and how many ordinary users who've never really  thought about copyright infringement it would affect. So now that they're seeing this pushback  and it's honestly massive and unprecedented, I mean, 4 million signatures on petition in less  than a day is, I've never heard of that. They're starting to wake up and understand what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  initially signed up for is not what they thought. Well, Trevor, I know you've got a lot to do today  and there's a lot more to do. I encourage everybody to visit EFF.org and read up on  the bills. I mean, it's more than just casting your vote or calling your member of Congress.  You need to know, you need to understand why this is a bad idea so that you can argue effectively  with friends and family who say, but piracy is a bad thing. We've got to stop piracy. They need  to understand why this doesn't work. And this is, it's up to all of us as educated geeks  to take action. Geeks tend to like to sit on our dofs and enjoy life and our gadgets. Well,  we want to preserve what we enjoy and this is time to act. EFF.org. Trevor, thank you so much for  coming on. We really appreciate it. Yeah, thanks for having me. Appreciate it. And EFF.org slash  action is the action page on EFF. That's fantastic. Just really. Yeah, or you can go  to blacklist.eff.org as well. Oh, I like that. All right. Thank you, Trevor. Thank you. Trevor,  Tim, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
