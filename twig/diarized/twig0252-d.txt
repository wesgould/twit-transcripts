Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did just get out of the sauna, so my hair is wet.  Oh, you're relaxed now. You're relaxed.  I tried to burn the cold out of my sinuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it freezing? Oh, you have a cold. I'm sorry.  Well, it's very kind of you to be with us. You're in Germany for a Google event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Google Big Tent event in full disclosure as they flew me over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is a Big Tent event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Google trying to make nice with the world. Policy, media, that kind of stuff. And they bring together panel discussions.  I've been to three or four of them, and they've hold them all around.  It's mainly the international side. They've had a few in D.C., but they'll have discussions about tomorrow.  It's about media and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea that it says on the Big Tent event page is to bring together many points of view about the impact of the Internet on society.  Right.  So Big Tent event number two. There are 20 events in Europe. Wow. Look, they're all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're going to make a lot of them. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're speaking about what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm doing 10 minutes on kind of Germany and media and Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that should be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to really, really rake them over the coals?  I'll try to have a little subtlety to it.  By the way, that other voice is, of course, the great Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org, ThinkUp.com and host.  We're very proud to say host of All About Android on Tuesday nights on this show along with Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Hello. Hello. Good to be here. Welcome.  I'll try to be lively if Jeff is sleepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought we'd just do this show at a very low key. I think we should all match his energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I can match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just very relaxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like very chill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't listen to this show while driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a little bit going on. Not really too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all members of the slow talkers of America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a great Bob and Ray routine, which nobody but Jeff and I are old and is old enough to even know who Bob and Ray are.  Sad. We just love them.  You'll be talking about them. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just appreciate making fun of slow talkers.  That's why I was laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a close talker. He's a slow talker between the two of us.  It's a mess. It's horrible.  So, Jake, did you get a chance to watch anything of Apple's event on Monday?  Because Google seemed to be the subtext there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that I didn't catch much of it at all.  And I read a few summaries afterwards.  And it didn't sound like there was a whole lot there.  I don't know.  What was how was Google a subtext?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A couple of ways.  You know, Apple for a while has been trying to get Google off of iOS and disintermediates Google and searches on iOS with Siri, for instance.  If you search for something with Siri, even the search, the web search done with Google is is hidden from Google app.  Only Google only sees Apple.  They're bringing that to the desktop.  So spotlight searches now will search everything, not just your hard drive, but search the Internet for information.  You will be able to see it being right.  It will use Bing.  In some cases, it may use Google.  I guess Safari will continue to use Google.  But if you use the desktop spotlight search, it'll use Bing.  And even then it will not.  You won't be visible to Bing.  Apple will.  But it will also use Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia and all sorts of stuff.  I mean, it's very clear Apple has decided.  I think Apple has decided to market itself as the antithesis to Google, the privacy and security company.  And and so they're offering, for instance, they're offering or plan to offer iCloud Drive, which will have roughly the same price as Google Drive.  It's going to be very inexpensive.  Five gigs free.  And then I think it's a buck ninety nine a month for one hundred gigs.  They're going to offer app engine style services for developers so you could put your app on the iCloud and it'll actually support a surprisingly large amount of data.  I can remember what they said was quite a bit of data for free.  It does very much feel like Apple saying, all right, Google, all right, Google, take this, take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It certainly sounded like some of the iOS updates were very Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're doing a lot of the things Android has been doing all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been doing for a long time.  Yeah. And DuckDuckGo is now an option for private search and Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. When you use it's not even an option when you use private search and Safari defaults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's that's a big deal for DuckDuckGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, good. It's kind of a pat in the back for them.  Apple also. Yeah, they did a lot of things that Google has been doing in on Android.  You know, the fact that you could put in Swipe, for instance, they showed Swipe third party keyboards on iOS to me is a big deal.  That was one of the main reasons I left iOS.  They they're supposedly going to come out with a bigger screen iPhone this fall.  If they do, that will be two of the big reasons I left iOS.  And they're offering some interesting reasons to go to iOS.  For instance, their touch ID, their fingerprint sensor on the 5S is going to have an opener, more open API.  You'll third parties will be able to use it, which means banking apps, last pass, things like that might be used.  That's really cool. I think that's very cool, especially since it works so well.  We were hoping they would do that. Yeah, that's big.  That's really big. They are going to provide a form of inter app communications, a la Android.  You know, when you on Android install a new application, it's added to your share menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will be doing that now on iOS. That was also a huge drawback on iOS. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had Twitter, Facebook, email, and that was airdrop.  That was about it. Now you'll be able and you'll also as a developer, you'll be able to write extensions that will then plug into services like not just the share service.  And by the way, as a developer, you have to explicitly plug into the share service.  Your extensions are a standalone binary that are part of the installation.  And I think Apple's really paying close attention to preserving security by making sure that the inter app communications are very constrained, locked down.  They encourage you in the documentation to make it look like the place you're going, not the place you've come from, things like that.  I think they're actually doing it quite elegantly.  And somebody said, I'm curious what you think as a developer, Gina, and an Android user, although also used an iPhone for a long time.  They said that it's easier.  Somebody said it's easier and probably more secure to go from a locked down state to less locked down as Apple has done than to go in the other direction as Google has done or Android has done to go from completely wide open to kind of slowly tightening down the nuts or Microsoft slightly tightening down the nuts.  That seems to make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would agree with that.  I would agree with that.  It's sort of like you can lower prices, right?  You can't really raise them.  Yeah, that's a good analogy.  It's very similar.  This is kind of copy and paste.  We're just seeing this happen over and over again where these basic functions on iOS had to wait for a really long time.  But when they came, they were done very well.  I mean, it's almost like Android is the canary in the coal mine and Apple observes and then does their own take on it.  And their take on it is usually very beautiful and very functional.  And they have the advantage of sort of learning from other implementations of what the issues are with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they're moving into Google territory, things like home automation.  Google made a lot of noise about Google at home, but never really delivered.  The queue died.  Yeah, the queue.  Now, I should absolutely point out that everything that happened on Monday at WWDC was similar, was an announcement of something that is going to come to us.  Although we have seen a developer release of iOS 8 and people will tell me that there are a lot of nice features in this implementation.  It does seem to be fairly solid.  But it is a case of Apple saying, well, we're going to do home automation.  And that's something Google has said to Microsoft has been saying it for more than a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you see anything at the Apple conference that makes you say no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they do at WWDC, they don't show any hardware at all.  It's not like Google I.O.  They say here's the they say you're going to get today iOS 8 pre-release.  And when I say you, I mean developers, it's a developer show and you're going to get OS 10, 10.10, which they've decided to name Yosemite.  You're going to get that. You can download that. You can start playing with it.  Here's the specs. Here's the API.  Here's some of the new features, not all.  And we want you to start developing for it.  But they don't say, oh, and here's our here's our Apple at home device.  Now, they do already have eye beacons and it looks like eye beacons, which is the Bluetooth low energy.  I'm here. I'm here.  It's going to be used in a lot of interesting ways.  I think what Apple said and again, they've got to implement it was very compelling.  So much so that I have to say, I think probably come this fall, they may have eliminated reasons for me not to use an iPhone.  I might might look at going back to iOS for my main phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see. They got to get a bigger screen.  I can't use that for a four inch screen. That's crazy.  It's crazy talk.  But I but you know, the keyboard was that was one of the reasons I was dying to and the notification shade got better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. More Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although it's hard to say what is Android's notification shade, because every of course, if you have a Nexus five, you know what the pure version is.  But every manufacturer, Samsung, HTC, LG, everybody has their own very variation on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I just meant rich notifications that you can, you know, that you can add controls like reply or tweet or skip the next song or pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those will be treated as I understand as extensions.  So that's another kind of extension.  Oh, I see. And so and by the way, that'll go to the desktop as well.  Oh, I know another thing they're going to add.  Touchless voice.  So you'll be able to say and I have to say I like this better than OK, Google now.  Hey, Siri.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it. I'm abandoning all Android, all Google products.  Hey, Siri. Hey, Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a little bit on the book on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not moving until you can say, yo, Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri. Yes, Siri.  But, you know, it's funny is it reminds me that I almost always say, hey, Siri, anyway.  It's like the episode of Veep on Sunday where or two Sundays ago.  Hey, Siri, how many how many horses died in World War One?  He literally said, hey, Siri.  And I feel like that's what everybody does anyway.  That the software must just be discarding the first few words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's a subtle difference.  But Siri is like is a persona, whereas Google is sort of just the ever present computer.  So it's interesting that you say, OK, Google versus Hey, Siri.  It's more like you're addressing a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm telling you, if they get Scarlett Johansson's voice, it is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's over. Oh, I loved her, by the way.  What do you think? Great movie.  Really enjoyed it. Really good movie.  Yeah, it was it was beautiful. It was compelling. It was very, really good.  And it raises very interesting issues. Yeah.  You will just buy an iPhone, you'll bury it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there is those who have.  Hell, if you can marry a pillow in Japan, you can marry an iPhone here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, that got dead silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can. Hello. Hello, Jason. Go ahead.  Jason Howell's new desk is right behind your head.  Jeff Jarvis.  So if you see a very tall person just slowly get your hand out of there.  Sinks Jason Sinks slowly in the West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were a little concerned because at first we could see the top of his head over that partition.  That's prime real estate right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lowered his chair. Oh, yeah, that's a good seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's the good seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he can't talk on the phone while the shows are on. Right.  Can you talk on the phone while the shows are on, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's talking on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's not listening. He's muted.  He's muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. This is it's a pretty directional mic.  I bet he could he could talk like this. Yeah, Mike probably wouldn't pick it up.  We have this problem in general.  Everybody in the office has to kind of go in the kitchen if they want to talk on the phone.  That's OK. We're a bunch of introverted nerds.  Nobody wants to talk on the phone anyway. Yeah.  All right. I think that's enough.  I just wanted to bring it up because it did feel very much like Apple was targeting Google  in a lot of the things that they were bringing to the iPhone and doing, I think, a lot of the right things to provide an alternative to Google and not copy Google,  but to say if you want these features, but you want them where your privacy is going to be kind of preserved, then we're going to provide an alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But hold on there one second. So Apple's going to going to hide your identity from all these services,  which means you don't get the customization opportunities you want.  They want a B. Who's to say we trust Apple with all this information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, I'm not saying one does, but if one does, then one would be happier with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Apple has anyone trust Apple can create a cloud experience that actually works.  That's a big, big bloopers here.  You know, like I mean, when you said App Engine on Apple, I was like, no, no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that may change if they can. You're right. They haven't delivered ever.  And they have some horrific failures with mobile me and so forth.  One hopes that they will do better, but it remains to be seen.  They did call Android a toxic hell stew.  Oh, you missed that?  I did.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm surprised you didn't talk about that last night on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had to miss last night. I'm sure actually they did. I had to miss last night.  Did they sit down stage? That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They quoted Adrian Kingsley Hughes, who is a ZDNet writer, and he says Android fragmentation.  He's talking about the fragmentation has turned devices.  Here's the exact quote from ZDNet into a toxic hell stew of vulnerabilities.  I completely disagree.  But they did. They put that in quotes on a big slide on the screen.  Wow, that's making Adrian very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a far cry from the days when they didn't mention their competitors.  I mean, the one place where Apple has a really long way to go and a lot of work to do is the developer tools.  I mean, iTunes Connect, the app tools, the tools they give you as an app developer, mobile app developer in particular,  because that's where my skills are, compared to the Play Store console.  I mean, Google is far and away much kinder to developers just in terms of stats and tools and the ways to see how your app is doing and improve that.  I mean, Apple's always had extreme empathy for users, right?  And I think that Google's core competency is extreme empathy for developers, right?  So like Google makes really great tools for nerds and Apple makes really great tools for humans.  But if Apple wants developers to feel better about developing for their platform and using things like their version of App Engine,  I think that they really have a lot of work to do there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, last night's episode of All About Android was titled Swimming in a Toxic Hell Stew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of a tribute.  Clearly, yes.  So, I mean, you're a developer. You've developed for both platforms.  It seems to me you have a good standing to talk about this.  So you think that it's more pleasurable to develop for Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I was Android first and I was a Java programmer before Android.  So Android was a lot very attractive to me.  Like I never really got my feet with Objective-C in the way that I would have liked or the way that I felt that I did with Android.  And I was developing for Android a lot earlier.  So I am certainly biased.  But I do know the developer tools for Android are way better.  I do know that you have to test across a lot more devices and there are a lot more configurations to make sure that your app works on Android than iOS.  So there's give and take there.  Right?  I mean, the fragmentation issue still is an issue.  But just talking about purely the tools for uploading your binary and distributing it to testers and seeing, you know,  what countries your app is doing well in and how your localizations are doing and that kind of thing.  Google beats Apple's tools hands down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think it would be fair to say that Java is a toxic hellstool.  JavaScript is a toxic hellstool.  But that's another.  But Java and JavaScript really are somewhat of a hellstool.  And in fact, Objective-C is not much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Apple responded to that.  And I guess you missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Apple has introduced a replacement for Objective-C.  They're calling it Swift.  They're saying it's significantly faster than Objective-C.  So that's good news.  And it avoids basically what they I could I think I could safely synopsizes and say what they've done is eliminated downward compatibility,  eliminated all the things from C that they put in Objective-C just so it would be C friendly.  Does this mean you have to rewrite apps now?  You do not.  Objective-C is not deprecated or replaced.  In fact, you can write apps in both languages at once.  But the idea is it is an expressive tool for writing code for a cocoa and cocoa touch that is desktop and iOS.  I think it's a beautiful language, a very nice language.  And they've provided something very interesting called Playgrounds,  which reminds me a lot of, say, the Python interpreter where you can go in the interpreter and try statements, try code and see what happens.  Now, the Playground gives you a graphical interface that lets you try code.  It's really a debugger because you can use a scrubber to go back and forth in your code, see how it impacts the graphical output, modify it, get instant changes.  Very interesting programming language.  I think developers are going to like a lot.  It's not going to be hard to learn.  It's C-like.  But they've eliminated some of the things that made C dangerous and Objective-C dangerous.  They've eliminated some of the things that you don't need anymore.  And they've eliminated some of the constructs that were unsafe.  It uses not strong typing.  It's typed by inference.  But it is fairly immutable typing.  So variables are initialized, must be initialized before use.  They have built-in array and integer overflow checking.  Instead of garbage collection, which is what Java does, they use reference counting.  Objective-C.  Yeah, they call it ARC.  I think that this might be an interesting...  I'd love to get your take on it at some point.  I know it's probably not high on your list, but it reminds me of Python or Ruby, which I love, these scripted languages, but has the efficiency of Objective-C.  Because it compiles down to the LLVM.  And the benchmarks they showed were kind of, as usual, carefully chosen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, of course.  I am excited about that, particularly around the tools.  I think that over the last few years of all these learning how to code tools, we've seen a lot of interactive editors.  And then as you type, see how your code affects things.  And I'd love to see those built into modern IDEs, even something as advanced as Xcode.  Anything that helps developers be more productive and not have to think about things like memory management and garbage collection.  Those are a good thing.  It means better apps. It means faster deploys.  Yeah, I'm excited about Swift. I'm definitely going to play around with it.  Because like I said, I never quite got into Objective-C.  And I always found it sort of frustrating and foreign.  So yeah, I would definitely check out Swift.  I'd even rewrite my app in Swift, just for the fun of it.  Yeah, I think it looks pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I downloaded it and started playing with it immediately.  Because I like...  Frankly, I think what's interesting about this is it's going to encourage...  By the way, this is free.  Everybody who uses a Mac can use it. It's not cross-platform.  Objective-C was cross-platform. It's not cross-platform.  This is Apple only.  But they offer free documentation.  It's 99 bucks to become an Apple developer.  And then you get access to a ton of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll stay on that for a second.  It's never been easy to write apps for both platforms.  Does this make it yet harder?  Yes. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you start writing in Swift, you're not writing cross-platform.  You're writing to the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But if you're writing in Objective-C, you're also writing for the platform too.  I mean, Objective-C, you could write on other platforms, but no one ever...  I mean, it's kind of like Java now.  Really, people are building Android apps in Java, right?  Like theoretically, sure, there are other things you can write Java for.  But particularly the Android SDK or the whole set of Android-specific classes.  That's Android only.  There are some frameworks that help you build an app and then deploy to native code on both platforms.  I don't know how good they are.  But there are people out there trying to solve that problem.  But Apple is not going to solve that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to do it at a very high level.  And games, there's Unity and there's other things that let you do that.  But if you want to...  It's always been the case.  I'm sure with Todo.Text, you didn't share any or much code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. No. I mean, the design pattern, sure.  Like the objects and things.  But no, there's no shared code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This lets itself, by the way, very well to design patterns.  A lot of the things they've done are...  It's fairly modern.  But as people in the chat room are saying, Go is just as modern.  Java has fixed many of these problems.  I know Apple has no interest in being cross-platform.  Right.  It's not in their interest.  Yeah, it's not in their interest.  Microsoft is interesting.  Microsoft is a little more open to that notion.  But Apple is saying, you know, this is for writing for our stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I think it was Farhad Manju who was asking, you know,  why are companies building new programming languages right now?  You know, it happens not as often as platforms or apps.  But it is interesting to see like Go and Swift and new languages emerge.  Because at some point you say, like, haven't we figured out every way  to express a certain thing?  I just think requirements change and different kinds of hardware change  and the problems become a little more common.  And I think certain languages is handled in a little better.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think also the fads and trends in programming, things like design patterns,  often lend themselves better to new languages and old languages.  And people write the languages around the trends in programming.  And I think Go is a good example of that.  I'm sure Swift is as well.  You will like it that, you know, remember, I don't know if you remember this,  but Apple bought a company called TestFlight a few months ago.  Developers are very disappointed because they used TestFlight to beta test apps for iOS.  Apple bought them.  And the good news is, is they have immediately made it available  even under the same name, TestFlight.  So now you can have a thousand beta testers instead of a hundred on your iOS app.  The process is easier.  It's much easier to get feedback and so forth.  So that's also good.  TestFlight is a godsend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I use TestFlight to do text.  I literally could not figure out how to have people beta test my, you know,  with Android you like email the APK.  Say, here's the file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Install it.  Here's the file.  Install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, okay, maybe you have to uncheck allow unknown sources and Android, right?  But with an iOS app, it's a whole rigmarole.  You have to get the device ID and allocate license.  I didn't even understand.  I went through the steps.  You know, I went through the 26 steps that it took to do it in the end.  I didn't really know what I did.  And I just prayed and it worked.  But TestFlight made that a lot easier.  Still, TestFlight was a pain.  You had to ask people to join TestFlight and add their device.  And then you could issue them.  Anyway, this is kind of what I was talking about.  And this is just about the issue of having your app distributed only through the app store  and approval and all that stuff.  So the TestFlight acquisition was certainly a step in the right direction.  TestFlight is great, but it's solving a problem that just doesn't exist in the Play Store.  Yeah, it's a problem Apple created, really.  Right.  It's a problem that they created, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, to jailbreak an iPhone requires all sorts of maneuvers and hoops.  You have to jump through and you can't do it with current versions of iOS, et cetera, et cetera.  To jailbreak an Android phone, you just go into Settings and you check the box that says,  Allow third-party apps.  And that's it.  You're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right to sideload, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all jailbreaking does in iOS, which just kind of says something.  People make such a big deal to do that.  So, yeah, I mean, I think I said this on Monday.  There is still a very big gulf between proprietary and open.  And there are advantages to being proprietary.  As you know, in Germany, the trains ran on time under Mussolini.  Oh, that was Italy.  Right.  But sometimes fascism benefits.  But I think generally I come down on the side of openness.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little more chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chaos.  It's chaotic.  It's a toxic hell stew.  And we like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we got a title.  And we might have to steal it from the AI.  We like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to take a break, come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis, poor guy.  He just got out of the sauna.  His brain is bubbling still.  A Wiener Schnitzel in a sauna.  That's a recipe for disaster.  Not bad, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's barely moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina Trappan.  Do you have a cold?  Are you a little under the weather too?  Oh, my God.  It's the walking wounded here.  Well, I'm feeling pretty good.  I had nothing to say about Apple development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I guess you're probably right.  Finally, I'm tired.  And you're talking about Apple stuff.  Gina gets a word in edgewise finally on the show.  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Ben tells me in Germany, the trains never run on time.  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the Germans complain mentally about the trains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they don't now.  That's the point.  And was it?  I'll move on.  We're going to take a break.  I don't want to go too down this road.  We're going to take a break and come back in a moment with more.  We're talking about, in fact, we'll get our Google Change log in here.  Let Jeff take a little bit longer nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where we, as in Gina Trippani, give you all the things that have changed at Google this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell it's the month of Google I.O. because there's a lot going on.  So let's see if I can punch through this.  So I guess the big announcement this month is that Google announced that they're working on a new Chrome extension called End to End,  which kind of sounds dirty, but it's not. It streamlines the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like the last episode of Silicon Valley, if we're going to be perfectly honest.  Oh, that was middle to middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Middle to middle.  Middle to middle. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Different kind of encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Different kind of encryption.  This Chrome extension streamlines the process of using PGP to encrypt your email when you're using Gmail.  So this extension actually hasn't been released yet.  Google just released the code for review by the community.  They want to make sure that it's as secure as it absolutely should be.  So it's up on code.google.com. You can check it out.  It's a Chrome extension, so it's basically JavaScript.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very early.  It's not in the extension store because it's really, they want to have people look at it and bang on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And this is something that we've talked about on the show a bunch of times.  You know, what are the implications?  If your email, if your content is encrypted in your browser and sent via Gmail to someone else and they decrypted on their client,  Gmail doesn't see the content.  They can't advertise to you against a bunch of jumbled letters.  Right.  So this is Google at their best.  I mean, I feel like this is Google really not being evil.  And I'm excited.  I hope that this extension works well.  I hope it supports other web mail providers than just Gmail.  They say it will.  And yeah, that's an ambitious goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's JavaScript, which is great.  It uses a JavaScript open PGP library.  So it's open.  It's open source.  You can look at the source because it's JavaScript and it's and it will work anywhere because it's you know, it's built in encryption.  This is exciting.  I think this is really the best.  I'm thrilled that Google's are doing this.  I think their attitude is, well, most people won't do it all the time.  So it's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  I guess.  Yeah. I don't think it's gonna be on by default.  I think that you're gonna have to say I'm sending an email I care about and encrypt this and hopefully it'll be a button.  It'll be that easy.  What else we got?  OK. Chromecast.  A few new Chromecast enabled apps.  The watch ESPN app.  My sport, the sports fan in my house is very excited about this.  Watch ESPN app is now Chromecast enabled.  You can also watch time for the World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Major League Soccer via the MLS match day app and MLS live as a premium services.  The crunchy roll video service, which has a bunch of TV and video content also now Chromecast enabled.  And you can also stream your photos and videos in the Google Plus app to the Chromecast.  So you can enable that feature.  You tap the cast button and the photos view of the Google Plus app on iOS or Android.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's a good one.  I wanted to see pictures of my kid that my wife took all day while I was at work at the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you see something cool, you can say, hey, you know, let me show you this.  That's great.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Really nice.  What else we got?  Oh, Google launches a 64 bit version of Chrome, starting with the Dev and Canary channels.  And this is for Windows 7 and Windows 8.  So both cases, the 64 bit version is offered by default.  If you're running the 64 bit flavor of Windows, the 32 bit version, of course, is still available.  And the reason why they're building the 64 bit version is it's just better, better speed, better security, better stability for 64 bit Windows users.  Google Plus, the Google Plus app for iOS is catching them playing a little catch up with Android.  It just got updated with the stories, which came out for Android a couple of weeks ago and photo filters.  So you can download that now on devices running iOS 6 or later.  That's the really cool feature that kind of takes your photos and figures out where you were and makes this sort of story that you can page through and see where you went.  And I think, Leo, you demoed a story that you made from your one of your trips and your pictures.  Really cool feature, really cool feature.  So iOS users get that now. Yeah, automatically.  It is awesome.  Let's see. Google's adding a one click hangout button that you can add anywhere on any web page, any app.  It's basically a start button for starting hangouts.  And they're targeting, it seems like, companies, enterprise customers who want to offer customer service hangouts or job interviews or, you know, instant meetings and their apps.  It's already been available to select Google enterprise customers that they've used it in a bunch of ways, including embedding it into online collaboration files, customer support apps and sales apps and interacting with job candidates.  So now it's become available to everyone.  So the buttons super customizable.  You can render it in markup, HTML5, JavaScript.  It's available in many languages.  So you can basically just kick off a hangout from anywhere.  Finally, earlier this week, and I'm sure my co-host talked about this last night on all about Android, Google posted factory images for the latest build of Android 4.4.3.  And the updated start to roll out to Google Experience Android devices.  One of the updates, I think this is a pretty, a pretty light update, but one of the updates includes a refresh design of the dialer app.  So you got a new color scheme, blue, black, gray and white.  And the action bar turned went from gray to blue.  And I think that this is the kind of design refresh we're going to see across a bunch of Google Apps at I.O. later on this month.  So I think we're going to see more of this.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google Change log.  I'm excited about the encryption.  I think it's going to be a big, big deal because it's you can do it now, but you have to install a plug in.  And, you know, it's just not easy.  It's not for the everyday person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, you know, and it puts pressure on other web mail providers and actually didn't include this in this bit of the story.  But as part of this announcement about the end to end, Google published this transparency report about which web mail providers support which kinds of encryptions.  And it's kind of like public shaming, you know, as a way to get more providers to to support TLS and all the kinds of encryption.  So show the screen if you can.  Chad, I don't know if you have my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it is.  How much email was encrypted in transit?  Coming from Google, 69 percent of messages from Gmail to other providers were encrypted.  That's great.  That's in the last 30 days.  The last year, you can see it started sometime between October and January of 2013, 2014.  But but that's a good number.  But then if you look at messages coming from other providers, less than half is encrypted on its way to Google.  And the reason that's important is you might say, well, I have an encrypted connection to Google and nobody can read my email as I compose it and upload it to Google.  But the minute it goes off of Google's servers is transported across the public Internet.  And, you know, it's in many cases not encrypted.  You have to both sides have to agree to encryption.  Google obviously does offer that in its in its SMTP client.  I guess what do they use?  Are they using SMTP?  I don't even know what they use.  But many, many providers don't.  So it is public shaming.  It's saying let's in fact, they even have a little ad.  Let's make email safer.  And if you go to have you gone to this URL G duck G dot CEO slash safer email or safer email, you can see how safe yours is.  And they have a list of email encrypted and so forth.  This is a good it is that it is the right answer.  It's not encrypted because it wasn't originally intended to be encrypted.  Nobody nobody thought email should be encrypted.  It's only now that we want to do it.  Right. Thanks to Edward Snowden.  I'm just going to type in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you guys hear me?  Yeah, we hear you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My other headset, my headset, I thought you bought a new one just for this show.  That's actually my idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had you.  Oh, was your fault?  During the ad, I muted you because of the headset, Russell.  But right now we're not getting your video.  No, he turned out the light.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Jeff jumps like leaps tall buildings in order to do the show.  I know he really does.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to hang up and come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, we'll get you back in a minute.  Jeff.  Google has a very good page.  If you go to this Google transparency report again, G.co slash safer email and you go to the bottom, there's a really good page on how encryption works that explains why this is an issue, why you should encourage this kind of encryption from your email provider and so forth.  And it's using TLS.  And it's just TLS.  It means you've got to use TLS from your server to their server and you have to support TLS.  TLS is SSL.  It's the same.  It's the same thing we use to encrypt our transactions to our bank and Amazon and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's the difference between sending.  I think this is the analogy they use sending a postcard versus sending a letter in an envelope.  Right. It's not it's not foolproof.  Someone could certainly rip open the envelope.  Right.  But it's the difference between sending it in the clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have two beautiful illustrations, one with the postcard and all the bad guys who are snooping on your postcard and then with an encrypted pipe and those bad guys just can't see into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's one other advantage of this kind of encryption is that the argument before was that if you only the people who used encryption were doing suspicious things.  Right.  The more people use encryption, the less those who use encryption will look suspicious.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, that's why I started using PGP and then later open PGP because I wanted to kind of establish a base line of encryption.  Everybody should be encrypting all the time.  It's not it's not it's not a tacit admission of guilt.  So it was a funny post on Google Plus this week right after WWDC.  He said Google announces it's going to spend a billion dollars to buy low altitude satellites to provide internet to the entire world and gets no attention.  Apple announces a font change and everybody's going, oh, and I think this might be the under reported story of the year to this point.  Yep.  And it's an amazing thing.  And even I have buried the lead.  Google has said they're going to spend they are spending more than a billion dollars to put up their own satellites, a fleet of satellites, low orbit satellites that will bring the internet to unwired regions of the globe, especially to underdeveloped nations, people who have financial and technical reasons they can't get the internet.  This is being led by Greg Weiler, who's the founder of Orb Networks, a satellite communications startup.  And they've been hiring engineers to work on the project.  They've allocated a billion dollars, maybe as much as three billion dollars to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are satellites or balloons or drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not loons.  This is not drones.  This is satellites, something a little more.  Say down to earth.  A little more, a little more stable.  That's right.  So it was something better understood.  More latency.  Yeah, but I think that the feeling is if you've got no internet, a little latency is better.  Take what you can get.  Take what you can get.  Yeah.  You may remember that Craig McCaw, who created cell phones basically with Cellular One, who really put it on the map,  and Bill Gates founded a company called Teledesic more than 20 years ago to do the same thing that put LEOs,  Low Earth Orbit Satellites for Internet Service.  That thing was a nine billion dollar project that basically flopped.  They stopped doing it in 2002.  You also may remember Iridium, which was a satellite phone service using Low Earth Orbit Satellites that went into bankruptcy in 1999.  So this is something that's been tried before, but it seems to me that Google has the best shot at it.  These are 1500 pound satellites.  And they, I'm sorry, I take it back.  These are 250 pound satellites.  They're a lot smaller than the traditional 1500 pound satellites.  And they want to circle the globe with them, which is quite amazing.  160 satellites.  It really could actually solve this problem in such an interesting way.  You've got to get regulatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's talking about the same thing, you know, and their drones and stuff.  But the business case for Google just makes more sense to me.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They also say that they think that they can make ground antenna systems much more inexpensive.  And traditionally they cost lots of money to get the receive.  We're talking hundreds of dollars instead of millions.  I think this is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's my other question.  Can governments interfere with this?  Yes, they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's the problem.  You're going to float a satellite or two or three over every nation in the world.  You're going to have some issues.  So there is absolutely there's regulatory issues and so forth.  But there would be with balloons.  It would be drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would matter what they were.  It wouldn't matter.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A fleet of pigeons.  I think these are geostationary, but I'm not sure.  No, they're just low earth orbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are they regulatory?  They should understand the satellite goes straight to your phone.  The satellite goes to a ground receiving station to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure it's not straight to your phone, but I don't know.  OK, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's why you have government.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you're doing, what they're eliminating is the line to the pop.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has Sherlocked Loon, says USC Waller in our chat room.  And only a bunch of geeks would even understand what that sentence means.  Very interesting.  I mean, really interesting.  But I mean, there's a long way to go still.  But clearly Google has placed a bet here.  They've hired between 10 and 20 people.  And they're reporting to Craig Barrett, who reports to Larry Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems like money well spent and money more sensibly spent than a lot of their Google X stuff.  I mean, it makes complete total sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good for Google.  It's good for the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good for the world.  It makes them look I mean, it's a win win all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  When we come back, I want to talk a little bit about what we're going to expect from Google I.O.  Because now that we've seen Apple, we've got the E3 gaming conference next week.  Amazon has just announced it's going to do something in the third week of June.  This is a crazy month.  But Google wraps it up with Google I.O.  You're both coming out for it.  We'll be covering it, of course, the keynotes.  What are we going to see?  In some ways, how does Google respond to Apple?  Can they top Apple?  It's always risky being the first.  Before we do, though, I want to show you something Google did that's so cool.  And you really should be able to take advantage of it.  I think it started when they did Chromebooks.  They said, you know, we've got to get a way to print from a device that is not hooked up to a printer that is traveling all around.  Maybe our Android device is the same thing.  They created Google Cloud Print, which is a very nice solution, easy to set up, easy to use.  And if your printer supports it, it's a step.  But what if your printer doesn't?  Are you going to buy a new printer just to print from your Android device?  I can print from here to my printer at home over the Internet using Cloud Print.  And this is the first and only print server officially certified by Google for cloud printing.  You see, it says right there, the made for cloud print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's I got to get one of those because I got the call.  I think I told you guys I gave my wife the Chromebook, the Pixel.  She loved it.  She used it without any questions or any complaints for many months.  But just a couple of weeks ago, I got the call.  She said, I need I need to print.  How do I print?  And I said, oh, can you just plug the printer?  And she's like, no.  Do you have a cloud print?  I was like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, almost any printer will work with this.  More than 4000 top brand printers.  And you know what's nice about it?  There's no software to install.  There's nothing to do.  You literally this is it.  It's a small little device.  It's about the size of a power brick for a laptop.  On one side, there's Ethernet, power, USB.  And that's about it.  What you'll do when you open it up, you plug it in.  And it automatically sees all the printers on the network.  If you have printers that need to be connected via USB, you can do that directly.  Of course, it supports multiple printers, virtually unlimited Android devices,  allows USB printers to be shared all over the network, turns any printer, almost any printer.  I may not work with your Epson MX100 dot matrix printer, but almost any other printer into a cloud print compatible printer.  Such a good idea.  We've seen, you know, they made one for AirPrint too that we've advertised for a long time.  And we got lots of emails from people saying, I can't believe how easy this was to set up.  People in schools and so forth use it.  It makes it very easy to make your network cloud print compatible.  So I want you to try it.  It's $149.95.  For that, you get up to 10 network printers and 8 USB printers simultaneously.  So it's more than just a household device.  Every office, every business should have this.  Every school.  Visit Xprintserver.com slash twit to find out more.  I didn't mention the name, did I?  It's from a company called Lantronics.  It's the Xprint Server Cloud Print Edition.  Xprintserver.com slash twit.  If you do use the offer code twit, you'll get free shipping.  You'll get it quickly.  And it's a little weird because it requires so little configuration.  It's one of those things where people go, that's it?  Yeah, that's it.  They should actually add some steps just to make people feel better.  That's it?  It's working?  Yeah.  There is no step three.  There is no step three.  It's awesome.  Xprintserver.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you first advertised this, Leo, I ordered while you were still doing the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, have you set it up yet?  No.  All right.  You got to do that when you get home and do a little demo for us on the show.  And print from the pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as I think I mentioned, I have a Macintosh now that is nothing but a Google Cloud Print  server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because it's sharing the printer and then you go to, yeah, that's a pen.  Yeah, so now I can get rid of that.  Yeah.  You don't have to keep that Mac on all day.  Right?  I love it.  It's great.  It's a really great idea.  Xprintserver.com slash twit.  Google, according to GigaOM, will be announcing its Android TV, the successor to Google TV.  I loved Google TV.  Apparently, it was kind of a flop.  Of course, we know the queue was a flop.  It announced two years at a Google I.O.  Google is about to open another front in the war for your living room, Janko Rickers.  The company is set to announce the launch of Android TV at I.O. in June, according to  sources, multiple sources familiar with Google's plans.  But what is Android TV?  Well, it's not a device.  It is a platform that others can build a device to.  Actually, that happened with Google TV too, didn't it?  With LG and others say we're going to use Google TV on our TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure what this is new.  According to this article...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this too late because everybody has smart TV platforms of their own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know, that's a bad thing because it means as a developer of apps, you have to  develop one for LG, one for Samsung, one for...  It's crazy for high sense.  So one system would be very nice.  The company is calling this technology that they're using Pano, P-A-N-O, and it's kind  of like zero config for apps.  So apps can surface individual pieces of content right on the home screen in a card-like fashion.  So users can browse movies, TV shows, and other types of media as soon as they turn  on Android TV.  Content is in a card.  This is Google loves cards, right?  Google now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google's all about the cards.  They can be browsed horizontally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each movie or TV episode has deep links into the publisher's apps, giving users the option  to start playback right away.  So there'll be, I gather from this, an overall interface that knows about the apps but focuses  on the content.  That's what you want, isn't it?  You don't want to have to go, well, let me see.  Is it Hulu Plus or HBO Go?  Let's go to HBO Go.  It's not in there.  What you want is you want to see all the shows.  And then you say, I want to watch that show.  And then you say, okay, well, there's three ways to watch it.  Doesn't that seem sensible?  That's got to be the key, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it sounds like this is just new interface, and it sounds like there's an emphasis on  gaming, which makes a lot of sense because Google's really been pushing hard on giving  developers more tools for gaming, for building games.  And gaming is something that Chromecast can't do.  I mean, I can't really get my head around why you'd have the Chromecast, which is so  great, so successful, and this.  I mean, it seems like that's more power and a better interface is what this Android TV  would get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So according to Janko, there are two answers to that question.  One is strategic and one is political.  At Google I.O., he says, you're likely going to hear the strategic one, which goes a bit  like this.  Chromecast is a great, inexpensive device for consumers that want to use their mobile  devices to launch content, right?  But due to its aggressively priced, limited hardware, it can't do everything you'd like  to do.  In particular, you nailed it, gaming.  So it would make sense to have a second device that's more powerful that isn't $35, it's  maybe $100 that can play games like the Amazon Fire TV, right?  Or, as Janko says, an uya done right.  So that's the strategic reason.  The political reason, according to Janko, is really about corporate politics.  Google TV launched in 2010 as a new product based on Android, but beyond that didn't share  a whole lot with the company's Android team.  Google TV was based on Honeycomb and a separate team that wasn't the Android team.  Janko says, I've been told by sources familiar with these discussions there was a lot of  growing discontent between the Android team and the Google TV team as Google TV failed,  floundered.  So the Android team said, well, we're going to do it right.  And that was the Nexus Q, which of course was instantly killed.  Right.  And the Nexus Q surprised the Google TV team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if you guys remember.  The Google TV team had no idea that the Q was happening.  And I think that they were dismayed by the fact that the Nexus Q was not working.  Dismayed.  And surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they probably said, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a little bit light.  One hand's not talking to the other.  Honeycomb always felt like this redheaded stepchild of a forked branch that they just  sort of rushed to production in order to get in the tablets faster.  And the whole splitting off the team, I just don't, this just feels like mismanagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The more I hear about Google, the more it is silos.  Eric Schmidt said long ago, the biggest problem facing Google is when it becomes this big.  And that's the problem that faces it today.  It's gigantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like it's a side effect of a positive intention, which is to kind of maintain the  startup mentality.  So by making small, autonomous teams, the advantage is they all are running and gunning.  But the disadvantage is they're not all running and gunning in the same direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the advantage too is that they can kill stuff off that's not working.  The Wave team, for example, was totally separate, particularly geographically.  They were in Sydney, but they were completely separate.  They were their own startup.  They had incentives built around user acquisition that were separate from the rest of the company.  And the idea was like, if you don't meet your goals, then we kill the product, right?  And that's what happened with the queue.  And it's what happened with Google TV.  It's just, it's hard, like as consumers and developers to be like, oh, this feels like the same  thing with maybe a different interface.  How is this going to be different this time?  What did you learn?  And I think what you said, Leo, is true.  I just realized that I'm missing the new season of Louie.  I had no idea it was airing.  And I wound up actually just buying it off the Play Store and using it on the Chromecast,  which was a really nice experience.  But it's true.  I just want to fire up my Android TV and say, hey, like Google knows that I watch Louie and that I love Louie.  And that as soon as the premiere happens, I'm going to want to know about it.  And it should just show me.  And I'll buy it from wherever.  I don't care.  Content first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are interested in content.  We don't care about HBO or Showtime or anything.  We want content.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Android TV has my Google Now, like the knowledge that Google Now has about what TV shows I like,  because Google Now is incredibly good at telling me that my new favorite show has a new episode  because I tend to Google a lot while I'm watching TV.  You know, I look up stars.  I look up whatever, plots, whatever.  If Android TV has that, that's going to be awesome.  I'm going to be able to turn that thing on.  And without my DVR, you know, have plenty of content that I'm going to want to watch, right,  without having to remember to schedule or, you know, have a backlog or whatever.  I'll just be able to stream.  And that would be a great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, Google has changed because Andy Rubin's gone.  Sundar Pichai is now in charge of both things, right?  So I feel like that some of the silos are also walls have been broken down,  which means, well, can you have, you can have both Chromecast and Android TV.  I'm sorry, Jeff, go ahead.  I forget what I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think you could you can mismanage silos.  You can mismanage a monolith, right?  Like mismanagement can happen either way.  And it doesn't feel like this was mismanagement.  But this is Google's way, right?  They build stuff.  A lot of it fails.  A lot of it is wildly successful.  They don't know what's going to stick.  And they and they kill and they fail fast.  And then they start a new thing.  And, you know, so while things like the Nexus Q feel like this terrible PR, you know,  blemish, it's actually just like the way that it works for them product wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So no customer ever bought one.  So nobody was the worse off.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of people got free ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just means a lot of dirty jerks make snarky remarks around Google.  I think that they can afford that.  Oh, it looks like another Q.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Next to Q. That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, so that's something to look for.  Now, it remains to be seen whether there's a standalone box like a Roku box or it's just a platform  that they sell to TV manufacturers that they put in.  I would like to see that.  God, that's apps on TVs.  Even within the Samsung line, I have different experiences.  You know, it just doesn't make any sense.  Yes.  It's really a mess.  And these guys are not good at developing apps.  They shouldn't be in this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing I know I was going to say tonight foundation held a meeting at my school a month or so ago  trying to kind of save public television.  The young people in the room said, why?  But the thing that struck that I've quoted since is that they all said the big screen on the wall,  that's the second screen.  Yes.  I'm most engaged at the screen that's right in front of me.  And also the TV is right in the background.  Oh, I'll watch that for a while.  OK, fine.  Or maybe we'll talk about it for a while or not.  And I think that if you look at it that way, how you tie the presumption was everything had to get to the big screen  because that was Valhalla.  No, not necessarily.  And the more you can tie what you're doing on the big screen to your truly engaged smaller screen,  that's where there's going to be something here.  Google loves, remember Google loves signals, knowing what you watch.  So as Gina said, they can give you the cards to say your favorite thing is coming on.  And here's some more.  Here's where you can find it.  I see you're watching TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you like me to help you?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clippy for your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get that all the time.  I see a Panasonic TV is on and on the network.  Would you what are you watching?  Press this button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you like me to send this self-driving car with some cheese doodles to your home?  Yes.  And I'll use the automatic lock to unlock your house and let the robot in.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll just put that on the counter.  You don't have to get up.  Well, we see now Apple let the iWatch stay fallow on the back burner.  No mention at all.  So this is an opportunity for Google once again to start talking wearables.  But here too, Google's been talking the OS, not the hardware.  Yeah, I think that's smart.  Be the platform, not the solution.  Do you have any questions?  I think we have a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we have a question.  Do you think they'll ever have their own hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They seem to always, for some reason, I really understand Google does like to build hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a lot of times though it's like the Pixel, their reference applications, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pixel was not a product.  We want to make it work on a thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just so that people, real enthusiasts and Googlers can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how big will Glass be at I.O. this year?  Good question.  My instinct says not big based on the merits, but they are behind this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're pushing out updates like gangbusters.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's the kind of thing you do before an event.  Yes.  Yes.  One of the more interesting ones is this notification, I think it's called notification glance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a kind of thing that you do before an event.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think it's interesting that Google has a lot of people that are interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you get the notification sound and you glance up, it will wake the device and show it to you.  Oh, I love that.  And when you look down.  And it's kind of like, that's cool.  Come on.  Does it kill the battery?  Because it's got to be watching you all the time.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, how do we know you looked up?  That's definitely one of the challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It must always be on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some part of it, right, has to be detecting that.  But yeah, I mean, the modal language is always on.  I mean, you know, the always listening, always watching.  You know, this is one of the challenges.  It's only when you get a call.  What you just said, I'm guessing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's when you get an update.  Maybe it goes on a little bit right then.  Yeah, right.  So you get the notification sound, you glance up and you glance down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to run this at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's glass hole dot S.H.  This is a good question.  Glass hole dot S.H.  This pissed me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This pissed me off so much.  It's a little bash script that looks for any Google Glass attached to the local network and boots them.  What an ass.  And then it puts up glass hole discovered, deauthorizing.  So it will kick glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about violating somebody's space and somebody's privacy.  This jerk is the one who's doing it.  Just because I have my glass on doesn't mean I want to photograph you, whoever you are, you egotistical piece of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think one thing we're going to be seeing at Google I.O. is a little fistfight between Jeff and Julian Oliver, author of Glass Hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hear you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you are the system, if you're the network administrator, you can kick any device off of the network.  I agree.  It's the same as whatever, walking into a bar with a universal remote that shuts off all the TVs.  Which I hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the argument has been for some time that way back when the theaters were going to block cell phones and pagers, remember those.  What if there's a surgeon in the audience?  They need this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody uses glass for emergency communications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if somebody's in the theater using glass to get subtitles or something?  Right.  I don't know.  It's just it's just a jerky thing to do to say I don't like that technology.  So I'm going to ban it.  I'm so friggin clever.  No, you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glass still works without Wi-Fi though.  You can still use your data program.  Right.  Your data connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how I feel about this.  I there are there are scenarios where you would like to say this is off the record.  Well, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to see the person wearing this ridiculously huge thing, even if designed by Diane.  So you could then say to them, could you please take off your glass?  You know what, Leo?  Even without glass, I have things called eyes and ears and the memory.  And you know, you have to tell somebody something's off the record based on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a big difference between Mitt Romney telling his prospective voters in a private session.  40 percent of all of all the electorate is freeloading losers.  And then somebody repeating that.  And then and then then somebody having a video of it.  There's a big difference.  Yeah, and I think it's all the better if they have the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I wouldn't I wouldn't hang your head on that one, Leo, because that's a public official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he so it was OK to record that because he's a public official, even though it's a private meeting.  Like if I'm a public official, anything I do ever can be recorded and put on the Internet.  Depends on whether it has newsworthy value.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if I want to live in that world.  If a candidate for president United States calls 40 percent of the country lazy oafs, that's newsworthy period.  And again, same thing as somebody in that room hears him say it and comes out and says you're not going to believe what he said.  And they report that as a journalist.  I support that openness.  If you happen to also record it.  Bonus points.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know?  I know that here's one you're going to love, then.  Using Google Glass to shoot guns around corners.  This is a program called Tracking Point that turns Google Glass into a remote site for aiming around corners.  So here's a guy who wore glass.  He basically used glass to take a video of what he's going to shoot at and then aims around the corner using some source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He could also put just put a monitor on his gun.  Look at that.  It's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this is this almost feels like it's intent.  It's like Agit prop.  Like somebody who doesn't like glass made this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like look, glass kills to scare people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that how you say it, Jeff?  Agit prop?  Yeah, I think so.  Agit prop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably some Germanic pronunciation for it.  This will get those liberals scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like insurgents also use it to save lives.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it's just a tool.  You can use it lots of different ways.  Glass is really, I have to say, has been a wonderful magnet for stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a good reason.  It has.  Diane von Furstenberg, we know as DVF, is making 13 million videos.  We know as DVF is making 13 new ladies frames and shades for Google Glass.  DVF made for glass collection will be out on the 23rd.  You could as a glass explorer, you can buy them at the official glass store or at netaporte.com.  I'm not going to ask.  I'm not going to be sexist and say, Gina, do you want these?  I'm going to say, Jeff, do you want these?  Oh, I think having a designer frame on such a dorky thing, the problem is it doesn't.  You can dress up a pig.  You can put lipstick on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it's really nice, except for that giant thing.  I love these frames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what the hell is that thing over your temple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how it makes you drink your head all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be really nice if the arms bent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Firemen can save lives using Google Glass or shoot around corners.  You take your choice.  It's been a great year talking about glass.  I hope it doesn't go away.  In fact, I would love to see Google make a big announcement at I.O.  something like we are now ready to start selling glass as a consumer product.  We have $200 to go on with the money I wasted.  Right. $200.  Well, you know what?  That's the price you pay for being able to be a glass hole a year earlier than the rest of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So should I wear my glass at I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, right.  Don't you?  Didn't you last year?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's one of the few places that you can wear it and not worry about people not understanding what it is.  Right.  I always just feel bad that the convention center, like every single person has, you know, at least five devices on them that's like connecting to the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will they give out glass?  Free at I.O.?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look under your chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What will they give out? What fun gadgets will they give out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody at Google told me that we'll be pleased. That's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  Because one school of thought would be, you know, this is becoming a problem that a lot of losers who aren't really developers are trying to get into I.O.  just so they can get the free stuff.  And maybe we should knock this off and do like Apple does and just say, hey, this is for developers.  You're here because you want to learn how to develop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I would be.  T-shirts. Isn't that enough?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a t-shirt.  Get away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of stuff.  Well, it could be a Nexus 10 could be long awaited, not delivered.  Could be a Nexus six or whatever the equivalent phone.  It could be glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glass or watch Android TV.  Watch. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I started this off with watches.  Is there a Google Watch?  I think I'm just hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Nest.  No, I mean, even if I buy a Nest for a while.  I mean, it's going to be something that's early.  Can I ask you a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember this story.  It went around that Nest was going to put ads on there.  And I remember Tony Fidel saying, we're never going to do that.  Right.  That was a bogus story.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was.  There were two bogus stories at the same time, which means that Nest has a bit of a PR issue.  I think it was in some kind of filing.  And he said, no, it's possible.  Doesn't mean we're going to do it.  We're not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because everybody and their brother several times this week on Twitter, on various shows, I've had to say, no, no, no, that wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were two bogus stories and you corrected the one.  People believed it.  There was a big second recall, which was only the bureaucracy catching up to the actual people.  And that was another one.  And right after that was the story about ads.  So both of them bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a sign of...  People don't believe anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Especially about Google.  Jaron Lanier wrote a piece for The Guardian saying he likes self-driving cars because they're safer.  But then, of course, going through all kinds of hand-wringing worry about Google.  You know, do we want them to drive us?  Well, that's Jaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Jaron, who was a virtual reality advocate very early on, has a very nice set of dreadlocks, has become an anti-technology guy in recent years.  Yes, he's a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I damn well rather have Google drive me than Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have Microsoft in my car.  I'm not sure really how happy I am about that.  Is that the system that puts you in the water?  No, that is not.  That's QNX.  That comes from Blackberry's rim.  The Audi has QNX as its operating system.  The Mustang has Microsoft Car.  And actually, the Mustang works pretty well.  And the Audi's fixed, so there.  I'm very sad to see this.  Google is going to close the Texas factory in Fort Worth where they build the Moto X.  The one of the things I loved about the Moto X was it was a phone made in the or assembled in the United States.  By the end of the year, they'll be closing the factory.  Of course, Google has sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo.  I had some hope that those 700 Texas workers who were assembling Moto X phones there would keep their jobs.  I guess not.  That's a bummer.  I think that's so.  And this is happening before the transition.  Google's doing this.  I guess that is actually not unusual now that I think of it.  In the sale of a company, you often fire everybody.  You clean up your messes.  And then if the new company wants to rehire them, that's up to them.  But I would guess that Google has already said to Lenovo, you want to keep this factory?  And they said, no, fire them all, please.  Because otherwise, Lenovo would pay the severance and the lawsuits and all that.  So it's going to be the current owner that lays off.  Oh, that's so sad.  Too bad.  Weak sales, high costs.  That's what they're saying.  It is.  At its peak, they employed 3,800 people.  Today, only about 700.  So apparently...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say high costs, that's not surprising.  But the weak sales, that's disturbing for other reasons.  Strategy Analytics says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Google isn't saying how many Moto Xs were sold, but Strategy Analytics says fewer than a million.  About 900,000.  Comparing to the Apple iPhone, which sold 26 million units in the same period.  Of one of the 5S.  Samsung would be even more.  I liked that phone.  I think we're going to think back and say those were the days, my friends.  I liked that phone.  I don't know, I guess the Moto X Plus One will be made in China like everything else.  12,000 people in the first day asked to be forgotten in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by now, it is more than 40,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does Google do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just ridiculous.  And among the many ironies is that they've only made Google more powerful.  Because now Google is going to be the arbiter of what's relevant, what's bad, what's this, what's that.  And it's just ridiculous.  It's really a scary, scary ruling.  And there's no opportunity for appeal.  It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So something like 10,000 requests a day.  Just kind of boom, boom, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how many take down requests do they get from the MCA?  Oh, far fewer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fewer than that.  Far fewer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I hear you and I agree that the ruling is troubling.  But I mean, Google deals with spam and take down requests from big companies all the time.  So I'm sure that they're, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got to make a judgment, Gina.  They've got to make a human qualitative judgment, not whether this is infringing material.  Was this created by Disney or not?  But this is instead...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they could kick it back to the court though, if it was unclear.  It's up to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no absolute right to have the information deleted.  Google will have to weigh a number of criteria in responding to the requests, including relevance and time passed.  This comes from an article in PC World by Jennifer Baker.  Google, quote, Google needs to work out what a reasonable consumer might find outdated.  This is not straightforward.  And if they do not anticipate, they will have too many requests.  What a mess.  What a mess.  Now, I am a little sympathetic because, I mean, there's stuff I would love to be forgotten on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't we all have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be untrue.  This is something very important to underscore.  It can be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's rewriting history.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if it's untrue, you have recourse with libel and so forth.  You can go to the source and say, that's not true.  You have to take that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody asked too, whether there was really suggested in a comment when I wrote about this, that one step that should have been in here is to demonstrate to Google that you went to the source to try to get it down there and failing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be good.  Did you try the guy who posted it?  Peter Hustink, the European data protection supervisor, is happy with Google's online form.  He says, yeah, Google is organizing itself, which is welcome.  I don't know what country he's from because ruling means the search engine needs.  That was just a generic Eastern European accent.  The ruling means that the search engine needs to anticipate what the reasonable expectation of a consumer might be.  Oh, you go vault.  That's a terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I pray happen.  What I really want to see happen is that a link to a site gets pulled down and the holder of that site sues.  Oh, great.  On the basis of the well, I want to see a ballast to this decision.  And I want people to try to sue to protect their free speech.  The right to remember.  It's not going to be in the U.S.  It's all you have to do is go search on Google, that switch to Google, that dot de or F.R.  And you'll find anything that only holds in the European countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, what I really what somebody needs to do is build like an extension or a bookmark that actually highlights the results on Google dot com that have been forgotten on others.  Search engines because that will make it a highlight things of particular interest.  But in terms of determining, that's a good idea.  And it'll be easy to do.  I mean, no longer on Google, no longer on Google dot F.R.  or whatever.  Oh, my God.  That's a great idea.  No one can do anything about that service.  I mean, it would it would certainly make those results.  I'd love to know what's been, you know, struck European search engines.  And that would be pretty trivial programming wise.  But in terms of determining relevance, I mean, that's what Google does.  Right. Like that's what Google does every day in every search.  But it does it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is going to be a team of people who will review every request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the guy who caused the case.  And as John Oliver said, now the only thing the world knows about is the thing he doesn't want known.  So is is his foreclosure years ago relevant?  Well, what the hell does it mean?  Relevant to whom?  If I hire the guy, I wonder if I can trust him or not.  If I want to give him a loan or go into business with him.  Yeah, it's relevant to me.  If I want to go out on a date with him, well, maybe it's still relevant.  But if I want to, you know.  So there will be.  Sell my skis.  No, it's not relevant.  It will be removed from the contextual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be in the EU and it will only be in the EU versions.  The search results will still be available in other jurisdictions, including the US.  There will be a notice at the bottom of each page that will say this was removed under the Right to be Forgotten Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that'll make it really easy to do what you suggest.  All you've got to do is do a diff between those two pages then.  Right. Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  That's well, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, just like, you know, get an array of URLs, you know, compare them to the array URLs that you get on the other.  You know, it's a double request.  Anyway, I don't mean to start.  Yeah, it would be pretty trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has shared information about what kinds of requests they're getting.  Thirty one percent of the requests were for fraudulent or scam incident reports that they want removed.  Of course, if you are a fraudster, you would want that removed.  But I don't know if that's in the public interest.  Twenty percent are reports of violent or serious crime arrests.  Twelve percent are for child pornography arrests.  So more than 63 percent of these are for crimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a different attitude in the U.S.  We take people who have been arrested but not tried yet on perp walks in front of news cameras.  Yeah, we do.  And in Europe, they put, you know, they block the eyes.  So if you block my eyes, which is still recognized me.  Oh, yeah.  And after you've served your sentence, then you could have something expunged in Europe.  And you can in some cases in the U.S. as well.  You can have a record expunged.  But the fact of what you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is fitting.  You know who's on the board, the advisory board that will review the process for Google?  Jimmy Wales, who himself has a few things he wanted removed.  Eric Schmidt, David Drummond, Google's legal counsel, Frank LaRue, who's a UN special reporter on the promotion and protection of the right of freedom of opinion and expression.  Peggy Valkey, director of the University of Louvain Law School.  Jose Luis Pinar, the former head of Spain's data protection authority.  Jimmy Wales and an ethics professor at Oxford, Luciana Floridi.  They didn't ask us.  Didn't ask me.  Oh, I want to fill out the form.  Fill out the form?  Let's fill out the form.  You want to just ask for something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you got to go do something.  Did you watch the John Oliver thing on?  We should play that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was very, very good.  I thought it was so far the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to go to some effort, fill out a form to the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  Don't fill out this form.  John Oliver did.  And we won't play it today.  But I will refer people to John Oliver's very, very good description of the net neutrality  proposals by the FCC, which he called it.  What was it?  I can't repeat the phrase he used, but cable company, Eferi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said the internet's not broken and the FCC is going to fix that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said trolls of the earth.  He was a great funny thing on trolls.  He said now is your opportunity to use your skills for good.  Go troll the FCC.  And indeed they did so much that it tore down the FCC's comment servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's a good response.  Sad to hear.  But good on you, John Oliver.  It took him a while, but a couple of weeks after the proposals.  Yeah, there it is.  It's on YouTube.  Search for his new show last week tonight and his segment on net neutrality.  Very, very good segment.  Yeah.  And it is, HPO is posted.  Pass it around, please.  Yeah.  I've got a lot of tweets and so forth.  Preventing cable company, Eferi.  I love John Oliver and I'm glad that he did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, if you were in the EU, would you submit to the forum the things that you would wish the internet had forgotten about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On principle, I would bite the bullet and say, but I know somebody who would.  And on principle, I would bite the bullet and say, look, you know, but I also understand the other side.  A close friend has spent a lot of time and effort to put other stuff up on the internet so that search results from Google don't point exclusively to negative reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I understand the human motive.  I just think that the court didn't balance the rights of knowledge, free speech and memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my feeling is if it's untrue, pursue libel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's true, then that varies country to country.  The US, that's the truth.  Well, you're right.  You're right.  You also have to prove damage.  You have to prove other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, there's damage.  Well, anyway, yeah.  OK.  If you could prove it's untrue and there's damage, then that then there but the laws exist for that.  If it actually happened or there's no damage, I think there's no right to pull it off the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think child pornography and debts and things.  I mean, if you look at like, you know, the Snapchat founder or Zuckerberg saying things when they were 19 or 20 years old that they wish that the internet had forgotten.  Right.  Right.  I think it's really important to apologize.  I think it's really important to apologize even to apologize as men now for being like teenagers and teenage boys and talking whatever.  It's talking in a way that most teenage boys would just talk in a locker room and it would there wouldn't be a record of it.  Right.  But these folks are very successful founders now, and they and but is it a relative chance to our judgment of them as people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that we've had this discussion before.  You want to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we have.  Who among us doesn't have regrets?  We all have regrets about things that happened in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Life does not provide a mechanism to erase those things we regret.  But I wish I could go to some people.  I know life didn't.  If it was public, it was public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But before the internet, the internet is a particular kind of memory that has never existed before.  Right.  I mean, people would tell stories word of mouth.  Right.  It was a different thing than having a file that lived out there forever.  Right.  Like our technology isn't built to deal with information and passing information, saving information and forgetting information the way that we collectively do as a culture and a community.  Right.  So, I mean, I think that's the that's the issue is our technology doesn't forget.  We do forget.  So we were in this weird.  We're in this weird space where somebody, you know, photo of someone as a kid doing something stupid looks just as real and current and up to date as as you know who they are today.  And like, I get what you're saying, Jeff.  Of course, like I'm not going to hold Zuck accountable for saying the things that he said when he was 20 years old.  Although I got to tell you that that doesn't I didn't I didn't forget about that.  I mean, I forgave but didn't forget.  You know, I mean, there was a time when he.  But Gina, that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what you do with the knowledge you have.  It's the it's it's it's it's it's goes back to what Dana Boyd told me.  It's not the gathering.  It's the use.  And what you're doing is you're deciding when to be tolerant, when to look past and when to find an openness to the knowledge that people make mistakes.  And that's what society has to do.  Internet or no, we've got to be able to forgive people for screwing up because we all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But if Zuckerberg, it's about a time, right?  It's about time that's passed.  If Zuckerberg had said those things now, it would be a huge problem for his company.  Right. But because he said them a long time ago, but people remember them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, what if I what if I said something racist?  Mm hmm. I hope I haven't.  But what if I then I wanted to run 40 years later, I run for office.  Is that relevant?  It was this whole relevance test at the time.  You know, right now, is it relevant?  Google can take it down.  No, the guy's not racist.  It's been 20 years. I find take it down.  Then suddenly I'm running for Congress.  Should I?  It's a good question.  And a lot of people think it's relevant.  And history has been erased.  And who erased it?  People who had this is also this is another digital divide.  These people are the sophistication.  To go in and do these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, 60.  What did I say?  Sixty one percent were for to pull down criminal activities.  Thirty nine percent were from a William G Gates who just wanted people to forget that he ever posed for this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, that's cute and charming.  And I saw today I saw Peter Dinklage's, you know, mullet high school yearbook picture.  It was funny. It was cute.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like Peter might not think it's so cute or funny, right?  He might not like it.  And he'd have the right to have you forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think things like racist remarks or it's tough.  And I often feel like I wish that our technology didn't automatically by default remember everything perfectly because our memories don't.  So there's a there's a different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think we have to what we have to do is figure out as a society what to forgive and when to forgive it.  And and and and try to rewrite history is not the way to do it because it creates a precedent and a tool that has been used by tyrannical governments rewrite reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such a tough one.  This is such a tough one.  I don't think there's and it's so hard and it encourages intolerance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, I hear you.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I got to say when when pictures of you are posted on Reddit that look like that, it's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, Tommy. That's amazing.  So somebody posted Lannister on the front and Dothraki in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God bless you, Reddit.  God bless you.  Now, there's something he's guilty of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He really is guilty of somebody said I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let us we I'm just looking what else we have to talk about so much, but I think we're kind of running out of time here.  YouTube is also waiting on the net neutrality issue.  Of course, they'll be one of the companies that will be asked for money from ISPs who want to start a fast lane.  And so they have released a US focused version of their video quality report, which lets you check which ISPs produce the best looking YouTube streams.  So I can see here.  Wow.  Wow.  That after.  Wow.  Looks like it starts to really go up in the afternoon.  And by nine o'clock at night.  And is a lot of video consumption right there.  He says users on YouTube HD verified networks, though this is something new HD verified should expect smooth playback most of the time.  Compare providers in your area.  That's so Comcast is HD verified.  Obviously, that means YouTube is paying the money, right?  AT&T, you verse Sonic Net.  Very interesting.  The clear point.  And this is a point, of course, John Oliver makes in his show is that.  Virtually over 90% of Americans only have two choices for Internet service.  It's not like you have a choice to go somewhere better.  Amazon's going to have a device launch.  We mentioned this.  They put out an invitation and announcement come June 18th.  We'll probably be covering this in Seattle.  A 3D display of some kind.  According to recode, it's a 3D phone display.  I thought that the rumor that Amazon was going to do a 3D phone seemed very far fetched.  But apparently.  That's what we're going to see on the 18th.  Amazon is not sending out invitations, but inviting those who want to attend to apply.  Now watch the people using whatever this device is.  That's really cool.  Turning their heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very real life.  In other news, Amazon released a video where actors act like they're looking at a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's super awesome.  I don't know how you guys do it.  It's pretty flawless.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one guy's pivoting on his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That I'm impressed.  That's pretty damn intuitive.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty damn intuitive.  Charlie Rose come in and say, whoa.  By drones?  Chad, you're exactly right.  There was a great piece in the New York Times this last week about Harvard Business School.  I think it was Clayton Christensen got in a room to record a lecture for online education.  He looked around and he saw that the students were attractive.  Really attractive.  He finally just asked, are you students?  Oh no, we're actors.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is I think really an innovation here.  They're posted on the Amazon.com slash launch event.  You request an invitation.  Where is it going to be held?  Seattle.  Would you request an invitation?  And I'll fly you out there and what you and didn't say, I want to wear my glass during this.  I'm flying enough, man.  Who could we send up there?  Jason, you want to go to Seattle on the 18th?  Jason should go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll send Jason.  You have three choices.  You have, are you an Amazon customer, a developer or a journalist?  And then you can do an optional video submission saying why you should attend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jesus, why you want to go to a flac event?  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's right on the front page of Amazon there.  Would you want an invite to a new device we're unveiling?  This is going to be the phone.  Look at the edge of it.  Yeah.  This is a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, based on what Amazon did to Android and the Kindle, I'm never buying an Amazon phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And really, I don't know why you would want a 3D display on a phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so I can go like this.  So Jesus's eyes can follow you.  Yes.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at you.  I imagine wearing glass and wearing using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's all we're going to do.  Unless you guys have anything important because we still have for tool and tip and number and Jeff is exhausted.

Transcript:  I'm going to city university to get more, for example, black males, Hispanic males in  my field to get the diversity.  If you put it there, it's very hard.  Given good, I imagine a lot of the minorities at Google are international minorities.  So we don't have any effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hard thing.  We have extended job offers to several, but they keep saying no.  I don't know why.  Petaluma.  No, thanks.  Yeah, some of it may be Petaluma.  Yeah.  But no, I think it is a problem in general.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It starts in education and opportunity.  Good for them for publishing their numbers.  I applaud them because the numbers were like, wow.  But if I think about it, I think that's probably how Silicon Valley is in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, when folks are saying, oh, that's the TV show, Silicon Valley, there's no women,  it's like, yeah, it's making fun of what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's one advantage.  The bathroom is always clean and empty when you're a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Worldwide Developers Conference last year.  And then this year, it was a little bit better.  So this is this year.  So, no, I don't see any women.  No.  A long line, though, for the men's room.  This year, the same picture, a little bit longer line.  Oh, here's the best one.  This was last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really happy this conversation is happening.  Yeah.  And I hope it continues to happen.  We just got to do better.  And I'm glad that it's coming from the top.  We got to do better.  We got to do better.  And that's been widely sort of acknowledged.  And this is part of it.  And I'm happy.  I'm happy when people are talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Me too.  I'm really excited for my tool with something that's been out on iOS for some time.  And I've just now got it for Android.  I'm really happy.  I think it's one of the best calendar apps I've ever used called Sunrise Calendar by Sunrise Atelier.  It is now available free on Android and on your desktop, which is kind of cool, too.  So let me show you.  I'll show you on my phone.  I don't know how well you can you see my phone?  Yeah, it's got a very nice user interface.  It's got month interface.  It's got day.  It's got week.  It puts icons next to people's names and makes the links hot links.  It puts in maps.  It does a lot of very nice things, I think, that make your calendar very pretty and highly functional.  These are all my invitations that I have not yet said yes to.  Here's the week view.  Just really nice.  And what I really like about it, of course, it's very easy to use with Google Calendar.  You just sign into your Google Calendar and it automatically populates.  And they have a very nice web based version of this as well.  So if I go if you go to the web based version, which is calendar dot sunrise dot a.m.  And this is free, by the way, you can connect with Google.  I'm going to connect with Google.  It'll download my calendar and it gives you a really, I think, attractive month by month interface on your desktop.  Almost eliminates the need for a desktop calendar app.  Frankly, I really like it.  So they've done a stellar job, I think, of giving you a calendar.  So it's called Sunrise Sunrise dot a.m.  iOS now Android and desktop to that's my tool of the week.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being here.  This has been a fun twig.

His many books are on Amazon and there is a Kindle single Gutenberg, the geek.  There's public parts.  And what would Google do?  You know, Trapani's abyss is think up th in Kup dot com.  A great place to get insights into your Facebook and Twitter feed.  What if analytics were for real people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said, you know, we're actually redoing that landing page, Leo, because it's terrible.  It doesn't really explain what the product is.  And Team Think of was actually scrambling to get that done by twig today.  Don't you? We didn't quite make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about if I show my Think Up analytics?  I always like going through this.  So when I go to my page, this is the kind of stuff I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congratulations is in order, Leo.  Think up notice that you had something very exciting happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it have? A little thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, your photo changes has changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good photo.  Nice. Still working on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We won't show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beta, beta, beta. We're still in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows you your tweets and what people like.  Actually, this is a tweet I might want to mention at some point.  I've been having remember I talked about how Oyster Books was suddenly billing me monthly on my Google Wallet.  So I got in a chat with the Google Wallet tech support and they said, well, you can't do anything.  You better contact.  Yeah. Well, they said contact Oyster.  So I contacted Oyster. They said, no, we don't know anything about it.  We don't use Google Wallet.  I said, well, what am I supposed to do?  So they said it was Oyster Books solution was sign up for an account on Oyster Books and then cancel it.  And then we'll see. And we'll see because they use Stripe, I guess, so they don't see any.  Meanwhile, every month I get charged 10 bucks.  So my point, I guess, is the Google Wallet is not a credit card.  There is a credit card associated with it, but it's not a credit card.  If it were, I could just say, well, stop it.  And they would have to stop it. Right.  But you can't. But you. But Google Wallet says, well, nothing we can do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a bummer. That's a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I am going to call the MasterCard associated with my Google Wallet and say, can you stop it?  But if you didn't use a MasterCard, you'd.  And the problem is my Google Wallet is tied to Google Music and my app purchases.  So I can't just get rid of my Google Wallet or not fund it. Right.  You cannot fund your wallet. Then it won't. But then I won't. I'll lose other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's crazy how hard like credit cards are so hard. We have so many credit card failures.  It's still so hard to manage this kind of thing.  Even with great tools like Stripe and Amazon Payments and Google Wallet,  you still run into these weird situations where it's like, what is going on?  I'm sorry, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fine. It's ten bucks a month. It's not killing me.  But at the same time, it's something people should understand.  It's the time. It's the irritation.  No, it's fine. It's not even that. I don't care.  I'd let it go for three months before I even made any effort. Ten bucks.  Ten bucks. But you should understand that you are vulnerable if you're using Google Wallet.  That they can literally throw up their hands and say, yeah, contact the company.  What if it's fraudulent? What if it's not a real company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not right. I was shocked when the rep from Google Wallet said, yeah, no, we can't do anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that policy might be changing.

Transcript:  The best way really is to look at somebody's analytics and see all the things you learn.  I mean, I tweeted 20 times last week and I can see what my number one tweet was.  I mean, it's just really great.  Who follows me? What verified users follow me?  And my favorite one is, you know, your retweet garnered somebody half a million more viewers.  I like that. It makes me feel powerful.  All right. Thank you, everybody. It's been so much fun.  Gina Trapani, smarterware.org is her blog, which she never posts to because she's busy making ThinkUp better.  Thinkup.com. There is To Do Text. That's great, too.  That's her great to do list for Android and iOS.  Thanks to Chad Johnson, our producer, who works very hard each week, figuring out what we can talk about.  And thanks to you for joining us. We do Twig 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC, every Wednesday afternoon right here.  I hope you will stop by and watch live.  If you can't, though, on demand audio and videos always available after the fact at twit.tv slash twig.  And on our apps, there are apps for every platform. I say are I didn't write them. We don't write them.  We have wonderful third party developers who take a lot of time and effort to write those.  And we thank them a tip of the hat to them.  And of course, on iTunes and everywhere else, podcasts are aggregated.  Thank you for watching. We'll see you next time on Twig.
