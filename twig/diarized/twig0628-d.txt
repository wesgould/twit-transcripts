Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agree, he wanted to steam me agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Top stories are so many. I don't know where to start proton mail says well, maybe we do log your IP address actually  Oh  Proton mail is one of a number of companies to to note another one that offers encrypted and an encrypted email  You know, it's cool  It's good. It's I think it's important to understand the limitations of encrypted email  Because you can't you know the other person has to you have to kind of have a  Agreement if you're both using proton mail no problem, but what if you're sending the gmail?  Well, then either it's unencrypted or you have to send them a link to something that an encrypted blob that they have to figure  out how to unencrypt  And that what is not encrypted of course is metadata who you're emailing and so that means proton mail has  information about what you're up to and  On their website they said we don't log your IP address, however  They had to respond to a legal request from the Swiss police to hand over a user's IP address and  details of the devices he used to access his mailbox  Resulting in the arrest of this of a French climate activist  We don't know what the crime he committed was  Yeah, alleged crime or alleged crime  proton mail says well we have to respond to a  Lawful request well yeah, but you shouldn't have boasted that you don't log IP addresses because obviously you do and in fact that  Marketing yeah, it was marketing and that that that line has now been removed from the  website we mocked when when Steve Gibson was talking about proton mail he mocked him a little bit because  They on their website  Made a big deal about how the fact that their servers were buried deep within a Swiss mountain as if that somehow  Magically protected your data. I think there's a lot of marketing that goes on in this stuff well beyond marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Beyond marketing was it mentioned in their terms of service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an interesting question I  Unfortunately, they you know we don't cuz I'm sure has been updated by now. It's all been changed so  Anyway, I don't think this is I don't really want to hammer proton mail. They should not have said that  They still say the email is still encrypted. Yeah, you know so is PGP. That's fine  I don't know if they supported perfect forwarding  encryption or not that would be an important thing but  Apparently that the user information logging was happened and that and that's kind of the point when you're using email  Metadata is visible  No matter whether the message is encrypted or not  So and metadata is often apparently was all the police this these police wanted  They didn't they didn't they just want to know who this guy was emailing I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, I guess we got nothing to say I know I'm just I was thinking about this and I'm like well you know  Yeah, it's like you shouldn't lie to people okay, yeah story

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Especially if you this is unfortunately you get ready because this is you know as people become more and more privacy focused expect to be  Conned more and more over privacy issues  You know when you announce to the world as we have that we care about something  Then there are gonna be plenty of people who come after you saying hey look we've got what you want  And like the freedom phone  It isn't  You know  This is the smartphone for conservatives was turns out to be a low-end China phone made in China by Chinese people  The same thing you you know you're opening yourself up to to people who are a little bit less a  Little bit more cynical about life and say I've been to podcast ridding  Yes, and then to podcast ridicule which of course is the lowest form of ridicule  It's our specialty

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean these people don't know anything they're just gonna make fun of you  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even eloquently. Yeah, thank you hot waffles hot takes we got them both. Yep  Hey  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know I'll try to find a better story. How about this one? Well what that said though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the next step for folks wanting to manage their own email actually this is a good concern  That's a good point. That's in fact why I brought this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really important to understand email is by its nature not a secure messaging platform  It never will be there are things you can do I would suggest  Instead of trusting somebody like proton mail or to to note it  I have accounts on both but a trusting them because they have the keys  It would be better for you to generate your own keys  And send the mail that way but still who you're sending it to subject lines a lot of stuff is still visible  Email was never intended to be a private or secure method of communication if you really want to communicate privately  My strong suggestion is use signal  Don't use whatsapp apparently Facebook can see what you're doing on whatsapp  But with that said I think I should probably read through the signal terms of services

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think I should probably read through the signal terms of services  Terms of service because who knows what what their marketing is as being secure, but is it well signal is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Created by Moxie Marling spike who is a strong privacy advocate with a long track record  The source code is open source, which is very important to me. I don't I would never trust anything that wasn't open source  Signal is has been vetted by many many people the source code has been vetted  And I don't think there's any question that signal is secure now whatsapp uses signal uses the signal encryption  I think it's telegram that I was confusing telegram is not necessarily secure. Yeah, so I that's why I said that  It's why I didn't say use signal or or or use signal end of sentence  Period period

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think there it's still true that once you so if I use signal with you Leo  But my fate is still in your hands that because you can do anything you want with it. Sure, you know it now  Yeah, both that you never yeah, what's good leaves your head. You're never fully. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Email is is is I think any any company that promises you secure email is over promising  So don't just use if you and if so, actually, that's the question  Let's say I wanted to tip off Stacy to you know, a big a big scam that was going on in the iot field  And a lot of reporters maintain accounts so that you can message them  Do you say do you Stacy? Do you have a do you publish a way that people could tip you off? I don't publish my signal account

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do mostly because I don't get a lot of secret tips that way my tips mostly  I mean because if you want to tip off a reporter typically you have a relationship with that person so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But how do you how do you engage the conversation you go to a parking garage like deep throat did with Woodward and Bernstein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, this is always someone face to face. Yeah, I mean and the other thing is I'm not reporting on national security things  So my my most difficult scoops are things that are maybe like the company would be mad that someone talked about it  But it's not like it's not criminal your fire. Well, yeah, so like if you work for Google and you wanted to tip me off  I would not bring my phone with me a lot of newspapers. Yeah, that would be smart a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lot of newspapers Washington Post uses something called secure drop  Which is a  And they specifically publish this thing if this is a discreet way for readers to share messages and materials with our journalists  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A lot of crap on those things though. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's hard to  Like I want tips from people I trust I know that sounds wrong, but I mean because you're gonna have to vet anything and vetting something is hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but the pair of the Pentagon papers for instance came in over the transom, right? Right and and  Actually, again, those were physically delivered to the Washington Post which is probably the safest way to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But everybody didn't want them. They didn't want to physically deliver them. They actually wanted to keep them themselves. So right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting what the post says if you want to securely message them with a tip  Go to a place with a public internet connection one that you don't normally frequent. Listen to this  This is opsec. Well, listen download and install the Tor browser bundle from Tor project org open the Tor browser and then copy in  This brow this address HTTPS colon slash slash Washington post secure drop dot tor dot onion  From this URL you'll be able to send messages and files to a secure drop box that we will check periodically  You will be provided with a code name that you will use to log in to check for replies from the post  Keep the code name you're provided safe and secure  We will not know your code name and you should not share with anyone if you forget your code name  We will have no other way to contact you. It's like your Bitcoin wallet  And this comes from the freedom of the press foundation Jeff do you ever do you cover this in your classroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we do actually in terms of primarily security for both the journalist and for the source

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's not required for everybody and you can see why the post wouldn't want to know who you are because they don't want to be  Ordered to reveal subpoenaed. Yeah  The post says no system is 100% secure even with these measures you there might be a risk of someone discovering who you are  What you are sending and so they have in fact more steps to secure yourself  Which is they say don't use use an operating system that helps preserve your privacy and anonymity like tails  Which is a Linux distribution that's designed around security delete trails of communication

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead print it out and mail it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not kidding. I mean, I hate to say it Stacey, but I know pronounce pronounce can be  There's this there is a hidden dot pattern on all printouts. Yeah that lead directly to your printer  But so borrow Stacey's printer printed out a journalist. So printed out at the library

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, go to the library printed out and then take your documents drop them in there  But a journalist we're aware of like thanks to like the John McAfee, you know metadata and the pictures  Most journalists are now aware of things like the dot patterns on printers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we won't publish the actual right documents, but those documents you need to burn them because if the FBI comes a knockin  They know how to read those dots

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but we we don't have to give that up  You can just I mean that's part of the freedom of the press or that's part of like I said job

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's it's less of a problem in the US but I think there are plenty of other places including some fairly civilized  Other places you should burn them  Would be better not to I'm starting to think Australia England Canada probably not good places to try to evade police surveillance  All right, enough of that. But anyway, that's that's why signal is a good choice. I think but hey if you really want to  Get fancy read that document from the Washington Post. I do most newspapers use a similar service or do they do their own thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It varies it was it was after Snowden it was quite the rush to yeah  I think a lot of them built their own but there are some services that are provided available newspapers  Yeah, so the New York Times says use signal and there's their signal phone number

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They may want to retract this part WhatsApp  WhatsApp uses the signal protocol but and there's by the way, there's a debate over this story. This is actually an interesting story from Pro Public  Yeah, it was like Pro Public  Pro Public ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was wondering what that explosive was from you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was thinking it too, Joe

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How Facebook undermines the privacy of two its two million two billion WhatsApp users

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  WhatsApp assures this came out yesterday  WhatsApp assures users that no one could see their messages, but the company has an extensive monitoring operation a thousand employees  Who can read the messages and they can see the messages and they can see the messages and they can see the messages  And they have an extensive monitoring operation a thousand employees  Who can read those messages and regularly shares personal information with prosecutors now Facebook saying that Pro Public  Cah misunderstood  Misunderstood the  The  Technology so they're denying it but at this point New York Times might want to take that off their tips page  They do say you could send email with PGP and here's their PGP key

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they do point out metadata will be available to your email provider. Oh  Postal mail mail delivered through the Postal Service is another secure means of communication. Well, this is not a postcard  You know, it's a federal offense to read the back of a postcard  We recommend that you use a public mailbox not a post office  Tips interest and they also use secure drop which uses Tor  So they this is interesting the Times has a very extensive  Variety of ways you can give them a tip. I still struggle trusting security of regular mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or any of the courier services just because of how packages look when you're  Destroyed and they're opened and you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really? I don't I get the occasional destroyed package, but most of my packages come pretty intact. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, there's it's it's been a little while for me  But definitely last year during 2020 when a lot of stuff was being shipped shipped here  it was a lot of  tape ripped off and  Holes cut into the sides and it's pretty common  Fortunately nothing was damaged but people were definitely interested  Whether it was Amazon or if they're good at it, they would use a teapot and steam it open you'd never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so that's the trick about boxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is for boxing something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Soggy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Try to steam it open these like porch pirates or were these just postal workers who wanted I think this is part of the newest

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this was part of the courier staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they just get grumbled up to sometimes just in the bouncing around the back of the truck  You think you're gonna get into it? There's that but you wouldn't have gotten it if they were if they really wanted it  They would have just taken it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I say. I'm assuming they were just interested in curious, but that was about it  Then they'd steal it they're looking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if you don't have one they're like, yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Didn't I didn't lose anything nor the Queen per because she just shipped some things out and people would message her say this box is  Destroyed and it's in pictures and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I bought my Nixie clock, I didn't realize it came from the Ukraine. Remember that Jeff that long  boring process of installing  Tubes it was driving you nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then you did the whole show with it behind your head flashing. Yeah, that didn't work either

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have it in my other office now, but I posted a picture of the box  Because it came from the Ukraine, but see how it was great. It was this cool wooden crate  It said fragile a on the side and everything but you see how it's taped because the customs opened it  Yeah, they opened it and so he said what the hell is what is this?  Well, it's not a bomb. Go ahead Tony. Let him have it Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what what are they what is what are the two hands with holding or that means it was made in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The great beyond I think  Looks like test containers. Yeah, isn't that that's I think that's fragile, but it's a or no. Oh  It takes two people to lift it fragile is the broken wine glass  The umbrella is make sure you take an umbrella with you when you go outside and then  That means it takes two

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hands to lift it. That means it's magical magnetic and after you get the vaccine in your magnetic  You can float that in the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I almost I really wanted to just keep this box because it was just so cool to get something to create like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And who was the same person who told you not to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You said don't get it. We know who she was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not to keep the box. Oh, no, I didn't keep the box. Yeah  German police guess who else uses Pegasus we talked last week about Bahrain  Apparently the German police also use Pegasus  This is the spyware that lets them hack into your iPhone without your knowledge without your in you know  And any clicking on your part they bought Pegasus the NSO group one. Yeah, they bought Pegasus from the NSO group in 2019  The federal government informed the Interior Committee of the bundesstag of the purchase in a closed-door session  Apparently there was a little bit cracked the parliament sources said the confirmed early reports published in the German newspaper  Desight were confirmed  The software was procured under the utmost  Secrecy according to is it D site die site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site  Ah  Despite the hesitations of lawyers as the surveillance tool can do much more than German privacy permits  However, the version purchased by the German Federal Criminal Police Office had certain functions blocked to prevent abuse  They're only allowed to use spyware on cell phones and computers of surveillance targets in  Special cases and can only initiate certain types of operations. Well, I feel much better now  All right, let's take a little break we will come back and talk about the new  Touchless Whole Foods stores opening up in a neighborhood near you  It's fragile a this is it it's a special a special award  And I put it in the window  For those of you only listening there is the famous leg lamp from a Christmas story our show today  Brought to you by command line heroes. They're back season eight. I'm so glad you're here  And I'm really excited about it  Their host is great. I saw on it Barak  She really knows her stuff and she's got the command line heroes  All of the seasons tell the epic tales of developers programmers hackers geeks and open source rebels  We're revolutionizing the technology landscape this season  The whole season is about the new technology landscape  The whole season is about one question and they tackle it from every angle. What is a robot and  Episode one which just came out as robot as servant really interesting  But there's also going to be robot as software as maker as humanoid  Why do we build robots that look like us? They'll answer that question and  Even though we always ask whether we can trust robots. What about robots?  Can they trust us?  Robot as vehicle robot as body robot as  Threat of course robots have always been the meat for science fiction stories, but now they're becoming a reality  And in the near future, I think robots are going to be there to serve our every need  Will they develop a mind of their own will they turn against us?  Will they be the savior of humanity or will they be our downfall?  Season eight of command line heroes  Season eight of command line heroes covers the robots that are in our midst and the determined dreamers who bring them to life eight episodes in this season eight  Season eight season eight. Let me play. It's so good. Let me play just a little clip Saron and  Let me play it's so good. Let me play just a little clip Saron and  Robot as servant listen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  While making the season we discovered a robot reality that's pretty removed from the robots we imagined and yet  All those misguided ideas about what a robot should be  Actually shaped with robots are and no robot fiction shape things more than the story  We told ourselves about robotic servants

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zaraña Barak is great and her show is great season eight is out now search for command line heroes  You'll find it on Apple podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts  We'll also include a link in our show notes so you can just go right to it  Thanks so much to command line heroes for their support. You should listen command line heroes from red hat. Thank You red hat  Let's see  It's kind of a potpourri today whole foods  Is going to be getting the Amazon just walk out technology  first two stores will be in California and Washington DC in the  The Glover Park neighborhood of Washington DC and in Sherman Oaks, California  This is the the store where you go you grab and you go you did you try it Stacy in Seattle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is actually bigger so it's the same technology, but it's it's a whole food. It's applied over. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, imagine how many cameras you need and how do you count how many bananas you got? It's imagine the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Computational workload that's happening behind the scenes because I mean how many people in a grocery store at any given time like 200

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so when you get to the Whole Foods, you'll you'll scan the the app or  Insert a credit card linked to your Amazon account or and this is very controversial place your palm over a palm scanning  system called Amazon one oh  Yeah, I remember when that came right so but but you could also just scan the app you need to identify yourself somehow  I think probably safer to use you know the phone's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  App and it's yeah, it's totally fine. Although it is annoying to have like 18 different Amazon apps on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  True if you opt out of the cashier list technology there aren't any cashiers  You'll have to use self-checkout or go over to a customer service booth  Yeah, it's really an interesting idea to put this in a in a normal sized Whole Foods

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's also like I wonder about the communication with like  So you can't just turn this on because people who are used to that being their grocery store who aren't like tech people  Are they gonna just walk in and be like what the heck so it's yeah, what I can't I shop here. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank you. What if you're more than one person shopping at a time?  Well one knows that you the person picked that up off the shelf and put the cart  What if my wife and I are both shopping nothing that happens because she thinks I'm a disaster in a grocery store  But just theoretically or your kid grabs.

Transcript:  But this is the best paragraph in this article  While snapchat dysmorphia has existed since 2015 and is connected to so-called  Alien face big eyes abnormally raised cheekbones  Zoom dysmorphia is different in a key way  With snapchat dysmorphia patients would come in to see the cosmetic consultant with a photo of themselves that would be heavily filtered  Yet there's an awareness in the patient's behalf that there's some dysmorphia going on but with zoom dysmorphia. It's unconscious  People don't understand there's distortion happening with their cameras  So there is nothing on your forehead. It's it's just zoom. There's something wrong with my monitor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a gray spot on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As many selfies as I see online I am calling total bored  Bull on this because selfies don't make anybody look good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not true people change their  They they like teach you how to take a good selfie, you know, like people I think  Maybe y'all are I mean one I'm just gonna throw this out here as a woman who is  Inherently judged first off because I'm a woman by my appearance just so true that is the default expectation  it's a so it is I I try you know, I pay attention to these things even though I I  Don't actually pay that much attention because I'm not I  Don't know I've never you know that time is raised by wolves. Yeah, you don't yeah, I just yeah  I don't care mostly but it is tough to see it every day and it is tough to  Feel like like it  Intellectually, I know no one's judging me for it, right because what I say is more important  But I will say that girls and young women and older women  Yeah, are like does my neck look weird? Yeah, probably no, you know teenage girls is noses

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why right there's so many rhinoplasties among teenage girls. In fact, this article quotes a Harvard Medical School professor  Dr. Shadi Kourosh  Who says there's an increase in employment requests for appearance related issues during the pandemic  Increase yes in in March British plastic surgeons reported a 70% increase in consultations  People were complaining about sagging skin in the lower face and neck  We wondered if this was because people were holding their smartphones at odd angles there while they're looking down  And also there's a certain amount of distortion as you get closer  As you get closer these are somewhat wide-angle right and  So they so that's there's distortion that makes your nose look big for instance  So actually I'm not I'm not surprised  I mean, it's not like looking in a mirror and people don't spend hours of their well some people most people those teenage teenage girls  Might that's where the nose things maybe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you see I have the opposite one meet for a long time meet would not show you or relationally other people  And I'm wondering what do I look like right now? What if I pick my nose right?  I find it more comforting to me because it's for you know doing this show for 25 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To just know you get used to this. Yeah, and I have to say as somebody's worked in television for years  It's where in radio by the way the same thing happens to their voice the first time you hear your voice  You remember that the first time you heard what tape recorders or anything?  And then thank you for turning off the camera. Oh, there it is. Okay, the  First after a while you get used to seeing yourself, but it's a weird experience for the first few years  So yeah, I'm not surprised that this is  cropping up

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And for everyone saying narcissism or vanity I would say  No, because we do judge a significant amount about people based on their pen appearance and we can see  Studies about people who are paid more or who are good-looking get paid more both men and women  So right I  Don't know I mean yes, there is a point over which it becomes silly, but it's it's almost the opposite of narcissism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's it's overblown humility, right? It's it's it's a bad self-image is far more the case  And I have terrible teeth. I have a huge nose. I'm pink. I'm pink  I tell you you know and so I hate all of that, but not anything to do about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's a this was a shocker  And I find this really hard to believe an internal memo in the LAPD  Shows that employees police officers were directed to use field interview cards  Even when an individual is not arrested or even accused of a crime  copies of the field interview cards police complete when they questioned civilians reveal that LAPD officers are instructed to record a  civilians Facebook  Instagram Twitter and other social media accounts alongside basic biographical information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the story about data miner

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, this is the story and this is from the the Guardian also an internal memo further shows the police chief  Michelle Moore  Told employees it was critical to collect the data for use in investigations arrests and prosecutions and warned that  Supervisors would review cards to ensure that they were complete now look at line 92 if you run related

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The LAPD worked with data miner during the George Floyd protests  So they were tying your real-life activity to your virtual life activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This comes from the nonprofit Brennan Center for for justice  They were they were on they checked with 40 other police agencies and were unable to find another department that required social media collection  on interview cards  Yeah, this probably started with Black Lives Matter  But it goes even fat farther back in 2015 the department added social media accounts as a line on this physical field interview cards  Similar to a nickname or an alias a person's online persona or identity  Used for social media can be highly beneficial to investigations. This is Charlie Beck a former LAPD chief  Yeah, that makes sense  That's what the bad guys do too. What's interesting is you don't have to have been arrested or even accused of a crime  It's just if you're if you're interviewed by the police, can you refuse that's what I was going to ask  If they're just innocent

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Refuse that's what I was going to ask if they're just interviewing me asking me questions, even though I'm not guilty  Can I just just refuse to share well, I certainly would I think you have the right to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, fourth amendment this one is it fourth? No fifth amendment

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But as as you would not as you probably know, especially if you're black saying no to a police officer could be a little risky  quite possibly

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  additional info additional Wow  Email social media accounts Twitter Instagram Facebook  They also want your gang or moniker I  Can I guess I you know, it's I'm in the twit gang  I don't think it's you also don't think it's unlegitimate to have these fields  I think what's what's the question is how much pressure there is to collect this from everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's let's look at where these interviews could happen per se  some gang run  neighborhood or whatever and the police is doing their  Trying to do their job and they're just trying to gather information  And they go to ask all of these questions and the person that they're asking they probably don't even know their rights, right? So  And just fishing a barrel for the law enforcement

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a group called stop LAPD spying coalition and its director  Said it's like stop and frisk which it is I guess and it's happening with a clear goal of surveillance

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so they've got like internal lists like known gang member lists on Twitter and you could just follow those I  Don't know. I mean, here's a really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Going to though all of the people out there doing these data breaches and and whatnot  They're pretty much doing the same thing just  Pinpointing all right, who's the weak person that I can go and hit on and get my weight into said organization

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're looking at all of that same stuff. They're also asking for social security numbers. And here's the disclaimer. Oh, no, that's bored if  Careful what you say  I might have to ask for your Twitter account if social security numbers are requested the following disclaimer must be read  This is on the card  Get this federal law requires that you be informed when asked for your social security number that it must be  provided for use in identification  Authority for requiring this information is based upon field interview procedures operational prior to January 1

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1975 well the social security number card was was introduced  It was not allowed for any form of identification because everyone was freaking out about it was privacy  gotten shirts of the time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They talked to a lawyer and they were right to cuz like remember how now it's associated with all this information  People like stole your SSN from your like your hospital beds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean guardian asked Kathleen Kim a Loyola professor of law and immigrants rights expert who previously served in the LA Police Commission  She said I am not aware of any law requiring individuals to disclose social security numbers to local police. That's a lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're actually lying our back it back it like it lying the police lying to people no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She said she was shocked to learn about the social security section on the cards  Noting it was so antithetical to the department's own policies and clearly violated the spirit of sanctuary laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why they asked for social security numbers. I was wondering if you're a citizen or not  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  LAPD says we're updating the policy but we would decline to provide further details  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's just really I you know, it's nice. You wonder where else this is happening  Yeah, I mean I would they said that for it 40 other they asked around to see if anybody else was doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I bet you what do you think Minneapolis? Yeah  Yeah informally if not Arizona Arizona all of Arizona, yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ProPublica should get these cards from to do something useful get these cards from police departments across the country  There are FOIA. You should be able to get them. Yeah, get them filled out cards. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there you go  Australia's top court finds media companies  Are are liable for other people's Facebook comments

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not just Facebook but also Twitter everywhere else  So if you're a media company and you put a story up on  Facebook and you allow comments there because the Facebook you could cut it off then anyone's that anything says under that  You are liable for as if it occurred in your own space  That's great gray it is completely cray cray  Guess who doesn't like this Rupert Murdoch News Corp. It's so bad. How bad is it? It is so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes me agree with Rupert Murdoch news Corp called for legislators to change Australia's laws to protect them from liability  It says it essentially makes media companies responsible for other people's comments  Even when they're unaware that the comments have been  Posted they've appealed News Corp and nine entertainment have appealed to the high court

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you want to know what it's like to get rid of section 230 this there you have it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, this is completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Insane a rag and I know in the legal people I trust are going completely nuts about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I treat oh, so this is actually this was the response to the appeal the high court said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's okay, but the actual libel case hasn't occurred yet  I put another explainer up on the run down somewhere and so that's still going on this morning when I saw it  I was up early. I said wake up call to Jeff Kossoff and Daphne Keller and Mike Mazdick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure they're talking about it. So  You can if you post on these sites you can say no comments, right? I guess only recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only recently but it'll say Twitter. So on Twitter you can you can say that you can't  Comment on that but I can retweet it and comment on it and and and copy and paste it comment on it  Yeah, and and there's no the whole point of section 230 was to enable a public conversation  Because what would happen is without that then we'd see that that would be completely limited and no one would go to any liability  No one would allow any comments and we were stuck with only mass media again. This sucks  And Australia's being stupid and Canada almost as stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The case was initially initially brought by somebody named Dylan Vohler. He was detained in a juvenile detention center  Became the subject of media attention articles about mr  Vohler that media outlets posted on Facebook drew comments from other Facebook users falsely accusing him of serious crimes  Vohler's lawyers said media companies have a strong commercial imperative to increase engagement on their posts and that they  Assisted the publication of the third-party comments by posting articles in the first place his lawyers said this decision put  Responsibility where it should be on media companies with huge resources to monitor public comments and circumstances where they know  There is a strong likelihood of an individual being defamed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Individual being defamed but it's more than that Leo. So so let's say that that  You as a media company post something on Facebook and  Stacey comes in and defames me in the comments under that I  Could sue Stacey and she has a nice house, you know  I could get something out of it, but I'm far better off suing you because you're a media mogul and  And that's what's gonna happen  In these cases what they're saying is people are not gonna sue the speaker they're gonna sue the intermediary  For liabilities, but this creates intermediary liability. It's quite literally and so  You're gonna go after the biggest pockets and the biggest pockets gonna be media companies. And that's why Murdoch doesn't like this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Also Jeff you have a nice house as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want two of them. I'm greedy. I want yours too. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're rolling out our first public testing of communities  Which gives people a place to have more focused conversations with people who share the same interests kind of sounds like reddit to me  communities introduces two  Very key mechanics that I think are worth touching on  Mechanics that I think are worth touching on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So click on that thread or no, go go down further in history explains. Okay, whoops. Oops. Oops

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twitter thing work  One tweets you post in communities are narrow casted to only the people in that community  They're still public but they aren't amplified to all your followers and they don't show up in your profile  We think this can lower the pressure of talking on Twitter. I  Think a lot of people who are on Twitter wanted to go to the largest possible number of people but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so you don't put any communities right but in a case where I'm in my I'm in my book wonks  My book history wonks community. Yeah, right and right now I'm not really in the community because I've  Picked all them from my list  I'd rather be in a community with them able to ask my wonky book history Gutenberg questions  To that's group specifically red

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So well, I wonder  You know is it in this kind of you're kind of sticking this on top of Twitter, which is really of a different beast  I feel like no. All right sounds like reddit envy to me being this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  Jack's talked about this for a long time about trying to do more communities and lists

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry being being this week in Google Google Plus was attempting to do the exact same thing that's this call remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that failed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is the voice of expertise as a social media manager. Mr. Ant Pruitt. Yeah  So the initial the initial one of them are you you're a community?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The initial communities are asked true hashtag astro Twitter. I guess astronomy right that's John would like that  Yeah, hashtag dog Twitter for you Jeff  hashkags skin hashtag skincare Twitter for you Stacey and your and your dot and  hashtag soul food  For sneaker lovers S OLE soul food  Sneaker lovers. I'm there's nothing for me in here. Once people join a community dogs. I  Don't have a dog though. Yeah, you know, I said ready really maybe it's more like Facebook groups  You think maybe  Communities have moderators these mods determine the rules and the social norms within that community  Does Facebook groups have mods like that? Yeah, they do don't they you have to have well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends I can start a group and abuse it. Oh, I see. Yeah, but it doesn't it's not a yeah  I'm guessing here if you screw up the community you might get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you can do more the mods can hide tweets and kick people out as well  We're just what is Twitter due to a bad mod. I wonder mmm  cave-on  Continues we're just getting started here  We'll be scaling up communities as we learn more and improve the product lots of new features and improvements on the way in the future  Anybody could start a community today creation is limited to what we're testing at which  Jeff Jarvis begged please

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I joined wonder what their testing strategy is because what I remember the most about  Google Plus and Google Plus communities was the the bad actors and how much time I spent  Other so much spam. Yeah, just fighting off the spam and the trollers and stuff like that. It was it was an effort  I wondered what what they have in place to try to you know  Keep that stuff at bay because they're going to be groups that are you know, pretty exclusive if you will  It might be saying I don't know a black photographers group or that'd be cool  You know and and they in that group could get trolled by someone who says hey, this is a racist group

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the mods can kick people out so  No, that's it. You know, that's an inherent problem with communities. It's very hard to do well  So I'll be interested to see how they do it. Yeah, they're also  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Communities don't scale. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You you as a photographer might like this they're gonna they're trying edge to edge pictures and video in the timeline  So instead of that little bitty picture you goes all the way to the edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's still on a four inch phone. Yeah, it's still time see

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See disheaning bezel  So that's and all of these are tests that are rolling out slowly  There's another new one or in the middle of the Twitter change log. Yeah, it really is  Really is isn't it?  Twitter support says we're making it easier to be the curator of your own followers list  Now you can remove a follower without blocking them and they won't know you've removed them this is it so you ghost them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really interesting. Yeah  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wonder oh man, I wonder if people are gonna have me and follow them as a reporter  This is interesting because sometimes you follow people just to keep up on like movement or news or kind of  So I wonder if people instead of just blocking them will just start unfollowing reporters

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if if if they're removed as a follower of yours and  Not essentially blocked. Do they still see your content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they can they can if they go to your page, they'll see it  I think but in there, but they won't notice that the GI haven't heard from Matt in a while  Oh, he's just not doing much. Meanwhile, and is tweeting up a storm, but I don't see Ant because Ant said I'm too wrinkled  And he didn't want me to follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I guess this is live cuz you're too pink I  Guess this is live. My nose is too big. No pinkies allowed  I guess this is a lot live now because I can go to my list of  Followers and I can click the three doc and I can actually remove this follower  So it's not like a mute or a block. They it's they silently will stop seeing my tweets  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Learned something new today from Dave Weiner because he begged to be taken out of the CC list on a Twitter  Conversation was going on and I didn't know you could take one person out of it. Yes. That's a new feature as well  Yeah, that's nice, too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And  Yeah, you know I like it it's funny they've gone for ages without doing anything and all of a sudden they're doing all sorts of last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  few months they've really really did a lot of  Come on is a chief product guy there. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is all part of basically what they're calling new privacy tools  Social privacy how users manage their oxymoron by the way social privacy  It's how you manage your reputation and identity on the service

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They better be careful with that actually that's where Facebook got in trouble is  Confusing public and private if you're on the internet  You're public and if you have this this presumption that no one's gonna see this  Then the platform is gonna get in trouble for that  So they need to find I think a different way to position this you will also now be able to hide past tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would save a lot of people a lot of trouble. There are a number of people and their jobs  I mean, it's like endless now people losing their jobs because of something they tweeted years ago. Yeah  I used a third party to something

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go and grew from I should say one one hopes grew fun from yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, some people delete all their tweets every like years. Yeah, I did that I deleted a whole bunch of them like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not cuz there was anything in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That I was embarrassed. I mean sometimes like like as a reporter. I dump all my notes after every year because  You have to have a system

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A mother among other features being considered  Is being able to set a time limit on?  Tweets so they're no longer visible to others after a specific amount of time you designate  Interesting. Yeah by expiring tweets  When  When social media, I'm sorry social privacy me needs are not met people limit their self-expression  They withdraw from the conversation says Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't think anyone's service can be everything to all people like I'll be that's I feel like all these  Like we must embrace as much of the social experience as possible  But for that you're gonna need different products and some of them aren't gonna scale well  Because there are conversations you will have with five people that you will not have with  5,000 people and if they could just get that through their freaking heads, that would be amazing. That's all. Oh, so this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that tool to remove somebody from a conversation only you could do it  Jeff but what's coming is the ability for Dave Weiner to do it himself  So that's the new feature of that users will be given the option to remove themselves from a public conversation on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh god, there's times I get sometimes I just happen to be, you know  Early on and then people get into a huge fight and it goes on and your name is still in there every time they respond

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I don't that would be a nice feature. I've been using the mute conversation button  Will that mute every that that conversation? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Cuz I get hit on those what do you call follow Friday post?  I  Fairly often and you know and I go through and read them but after a while  I'm like, okay, I got other stuff to do and I'm tired of seeing this notification  I just hit mute  Conversation and I don't see that conversation anymore doesn't mean I unfollowed them or anything like that  It just means I moved on to something else to talk about this particular day

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is all of these new things is part of an initiative chief executive officer Jack Dorsey  This is from Bloomberg said last March that Twitter has moved too slowly in recent years to launch new products  He said they're rolling out new tools tools more quickly was now a company wide goal naming it alongside revenue and user growth targets  Specifically Dorsey said he wanted to double the number of features per employee  That directly drive either user growth growth or revenue  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're a spongebob now miss Stacy is you talked about they?  Not all of these platforms are gonna be for everybody  But that's not gonna stop them from being ambitious and wanting to to have more users  That's that's their end goal sure sure some investor is telling them. Hey, we need more market share and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are you gonna do active user mo use? It's a metric. It's a KPI we care about KP eyes

Transcript:  It's gonna start using that on members of the twit club got your KP eyes are not up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That gives me it's funny it gives me anxiety I  Hate the idea of now you're responsible for twice as many  Initiatives that'll double revenue  I hate that the company that I do the radio show for premiere has something like that for their executives  Where they know you're 15% increase in revenue every year and what gives me just a pit  Hole in the pit of my stomach. I just don't I can't take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a little out of date I think oh  Apple music yes, this is wrong  This is wrong  Because it says Spotify's behind Apple music, which is not the case. I'm not in the IRC. I'm sure IRC has  Oh, let me check  Apple is believed to have between 70 and 80 million subscribers, but it hasn't updated those numbers since 2019 says the chat  So that's why  so Spotify hundred sixty five million  Apple let's say 80 million and then YouTube pretty respectable 50 million.

Transcript:  What do you mean rather in life I'd rather be Google  Yeah, you mean oh, yeah, I mean actually you should say whose wallet would you rather have Daniel Ek or Larry pages  Yeah, I'm a zones. Yeah, Amazon's wallet  Google music see I think YouTube music is a little bit funny because it also includes  YouTube premium no ads  And actually that's the reason I have Google music in fact in a way for me what it was was I bought YouTube premium  And I got app YouTube music kind of as an additional Amazon Prime strategy. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you buy YouTube TV, do you get YouTube premium or those are totally separate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's totally separate because I tried that no yeah YouTube. It would be nice wouldn't that be nice  I tried that one. Why yeah, you know I dropped YouTube TV and it's really expensive to premium. Yeah, it's really expensive  65 bucks. Yeah, unless you want to get 4k  Yikes, but the 4k does look good  There is not a lot of 4k content  But if you like sports in fact you would like it and cuz all the college a lot of college football oddly enough is 4k

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not NFL, but college. I'm still on Hulu TV live and it's it's it's fine  It's fine. Yep, plus it doesn't screw up my doesn't you screw up my YouTube?  Algorithm far as the recommendations go to so so YouTube TV was dipping into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's an interesting stat you for all that YouTube's doing well  Tick-tock has actually overtaken YouTube for average watch time in the US sorry in the UK  Yeah, all of our role hook. We're all this comes from app Annie. That's me  Now because YouTube  Has the by far the most users it's got the largest overall time spent, you know millions of hours or whatever  They're two billion monthly YouTube users tick-tock is only about 700 million as of mid 2020, but  Average amount of time per user spent on the app is higher for tick-tock  Which surprises me because I my sense of people who use YouTube like like the hard heads ant are that they will just they'll just keep  It running and running and running and running and running for hours on an end. No, that's that's me

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  Hey, if you send me one of those I'll do the next twig for my deck. That'd be cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish we could afford to hear that because these would be really cool to have  They are expensive. Although, you know because businesses save an average of $11,000 per halftime telecommuter a year  That pays for it says Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hmm so this is the here's the CNET see I saw that in the first time I would also my line was mobile device management from  the IT department

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, sure  Look at this. So this is the 27 inch. It's basically a $2,000 monitor, but you can use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  The also the September security patch is rolling out so and the factory images and OTAs are live  so check your your phone, especially if you have a Google phone, you should be getting an update very soon and  Google clock is  Is broken this is actually a warning because the alarms are broken leading to a flurry of  1-star Play Store reviews nothing worse than when alarm doesn't go off

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's  Last time I use an alarm but I can see why that would aggravate people. So this is a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is from reddit posted by rip tire 21 PSA  Currently using an alarm and have it set to use Spotify  Switch back to system sounds until an update is released. Oh  So that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then it's the Spotify integration. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well, and then of course  Somebody immediately came in and said is there any fix for the pixel 3 devices stuck in EDL mode? That's that's been a  Increasing growing problem of people's pixel 3 is being bricked

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Bricked  Planned obsolescence

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's the EDL mode is you know  Normally you would hook it up to a computer to get it fixed  But that it's not working. So it's kind of unclear what's going on here and people basically have  broken pixel 3s  Google has confirmed  the issue 3 and 3 XL smartphones are bricking  But Google says it has nothing else to share for now  In other words, I'm sure they're trying to figure out what the heck's going on  EDL is the emergency download mode in theory you'd connect it to a computer and download a new firmware but  And that's built into the Qualcomm chips, but it's not working  It's not working users are confirming the devices are in EDL mode by plugging them into computers  They see a device ID that says  Q USB bulk CID followed by their serial numbers many of these devices can be charged but the screens remain  Unresponsive it's not clear why this is happening Google's investigating and that's  The Google changelog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see how we can make the show title. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, it's cuz I it's cuz I ran down to get my thing of the week. I think I talked about this on  This weekend tech maybe but I don't think I've done it here. So apologies if you've seen this but a couple weeks ago  I said I was testing the swarm eval kit. This is a  Satellite dev kit to test swarm $60 a year satellite IOT service. So I  Have been testing it this is intermittent service small packets and this is my kit  the solar panel there is  Would you send a level can you put this outside?  Yes, it's been living outside. It's water proof outside. Yeah, I was I would think yeah  It does need to live outside  Over very adequately here, but see back here. All right, this is the tripods getting in my way here  That can you see the little tile yeah, yeah  All right, so this is the thing of the week I've been testing it so you get you know, this is not constant connectivity  Eventually, it will be once every hour at least right now some hours go by without a satellite hitting my neck of the woods  But it's still really fun. So what would you use it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you only get 750 one-way data packets a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so people use it for sensors like  Bluetooth sensor to this and you get like do you need to water your plants or someone else is using it for a device?  It's a service called boat secure  And it's basically letting people know if someone's like  Messing with their boat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's lots can you send the images are very small packets

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know it's just yeah, this is this is just text or said time series data  I mean, but there's a lot of demand for stuff like this and $60 a year is not a lot. That's five bucks a month  So and this eval kit is expensive because it you know comes with a solar panel comes with a featherweight board  it comes with all this stuff, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so the message is the messages go through the satellite or they go through your I?  Guess they do  Yeah, so they have satellites swarm has satellites

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Swarm has yes swarm has a couple thousand satellites in there. Wow, maybe a couple hundred. I can't remember  They're the company just so y'all know swarm was recently bought by SpaceX. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. That's why we were talking. Oh, I have heard about them now  Yeah, that's why we were talking about him. I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I have ordered SpaceX  I don't know if it'll when it'll come there's a waiting list  But I ordered Starlink SpaceX is Starlink because I'm very curious how that will work out  For that you have to have a clear line of sight does this swarm require to work with you do need I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  trees are gonna  Cause some problems. This isn't a bad like I have trees  But I managed to find a good spot where I did like it's not that crazy. I'm a little nervous actually now that I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't know where I'm gonna put  The dish dishy McDish face, I don't know  I guess I have to get up on the roof and put up a like a TV antenna rod  Because it needs to be high  We have video of you doing oh you will definitely. Yeah, you will definitely  dwarf  Just for you I'll put my knees in my sandals and I'll do it up a dwarf on the roof just for you  All right cool swarm so this is a somewhat specialized thing, but if you knew  You need to send location data or some sort of textual data. That's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool because it's satellite so it's everywhere right  Yeah, it's cheaper than

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much a month 60 bucks a month five dollars a month Oh five sixty a year a year. Oh, that's not yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's super cheap like for it that price  I mean if I had a couple Bluetooth sensors in my yard, it'd be worth it. You know yeah, they just couldn't access Wi-Fi right I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think would you put it on your mailbox to let you know when the mail's here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, cuz I don't really care what my mail's here. Yeah, maybe nothing in the mail anymore. It's like the phone  I know it's true. Isn't it? I got lots of good things in the mail. I love catalogs y'all. Yeah, I get packages

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like packages let's do a number  With Jeff John by the way swarm dot space I should mention swarm dot space. Oh, yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do one related. You've been wanting to test Starlink, right? Yes  So Tom Eveslin is tested. Let me explain who Tom Eveslin is first because he's a very important character  Tom was the founder of an ahead of ITXC, which was a major VoIP company  He before that was the  Person who created world net at AT&T and he took the clock off the internet  Before Tom there was no unlimited you always you paid by the minute your parents were after you are you still on that internet?  And Tom is the guy who changed the world and took the clock off the internet Tom is a real leader  He's an amazing guy. He's a friend. I haven't talked to me. He's a friend really great guy  So anyway, he is also I think he was the chief technology officer of Vermont  And other things up there. He lives up there. I know him

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, this is I remembering this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, he's a great guy. Yes, he's a great guy. Brilliant. Brilliant  So Tom's and his wife married up in Vermont and they've you know  They have to deal with the problems of being remote with connectivity. He finally got fiber, but he's connected  He had a terrible DSL. So he's finally fixed on that but he wanted to compare  Starlink beta versus fiber and the fiber we know what that is the starlink  He was getting  75 to 200  down  It could go as low as 40 but as high as 325  The average he says is probably about 125 down upload varies between 8 and 15  The latency as a rule is running 45 to 60  MS microsecond. No, what is that milliseconds? Yeah milliseconds  So with a loaded latency that is the same when you actually use it with my zoom is running 300  That's not great or twitch. Yeah, right. What's your what's your high end for latency? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess we could deal with 300 which is a third of a second. Yeah  That what we could deal with that. I would like to do that with me in hotels in other words  Oh, yeah, whether we didn't that's not unusual anytime. But we happens all the time  We'll have guests on who you could tell the latency is terrible because they'll start talking and you're while somebody else is talking  We're all asking a question and there's a delay and it can often be, you know, almost a second  I think that happens that right John. I mean, do we keep track of latency?  Yeah, Renee's latent he's very latent I've always thought  It's blame Canada  It's funny because Rogers yeah the time it's funny cuz Tom says we're heavy zoomers  Which in fact upstream and latency are very important for so  Yeah, he says it's kind of tolerable. He can live with it. Yeah. Yeah  This is about what I've seen and expect for myself as well Starlink has frequent period

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says it generally stays up but about 10 per hour the latency will spike for five seconds or more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible. That's unusable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So his fiber connection is a hundred thirty one dollars a month is Starlink is ninety nine dollars a month  Starlink kit cost six hundred bucks with taxes and shipping pretty much installed itself though  He has Tom Epsilon the expert in all things communications  And you can't really get it now, but out of curiosity. I thought that was a Thomas

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, so you pay a hundred bucks to get in line  Which I've done and I don't know when I'll get it, you know, they're slowly rolling out  if  They're calling it he says the better than nothing beta  So that's honest advertising yeah, no you're good at that  Despite what Amazon says about him. Did you see what Amazon said about Elon Musk? Wow. No, oh, they're there  This is just getting vicious  He's in space boys at war yes, you tell do tell yeah. All right, I'll find it here. Hold on a second  Amazon slams  SpaceX and not just to anybody they told the FCC  That the Musk companies are rule breakers. Here's the quote  This is they sent this to the FCC whether it's launching satellites with unlicensed antennas  launching rockets without approval building an unapproved launch tower or  Reopening a factory in violation of shelter-in-place order the conduct of SpaceX and other musk lead companies  Makes their view plane rules are for other people and those who insist upon or even simply request  Compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So let me tell you this is the satellite industry. They're vicious these people hold  Nothing back their comments to the FCC are usually excellent the lobbyists in the space  Do like swarm and orbcom are fighting over the use of the same spectrum orbcom's  Letters to the FCC accused swarm of doing very similar things. This was pre musk buying them  What although maybe they were they were twins although?  Sarah's Canadian, so I can't imagine her not abiding by rules. Anyway, the point is  satellite  Those those people are pirates they're amazing. It's so fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so Amazon is not held back ensuing other companies like Microsoft  When they can't compete in fact SpaceX's responses Amazon frequently tries to hinder competitors to quote  Compensate for Amazon's failure to make progress of its own  Amazon's trying to torpedo SpaceX's request for the next generation of Starlink satellites  They want to launch now. I last time I saw it was 12,000 now says 30,000  broadband  satellites  So yeah, it's it's vicious. It's vicious  In today's filing Amazon said it's making its response to SpaceX with a quote with a sigh  a  Heavy sigh  And you know, they're not fully wrong in this I mean I don't anyway, yeah  Yeah, it's an interesting battle and it's not Amazon's gotten very feisty under Andy Jassy. They're  Aggressive I will let you know  I'm actually supportive of Starlink because the notion of high speed internet access  Available to every corner of the globe is very intriguing  Admittedly, it's very expensive right now, but they've said they'll be able to get the price down  In fact, they've got new satellites or new dishes coming that are less expensive. So  We shall see  We shall see  And was that a number that was just your your there's a lot of numbers  There were a lot of numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will give you the link to Tom Eveslin's blog. It's Tom Eveslin comm EVSL I and it's called fractals of change  Nothing just mentioned. Yes his subtype other things that I found interesting this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I won't go into them at any length  But but Amazon is now shipping cargo for others outside of Amazon not a surprise  Yeah, that's really much like the AWS strategy. Yeah, I found that interesting. Yeah  Visio got a hundred million dollars in upfront advertising  your TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not surprising as well  You know LG pushed an update to my LG TV that started to show ads and all sorts of stuff  Then I got another update yesterday that took it all back. So I wonder if there's a little heat  From

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Show it even like is it like your Kindle like even when it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure it shows when you first turn on the TV. There's little pop-up ads and in some of the user interface  There's a little pop-up ads  And that's not sure what Vizio is. Yeah, I'm sure that well, I'm sure that's what Vizio is doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they also know what you watch and who you are and well, that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's not merely that Vizio showing ads. I wonder I mean, I don't know that hundred million dollars if it goes to  Also purchasing customer viewing information because there's a lot of that coming from these smart TVs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vizio ads was created. I would have talked about but I wanted to be in in harmony with Stacey and do connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I think this stuff is horrifying  I wrote like canoe ventures was a Comcast ventures effort to do something similar to this back in  2008 and I wrote one of the most excruciating pieces of my career on that. Here just  Excruciating  Is that not how you say the word or excoriating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excoriating oh, I can't it was excruciating for her as she excoriated those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excruciating for them because she excoriated them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There we go excoriate show title here is here is Vizio's come on to  advertisers from Vizio ads the direct-to-device  advertising platform built for the future of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The home where our audience is the core of innovation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like the poetry I used to write in like high school for my teachers who loved that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they just told you they love every niche. I hate every demographic  Every red solo cup using data  Yeah, innovative ad formats. Yes. So in a way, that's how they're selling the information they gather is  You know, they're they're saying look we can put that pizza ad right in front of somebody about to watch a football game

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really pissed my pizza place got rid of tip-to-tip our audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  verification  Manage frequency. Yeah, see this is why it's hard to sell podcast advertising. Oh, by the way, did you see that?  The audience's will be happier  So it's all good  Everybody wins nobody's excruciated  Second by second content recognition Wow  This is them saying telling advertisers. They know everything about what I'm watching on their Vizio TV  Patrol on one of them. Yeah, they're not supposed to do that with kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow, well, maybe it's an adult who owns the TV. Oh, maybe yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Ampruitt pick of the week my friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, since y'all were talking about starlink  I figure out there are one more starlink reference out there and that's with our co-hosts of floss weekly  Mr. Jonathan Bennett, I believe he's a starlink user  there in Oklahoma and he does the show over that connection and  Episode 638 of floss weekly they had  David Tatt on  Dave Tatt and he talked a lot about Mr. Buffer bloat. Yeah buffer bloat and he talked about conversations with  He's on a boat. He's on a boat on a dad gum boat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  During the show it was such a cool show. What kind of internet did he have? Where did he get his internet?  He didn't say that's pretty good for a boat, but he was doing it. There's Jonathan. Yeah, he's a he's on a starlink  It's pretty cool. Yeah, in fact, it was his positive experience with the show  His positive experience with the starlink that kind of encouraged me to take a chance myself  it's also because Lisa said we have to have a  Backup if Comcast goes down, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
