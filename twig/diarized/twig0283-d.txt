Can I get that on Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get that on Amazon.  I left a copy on your desk.  I know you did.  I was so sweet.  I just came in as you were as you were crying in pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Book Fairy left me something while I was getting tattooed.  Yes.  Nice to have you.  And as you know, Gina has left the building.  She'll be back every month.  But right now we've got a great person replacing her.  Matthew Ingram is here from Giga Home.  Always great to have Matthew on the show.  Hi, Matthew.  How are you doing?  Nice to have you.  Your Canadian fellas up there.  Blackberry is near.  Is Waterloo near you?  It's a couple hours away.  You're in Ottawa, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Toronto.  OK.  Is it kind of is it a backwater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure I'm sure they wouldn't like to think of it that way.  It's a smallish town in a sort of rural area.  Isn't it funny that Blackberry is there?  Yeah.  Well, they came out of the University of Waterloo.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Well, they may not be there much longer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of writers reported that Blackberry was in play, that Samsung had made an offer  of as much as seven and a half billion dollars.  And immediately Blackberry stock jumped 30 percent, closing at $12.59 on the day.  You can see that's that spike.  This is the one day graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Boom.  Yeah.  If I drop off, it's because I'm selling some shorts that I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do not short Blackberry at this point.  But this is not the first time we've heard this rumor.  In fact, this rumor has been floating around for years, literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it makes a certain amount of sense.  I mean, that's why it keeps coming up.  It would make a certain amount of sense for Samsung.  Blackberry has patents that have value.  QNX theoretically has value.  You know, the question is what that value is.  Seven and a half billion, I don't know, seems steep to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Business Insider says the patents alone are only two to three billion.  And we kind of know this because there was some thinking about chopping up Blackberry  and selling off the parts.  So we kind of know what's the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the other like five billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to wonder, you know, QNX was a big part of CES.  Ford has announced they're going to use QNX in the new Ford SYNC, replacing Microsoft's  car operating system.  QNX is actually a very highly regarded real time operating system and Blackberry owns it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so that has value, but is it five billion?  Still, five billion.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, Matthew, you know how I love Canada.  You know how I'm a Canadianophile.  You know how I wanted to move to Canada.  But between Rob Ford and Blackberry and whatever else has been going on lately, what's going  on with Canada, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean?  Come on.  What's wrong with Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things are the same, you know, Rob.  We took care of Rob Ford, so that's not a problem anymore.  Is he not the mayor of Toronto anymore?  No, no, no.  He is a councillor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's back at, he's a councillor again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but yeah, I know we just have a regular old boring guy now.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you know, Matthew, I'm disappointed you didn't even apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I should say I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's happening to Canada?  What has happened?  I ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing has happened to Canada.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, we're still doing the same old stuff.  And in fact, I would argue with the whole lumber sexual trend, we're going to be on  top pretty soon.  Like that pretty much photos of that just look like Canadians, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just Hockey Night in Canada.  It's Hockey Night all over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, lumberjack jackets and  Yeah.  Boots and you invented that look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we invented that.  Not you personally, Matthew.  Not me personally.  Anyway, we'll watch that story.  It just broke a few minutes before the show began.  And I'm not sure exactly whether it's creditable or not.  Although the fact that the stock market clearly believes it, maybe gives it some lends it  some credibility.  We talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly, Google and Microsoft continue to bicker.  Now for the second week in a row, Google's security forces have revealed a flaw in Microsoft  Windows saying Microsoft had 90 days to fix it and did not.  So we're going to tell you about it.  Microsoft's response is effectively, come on, man.  Come on.  They did issue an out of cycle patch.  And then in related news, they say the Scroogled site note is down.  It points to a different site now, to a site called Why Microsoft.  So if you go to Scroogled.com, you get Why Microsoft.  I think that's probably not an auspicious name for a site, Why Microsoft.  No, it's not.  Why Microsoft.  But it ain't Scroogled.  In fact, of late under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has been kinder to Android and iOS than it  has been to its own Windows phone users, offering a touch first version of Office, for instance,  first on the iPad, and now it's coming to Android.  Still not on Windows phone, or Windows for that matter.  So maybe it's unrequited love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the vulnerability thing, I know there's a whole sort of etiquette around how  you release information like that, but I have to go with Google on this one.  I think that's a public service.  I mean, if Microsoft had time to do something or to say something, then they should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know this is the case that in the security community, if you discover a flaw, the thing  to do, the done thing is to tell the company that makes the software and give them an opportunity  to patch that.  Google did that.  I think maybe the only question is, well, then how much longer do you wait before you  disclose it?  Does anybody think you should never disclose it like, well, even if Microsoft didn't fix  it, Google should never tell anybody?  I think everybody agrees that at some point hackers are going to find it.  So it's incumbent on the security firm that discovers the flaw, if the company doesn't  fix it, to report it, right?  Or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the ethical?  Haven't you opened a window, Leo?  I mean, to ask you this, but isn't there a window open then between the time Microsoft  does act, has Google made Microsoft users more vulnerable?  Or is there the argument that, well, Microsoft didn't do anything, they were better off pushing  them into it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, someone in the chat room mentions that it was fixed a couple of days later.  Well, it was.  And that's fine.  So for a couple of days, it was an exploit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Microsoft wrote in the person of Chris Betts, who's a senior director of their security  response center, he posted, although following through keeps to Google's announced timeline,  Google did say, as always said, you get 90 days, keeps to Google's announced timeline  for disclosure, the decision feels less like principles and more like a gotcha with customers,  the ones who may suffer as a result.  What's right for Google is not always right for customers.  We urge Google to make protection of customers our collective primary goal.  Google says the public has a right to know about these flaws.  And if a company doesn't fix it, we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think if you don't have a timeline, then Microsoft can just say, yeah, we're going  to get around to that.  We're working on it.  Please don't say anything.  And then it's still a problem and nobody knows about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This has been going on for years.  And I think that this wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't Google and Microsoft, because  they're such obvious rivals.  But I remember talking to Matthew Conover, who was a security researcher.  This was on the screensaver.  So that means this is more than 10 years ago.  He was one of many researchers at a company called Woo Woo Security.  They had found a serious flaw in Microsoft Windows.  And he was irate.  He says, it's been over a year.  We've had many flaws in Windows and it's been over a year.  Microsoft has done nothing about it.  So in absence of this threat of disclosure, Microsoft may very well sit on its hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you give the company notice.  You have a time limit that's the same for everybody.  If you make an exception for Microsoft, give them a little longer.  You have to do that for everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Betts writes, we are in favor of something called coordinated vulnerability disclosure.  And this, as far as I can tell, is Microsoft's idea, although other software vendors apparently  have agreed to it.  Under the principle of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, finders disclose newly discovered  vulnerabilities in hardware, software and services directly to the vendors or to a national  CERT, computer emergency response team or other coordinator who will report to the  vendor privately or to a private service that will likewise report to the vendor privately.  The finder allows the vendor the opportunity to diagnose and offer fully tested updates.  The vendor continues before any party discloses vulnerability or exploit information to the  public.  The vendor continues to coordinate with a finder throughout the vulnerability investigation.  Upon release of an update, the vendor may recognize the finder in bulletins if her attacks  are underway in the wild and the vendor is still working on the update, then both the  finder and the vendor work together as closely as possible to provide early public vulnerability  disclosure to protect customers.  In other words, if it's a zero day.  But what they don't mention in this CVD policy, and it's again a Microsoft policy, is a time  frame.  The assumption is that Microsoft's going to work to patch it or any company's going to  work to patch it.  But what if they don't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the argument, one argument that I read was that Google could have, well, basically  that releasing the code, like effectively telling people how to use this exploit doesn't  help anyone but bad people.  It doesn't help users because there's no patch and so they can't fix it.  So effectively it only helps the bad guys.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And, okay, I'm going to play devil's advocate here because I don't, I guess the question  really is how long do you wait?  Do you wait a year?  Do you wait 10 years?  Because as the clock ticks, there's the increased likelihood that a bad guy will discover this  independently.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then we've got a problem.  The only real argument is Google could have just said there's an exploit or a vulnerability.  They didn't have to release the entire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's the way to do it, kind of stage the announcement.  Eventually you have to have a proof of concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would have gotten crap for that as saying, okay, now you know something and now you're  letting everybody know there's something there.  Now I don't think they could have done that.  I think they would have gotten more crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to get crap no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well and there's additional crap or maybe we should say, hey, let's change the metaphor.  Egg on Google's face because, and you guys talked about it last night and all about Android,  Jason Howell, there's a serious flaw in all versions of Android prior to KitKat that Google,  and this is an interesting, you got to choose your words carefully.  Some say won't, others say can't.  I would say can't fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't hear that distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it has to do with WebView and the old Android browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So remember that in the early days of Android, instead of getting Chrome on a Nexus device,  you'd get that blue icon that was, it said the internet I think.  Yeah, it was just Android browser.  The thing is that WebView is built in throughout the operating system.  So any application that displays a WebView, and many applications do for login purposes  and so forth, is using that WebView.  So it's not a simple component to patch, but it's a very severe flaw.  So what that means is billions of Android phone users are vulnerable to, I think it's  a cross-site scripting hack, and Google, okay, here's why I say can't patch it.  All Google can do, remember Google makes Android, but they don't control who uses it.  All Google can do is tell the manufacturers, the LGs and HTCs and Samsungs of the world,  hey, here's the patch, which they've done.  You need to push this out.  Google can't, has no physical means of pushing it out.  Samsung has to push it out.  Google didn't do the patch.  Well, and this is the other, yes, there is a patch.  Google did not do it, third party did it.  It's my understanding, but it's an open source project.  That's not unusual.  So the open source project has a patch.  But the problem is fixing this requires not just, and by the way, and the other thing  Google did, which is a point in their favor, they changed this system.  So in KitKat and later, they can push a patch out through the app store.  Through the Play Store.  So they can fix it now, but prior to KitKat, there was no mechanism for them to push this  out.  So all they can do is say to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because otherwise, otherwise Android's in a position of weakness versus a fascistic  control like iOS.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just the way Android is.  It's an open source project, which Google funded and bought, funded and supports.  And there's debate about how open it is because if you're going to use AOSP, then you want  Google services, you have to have the Google Store and blah, blah, blah.  But Google Apps, and then Google has to approve your implementation.  But that doesn't give Google the ability to go into a Samsung phone running gingerbread  and fix it.  They don't have any way to do that.  They have to go to Samsung.  And then by the way, Samsung probably has to go to the carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  There's so many layers of barriers in front of them.  Not to mention the platform numbers for Android that just came out basically say that the  versions that are affected here are more than 60% of all devices worldwide.  So the fact that Google doesn't have their hands specifically in it to address it themselves  and they're leaving it in the hands of researchers to discover and then independent third party  developers to code around it and then roll those changes in the AOSP.  And then does that get pushed out to all those two plus year old devices?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it gets, it's available to the manufacturers, but it's up to the manufacturers to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, you know, our manufacturer is ever rushing to update two year devices.  They want you to buy a new phone.  Heck no.  They're not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same with the carriers.  60% of Android devices are vulnerable.  They run jelly bean or lower.  If you're running 4.4 or later, you're fine because Google changed this and they update  through Play Services.  You've probably seen those Play Services updates.  They happen automatically.  So Google says we don't develop the patches ourselves.  We welcome patches with the report for consideration.  Other than notifying OEMs, we will not be able to take action on any report that is  affecting versions before 4.4.  The fix Google says is KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just update your device.  He's a cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simple.  I don't think you could fault Google for this, to be honest.  I mean, maybe they should have thought of it.  They didn't, they didn't set up a way to do this in the past.  They do have, they do have a way now.  Here's a good question.  P.S. Chopps asks in the chat room, have we seen exploits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think from what I read, the researchers have discovered these exploits and they have  been rolled in.  But I mean, they've discovered the holes.  Have they been exploited actively?  I suppose that's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should point out Apple does not fix bugs in iOS 4.  Microsoft doesn't fix bugs in Windows XP.  Right.  Anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anymore.  But they did for a pretty long time.  Right.  And so that's the issue.  Because of the market share, right?  Jelly Bean is.  Because there were so many users of XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Jelly Bean isn't that old.  Yeah.  So the fix, there's, I don't know what the fix is.  You have to get a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess with all of those companies, they're hoping at some point it's a trade-off between  Do you help or fix or do you kind of use that as a stick to get people to operate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why this Google Microsoft thing, timing couldn't be worse for Google.  Because Microsoft says, see, they're not fixing their flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But theirs is arguably not as fixable.  I mean, the Microsoft one.  That's what I would submit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And all desktop operating systems have a mechanism for fixing these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently Microsoft said, we've got regular fixes coming out in a couple of days.  Could you wait?  That's.  Right.  And Google said, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have waited to patch Tuesday.  Yeah, so I think there's a little.  There's a little.  There's a little F you in there.  Yeah.  Something for both sides.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we come back, we're going to talk about Title 2.  Um.  Self-driving cars, Google domains.  We should put that in the.  Are we going to do a changelog?  Jeff, what do you think?  We did such a bad job without Gina last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did.  We did.  I think we should incorporate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll just incorporate it in.  So you can retire the trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, do we have a changelog here?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I put a few things in there that would be changelog worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you mean that's pathetic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No offense to the producer.  I love you, but two things.  Two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina did find a lot of those things.  She worked hard.  You know, we miss her.  I'll put it.  I'll just put another one in.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure there's more.  Just put another one in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the effort to keep her.  In the effort to keep her.  I even.  It wasn't my job to do, so I had no authority, but I said, what if we go into the changelog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Let's work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we'll do the changelog.  We've got four things to have.  Three things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm putting some in there.  Our show today brought to you by HipChat.  See if we had, you know what?  We do have HipChat.  Let's set it up.  We should have a host HipChat.  HipChat is a great way for a team to stay in touch.  We started using it with our web design team, Four Kitchens, as we create a new web page,  a website for Twit.  And I was so blown away.  And then I realized, oh, this is from Alassi.  And they're using Jira at Four Kitchens, so it made a perfect relationship.  So HipChat Plus is a way of keeping teams on the same page, not just IM.  It's better than email because email, you know, is kind of asynchronous.  Well, I don't know.  It's just better.  I can't describe it.  It's so much better.  It gets the thing done.  So you've got IM, you've got texting, you've got cloud storage, document sharing apps.  You're probably using all of them, but HipChat puts it all in one place.  In video chat, document sharing, screen sharing, system updates, code sharing.  It integrates into 57 services like GitHub, Jira, Zendesk, and more.  So you know, you got a website monitoring service, it integrates it in and HipChat becomes  your kind of dashboard for everything that's going on.  Email's too slow.  Meetings get sidetracked.  Regular IM doesn't work.  HipChat Plus.  Plus, you can go back in time.  So like email, it's a record of everything you've talked about and done.  It's easy to set up, fun to use.  Your team will love it.  We love it.  It makes your team wildly productive.  And oh, by the way, iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, Mac, everywhere you are.  And even the web.  So that actually means it's everywhere.  The web-based version works on everything.  HipChat.com slash Trig.  I want you to try HipChat Plus for free.  You don't need to give them a credit card.  Don't worry.  Go to HipChat.com slash Twig.  Click on Start Chatting to sign up and invite a few team members.  All the features will be free for 30 days.  Actually for the first 100 signups that we do, they're going to extend that 30 day free  trial to 90 days.  So sign up right now.  Don't wait.  HipChat.com slash Twig.  After the free trial, you can always stick with the freemium version.  It's free forever.  Or if you want some of these additional features, it's very affordable.  HipChat.com slash Twig.  Free for 30 days.  Unless you do it right now in the first 100 signups right now, we'll get it for three  months free.  HipChat.  Your team, your project, in sync instantly.  And Jeff will send you a link because we have set up HipChat.  We use it now not only for the web designers, but our engineering team has started using  it.  Our sales team has started using it.  I think we need to host some producers' HipChat, Jason.  Wouldn't that be very helpful?  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That way we can foment revolt against you, boss.  You can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm all for it.  See, I'm a Democrat.  I'm a Gallitarian.  If you guys want to overthrow, fine.  I'll retire.  I'll move to the Seychelles Islands, enjoy the sand beach, white sand beaches, Mai Tais,  the endless Mai Tais.  So you know who else has lived there for a year?  Did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they like it?  They loved it.  Is it Dutch?  It is not Dutch.  It's sort of a weird amalgam of French and British and the local culture.  Perfect.  That's what I want.  But it's paradise, effectively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The République des Seychelles.  They actually have a creole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the only thing I remember is there's a replica of Big Ben in the main square on the  main island and it rings twice just in case you were sleeping through the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of nap times in the Seychelles.  It's 115 islands in the Indian Ocean.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to move there.  I'm retiring there.  What?  Nope.  You're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.  You can't.  Internet access is not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's why I'm going there.  That's precisely why I'm going to the Seychelles Islands.  So, Kevin Rose is retiring.  Well, not exactly.  He's leaving.  Retiring.  I was going to wear my Dig 4.  It was my idea shirt.  I should have.  He was at Google Ventures.  Remember, he found a dig.  He worked with us on the screensavers.  He's been on many times on our shows.  And he started a iOS app incubator called Milk, which he then sold to Google, joined  Google Ventures.  And then he backed down because he wanted to go back to app development.  Now he's going to do that.  His company, North Technologies, he's formerly left Google Ventures.  And, of course, it has raised $5 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's got $5 million in venture funding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The second app that lists the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the second app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  What's the second app?  It sounds just obnoxious.  Well, I have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, Ne.  Oh, Watchville.  Yeah, I have Watchville too.  So...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but that's just Kevin.  Okay.  For people who do...  I could have written that in my sleep.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just wildly overpriced watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's right.  It's basically...  It's not even an app, really.  It just aggregates watch blogs, and there are quite a few of them.  I think he's smart.  I think that the Apple Watch, especially the edition, the solid gold Apple Watch, is going  to jumpstart an interest in watches, in old school watches.  Good watch.  He's always been a watch collector ever since he got rich anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  There are people that I have friends who are that way too, but I always make fun of them  because when the revolution comes, people, you're getting Timex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's weird to wear something on your wrist that costs more than your house.  But it's jewelry.  What do you want?  Do people do that?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Real people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, because if you could afford a watch like that, you have a much more expensive house.  Yeah, I would assume.  It's kind of a piggyback thing.  House, watch, watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a friend who said he had gotten a great deal on a watch, and it was 65% off, and it  was $25,000.  I said, I don't know where you live, but it's not in the same world I live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  It's weird.  Well, it's jewelry.  It's not about the time.  It's not about function.  Anyway, I have both of Kevin's app because I'm a friend and a fan.  Tiny's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two years, Kevin's going to sell that new venture thing back to Google and become a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VC again.  Yeah, for $100 million.  He's a smart man.  He made money on everything.  I think he's made money on everything.  Did he make money on Digg?  I think probably not, but I don't know.  I don't pretend to know because I don't ask him those questions.  But I think he made money on Revision 3.  Digg probably not.  Although, wait a minute, I'm sorry, he did.  You know why?  Because he took money off the table during one of the venture runs.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  That's the thing founders do is you get a $15 million venture round and you go, and  by the way, I'm taking two.  I know he took at least a million off the table in one of the Digg rounds.  Not because he told me, because it was public knowledge.  So let's go back to Title 2.  Title 2 revisited.  What do you folks in Canada think about this whole regulating the internet thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're in favor of it.  Government regulation of things is hugely popular in Canada.  No, I mean, I'm personally not in favor of it, but we have a history of government regulating  everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually my sense that Canadian internet service providers are some of the first to  do things like paid prioritization.  Tell us that used to block Skype.  One of them did.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the stories are legion.  I remember writing about cable and Rogers was the first to come up with nice sounding  ways of like packet shaping or bandwidth management and so on.  And what they really meant was throttling BitTorrent.  Right.  And you know, that was just, it was no big deal.  I don't even, I mean, people complain, but I don't remember anybody at that time, at  least turning it into, you know, a sort of policy issue.  I mean, I remember when Shaw cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shaw, that's who was, that's who was doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Shaw was a big Western cable provider.  They came out with internet telephony.  Right.  And I remember saying to a guy, an analyst, oh, well, that means they can compete with,  you know, the other, with the real telecom companies and drive prices down.  And he laughed and he said, are you insane?  Why would they do that?  They'll, they'll just put their prices up to exactly the same height within 15 cents  or so.  And everybody will make a boatload of money, which is exactly what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then they started doing things like, I remember very well after an hour on Skype,  you would just, that would be it.  That's all you get.  That's all you get.  So the company that, by the way, does all this deep packet inspection for Comcast and  others is in Waterloo.  It's called Sandvine.  And they, they make the box that at least for a while Comcast was using to block BitTorrent  and other things that it looks into the traffic.  They call it traffic optimization.  Bandwidth shaping.  In bandwidth shaping.  We're just talking.  Like manscaping.  It's bandscaping.  Revenue generation, traffic optimization, network security.  That's Sandvine.  So it's not illegal, but they're also, as you can see, widely used by ISPs all over  the world to keep an eye on what the subscribers are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and Rogers was very good at, in fact, they all did, but Rogers was very good at  kind of portraying itself as, you know, we're just doing this to help you guys because  you, the normal internet user, are having all your bandwidth sucked up by these guys  in pajamas in their mom's basement, you know, BitTorrenting everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bandwidth hogs.  How dare they?  Traffic classification technology for meaningful insight.  That's what they call it.  For communication service providers, DPI is the foundation that enables the delivery  of advanced services.  Traffic classification for actionable data.  That's it.  Right there.  Yeah.  That's it.  Actionable.  Actionable.  Like call the RIAA.  Anyway, the FCC, I don't know whether you subscribe.  Certainly the CRTC in Canada is as bad, but I don't know whether you subscribe to the  notion the FCC is trying to protect consumers or trying to protect themselves or trying  to protect providers.  Tom Wheeler, who President Obama made the chairman of the FCC, kind of notorious for  having been a lobbyist for both cable and wireless companies in his previous life, nevertheless  says February next month, about a month from now, in fact, I think the 25th, the FCC will  decide, and he indicates they're going to go for Title II, which we've all been talking  about.  Title II is the section of the Telecommunications Act of 1934, updated in the 90s, that says  that basically allows the FCC to regulate broadband providers as common carriers.  He says, we're going to do it, but we're going to use forbearance to keep from overdoing  the regulation, but it does allow us.  Now Verizon says, no, no, we'll sue anyway.  It's going to go on and on in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the hard part, the hard part is that, you know, I've talked to lots of people about  Title II.  We've written about it a lot.  Giga Holmes, Stacey Higginbotham is right.  It's you know, knows it inside and out.  And I mean, the problem is the tradeoff is you either have Comcast buying everyone and  then doing whatever it wants to the Internet, or you have the government trying to regulate  the Internet.  It's like choosing between getting stabbed in the eye and getting shot, you know, in  the butt or something like there is no, neither one of those is particularly great.  Like in order to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But right, the argument is made that the neutrality is Internet regulation.  But our dear Senator Al Franken argues instead that no, what it is is trying to stop, is  trying to keep the Internet the way it is and just prevent kind of a takeover of the  Internet by the companies and change.  I am encouraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  And I think Title II, I mean, the principle of Title II is that, you know, it's a pipe  and it should carry things.  I'm trying to remember the phrasing that David Weinberger used in the update to the Clutrain  Manifesto.  But, you know, it's it bits should flow and they should not be restricted based on where  they come from or who paid for them or, you know, that and theoretically, at least that's  the way Title II is supposed to operate or should operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I'm encouraged by this most recent call from the president and the FCC saying, and this  is the other side of the coin, yet regulation, but also competition.  Right.  Is the solution.  And, you know, 19 states in the U.S. have laws that prohibit municipal Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And that's ridiculous.  And I know Tim Wu and Susan Crawford both, I think, have said if you're going to like  there needs to be more options for communities to to have competitive providers.  And if it's actually literally against the law to have someone do that, that's a problem.  It's not enough to just have Title II and have the FCC telling people what to do.  You need to help incentivize more competition in regions as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to commend Obama because, you know, in the campaign he said he would do this and  then it seemed like with the appointed Tom Wheeler, oh my God, he's gone the opposite  way.  But he did, you know, in a speech say Title II, we got to do Title II.  And now the White House says it wants to end laws that harm broadband service competition.  I think this is actually this is the best possible outcome.  This is from the report.  Laws in 19 states, some specifically written by special interests, trying to stifle competition,  have held back broadband access.  Today, the president is announcing a new effort to support local choice in broadband, formally  opposing measures that limit the range of options available to communities.  They're filing a letter with the FCC saying, you know, we'd like your support in this.  The FCC is apparently already examining state laws and considering whether it can invalidate  them by using its authority to promote competition in local telecom markets.  This would be things like not only municipalities offering Wi-Fi, but in some cases municipalities  taking over the infrastructure and providing Internet.  There were a couple of lawsuits.  I remember a couple of municipalities.  Chattanooga, Tennessee, for instance, provides Internet to everybody in Chattanooga.  And it's doing it's a great solution.  A lot of people have called for it.  We've talked about this a lot.  In fact, the guy who brought it to my attention first was one of the creators of Lotus 123.  No, not Mitch Capore, of VisiCalc.  Let's go back even farther.  And he said the thing that municipalities should do is use the right of eminent domain,  take over the infrastructure, and then sell it back, rent it back to a variety of providers  so that there's competition.  Just like the water and power, it can be run by the municipalities, by the local governments,  but the service on top of it can be provided by private companies who compete with each other  for price, performance, bandwidth shaping, fast lanes and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there is an argument if you buy the sort of public highway or water utility argument  that the actual infrastructure should be available to anyone  and that private companies should basically have to bid to run their services on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead, in the States anyway, we give them monopolies.  So, last week, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, proposed changing the definition of broadband.  See, one of the ways that they get away with this is by saying,  well, broadband is four megabits downstream, one megabits upstream.  And if you talk about that, 75% consumers have a choice of two or more providers.  If you really define broadband as it should be, and this is what Wheeler's proposing,  if you're talking about broadband as 25 megabits down and three megabits up,  that's what you'd need to watch video to use all the modern services,  then three out of four Americans, 75% of Americans have no choice at all.  They do not have a choice between providers.  There is one incumbent provider who could provide true broadband in 75% of areas.  That's why there's no competition.  Obama's speaking today at an Internet service provider in Iowa.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I apologize, my lag is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff has a terrible connection. Yeah, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's awful. Well, here's an example.  I'm paying for 50 down and 50 up on files.  You're not getting it, dude.  Are you bid-torting?  I am. I'll do a speed test. It's 50 down and 50 up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you bid-torting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not running anything. Jake's not here.  So I know he's not running anything.  I always wonder if Obama's...  This is like the equivalent of him just doing immigration and closing Guantanamo.  And it's the Internet equivalent of that, of saying, let's just do this stuff.  Right.  And let it get going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that he never did close Guantanamo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He never did close Guantanamo.  Well, yeah, no, that's why I'm fearing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's closed to new guests.  New guests.  They're not accepting any new guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a start.  So he's in Cedar Falls. He's speaking right now, actually.  It's Iowa's first gigabit city.  I'm trying to think if it's municipal. Why municipal Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he showed a graph or a chart of high speed in other countries.  And so it was, you know, South Korea and then wherever, Tokyo cities.  And then the first one in the US was Cedar Falls.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Iowa's a really good test case because two thirds of Iowans are in rural areas.  I mean, there's a huge rural population that isn't well served.  And so, and that's his part.  So to me, it's an issue of equality.  You know, if you don't have access to high speed Internet, it's not just that you can't watch Netflix.  You can't really participate in what's in the world, you know.  And it's an issue of just economic development.  Municipalities should be able to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that at one point, Mark Andreessen did a sort of tweet storm talking about net neutrality,  which I then aggregated in my job as a journalist.  And his one of the sort of core arguments was that he believes we're going to need orders of magnitude more bandwidth to do teleprompter.  And all the 3D modeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine the educational opportunities provided that can be provided in rural areas if they have high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But his argument is that we can't, if we have Title II, like basically he was saying we need the owners of these networks to invest hugely in more bandwidth.  And if we make it less economically viable for them, they won't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's exactly.  I mean, can we should we call Jeff back?  Because I don't want this to just be me and Matthew going back and forth.  Let's let's take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That wouldn't be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting I know Jeff has a lot to say.  He's probably right now fairly frustrated.  So I'll wait for a little bit here before we go on.  I wonder why he says it's 50 50.  That's might be an example of bandwidth shaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to tell you a story.  Rogers, who I use.  I saw an ad just randomly in the newspaper a year or so ago and it said, hey, if you sign up now for Rogers Extreme, you'll get 30 megabits or something like that.  And I thought 30 megabits.  Wait a second.  I've got Rogers Extreme.  I've been paying for it for two years.  I get like eight megabits.  So I phoned Rogers and the guy says, oh, yeah, just all you have to do is go to the store.  Just all you have to do is go in and get a new router.  And then so I literally just went and got a new router and boom, 25 megabits.  But had Rogers told me that had they sent me anything saying you can upgrade to a faster speed if you get a new router?  No, they literally never mentioned it because they don't want me to get they don't want you that high speed.  Yeah, they want me to keep paying for the low.  Yeah.  Why would they want to give me more bandwidth for the same amount of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now can we not get him back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's offline right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the question.  Yes, he says I have 50 50.  He says I do a speed test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's right now.  He just did a full machine.  I'm not sure I blame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I blame Verizon for this, though.  It's a Chromebook.  I think really Jeff is insisting on using some very odd technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he also said in in in chat, I think he's ready to go the Mac mini route.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll buy him one.  Yeah, that's what I figured.  He doesn't have to use it.  All right.  I'm giving him a call.  Stay pure.  Yeah, Tim Tozard, Cool Breeze is exactly right.  He's an old friend of mine who is one of the members of the Bay Area Internet service providers.  I can't remember what he's about.  I think it is anyway.  He's very much about community Internet.  But I wasn't it's not Dan Bricklin.  It's the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should run.  You're my good friend.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to look it up.  The Google will tell me Bob Frankston.  Thank you, Bob Frankston.  Bob is great.  Yeah.  And he's very much been taking this on as a community Internet is the solution.  Jeff, we're going to get you a Mac mini.  I just I declared defeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I think I don't think we can blame Verizon on this one.  I think this is just we got to figure out why not blame Verizon.  It's certainly worth doing all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If this isn't their fault, something similar to this, it ought to be their fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So, Jeff, we have you back.  I'm not sure we have the right mic, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, not again.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, we're not getting that talk back that we were.  I've been I've been riding the fader the whole show to try and minimize the echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how am I now?  Hey, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds better.  We're getting talk.  Check, check, check, check, check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's fine.  I just I didn't want to leave you out.  I feel like this is such a this is your.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my thing.  And I didn't want to be awful with the terrible lag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'll just jump in and we'll be very patient.  Is it OK now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is.  Yeah, it sounds great right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it sounds like maybe the lag is is minimized as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So pictures not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what indicates probably we're going to get a Mac mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll pay for it, Jeff.  Seriously. And what I would suggest and some of our hosts do this is just dedicated.  Doesn't you don't have to do?  Yeah. And we will buy it.  It'll be dedicated.  We'll set it all up.  And that's I think Steve does that a lot of our hosts do that.  I'll take one, too.  Matthew, you can have one.  It's on its way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me throw this bug up here real quick.  We try to get our host to do is not use it for anything else, but just kind of leave it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the key. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't. I'll still use my Chromebook for miles.  But yeah, that's the that's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would run a bit towards her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But only in the off time.  Oh, yeah. I'll follow the bandwidth.  All right. We're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll start on single on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we were so by the way, kind of a follow up on the story we reported last week that Google kind of weighed in a little bit on this title to report.  A little bit on this title to regulation by saying, oh, and it would give us access to utility polls.  And of course, immediately, Verizon says, no, they they always have had access to utility polls.  They're crazy. They're blowing smoke.  The NCT actually was a cable company's NCTA filed.  Google can already avail itself of poll attachment rights under Section 224.  That's why they're in Austin.  Google didn't have a comment.  I'm not doing this story.  So anyway, I don't you know what?  That's a minor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boys, boys, boys.  Yeah. Get along and give us our Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we just want a free and open and fast Internet.  And it seems that every other country is able to do this except us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but then in the UK now, they're going to spy on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we talked about this.  I'd love to get your opinions on this.  We talked about David Cameron's speech on the Security Now yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man. I'll bet you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a train wreck.  And I think Cory Doctorow had a good take down on on Boing Boing.  But he did.  So Cameron, the prime minister of Great Britain, says that it should be illegal to make a communications product that the law and that the home secretary can't listen in on.  And he said, it's OK.  You're protected because the home secretary would have to sign a warrant for us to listen in on.  And now I have to say, I I think it's one thing for David Cameron to say that it's another thing for it to actually happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what it reveals in the attitude is the Greenwald's argument.  What it reveals is just a terrible view of our rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And Cory argues it's also ignorance.  Yes, he says David Cameron says there should be no means of communication, which we cannot read.  And no doubt many in his party will agree with him politically.  But if they understood the technology, they'd be shocked to their boots.  Cory is always eloquent in this stuff.  So he says Cameron doesn't know what he's asking for, because in order to make this work, you know, you can ban WhatsApp.  You can ban iMessage or Apple's messages, both of which provide encrypted message passing that the government can't read.  But first of all, you sure you want to ban iOS from Great Britain?  OK, but then you can't ban Linux.  Who do you who do you ban if you're you know, who do you stop for Linux or BSD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes no sense.  It makes no sense. And it's it's like saying no one is allowed to have door locks just in case we need to come in your house.  Right. Right. Right.  But it'll be only only for your own protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, but there is an analog there.  You know, if you have a gate here in this area, a lot of people in the farm areas have a gate before you can get in and they have a special key that the fire department.  It's a it's a special key the fire department can open because if your house is burning down, you don't want the fire trucks to have to stop at the gate or drive them down.  So there's an analog for that. The TSA TSA approved locks keep bad guys out.  But the TSA has a way of opening them. So there's a precedent.  Corey points out, first of all, if you put a back door in any kind of software that not just not only makes it easy for law enforcement,  but criminals, voyeurs and foreign spies.  So you've made all communications insecure. Right.  Any firms this is this is what Cameron's proposing when Corey breaks it down.  Any firms within reach of the UK government must be banned from producing secure software that includes Microsoft and Apple.  All major code repositories, GitHub and SourceForge, for example, have to be blocked because that's where you get the open source for programs like TechSecure and others.  True Crypt. So you got to prevent that.  Search engines must not answer queries about web pages that carry secure software.  I raised this point yesterday with Steve.  It also means that you have to have a back door in secure HTTP, HTTPS, SSL.  That's not an easy thing to do since that's essentially open.  Virtually all academic security work in the UK must cease.  Security research must only take place in proprietary research environments where there is no onus to publish one's findings such as industry R&D and security services.  All packets in and out of the country and within the country must be subject to Chinese style deep packet inspection.  We're just talking about that. I'm sure Sandvine has a tool and any packets that appear to originate from secure software must be dropped.  Existing walled gardens like iOS and Xboxes must be ordered to ban their users from installing secure software.  Anyone visiting the country from abroad must have their smartphones held at the border until they leave.  That's the fun one, yeah.  Proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple must be ordered to redesign their operating systems as walled gardens that only allow users to run software from an app store which will not sell or give secure software to Britons.  Free and open source operating systems that power the energy, banking, e-commerce and infrastructure sectors must be banned outright.  So that's why Steve was upset and a lot of people are upset about this. I think it's pretty clear it's unenforceable.  And even if it was enforceable, it wouldn't achieve what it's supposedly going to achieve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unenforceable. It wouldn't achieve what it's supposedly going to achieve or wants to achieve.  You criminalize security software, only criminals will have secure software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what it indicates is a belief that there is a manifest destiny and a right for government to be able to listen to anything we say.  And that's the real issue. That's what this reveals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. It's telling into their state of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and unfortunately in Britain at least and in lots of other European countries, it's taken for granted that the government has those rights.  I think the US is abnormal in a way in the sense that people won't put up with that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the sad thing is that he's blaming the attacks on Charlie. He's saying, well, after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France, we've got to do this.  Which makes no sense at all.  But that's what happened in the US. As soon as 9-11 happened, we had the Patriot Act.  That's the kind of knee-jerk reaction. Here's Prime Minister Cameron speaking.  Oh, after an ad. How come there's an ad before? The Prime Minister speaks.  Apparently people who are having erectile dysfunction.  That's actually the Prime Minister.  I'm sorry. No, it's a Charles Schwab ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much has been used? Is that the first duty of any government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's to protect our freedom indeed. But how much tyranny has been wrought under that justification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as Corey points out, it would not keep us safe. It would open all communications to bad guys, spies, and Corey points out, voyeurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The terrorist threat that we face and the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies and policing in order to keep our people safe.  And the powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of communications, I'm very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern liberal democracy.  But what I've done is we legislated very recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what are we going to have here as in old-fashioned, illiberal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's totally the opposite of what should be allowed in a liberal democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody's pointing on the Chairman. This is true also that Cameron's faced with, I don't know how significant, but somewhat of a challenge from the right-wing UKIP.  The UKIP, yeah.  And that this may be merely a political statement that he knows has no chance of passing through Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he is trying to saber-rattle and look tough.  You know, he's not known for being tough, and this is a great opportunity. Oh, look at all the terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But look at the justifications we have. In France, there's been, since the Charlie Hebdo murders, there have been, I think, 54 examples of people being arrested for supporting terrorism.  Now, after a loud and clear support of free speech, then what turns around? We turn around and we abuse free speech.  In the American view, you support even obnoxious speech to support speech.  The other problem was all the great reports to Guardian and elsewhere of all of the heads of state who marched alongside Hollande who do terrible things to free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. It was really ironic to watch that parade of dictators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  France themselves just finished arresting someone for something they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. That's what I'm saying. 54 cases of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They arrested a comedian, a well-known but radical comedian in France, because he posted on Facebook something that they didn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right after saying, we have to uphold free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no free speech if you don't say what we agree with.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really a case I don't want to go off the reservation here.  But that's one of the shocks to me in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo case, is that when I talk about free speech, what I get back often is, oh, you're American, you have a different view.  And I wrote about this, that free speech is weirdly, oddly American.  And no, it's not peculiarly American. It is a human right.  But the protection of it and the explicit protection of it is unusual to the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In many countries, other things take precedence. Security.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying that's right.  Yeah. But I think there's a lack of understanding of what free speech means.  And that really struck me after this case.  And by the way, I also took to task American journalists and newspapers for not publishing the cartoons.  I understand, be clear here, I understand why the Jewish Chronicle didn't publish them.  But Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of the New York Times, first time she attacked the issue, she kind of danced around.  But today she came straight out and said the New York Times was wrong not to run the current new cover of Charlie Hebdo.  And that it's not offensive by any standard of civility and it should be there.  And even our American newspapers don't really understand, I think, to some extent, that free speech is not just a right for journalism, it's responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and this comes up whenever I write about free speech, especially when I'm talking about proprietary platforms like Twitter and Facebook, you know, that are effectively corporate owned kind of town squares.  Someone will say, well, free speech only applies to government.  Like the First Amendment is only designed to apply to government.  And so free speech is just a fiction unless it applies to how government treats citizens, which doesn't make any sense to me at all.  I mean, the whole point, the whole reason why there's a First Amendment is that it's a principle worth protecting.  Well, Matthew, I'll argue that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the reason that is is that part of your free speech is as an editor.  Leo has free speech. Leo can say, Jarvis, I just don't like you.  I've had it with you.  I'm fed up with you and your damn Chromebook.  Get off my air.  And he has a perfect right to do that.  That is part of his.  I'm not the government.  But the government can't tell me to stop extolling the virtues of Chromebooks.  It's not the government's rule.  Right.  And that's a private company has a full and complete right to decide what speech it chooses to distribute.  And that's not censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, it does.  And my only point when I wrote about Facebook was Mark Zuckerberg made a point of standing up in favor of free speech and against censorship and said he stood behind all of those principles.  Despite the fact that Facebook routinely censors things for no reason or for reasons it doesn't discuss.  I'm not saying they don't have the right to do that.  I'm just saying you can't have it both ways.  You can't say that you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can. You set your standards because otherwise what we'd have and this is why we have Section 230 in the US is that if it were a binary switch, we would have no forums and no discussion in the US.  Because if you were held responsible, as for example, Europeans are for the things that occur on your site or the things that you link to, then you would have no discussion.  So Section 230 protects us from making our own judgments so that we can make our own judgments.  We can let things go up that we disapprove of.  We can take things down.  That's our freedom.  No, I have to disagree with you there.  I think that they're private.  But Section 230 protects them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Section 230 protects them, then why do they take so much stuff down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because, well, look at it another way.  Forget the Facebook.  Let's say that the comments on my blog, I take down things there that are offensive and stupid and off-target and abusive.  And that is not only my right, but I believe my responsibility to have a good community there.  If you believe that all speech is equal, all speech must be allowed.  It's allowed by government.  But that doesn't mean that I should be forced to be the host for it.  It's not inconsistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not inconsistent for you to support censorship on Facebook and be against government censorship.  That's not inconsistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not censorship, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could call it censorship.  It is censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say it's censorship.  Censorship is when no.  Censorship is when government censors you from something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm willing to broaden.  I'm willing to agree with Matthew to broaden it and say censorship is censorship.  And it's just cutting something off your site for whatever reason is a form of censorship.  But it's still not inconsistent to say, I have the right to do that as a private business.  But what I would and we should all fight against is the government doing that.  Yes.  That's not inconsistent.  So it's not inconsistent for Mark Zuckerberg to say, yeah, of course, we have to control the environment on Facebook.  But the fact is that Facebook and Twitter are used by governments to censor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are actively censoring people on behalf of the government.  They also say, Matthew, in that case, they also say, they always say that they must follow local laws.  Right.  Now Twitter does it more cleverly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter does it more cleverly.  It will cut out something in France and leave it in the rest of the world.  But it's not inconsistent.  It's not inconsistent.  It's not inconsistent.  It's not inconsistent.  It's not consistent.  So Facebook, Twitter is a lawful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They still cut out something in France and leave it in the rest of the world.  Not just that, they actually fight requests in court on behalf of their users.  They fight.  And in some cases, they have put content back that they took away because the government of whatever country didn't make a good enough case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook.  So when the government says you must take this down under law, and they do that because they follow the law, even if they don't like it, they may fight it, but they lose and they take it down.  That's one thing.  It's another thing when they choose to take something down on their own.  Now Twitter was indeed a very, very open platform, but Twitter hit the wall with two things recently.  We talked about this on the show a while ago.  One was the beheading videos and two was the naked celebrity photos that have been stolen.  And Twitter decided basically for the first time really to say, OK, that's going too far.  We are making an editorial judgment to take that down on our own without request.  That's their right to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But look, Google does not take down videos that criticize Turkey from YouTube because there's a law in Turkey against criticizing Turkish net.  No, they don't.  And they get blocked from Turkey because they make a choice to leave that content up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because YouTube is blocked in Turkey.  And they've chosen to go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So I'm saying at some point, a company has to decide whether they are just going to roll over for every government request or whether there are things they are not going to do when asked by government.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. OK.  We agree there. Yes.  And so Google thus got out of China.  Right.  But are you suggesting that every company should pull out of every country where the government demands they do something they can't do?  Yeah.  That's well, OK.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to, I think you have to punish these countries for having that kind of reactionary point of view.  And if these companies did, the countries would soon turn around, I think.  Yeah.  Well, given the right to be forgotten, then Google should pull out of Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look what Google did in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turkey has reinstated YouTube a number of times, even though, so they'll punish them and block them.  And then they put them back on again.  I just think if Facebook has principles, which it sounds like they do, then they should stick to them instead of bending over for every government that asks them to take something down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, I sympathize with your view.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they fight.  But it's not as simple as that.  Well, I'll tell you why it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're publicly held companies and they have a fiduciary right to their stakeholders to maximize profits.  And it's hard in that environment to take a principled stand, I think.  If it's a privately held company, they should do it.  But as soon as you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to go down a rat hole here, but someone recently pointed out to me that companies do not actually have a legal fiduciary duty to maximize profits.  They don't?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a legal duty, but the shareholders could punish them.  They could punish them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could punish them.  They could throw everybody out.  But they don't have a legal...  They could punish them in the market and in the courts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course you agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any company, public or not, has the right to lose money and run a crappy business.  You're always protected from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg controls the majority of the votes.  True.  Voting shares in Facebook and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he faced no risk.  He can do whatever he wants.  He faced no risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you saying Zuckerberg should do?  Be specific.  Should Facebook pull out of 20 countries?  Should they pull out of every country that doesn't have a First Amendment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to see Facebook put up a bit more of a fight.  That's what I would like to see.  You think Twitter is a good model for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter puts up a fight.  Twitter is a better model.  But I don't think...  I think you're presuming that Facebook doesn't fight.  Facebook also has a transparency report.  Google has transparency report.  They all fight.  Twitter does more and more cleverly.  But Twitter does other things that are odd.  But I think Twitter is not well-agreeable with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the fighting from some of the companies looks like window dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook does not say in its transparency report, I don't think,  specifically what the complaint is or what content it involves.  They can't.  They're not allowed to.  They can't.  Look, Google doesn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google is only allowed to say that they get between one and 900 requests from government.  And that was after fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter will tell you what the order was, what it related to, and where it came from.  Not in a lot of cases they cannot, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'd be jailed.  They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't in cases where the US government has asked them for data.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's a national security letter, they have to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if the Turkish government files a court order saying take down that thing  because it makes fun of Kamel had a Turk, they can certainly say that.  And they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we come back...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got to put my boxing gloves on.  No, this is a great topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad we had the conversation.  But when we come back, we'll talk a little bit about the changes from Google.  Not the changelog, because no one can do the changelog like Gina Trapani.  But there are some new things from Google we want to talk a little bit about.  But first, a word from our friends at SmartThings.  SmartThings had a great showing at CES this year.  In fact, Time Magazine said SmartThings gave them their 2015 SES award.  And their 2015 Editor's Choice Award.  SmartThings is kind of a neat story.  There you go.  Six of the coolest smart home innovations at CES.  SmartThings right in there.  And it's a great story because it was a Kickstarter project by some guys who said,  we need to solve this problem of this tower of babble among home automation systems.  There's Z-Wave and Zigbee.  There's X10 and Nest.  Nest doesn't talk to anybody.  So why don't we make something that can talk to everybody?  They raised a lot of money and they created a great product, the SmartThings Smart Hub.  And they're getting better all the time.  It talks to everything.  Your Sonos music, your Hue lights, your Nest thermostat, your DropCam camera.  It talks to all of the SmartThings devices as well.  In fact, to make it this easy, they've created these solution kits and home security kits  that give you everything you need to solve a particular problem.  But now all, and by the way, it's a great starting point because they all have the hub,  like the Energy Saver kit for 17910 that saves you money by controlling how much energy you use,  allowing you smartphone access to all the information.  But your lights, your locks, your thermostats, your home security can all use that same app.  Yes, it is awesome for iOS, for Android and for Windows Phone.  I think a lot of Windows Phone users feel a little laughed out.  You don't have to, SmartThings supports you too.  Now you could type good, tap good night on your phone, the lights turn off, the thermostat turns down,  the doors lock, garage doors close, set your lamps to brighten each morning at sunrise  or when you want to wake up, even keep your thing, your home protected with SmartThings,  home security, motion detection, water detection and more.  You can even have your speakers bark.  You can have dogs barking if there's motion outside the house.  Really? Yeah.  That's cool.  I know.  Your doors will recognize when you're close and unlock themselves as you walk up.  SmartThings is really cool and to get you started setting up your smart home right now,  SmartThings is offering Twig users 10% off any home security or solution kit and free shipping in the US.  But you have to go to SmartThings.com slash Twit and use our offer code TWIT10 at checkout.  SmartThings.com slash Twit.  You're minutes away from a smart home with SmartThings.  Don't play the trumpets.  We're just going to talk our way through the Google.  Play your kazoo.  I haven't gotten it yet, but Google is pushing out to all Android devices and iOS too.  A better Google Translate.  I love this idea.  I got it.  Did you get it?  Have you tried it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't try it.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they bought Word Lens a while ago.  That was the really cool iOS app that would let you see it's right there.  Show a sign in a language you don't understand and it will translate it.  It even preserves the font and translates it into your language, which is very awesome.  So you can snap a photo too of text to get a translation for it in 36 languages.  The instant translation that you're seeing with Word Lens works from English to French,  German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.  They're going to add more languages in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they do real-time voice too.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we try it?  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't speak a language.  Who speaks a language?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say something in German.  Where is the train station?  Who is the train station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you hear that?  Yeah, now you have to respond in German.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this the train station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is straight ahead.  Whoa!  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the idea is they've sped it up so that, first of all, the first time you have to press a button,  you tap the mic, you start speaking, it immediately recognizes what language you're speaking, which is nice.  And then it goes back and forth much more quickly without you having to do anything.  So you talk, they talk, you talk, they talk.  Here's a demonstration.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How can I help you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bonjour, je voudrais une tasse de café.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without milk or sugar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sans lait ni sucre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was very quick.  It's like a French translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just turn it on its side.  So I do it.  Let me translate.  So English to German.  I would like a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yet again, eine tasse of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Möchtest du milk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want a milk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, thank you.  Just sugar.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nein, das nicht so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty neat.  That's the Babel fish.  Exactly.  And it's instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gross or Klein?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Big and small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, obviously it's, you know, all I'm doing is turning the phone between each one.  So I talk up.  Is that how you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  This way.  So you just go back and forth.  That's how it knows who's talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could have used that when I was in Italy.  I was I got a ride from from the train station by with a guy who didn't speak any English at all other than hello.  And so I said, you know, where are we going?  And he said, to ISIS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, even even a little bit, you know, however mangled or grammatically incorrect it is, is better than nothing.  I mean, I would you be embarrassed to use it?  Would you feel like a weirdo using it?  No, I think everywhere except France and France, they just spit at you.  And yeah, they would they would tell you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody loves France.  So I'm making no French jokes.  Let's be very clear.  It's been my experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you make the attempt in France, they're very great.  Well, that's what I wonder.  Would they think this is cheating?  Well, I would say start a conversation and then go, oh, pardon, pardon, je ne parle pas français.  But my mobile does.  And then you know what?  That might be kind of cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to Europe in June, going to Germany, Netherlands.  I don't speak Dutch, Germany.  Don't speak German and Austria.  And I'm also going to Istanbul.  Don't speak Hungarian.  I think that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really cool.  I remember when Eric Schmidt showed it at Davos like four years ago saying this will you know, this will stop.  Stop war.  I don't know about that.  My start of war actually.  What I want to do is put the picture part of this over the Charlie Hebdo covers and see if it can translate Charlie Hebdo.  Good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is interesting from the Google blog post about this.  By the way, it would be Android and iOS.  And some of these features have never been available before on iOS.  So if you're an iOS user, definitely try it.  This is the stat from the blog post.  Half a billion people use Google Translate every month.  More than a billion translations a day.  It's kind of mind boggling.  So people do use this obviously.  I would guess a lot of it is on the web.  I've used it a lot where either you're reading a web page that says translate this page.  You do that.  That's probably the more snippet.  Yeah, that's probably the majority usage.  But still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I remember when they added the ability to recognize the language automatically so you didn't have to choose from a drop down.  Isn't that great?  Super handy.  Why shouldn't it?  When I mentioned the Google Translate this morning on Twitter, someone said they wouldn't be impressed until it translated from Tamarian, the Star Trek language that is solely metaphor driven.  No, that's not going to work.  Darmach and Jalot.  Yeah, that's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ever.  Ever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moving on with the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You left the photo part out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mentioned Word Lens.  We showed that.  Yeah, yeah.  Google Domains has launched.  This was a beta only for a while.  But it's now here.  If you go to domains.google.com, it still says beta, but you can register a domain name.  They have hundreds of TLDs, $12 a year, which is kind of in there with a going price.  It automatically works instantly with Blogspot, but it also works with Shopify, Squarespace, Weebly, and Wix.  So you just use their software and you're automatically in there.  I don't know.  Let's see.  What should we get?  What domain name should we get here?  It's got a domain management feature.  It's very much like any registrar.  Now, we like Hover because they're good Canadian fellas and gals.  But I don't know.  I need a new...what do I need?  Chris, give me a domain name.  You need a new domain name.  How about Minecraft Today?  That's going to be the name of your new show, Chris.  Minecraft...no, I'm just kidding.  Never doing another Minecraft show again.  That's Minecraft fat is about to end, isn't it?  Domain availability?  Yes, I can get minecrafttoday.com, minecrafttoday.net, minecrafttoday.org, dot company, dot partners.  There's quite a few choices.  Look at that.  Dot today?  Should I get minecrafttoday.today?  And then at Minecraft Now, minecrafttoday.net.  Look at these.  And then they're just making up stuff.  Video game today dot org, mods today dot net.  YouTube...good today?  Good today.  What the hell is that?  Mine art today.  Great Britain today?  I don't know.  Twitter today dot org.  All right, twittertoday.org.  That's got to be worth something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't search because I'm in Canada.  Oh, it's US only?  Not entitled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you want?  You want dot ninja?  This week in Google?  All right.  This?  Yeah, let's see what we can get with this week.  Actually, I don't know if that search works.  That looks like a regular Google search.  Oh, now I'm lost.  You know, somebody ought to teach these guys usability.  I'm going to go back to the original.  Domains dot Google dot com.  I'm not sure why Google wants to be in this business,  but it makes more sense than the insurance business,  which they apparently also want to be in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't understand the whole domain thing.  I mean, I don't know.  Maybe domainers are a big market.  I can't imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, GoDaddy's made some money.  I can't imagine.  Look, this week in Google dot com.  No, somebody's got that.  But dot net dot org dot company dot training.  Madmen twitter dot com.  I don't know where they get that from.  Now they're just making crap up.  Madmen website.  Did I mention Madmen?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Domains dot Google dot com.  That's another new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They checked your birth certificate information.  That's why they suggested Madmen.  Oh, is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you must have been born in the 50s.  Google and of course,  and GoDaddy is probably the largest of the rest of the registrars.  Google was ICANN accredited in 2005.  So they could have done this for a while.  Wow.  They might have done it internally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder.  Well, remember they locked up a bunch of those extensions.  Right.  And I still don't know why, but like dot blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because maybe they want to sell them on domains dot Google dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.  There is a dot Google, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And if they never sell it,  it just seems a bit odd to me that they own an entire sub domain.  Yeah, sub domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Me too.  They did say they were going to open a bunch of them.  I don't know if that ever happened, but they said like dot blog and a bunch of those.  They were going to open up so they wouldn't control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have a sub domain, it should be required to be open or don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would hope that Google wouldn't in any way prioritize and search the domains you purchase on the Google domain site, but I'm sure they wouldn't.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the 12 bucks a year.  Yeah, we're going to throw out our entire business model for 12 bucks a year for one person for domain.  That's absurd.  Moving on Google.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I should point out Blackberry came out and said that it is not in talks with Samsung.  Yeah.  And the stock dropped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The stock went right back down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well, we've seen this.  I mean, if you do a search for Google for Blackberry Samsung, you'll find references to an acquisition or merger since 2012.  It's been going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A bunch of traders made some money today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's how you make some money.  That's a very clever idea.  Google's rolling out a classroom mobile app for students and teachers.  Saying, of course, if the dog has actually eaten your homework, classroom cannot help.  But this is the classroom we talked about about six months ago, but this is the mobile version.  Here's the promo clip.  Google Classroom mobile app.  Snap a photo.  So there you're doing a chemistry lab and you've got a colors and smoke.  You say, take a photo.  This is in the Google Apps experiment photo chemistry 101 done.  I don't know what you got out of that that you couldn't do otherwise.  But there you go.  Well, yeah, that's I know I'm going off to change whatever we call it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google going into the classroom with that kind of app and Facebook announcing Facebook for Work, it's really interesting to me that they're taking these.  They're trying to to take basic functionality that already exists that you can use for anything you darn want, whether it's work or school and then try to declare it work or school.  I'm not sure what they how much they have to add to make that true.  Well, I think for schools, certainly there are privacy issues that you have to be aware of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kids under 13, there's special rules on the Web, et cetera, et cetera.  So that makes sense that you, you know, and this is a big category that we're seeing.  You know, commercial products like Blackboard and open source products like Moodle are kind of not great.  And I think Google probably looked at it and said we could do better.  And a lot of the stuff in that in that market has been proprietary, way more proprietary than Google to the point where you have to get locked in, you know, SAP style to some thing that then your kid can't get any of their data out and the teacher can't share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love to see Google open some of that up.  Our local elementary school uses G apps and all the kids get chrome get Chromebooks.  Really? Yeah.  The local high school that I'm on the board of, even though they're giving Mac books in their one to one program, their apps are on the board of the local high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife and I are touring preschools right now.  Sorry, not preschools, kindergarten through six through eight.  And I mean, as early as I think like fourth grade, they're giving them Chromebooks.  Really? Yeah, I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have visions of leading a school, I think.  I think that's a great idea.  I think that's a great idea.  I think that's a great idea.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a great idea.  Really?  Yeah, I think that's great.  Leo's I've visions actually the Leo staying out the side of the school laughing at the kids.  I have come around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've come around.  I think it's great.  I love it.  Or whatever.  The LA school district, of course, had done iPads.  Yes.  And that was an utter disaster.  So they're switching the Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also because of corruption.  It turns out.  Yes.  There might have been that bid process might not have been as fair as one thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went into my daughter's classroom and the teacher had brought in her old computer from like six years ago.  And that's what they had in the classroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's very common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to correct myself.  Obviously, I didn't mean some domains.  I meant TLDs top level domains.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We knew what you meant.  Oh, God.  I didn't even notice.  If you used iOS, which you don't, you might want to try this Chrome remote desktop for iOS.  They must have it for Android already, right?  They do. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just installed it last night on my iPad, actually.  So it allows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems kind of ridiculous.  Why do you need?  Because you can have what all your stuff anywhere.  Right.  Why would you need a remote desktop to a Chrome device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I actually use it.  This might seem like a weird use case, but if I'm downstairs and I have stuff on the computer upstairs, I've actually looked at it on the iPad to remind myself what was going on.  I like to try and return to the state of mind I had when I was looking at that computer or to reboot something or restart something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know what?  It just makes it easier.  Everything's more fluid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it is really easy.  I've used remote desktop apps for decades at VNC and all sorts of proprietary.  This was super slick on every device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you start by adding a Chrome extension, the Chrome remote desktop app, they call it now, and you enable remote access.  You give it a pin so only you can get to it.  Yeah.  And then you launch the app on iOS or Android and it sees it on your network and says, oh, which one would you like to join?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you don't you can say, don't ask me for a pin anymore on this device.  Nice.  And it was fast.  Yeah.  I'm definitely doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why, but I am.  Because it's cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if I install the Chrome extension on any one of my Chrome's, it installs across the board too, which is kind of nice.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  Oh, my overlord.  Thank you.  Oh, my overlord, Google, for once again, convincing me of the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was actually thinking of getting my mom a Chromebook and then just run Chrome remote desktop on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, clever.  So you could fix it and stuff.  Can you do it over the network?  No, you have to be on the LAN.  You do?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Oh, well, maybe you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of remote desktops you can do over a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can someone in the chat room figure out whether that's true?  Could you figure that out, Charam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're confused.  Can you get back to me?  Project Era, which I've mocked because I don't feel like anybody really wants a modular smartphone that you could take apart like a tinker toy.  But it's going to begin pilot testing in Puerto Rico later this year.  This was kind of a Skunk Works project.  It was part of Motorola.  Google kept it when they sold Motorola to Lenovo.  Right now, as we speak, the second Project Era Developers Conference is going on.  And this will give you a roadmap of how and when the modular smartphones will get on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like this is appealing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's cool.  But I really I feel like I don't want to carry around a phone that's going to fall apart as I'm walking around.  Little modules are going to shed off of it.  Oh, man, I dropped my speaker module.  Night vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can look through people's clothes.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're in Puerto Rico, Open Mobile and Claro will I guess are they going to sell it like a smartphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be easier to upgrade, right?  Then you could just upgrade modules.  Right.  That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But look how ugly your phone is.  This is an ugly ass phone.  We've had it's not new.  Remember the Lifespring modules for the Lifespring Palm?  Anyway, you know what?  It might be very cool.  I don't know.  Palm is coming back.  When you can buy one, you will, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'll buy one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't know if it'll ever be my major main phone.  Here's Dede Brohn from The Verge looking at it.  You know, this guy's a designer because he's wearing eyeglasses with white frames.  He has no hair.  That's the designer giveaway.  If he had a scarf, we'd know he was definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you look good with white glasses, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to get white glasses to go with my white hair.  Yeah, it's kind of an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we'll watch.  Handspring did that, didn't it?  Handspring.  That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not Lifespring.  Handspring.  The Handspring modules.  I have a handspring over here.  You could add a modem.  You could add...  It was really a Palm Pilot that you could add a phone to, but only one at a time.  So this one you can kind of plug and play it all together.  If you want, there is a live stream.  If you go to projectera.com, you can watch the live stream of the DevConference.  And a new MDK has been released.  So if you want to get developing, you can.  I think open hardware is a very interesting category.  I'm not a guinni.  Let's see.  Oh, Facebook at Work, you brought this up.  Yeah.  I had an insight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, me.  I love those moments.  I wait for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I live for them.  I had an insight.  I was thinking about this because this was on Windows Weekly we were talking about it.  Just as the iPhone really changed enterprise computing because of Bring Your Own Device,  employees started saying, no, I'm not going to use that crappy Blackberry or Windows phone you issued me.  I'm going to use my own iPhone and I'm going to bring it into the enterprise.  And it forced IT managers and CIOs to even acknowledge that it existed and then embrace it.  And now iPhones and iPads are everywhere in enterprise.  And I have to think Mark Zuckerberg's thinking, hey, BYOD, what about BYOS?  Users are used to using Facebook.  They love Facebook.  They probably already are using Facebook a little bit for business communications.  What if we made a business specific version of Facebook that in effect is a leverage or web wedge into enterprise?  Well, that's a good point.  Because people want to use what they use.  They don't want to use some special hip chat or whatever.  They want to use what they use.  Now, interestingly, there's no messaging in Facebook for work.  So you still need hip chat.  But that makes sense to me.  And also it's a beta.  They've been, you know, what they said is, well, we've been dogfooding this for 10 years is what we use at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also think they probably saw what's been happening with Slack.  Yeah.  And how that's been.  Stuart Butterfield's startup.  They've been signing up enterprise customers like it's going out of style.  The chart on that thing uses usage wise is just mind boggling.  And so I think they I'm sure they thought we've got to get a piece of that even if we can't, you know, get all of it or crush Slack.  We need to at least be in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not too much of a stretch to think of them adding, you know, WhatsApp into this mix and and making an enterprise.  And of course, enterprise has requirements.  It needs to be a walled garden.  You can't.  You want to be an intranet, not an internet.  You want it to be secure.  There's a lot of neat just as with schools and classroom apps, there's a special needs.  I think this makes a lot of sense for Facebook.  This is this is to me.  This is like Facebook leaving the colleges and going out to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's there is a potential to I mean, assuming they can get their newsfeed algorithm working properly inside the enterprise.  At least there's a potential for them to become a kind of, you know, central dashboard information dashboard where you can find all the stuff that's relevant to your company.  That's that's a huge value.  LinkedIn, you know, I'm sure is is doing something similar to right because that's what they want to own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.  People want to use what they're familiar with.  They don't want to use learn a specialized tool.  But businesses have certain needs.  I have needs and it makes sense that Facebook, just as they do with my personal needs, want to satisfy enterprises needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so you'll have I predict now you're going to have the case where some oh, I meant to post that half naked.  Yeah, right. My personal.  Yeah, not to my work.  But that can happen anyway, right?  My puppy. Well, not if you're not using Facebook for work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I posted we were using hip chat for a conversation and then I was talking about the I remember was on this show.  I think I was talking about those acronyms that teenagers use like get naked on camera.  So I posted them into our hip chat, which is our business chat.  Oops. Well, that's OK, because we've got one of one of our people immediately said, ignore Leo.  He's just showing off something in Twig.  Hey, congratulations to Amazon, by the way.  Transparent won a Golden Globe Award and rightly so, by the way, it's a really great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't watched it yet. I feel so behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful in it.  He's great. He plays the dad of a totally dysfunctional family who's decided to finally live as a woman.  Something he's felt that he is all along and and the kids.  It's comedic. It's very funny.  And in fact, I thought that's what it would be about because the name is transparent and all of that.  But really, it's as much about his totally dysfunctional family and each of them have their own awful quirks.  His ex wife was equally awful.  It's a great, great show.  And Jeffrey Tambor deserved the Golden Globe.  I think he did a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I didn't know the writer, her father.  It's the characters, her story based on her father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe that because it's you can see it's deeply felt and it's very insightful and a great show.  And it's Amazon only.  And so it's a huge victory.  And of course, if you go to Amazon, they're touting it like a like they've just won the World Series.  It's all over the big deal.  It's a very big deal for us.  And now Amazon's by the way, they've been doing great stuff.  Both Netflix and Amazon have totally proven that you don't need to be a cable network.  You don't need to be a broadcast network to produce great programming.  I love House of Cards.  It's coming back.  I love Orange is the New Black.  Amazon has Alpha House, which is incredibly funny.  They've got some great shows.  I've been watching.  Let me ask you a question, Leo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have argued, you have argued that Google is in a position of conflict.  I've argued that Google can't really own and create content.  And really, they don't.  That YouTube is a platform.  So here's Amazon, which is the primary media sales operation in the world now.  And it's making its own content.  And I don't hear the squeals there.  Why should you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Amazon's a retailer.  Amazon sells its own stuff all the time.  And also, I mean, I would squeal.  So compare it to Google.  But Amazon's no, it's different.  Google's not even trying to sell stuff.  They're different.  Google's trying to be an objective search engine.  Amazon's never said anything.  But hey, what we do is we sell stuff for money.  Well, that's what I know.  I want it to be objective.  Don't you want Google to be objective?  If you're going to rely on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I want it to be relevant.  No, no, objective for everybody.  No, they're not claiming that.  They're claiming it's relevant to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in the beginning, they claimed it was objective.  I would hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not paid.  You cannot pay for what they claim is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the difference between paid and Google saying, well, our content's better than others?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not saying that you've proven that they do that.  No, and they haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the real fear is that they will.  And that's why it's a confident interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm making my own TV show.  You're making your own podcast.  And now Amazon says, I'm going to, I'm not going to promote yours.  I'm going to promote mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not a search engine.  They're a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the only way you can get sold if you make certain things now, books and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if they become a monopoly, that's an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they are a retailer.  I mean, the central difference is Google did not start off as a retailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is their business.  And they've done this, by the way.  Amazon makes cables, too.  They make a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, I'm not complaining that Amazon shouldn't make this stuff.  I'm just trying to compare.  It's not comparable.  You lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is.  I disagree.  I disagree.  It doesn't bother me.  Well, see, and here's the other thing.  If you're in the content creation business, there are a million competitors creating content.  I'm not mad at Google because they want to be in the, if they want to be in the content creation business, have at it.  But drop the search business because the search, the directory is what allows people to discover us.  I don't need Amazon to be discovered.  If you're an author, you do.  Well, but and then you have an argument.  Then you have an argument.  That's what I'm saying.  And Amazon is, by the way, going into the publishing business as well.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if we talk about the standards around Google and what they and oh my God, Google's promoting its own stuff.  What I'm saying is, of course they do.  And it's obvious when they do.  But they also promote their competitors.  Now Amazon also promotes its competitors, by the way.  Right.  I mean, it allows anybody to sell to you.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd be out of business if they only sold Amazon originals on their video store.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  As good as they are.  There's other stuff I want to see.  By the way, this all came up because they just signed Woody Allen to do his very first TV series, which is going to be called in a kind of sly inside joke, the Untitled Woody Allen Project.  I'm sorry, but the obvious joke here is next they're going to sign Bill Cosby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the obvious joke.  I said they should do a duo.  They should do a.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to get in this conversation.  I don't think it's comparable.  I know.  I think the claims against what they're doing is that they're not going to be able to do it.  I think the claims against Woody Allen.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I question in terms of in terms of shamed and questioned celebrities.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But yeah.  And I have to admit, I have a little I'm a little queasy.  Got what going to a Woody Allen movie these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did like his comment, though, where he said, I don't know why they did this.  And I think it's probably going to turn out badly.  And I don't really have any ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, my guess is Roy Price, who is the VP of Amazon Studios, will regret this.  That's what he though.  You love what he's totally.  Setting expectations low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, people watch it.  And frankly, if they got Cosby to do a show, you know, people would watch it, but then  stop buying things on Amazon.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I used to be a gigantic fan of what he had.  And I also think that he's not quite what he was.  But.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's none of our business what to discuss the allegations against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the well.  It's not an allegation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not talking about that.  I'm just talking about the fact, just just the known fact that he he's not as good as  he used to be.  He dated his stepdaughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What he did is married and married his stepdaughter, but they didn't live together.  They were.  She lived down the down the road.  Right.  Sure.  I mean, you can you can not like somebody because he married a very young woman who  was, in fact, his stepdaughter.  But that's not illegal.  The other allegations that he molested his stepdaughter are illegal.  Yeah.  No, I'm talking about the factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's all.  And there's lots of his movies.  You know, he's continued to age and the people that he's romantically involved with in the  movies.  OK, that's a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Younger.  But again, that's not illegal.  Just creepy.  And I, you know, I think some of his later movies are great.  I love the The Midnight in Paris was one of his best movies, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Did you not like that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Yeah, that one I liked.  Yeah, I liked it.  But one reason I liked it was because he wasn't in it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he should stop being in his movies.  I don't know if he'll be in the TV show.  I guess he will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to watch Andy Hall again and see if it holds up.  Oh, it holds up.  Oh, it totally.  Absolutely holds up.  I would imagine it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bananas, not so much.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've covered everything.  Artificial intelligence experts are all signing a letter saying,  We've got to protect mankind from machines.  Sky that's kind of run a session in this dinner session of this at Davos next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so this was interesting to me.  Oh, this will be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's it called?  What's it about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, man versus machine kind of thing.  And there's there's there's two AI robotic machines.  AI robotic people.  There's the Archbishop of Ireland.  There's a technology historian and a biological I can print organs for you guy.  They're going to be the discussion leaders.  And it'll be it'll be fascinating.  It'll be absolutely interesting.  And the good thing about it is there's no techno panic representative there.  There'll be people in the room will be saying, Oh, my God, but here are the technologists.  And so the discussion that I want to have is, OK, you're all making these technologies and same as this letter in a way.  How do you protect us?  You presume you can because otherwise you wouldn't be doing it.  You think it's evil.  So so talk about what you know, what are you going to do to make all this OK so that we can take advantage of these technologies?  I want to point you to two books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are two people we've interviewed on triangulation on this subject.  The first is a guy named James Barrett, who wrote a book called Our Final Invention,  Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.  He's a journalist.  He's not a scientist, but he did interview a lot of experts in A.I., many of whom I think agree that we've got to tread lightly here because there's a big risk.  I asked Ray Kurzweil about that because he's one of the people who believes that the singularity is nigh and that the machines will be as smart as humans any day now.  And he said, Oh, don't worry.  The machines will think of us as mom and dad.  They'll they'll take care of us.  Right.  I agree with that.  I heard him speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard him speak at Google.  He said basically we're not going to get there in the way that you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't mean we don't have to worry.  Here's the other one.  Nick Bostrom is a this is a guy actually with a very interesting CV.  He's not just a computer scientist.  He does a lot of stuff, but his book Superintelligence really talks about these issues.  It's a really good book.  And he was fascinating.  And he is a guy who is working in this field as professor at the at Oxford and director of the Future of Humanity Institute there.  So very interesting fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ask the people at your at your event what they think a Google self-driving car should do.  If if sacrificing the occupants of the car would actually prevent more deaths than than not sacrifice.  We've talked about this on the show, haven't we, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we have.  But it's a hard calculation to make with maturity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, does this self-driving car look and say, well, if I swerve into the lane with the bus, I could kill 20 people.  But if I drive off the cliff on the right, I'll only kill the guy inside.  So, you know, the smart thing overall, societally would be drive off the cliff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw that that that amazing video of the what is it?  Hundred sixty nine car pile up in Michigan.  Yeah, phenomenal, phenomenal video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you wonder what one where the firecracker truck blew up was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you see you see these these vehicles come barreling down and then there is nothing they can do.  They've got two seconds and they smash on top of things.  What would a self-driving universe look like?  It wouldn't be barreling down the road, I don't think.  And it'd have it also be in connection with what's ahead of them saying, well, oh, no.  Yeah. I got to find a video now.  Well, you haven't seen this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ways should have should have told them that that was coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I think a smart smart car would, of course, do a better job than humans in an environment like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it would have data from ahead.  You'd be networked.  It's the network would save you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here is is this it?  The fireworks go off following the accident.  No, now we have to watch tennis.  Come on, go go.  It's a funny commercial.  It's the John McEnroe commercial.  Yeah, that's a chase commercial.  At least. Yeah.  All right. Since Chase is done, we get to see this fire.  Free advertising for a firey wreck from the Ann Arbor News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the company I work with. Really?  Yeah.  That's oh, is this the?  No, this is a different one. This is later.  Yeah, this is later.  Well, that's that's a fireworks going off.  Yeah, you can hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it is funny, although people were OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry that people were hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it is no, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon.  I think self-driving cars are, I think, demonstrably better drivers than humans.  So lives are saved right off the bat.  That car, the Audi that drove 500 miles to CES.  Pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually, you know, I see the at least for me, the the earliest benefit from self-driving cars would be things like,  you know, everybody's at a party downtown and you want to get somewhere.  And so you don't have a designated driver.  You don't want to call a cab.  You know, self-driving car can take you wherever.  And the other thing is delivery.  Think about all the trucks, UPS trucks that can be automated.  Yeah, really don't need a human being.  Right. They're just dropping off a package.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found the video here.  It's on the I put it in the chat and the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good.  You want it on the bottom of that page?  Do you want to you want to play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I'm talking to Jason.  I know you're.  He's the magic man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's hope we don't get sacked with an ad.  OK.  Wow.  No, but we're vertical video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, vertical.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  And this is nothing.  Just nothing to jest about because one person was killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Truck drive.  Just that horrible sound.  Is there going full speed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they should.  Yeah.  On snow in the fog, it seems in a blinding snow.  Humans are not the best drivers in the world.  No.  In the world.  What am I talking about?  Well, on Mars, we're following.  And listen, the guy on the phone, he's saying, oh, no, oh, no.  This does happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then he's saying, get out, because they know there's somebody behind you coming.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This happens regularly near where I live.  Near the circle.  It happens here in Drizzle.  But snow squalls come up very quickly.  You can be in a clear area and then all of a sudden there's a squall.  And on the other side of that is a truck that jackknifed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Horrible.  I want to I want to I want a self-driving car.  I have kind of for the most part a self-driving car.  It warns me if I try to switch lanes with another car in the lane.  It warns me if I drift out of the lanes, it starts to vibrate the steering wheel.  It has adaptive cruise control so I can just turn on cruise control and close my eyes  because if the car in front of me slows down, my car will slow down.  If it stops, my car will stop.  It's interesting.  It keeps it.  It keeps a following distance that's really the right following distance, which is.  What kind of car is it?  It's an Audi.  It's surprising because, God, I'm far behind.  Really?  I should be this far.  Yes, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should stay back.  I saw a video where it reads the speed sign and automatically decreases speed.  Yeah, that's cool.  I want that.  What happens if a Google self-driving car is potentially going to be an accident that  would only kill the occupants of a Microsoft self-driving car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Computers are smart enough.  By the way, somebody says, that's not cool, Leo.  You shouldn't close your eyes.  I don't really close my eyes.  You think I'm nuts?  You still have to steer, Leo.  No, it's a joke.  We're going to take a break and we shall return with pictures.  Whether you want us to or not.  Yeah, but briefly, only briefly.

I think we have to rejigger how we do these things.  We have Matthew Ingram of Giga Home.  Great to have you here, Matthew.  Is there anything you'd like to talk about?  A movie you saw?  A book you read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A snowflake you admired?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I did see the Imitation Game.  You know, we should talk about that.  And I mentioned when I got home that the first thing I was going to do,  I know a little bit about Alan Turing, but not that much.  The first thing I was going to do was research how much of the movie is just Hollywood BS  and how much of it is actually what Turing was like.  And unfortunately, a lot of the movie is...  It's pretty bad.  Yes, and the picture that it sort of paints of Turing is not...  is unfair in a lot of ways and goes for the sort of easy...  You know, he was a nerd who couldn't mix with people and all...  none of which I think was the way it's portrayed in the movie, but...  You know, it was good and it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a wonderful movie.  He is great. The acting is great.  But as the Garnian points out, in a way the movie slanders Alan Turing.  And what's sad is that Alan Turing was persecuted and slandered and reviled by Britain,  even though he made a huge contribution to the war effort and frankly,  to the industry we love so much, to the invention of computing.  It's the father of modern computing.  It's the father of modern computing.  So while I loved the movie and I had the same reaction as you, Matthew,  I thought, well, this is based on a well-known biography. It must be accurate.  There's some horrific things that they do, the chief of which...  and I won't give you a spoiler, but in effect the movie implies that...  You know, the movie which is very much at the end, you know,  it says tens of thousands of Britons were put in jail for homosexuality  and that, you know, he was persecuted, he was chemically castrated  and eventually committed suicide because of the harassment in the 50s.  So they're in some ways doing the right thing by kind of letting people know how awful that was.  But there's a moment in which he's blackmailed by a spy and the spy says,  I'll tell him you're gay. And he goes, OK.  And he not only breaks the law, but acts in a cowardly fashion  to hide the spy's identity. And none of that happened.  Right. None of that happened.  So that's the slander that The Guardian is talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And actually, you know, the thing that bugged me was that he...  you know, they go for the sort of easy trope of the nerd genius who can't...  doesn't understand a joke and can't make friends,  none of which was apparently the case, according to other things I've read.  So that's a kind of easy stereotype.  But it doesn't really... I wish someone would make a movie where they celebrate his accomplishments.  They don't even tell you how the Enigma breaker works.  They don't even discuss all the things that he... you know, the things that he did that were groundbreaking.  He just seems like a giant nerd who builds this thing and then wins the war. It's not... anyway.  So it was disappointing in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found it a wonderfully entertaining movie and I love Benedict Cumberbatch.  He's great. Does a good job.  And he will get an Oscar nomination, no doubt about it.  Might even win. But for those of us who want to honor Alan Turing's memory for the amazing contributions he made...  Not great for that. Not great for that.  Yeah. I'm kind of with you on that.  And once I read this article, I went, oh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I get the feeling like most people probably won't.  So on the good side, they'll be exposed to, oh, there was a guy named Alan Turing and he was persecuted.  And he did these amazing things. But they'll... you know, the picture of him they will get will not be sort of realist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they did the same thing with Mark Zuckerberg and the social network.  And it was wrong. It was wrong.  And in fact, they made up that the whole basis of the movie was that his girlfriend dumped him.  And in fact, it's not true. He's married to her now.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm binge watching The Good Wife, which I...  Me too.  I'm a great show. Love it.  And so in the second season, they have just a copy of...  They make a reference up front to Zuckerberg, but it's all... it's exactly the same story.  And it's a guy fighting and the stupid screenwriter is saying, I don't care about the facts. I care about the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I can't wait. You know, the show... I'm in the first season.  It starts off like a traditional kind of procedural lawyer show.  And it's actually pretty bad. Like all the crimes get solved by kind of this deus ex machina that appears.  Oh, look, here's a clue. Oh, he's exonerated.  But then around episode 17 of the first season, it suddenly gets ambiguous and interesting.  And then it starts to deal with some really...  It's really good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watched... The weird thing was I wanted to watch... So I thought I'd watch from both ends.  So I watched season... We're in season six now. I watched all of season five.  I watched season... Well, I was watching one trying not to buy it. I finally gave up on buying every season.  It's all on Amazon Prime for free.  I know, but I'm on airplanes.  Oh, airplanes.  So I've just bought the damn seasons and I'm watching it.  So I'm full... I'm season and a half now at the beginning and trying not to watch the end.  But I know I have my own spoilers. It's really weird. But each show is really good. It's superb.  And Alan Cumming is wonderful. She's really good.  She's wonderful. It's a great...  And Alan Cumming is good.  I think you'll fall in love with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything with Alan Cumming in it, I'll just watch. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm going to go see Cabaret. He's in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw him in Cabaret in the old Studio 54 some years ago.  How was it?  It's great. He's wonderful.  I can't remember who played Sally...  Emma Stone is now...  Yes, see, that would be good. The person I saw play Sally Bowles was not an actor.  She was like a celebrity. And so that wasn't great.  It was somebody like Annie Wilson from Heart or something. It was just like a random...  Oh, this will sell tickets kind of a thing. But he is great.  People are pointing out, by the way, that the other movie for nerds that everybody should watch is The Theory of Everything.  Stephen Hawking's story, which I haven't seen. Have you seen that, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I haven't. But I really want to because I heard Eddie Redmayne does an amazing job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he'll win the Oscar because that's how you win an Oscar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, playing disabled people generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It guarantees you an Oscar. But it does look like he does an amazing job.  And that one, I think, is a little more accurate.  It's a little harder to slander somebody who's still alive.  Well, maybe not. Actually Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they do go into the fact that he dumped his wife, which is...  I have to watch this.  So they don't try to paper that over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Mr. Jarvis, you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a few. Where is it?  So two things that I found fascinating.  One is, I didn't know this, according to RW Baird,  an analyst, Google's desktop search revenue is now below 50% of Google's total revenue.  Whoa. Whoa. I heard reaction.  And the other little point that I thought was interesting here,  and I'm going to start the street that's going to play a video to me, which I hate.  Is that this says, Credit Suisse analyst says that Google Play's revenue run rate  at $4 billion is equivalent to Google's YouTube revenue run rate of $4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh. What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it just means, A, that Play is a hidden gem for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to make money for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But B, this says that everybody thinks that Google, 98% of Google revenue is advertising.  True. But Google and people think Facebook is moving ahead fast on mobile.  True. But Google is more mixed and diverse in its revenue than I would have thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. That's good. So that whole content strategy working good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then as search, because Google lost Firefox as the default search, it lost the market share.  But, you know, flee on the butt of the elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a crazy tool for you. When the HTC announced this little doohickey, we thought they were insane.  This is the HTC RE. It looks like a little periscope or an asthma inhaler.  Yeah, I thought it was a puffer.  It looks like a puffer, but it's actually a camera.  And it's kind of the logical successor to the flip cam or something like that.  Maybe it's not exactly a GoPro. It's a weird thing.  But look here, I'll show you if you get the over the shoulder shot.  It ties to Android or iOS. So I have a viewfinder here.  Now, it's not great for stills, but it's actually kind of a decent movie camera because it just sits there.  You know, you don't need a tripod. It's really easy.  And they added a feature which I kind of think puts this over the top, makes it very interesting.  Live YouTube streaming. So if I check this box, I've already set up my YouTube account to receive it and press the record button.  I am now streaming live on YouTube.  Talk about an interesting and simple way to start vlogging or I don't know what.  Is that out in the market now?  Yeah. Now it's pricey. In fact, it's overpriced. It's $179 on Amazon. I think 200 is the list.  I wouldn't use it as a still camera, probably. In fact, I probably wouldn't.  I don't even know if it's as a movie camera, it'd be that valuable.  But it's really intriguing as a streamer.  It's just like you could start vlogging instantly and create a YouTube.  I don't know. I found this really intriguing and I have to admit I was skeptical about it.  There's some cool features. I'm going to review it fully on before you buy next week.  But there's some cool features. One, it's always on. It's got a touch sensor in the body.  So when you pick it up, it wakes up.  So you don't have to. You can pick it up and take a picture right away just by pressing that button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you still streaming to YouTube? OK, so it finally came up on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about 30 seconds to get going on YouTube. So if you go to my YouTube site, youtube.com slash Leo Laporte.  Yeah, it took a little bit to appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not as much of a lag as I have on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it has to encode and stream and YouTube has to receive it. It's using YouTube Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is it not? Come on, YouTube. You can do it. We believe in you.  There you go. It can only stream half an hour at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The audio is pretty good. Listen.  I don't know. I found this really intriguing and I have to admit I was skeptical about it.  There's some cool features. I'm going to. That's good, doesn't it?  I could do video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does it record in its own memory or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you have it. It comes with an SD card, 8GB SD card.  You could put up to 128GB micro SD in it. So it has plenty of recording space.  But you tie it to your smartphone with the Re app and then you've got a viewfinder and the ability to stream.  It streams through this, right? Streams through the phone.  It works much better on Wi-Fi. I wasn't really able to do much streaming on LTE, but very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I got a gadget too, Leo.  All right.  I decided I asked myself, what's the most obnoxious thing that I could do?  What is it?  I can take a selfie stick.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The selfie stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's technically called the wand of Narcissus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't stroke your wand of Narcissus there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought going around Davos with a selfie stick would be the most obnoxious thing I could do. So I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me just point out that the Re has a tripod thread in the bottom and it will work with a selfie stick as well.  And so I think I might put this on a selfie stick too.  Or just it just kind of naturally follows you around. Look at that.  You need a Belfi stick.  You've seen that the butt selfie stick.  Yeah, it has a little angle.  Let's try it. Let's just see.  Here's my selfie stick.  I got one too Jarvis.  Oh, man.  I got one too.  Now, now how much would you pay?  Close this whole studio down. You're all fired.  I've got everything I need with my selfie stick and my HTC Re.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be better if it had an extendable, you know, on the actual camera.  It should be its own selfie stick.  Or like a flex head that could move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inside it's got a battery that goes about an hour and a half, but you can get an extended battery.  And as I said, the YouTube stream is limited probably because of Google to 30 minutes.  But I don't know. It's kind of funny.  Good. So when are you going to Davos, Mr. J?  Next week.  So will you be here from Davos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's going to be... I hate to leave you without...  Soon it's going to be a one person show.  Yes, I know. I know. I know. But the problem is they have me doing that dinner until 10 o'clock.  Yeah, that's all right.  Until the show starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all right.  Up the street.  So Matthew, can you come next week too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I'm happy to do it and I'll never go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We love you, Matthew. We love you.  We love you. And you have no plans to have a baby anytime in the near future?  Not to my knowledge.  Or a startup?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm not getting a selfie stick either.  And he's not getting a selfie stick either. Matthew Igram, we love Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be very un-Canadian to have a selfie stick, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is why I love you.  Apparently they're coming to the United States. This is going to be the summer of the selfie stick in the US.  Oh no.  I saw them all over Europe.  Yeah, they're everywhere.  Yeah.  Matthew writes for Giga Home. He is the guy.  You got to read him. GigaHome.com. I'm sorry, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at the oatmeal. Did a selfie stick. Should you buy a selfie stick for it?  I love the oatmeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew Igram is... Is he any relation to you? Matthew Ingram?  Inman? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inman? Ingram?  All people named Matthew are not related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Inman and Ingram are practically your brother.  No, you're right. That doesn't make any sense at all. There it is.  Should you buy a selfie stick? writes the oatmeal.  A handy guide for shoppers. Have you completely given up on life? Yes, you should buy a selfie stick.  No. Are you Japanese? Yes, you should buy a selfie stick.  No, you should not buy a selfie stick.  It's a simple decision tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite is the little arrow at the bottom of the drawing.  Yeah.  What? Scroll down.  The character is Crocs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crocs. Oh, I wear Crocs too.  Crocs are great. What's wrong with Crocs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think selfie sticks are an interim technology and soon we'll have little mini drones that can take pictures from anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ordered a drone too. I am Mr. With It.  I would like a drone.  Yeah, I'll send you one. You can put your camera on it and you'll be looking up the whole time you do the show.  And a mini. Do you want to put it in the same pack?  Put it in with a Mac mini, absolutely.  Okay.  Matthew Ingram, GigaHome.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have a drone camera for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do, but I don't know doing it inside if it's a good idea.  Oh, yeah.  What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, you had a fire dancer inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. You saw that. You were there.  I smelled it.  We had to leave because the kerosene was so...  But she was great. She was great.  Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York. We call it CUNY.  And he also blogs at BuzzMachine.com and he's on Twitter and he's on Google Plus.  And his latest book...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon I'll be on a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll send you a Mac. I'll get John to talk to you and we'll get you an appropriate piece of hardware.  We would love to replace Skype. It's not that we're in love with Skype.  I know.  It's just the only thing that seems to work reliably, alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I should have restarted the machine right before the show. I learned that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty good now. It's settled down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's better. And I closed everything on the machine and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the key. Nothing else can be going on.  We do This Week in Google every Wednesday. I love this selfie stick. I'm just going to keep using this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
