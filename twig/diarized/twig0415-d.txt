Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The University of Technology Sydney. Nice.  My friend Peter Frey's office. I'm over here for the whole week yabbing, yabbing, yabbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So unfortunately that means you're probably on Australian time by now.  Yes. Yeah.  Which means it's really early in the morning. Otherwise, it'd be evening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just hard. Yeah, it's so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's tomorrow. I'm telling you Thursday's bad. You don't want to stay in Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every day's been getting worse and worse. Are you kidding?  Great to have you, Jeff Jarvis, also joining us back after his stunning,  stunning show on Sunday. Mark Elgin from gastronomad.net.  We're so glad we have you in the country for a little while.  I'm glad to be in the country. I enjoy this country very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was a stunning show. I think I was stunned the entire time.  That was actually a lot of fun. Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  I was in France and Southern Europe and just like right here, Sonoma County. The climate is almost...  It is actually, isn't it? Yeah.  It's just like Sonoma but with castles and stuff.  And French people. History and culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going there in two months in September. I can't wait.  And actually, if you're interested in going somewhere, Mike and Amira, his wife,  are doing an amazing event in Barcelona coming up September 12th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe that's right. If you go to gastronomad.net, you can get the exact...  If that's not it. I'm pretty sure that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spend the week with them cooking, baking bread. The best baker in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stand behind that statement. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes. Is Spanish bread any different than  French bread, say, or Italian bread? It has lots of regional varieties,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  many of which are not generally available. But there's also a, pardon the pun, pan-European  bread culture. And so this baker participates in both. So it's kind of French, kind of Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lovely. Really good bread.  Yeah. And you're a good... I don't know if people know, but Mike's an amazing baker. He really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inspired me to do more baking. Thank you. And I'm obsessed with bread. I'm very...  I follow you on the Google Plus bread community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. The art of bread.  The art of bread. It's a wonderful... If you don't mind the carbs,  highly recommend the art of bread. Hey, look who else is here. Aaron Newcomb is here. Hello,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron. Great to see you. Yeah, dad. It's been back. I don't know how long it's been. Boy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it seems like forever. Well, where are you working these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'm at New Relic, which is part of the reason I haven't been able to join  as often as I'd like to. I love New Relic. We use New Relic.  Yeah, it's great software. If anybody needs application monitoring software, you should  really check it out. Or even infrastructure monitoring, which is what I joined to help them  develop as their infrastructure monitoring platform. So yeah, it's just busy as all get out  here, as my dad would say. And so they don't give me much time, but I try to get on channels as  often as I can on Floss Weekly twice in a row the past couple of weeks. So go back out and take a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  look at Floss Weekly if you missed those episodes. Yeah, we use New Relic to monitor the Twitter TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  website. Yeah. From day one on your website. Yeah. Applications, your hosts. Yeah. Makes it  really easy. The thing that I love about it is you can really dive in if you're a data nerd.  In fact, the people behind me, I don't know if you can see them walking back and forth. Those  are our data scientists. I love data. So they're constantly digging in and trying to find insights  and all the data we collect. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. So good news for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Chromebook rumors are starting, the rumor mill is starting to pound.  Chromebook Eve, which we've been seeing in the OS commits, Chrome OS commits since last October,  seems to be getting closer and closer. This would be, if it is what people think it is,  a replacement for this Google Pixel, which we're all desperate to get. The Pixel is kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  run through its end of life at this point. Has. I lugged mine here so I could do the show and I  love it dearly, but it's, yeah, I'm waiting for the next thing. It would be running the current

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  seventh generation Kaby Lake processor from Intel. That's one of the things Google did with its  Pixel. It ran i5 processors and i3 processors. And there's another thing that's kind of interesting  that is actually a larger story, which is that Google may be eliminating the,  I don't want to say it out loud. Okay. Google features from the Chromebook, you know, where you  invoke Google assistant. Actually, it's not Google assistant. It is it's Google something,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something voice search or whatever. It seems like it's assistant. See, this is the confusion.  Is the problem. And so I think they're heading toward, hopefully a thing that when you talk to  any Google thing, you know, you're talking to the assistant and that would be very nice. That's  essentially what Apple does with Siri. There's only one a word at Amazon, even though that's  widely distributed. And so when you get to Google, it's always been, well, is it Google now? Is it  this? Is it that? And they really need to centralize. I think it's a good thing. It's mostly branding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the other rumor is at least according to code in the OS repository, there will be a dedicated  assistant key, which I like. I mean, I have it on Bixby, but who wants to talk to Bixby?  Nobody. Samsung Galaxy. Is it a key word? No, a key, a physical like button that you'd press to  say and now and then start talking. So I like that. Because I think a lot of times you feel  kind of dopey saying, OK, Google, and then talking. So I like this. Can you also can you also say,  OK, you know who the this is what I'm reading from an article in Laptop Magazine, but I think that  they may be quoting Chrome Unboxed, which is a Chromebook Chrome OS blog. Right. They say that  it's that the code in the repository suggests Google plans to deprecate. OK, Google functionality.  Now, I'm not sure if that's in only Chrome OS. I mean, that's what they know. But I wonder if  Google might even be doing in a more global way. I don't know. I don't know. And I suspect they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  will. What they really should do, what I'd really love to see Google do, and they probably won't do  it, but they should have another hardware product, which would be earbuds, the hearables.  I know you're a big fan of Apple's ear pods. Big fan of them. But what the way Google should work  is that should automatically connect to whichever device is nearby that it already has permissions  to connect. And then when you talk to this, when you talk to the Google Assistant, you can just do  that. You can just talk. It'll you know, it'll be like the A word from from Amazon, the Echo.  And that would be killer because we're moving to a world where we just talk, be like Star Trek,  and our virtual assistant talks back. And other companies, namely Amazon and Apple, are starting  to take over that space, even though Google had the best assistant first. And I'd love to see them  get back into it with more hardware like the home, but also like these ear pods. Apple air pods are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are wonderful. The way they work is you double tap them to get Siri to listen. And that is hit or  miss, I think. It is. It's problematic. It also hurts your ear. I'd like to have it be keyword

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  triggered. I think that would be perfectly fine. Or maybe have a user setting that you could do one  or the other. Either way, we're getting we're going to the world where we just talk and something  whispers in our ear. Let's get there. You know, let's hurry up and get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a wake on voice capability that is in the Chromebook Eve repository. So but I think key  mapping. So I'm actually when I decided to read the original article by Gabriel Brangers and  Chromebook Chrome unboxed, Chrome unboxed calm. So this is the this would be the first time a  Google Assistant is on a Chrome OS device as an again, distinguishing it from Google search,  voice search. Yeah. He says we've been tracking the new Chromebook Eve for some time now.  And the longer we do, the more intriguing it becomes. So he's mentioning this. And here's the  snippet special keyboard mapping for Eve project, the keyboard has an extra assistant key.  The commit looks to add key mapping for some combination of the eight key and another key,  yet to be discovered. The wake on voice capabilities been added to Chromebook Eve.  So it does, I guess still wake on voice. Okay. But but see, that's why I'm puzzled because the  article I that I was reading on in laptop magazines said they were going to deprecate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I guess they're deprecating. Okay. Yeah. You know, okay, you know who but but they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, I agree with you. You're switching. You have to have a trigger of some kind, whether it's  a button or a voice. But I love it. If I'd love the Moto X where you could say whatever you wanted,  I thought that was much better. It's more secure, obviously, because people don't necessarily know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your passphrase. The problem with the Moto X, excuse me, is that you'd have to take it out of  your I mean, this is first world problems, you have to take it out of your pocket. Right. What'd  be ideal would be to have a Chromebook closed in your backpack or sitting in the seat next to you  in the car. Powering those earbuds. Yeah, yeah, that would be great. Yeah, I would like that.  Okay, I mean, they do have the technology is there. Right. Yeah. I mean, I know when I'm sitting at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  home, and I've got my phone out, and I've got Google Home in the same room, and I say the  trigger word, and ask it a question, they both hear me. Yes, and it'll say answering on another

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  device. It always seems to answer when you're on the phone, it'll wake up the phone, but always

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seems to answer on the home, right? It's like has a built in preference in the software. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the Amazon Echo, because it has those beamforming array mics, it can it knows what  you're closest to. So I almost always wake up multiple echoes when I say it, because I have a  booming voice. But the one that answers me is always the one nearest me. And that's how it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  should be. Mike, there's one other thing you need though, for that laptop in your backpack. Yeah.  You need a cellular connectivity on it. Oh, yeah. You definitely need that. And that's, I miss that  so much from the first Pixel. I just, I would kill for that. And the same with my Pixel C. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Mike is, oh no, you're not, I keep making that mistake. You're using an iPad. It  looks like you're using a Pixel C, but it's not. It's an iPad. That's right. But he is using a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tablet like you do, Jeff. Yeah. And I have the SIM card in there, so I have data, and it's unlimited  data plan. So I'm like, that's heaven. That's, you got to have that. If you're going to be a nomad,  absolutely. Does it work overseas? I have to get a SIM card, the local SIM card, but then it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that's a special case because I think the reason they stopped putting it in  is because everybody already is paying for data on their phone. And nowadays, almost everybody  has the ability to hotspot from their phone. And so now it's not as fast. No, and that's a matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of the business model. What you should be able to do is connect all your SIMs in one account.  And just have it take from the same pool. If you can do that among family members, why can't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do that among devices? You can actually. AT&T, if you buy the new Android 2 watch,  you have a choice of having its own phone number and its own SIM or using an app on your phone to  use data from the phone. I'm not sure how it works, but I gather that it's a handoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Google's Project PHY, you get your main account and then you can get up to 10, I think,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  additional SIM cards. I keep meaning to do that. That would be on the PHY account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is it's not cheap anymore. When they first came out, I was like, oh my gosh,  look at these prices. But now there's all these unlimited things and deals have gotten much better.  And now Google PHY is kind of on the pricey side. You keep using a lot of data,  you're going to pay for all that data. In a way, it's kind of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Boy, Mike, isn't it the best thing abroad? I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't live abroad like you do, but when I go abroad, yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I shop on the PHY store? Where would I do that? Oh, manage plan maybe?  Apparently I have five devices, which I didn't know about.  Wait a minute, that can't be right. Are people buying SIM cards on my account? Five devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your monthly cost says 70 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, these are old devices. Okay, so here's where you do it. I get it. So I should probably  get rid of these inactive devices. These are old Nexus 6, the old Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could employ a full-time person just getting rid of your inactive devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have so much that I should just...  A separate person just for Amazon.  So add a data only SIM using any compatible device or try to data coverage. And that's the  same 10 bucks a month. 10 bucks a gigabyte, I should say. And then what do they charge you  to get a SIM? Oh, nothing. It's free. They'll just send you a free SIM. They'll send you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  several free SIMs. They want you to use data, you know, and think about it. And the best thing  about Google PHY is the clarity in the pricing model. So if I'm going to be in the US for three  months, I just pause service for three months and they charge me nothing during those months.  And then when I'm going to go abroad again, I just reactivate it. Half an hour later, I'm on  the network in the foreign country and it works really great. The only problem is that I use way  too much data for this plan. I think I ran up a bill of like a hundred bucks in a couple of hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  recently. Yeah, I signed up for Google PHY recently and I work on the ferry now back and forth to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  work in the morning, the afternoon. Oh, it works? Like even when you're in the bay in the middle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's spotty, but I can get a connection. That's the reason I got PHY was because it will jump  around from tower to tower, right? Yeah, it uses US sellers, Sprint, and T-Mobile and Wi-Fi. So it'll  find the best if it can find anything. Yeah. So I figured I'd try it out. Unfortunately, I'm using  about seven gig a month. So I think I'm going to go back to T-Mobile's one plan, their unlimited

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  plan, because I just can't justify it. That's the cutoff because you have to pay 20 bucks for voice  and text and then 10 bucks per gigabyte. So you're paying $90 now, whereas you can go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a T-Mobile 70 or $80 plan. Exactly. You're right at the cutoff. Now, if Google can somehow take  Google PHY and make it unlimited, that would be... Yep. Forget about it. There would be no other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be killer. By the way, there is a Google PHY referral challenge. So we can all fight over  which PHY code. Who's Google PHY code? I think all four of us use PHY. That's interesting. Of course,  it is this week in Google. So I guess the reason I bring this up is because Jeff is  desperate for a new Pixel. And it sounds like this Eve will be the Chromebook to get  whenever it comes out. It's got to be fairly close. Yeah, because the Samsung Pro and the Asus C302

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are good, but they're only four gigs of onboard memory. You want an 8-gig machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want an i5 processor. Yeah, yeah. Touchscreen, good screen. The screen will be 3.2.  This is all stuff gleaned from the Chrome OS repository. There's something in... It's called  double-click. I don't know what that is. This is from Laptop Magazine. The third more perplexing  rumor that Google Chrome Unbox uncovered is it can respond to a double tap similar to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chromebook Pixel. On the external, when it's closed, you can double tap on the case. Oh, right.  You can see the power. That wakes up that LED bar. So it could do other things. Yeah, it could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  other things. It's unclear what this will do, but Eve apparently doesn't have a light bar like the  Pixel C does. Commits refer to some LEDs, but we don't know what they'll do. So that's interesting.  That's interesting. So this is the code repository for Chrome OS. As new devices come out, they start  to add code specific to those devices. Since it's open source, that's what these guys are looking at.  Other rumors, fingerprint reader, like that. 2400 by 1600 touchscreen display, that's good.  That's a three by two, which the current one is. Is that right? Yeah, three by two. So it sounds like  a good, it sounds like something to wait for, Jeff. If I'm going to be a betting man, what do you guys  think? The current rumor, we're back in the rumor sphere again, but the current rumor is the Pixel  will be, the next Pixel will be announced in October after Apple's event, not before. So that's only a  few months off. That would be a logical time to announce a new, one or two new phones and a new  Chromebook. It's a little late for back to school though. If you wanted to get back to school, you'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  want to do it now. Yeah. But I don't, I'm not sure the schools, that's not a device for schools.  It's too high end. It's too high end. The other, the rest of the, the Chrome OS device. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a whole benefit. I bought Michael's entering is a, could be a freshman in high school.  I bought him the Samsung Chromebook Plus, which I really like. Yeah. That's a really nice, lightweight,  powerful, but, but easy to use machine. Right. Okay. Let's take a break. We're going to come back.  We're going to talk about a lot of new things from Google was busy this week. Yeah. SOS in maps and  search, this international space station. You can now tour it in street view  and a lot more, I think. And much, much more. Much, much more, which I haven't found yet,  but I will find before this ad is over. Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  If you're buying a house, unless you're, unless you're, you know, you got some money and you're  writing a check, chances are good, or bringing a briefcase full of cash, you're going to get a  mortgage. You're going to get a home loan. Everybody does, but not all home loans are created equal.  And certainly not all mortgage lenders are created equal. I want to encourage you to go to Quicken  Loans, the best mortgage lender in the business. That's why year after year, they win those great  JD Power customer satisfaction awards. And they like geeks because they've created a brand new  service, a completely online mortgage approval process called Rocket Mortgage. It's awesome.  It's first of all, you can do it all on your phone. You could do it. It's so fast. You could  do it at an open house and get approval before you leave. But you may say, but Leo, don't we  have to fax them documents or hand carry our banker's box full of check stubs and pay statements  and bank statements? Don't we have to? No, you don't because Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans  is paired with all of the big financial institutions so they can just automatically send them to  Quicken Loans, give them all the information they need. Just, you know, all you have to do is say,  yes, do that, do that, do that. And then within minutes, they will chop the numbers and based on  your income, your assets and your credit, they can give you exactly the home loan that's right for  you. You can choose the rate and term, of course, it's flexible, but it's transparent. You'll know  how it's working. You'll know what's going on. And you can be confident you're getting the best loan  for you. Rocket Mortgage is here to lift the burden of getting a home loan. Apply simply, understand  fully, mortgage confidently. Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig, rocketmortgage.com slash twig,  equal housing lender license to all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org number 3030.  And of course, if you go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig, they'll know you heard it here,  which is good for us. Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans. We thank them so much for the support of  this week in Google. What was the YouTube boycott? I didn't, it says your YouTube ad boycott had  minimal impact. Well, I didn't even know it was happening. So maybe that's why maybe.  So let's see here. This is Google YouTube boycott has minimal impact. This is okay. This is part of  the report on Google's quarterly results. Of course, a very big quarter. Net income was down  28%. But they still made three and a half billion dollars. The reason it was down is because they  paid a two or I guess they took, I don't think they've paid it yet because they're appealing it.  But they took a loss of 2.7 billion for the antitrust fine they got from the EC. That's nice if  you make so much money that you could pay a 2.7 billion dollar fine and still make three and a  half billion. They just write it off. Just write it off. The funny thing is that the amount that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Europe fined, that was a record fine obviously, just keeps, it like doubles every 18th month.  It's like the European Moore's law. That's not good. That's not good. So the next one will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in 18 months and it'll be. Is that built into the law that it keeps going up or that's just the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it works? No, I just think that they keep noticing how deep Google's pockets are. That's really it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's go get some more. Well, we got money. They got plenty left over. Search and display  advertising revenue grew by 20% to 18.4 billion dollars. 18.4 billion in revenue,  3.5 billion dollars in profit. It's good work if you can get it, Leo.  I didn't know this but there was a YouTube brand safety boycott earlier this year.  What was that? Apparently, that was major advertisers. That was Guardian, BBC,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Havas and others pulled back their ads from YouTube because of being next to bad stuff  and in the financials it had no impact. Google responded quickly and Google needed to because  otherwise others could have left if they weren't responsive. So it did have an impact on their  actions. It just didn't have an impact on their bottom line. Cost per click, this might be a cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of concern, cost per click down 26% on Google properties, 11% on display network member sites.  But paid clicks increased by 61%. That's why their overall revenue went up even though the  cost went down. Maybe that's part of the deal is the cost goes down but they continue to grow the  market. A 9% increase in paid clicks on Google display. Google paid out 3 billion dollars to  network members. That's up 15% year over year. So I guess you'd say the ad, Jeff, I'll defer to you  on this but I guess you'd say the ad market is healthy. It is but one has to wonder whether the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ad market starts to collapse at some point. Is there a point at which it can't get any bigger?  They're just, yeah, it can't get any bigger. B, there's so many other ways that people buy things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we see this in podcast revenues because there's so many more podcasts now.  Even though the pie is growing, the slices are getting smaller because there's so many different  podcast companies. It's roughly an equal. I think we're down, we're probably down maybe 10%  this year. It's the first year we'd be down ever but I think that's because there's just so much  competition. I think it's probably the same thing in Google's sphere. There are a huge number of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  podcasts that are just too small to make a penny. Well that's right, yeah. They know that, I hope.  But that also has the sort of invisible effect of just kind of subtly draining away people's time.  They're listening to them, right? Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. They have small audiences.  Everybody has a limited amount of time that they can pay attention to stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Even though this isn't related to podcasts,  it's related to advertising in general, but programmatic advertising, these marketplaces,  these trading floors, put instantaneous competition and that depresses prices considerably. It  commodifies media so that has an impact on media as a whole. Now, podcasts should stand out from  that because you can't just place any old generic ad anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, there's moves to do that in podcasts too with insertion.  We will never do that because I don't believe, well, I can't say we'll never do it, but  I would prefer not to do it. I don't believe in that. I think that you're exactly right,  Jeff. That's what differentiates our advertising from just run of the mill media, but there's lots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of pressure from advertisers. I also think it's an opportunity. The way that you do ads on this  network is a respite. As the outside world where the advertisements get more and more intrusive,  automatically running video, all this noise and just irritating ads in your face all the time,  it's nice to go to the Twitter network and hear ads the way you do them.  We're just kind of conversational. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Advertising that works. Well, I don't want to make it all about us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I do think that there's a ... Now that podcasting is having a renaissance,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which always makes me laugh because we've been here 12 years, but now that there's a renaissance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of podcasting and the media world, particularly New York, is sitting up and taking notice because  there's a lot of podcasts coming out of media in New York, there's a lot of pressure. There's more  money in it, but there's also a lot of pressure to conform to other media. People want it to work the  same way it works on radio and TV. There's up fronts now. They're looking at insertion. They're  looking at terms from the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, that are less favorable to  podcasters, more favorable to advertisers. We knew this was coming. I always liked the days when  podcasting was kind of the lesser known cousin of mainstream media and nobody really knew what about  us. It's not like that anymore. Everybody knows about podcasts now, so it's changing.  Half the podcasts were yours. Those were the days when I was the only podcaster.  I had a monopoly on a tiny, tiny, I'd rather be a big fish in a little pond, I admit it.  Shrink that pond down. Drain the swamp.  Or something. Let's see. Good news, I would say overall, for Google, less money per click.  Very similar, isn't it? Less money per click, but the pond is growing bigger, so that makes up for it.  Clicks on its ads, according to Alphabet, surged 52%. Wow, more clicks. Wow. What does that mean?  Does that mean advertisers are getting savvier about making ads that work? I think it might have  something to do with better targeting. Everybody hates ad targeting, right, Aaron? Everybody says,  oh, don't track me, bro. But at the same time, I would far prefer to see ads for products I'm  interested in than ads for stuff I have no interest in. Why waste my time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right. If you earn less for each click, but you're more productive  in presenting what people want, that's okay. So you're trading the high dollar amount for  the volume in that case, and people are happier. The other thing that's happening is the distribution

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of advertising is going underground and becoming more subtle. What I mean by that is the rise in  experiential marketing means that marketers and advertisers are not actually creating content.  What they're doing is they're creating Instagrammable experiences, and then consumers  are Instagramming them, and they're creating the content, and they're distributing the content on  social. That's kind of like this weird new world where how do you measure it, how do you control it?  You don't know how much of those ad budgets are being drained off from advertising, which you can  measure, you can measure clicks and all that stuff, into this experiential marketing universe, which  again, with augmented reality, is just going to be a huge form of marketing. Great article today in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  BuzzFeed by Alex Kantrowitz, who's talking about how money is going away from buying ads,  instead it's going to promoting favorable news coverage, and this is exactly what you're talking  about. Fascinating. Fascinating. And that's good marketing, right? Promote a positive review of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your product. That's better than an ad. Oh yeah, much better. But once again, the content creators

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are the users. Didn't Mashable get clicks? Let's see. So yeah, that's interesting. So here's the  example. Mashable wrote a positive review of an app called Blind. What Blind did is buy on Facebook,  see suggested post, links not to an ad in effect, but to the Mashable review.  And of course Mashable doesn't get any of that money. It all goes to Facebook, but Mashable...  No, if you click on the article, Leo, you would go to the Mashable review and they'd get more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  traffic. It says the post drove more than 11,000 visits to the app download page, which was, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guess, linked. Mashable, which sells advertising to companies like Blind, didn't see a dime. Not  that way. In other words, Blind didn't buy an ad on Mashable. But its benefits Mashable, and this is  instead of buying a normal ad on Facebook. So I think this is beneficial to everybody. Facebook  still gets the same amount of money. Blind gets better promotion, and Mashable, which wouldn't  have gotten any money from an ad, gets some traffic. Here's the dark side. The dark side is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the people who work at Mashable, young kids out of college writing these articles, now have a  massive incentive to write positive reviews so that they will get traffic. Now, the thing is,  so that they will get traffic. Now, in order to get traffic, it's not about clickbait. It's about  sucking up to Microsoft, sucking up to other companies so that they link to you and you can  go to your editor and say, look at all the traffic I'm generating with my articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like it's back to paper post. It's like paper post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as this Buzzfeed article points out, advertisers are going to send... Facebook wins  because advertisers send money to Facebook instead of to Mashable for an ad on Mashable.  Facebook wins anyway. Casper did this. Now, I guess it would affect us as well, right?  Casper repurposed a BBC story as a Facebook ad promoting its product. A local plumbing company  in Texas used a Dallas Morning News article about a water main break to promote its service.  Facebook itself recently promoted an Ad Age article to hype its video offering. So here's  a sponsored post, Facebook Business, which links to Ad Age. Facebook has a message for marketers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ahead of cans. All digital is not the same. And this is one of those things like for a while  every time there's a new type of controversial ad format, everybody tries it. Native advertising  came and didn't quite go again, but it became a thing. Everybody was trying to see if it was a  good fit. I hope this experiment fails for everybody because this is... I don't think it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Native failed because it felt skeezy. It felt like it was a trick, right? But this is  clearly an ad and it's linking to a legitimate article. Though that's going to be the question.  I agree that maybe this article will become... Over time, this will suborn the best intentions  of these publications, but at least for now, it pushes through publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the danger, Leo. Right. So we have a Casper ad here. If somebody else writes...  If Jason Calacanis writes a glowing Casper review, just knowing he's going to screw you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do they stop advertising with you? No. Well, yeah. So what could happen is Casper could buy  an ad on Facebook pushing the Calacanis's article, but that's not Calacanis's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a different kind of... I'm making a Jason joke is all. But what I'm saying is,  does this change advertising such that they stop buying advertising instead...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So again, this is... Right. And this might incent a whole new demand media style business where  people write positive articles. But see, I don't think that that's... Because again,  that's going to look skeezy because there's going to be people... You got to push to a legitimate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  source of this positive review or it's just junk. But left in the dust is the legitimate  article that was critical. And so it skews the favorability. It also skews the algorithms because  Facebook says, oh, everybody's linking to this article. What did you do? So when you were running

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows Magazine, if you had a positive review of a product, would the product come to you and say,  can we put a link to that on our webpage? Well, when I started Windows Magazine, there was no web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or in a newspaper ad. Yeah. No, if people... I mean, it's free speech issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Windows Magazine gives it five stars. Or Cisco and Ebert say two thumbs up. You can't stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And we wouldn't try. And they would even put that stuff in ads that appeared in  Windows Magazine. And that was fine. Well, at least you got some revenue. But we get to ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that all the time. Can we use... So let's say we do a segment. Now I realize what's going on. It's this.  We'll do a segment on a product and that company will then say, can we embed that on our webpage?  And we usually... In fact, we always say no. Yeah. Well, what you should do... But I don't think we can really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stop it. Here's what you should do, Leo. Turn this thing around to your own advantage. So you have...  Let's say you have several ads on your shows. You could go to one of those advertisers and say, look,  here's how much you spent on the ad. Take that money and instead we'll do the ad for free if  you take that money and advertise links to the show. In other words, you could turn as payment  for some of your advertisers into promotions for the shows. I'd rather have cash. Yeah. Cash is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me cash. Don't get me wrong. Cash is good. Well, I think this kind of thing will happen. In fact,  who knows? Maybe Mashable did say something like that. We don't know. Yeah. Because traffic is  valuable. Yes. So it's good for everybody, at least now. Mashable got traffic. Traffic is less

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  valuable. It's less valuable than the dollars. And you're right. And Facebook gets a new kind of...  So we were talking just a few minutes ago about how Google and Facebook have to find new ways to  get new pieces of the pie of the advertising. This is a new kind of advertising. Chowroom,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what do you think? Facebook gets it. The consumers... I think these are ads, these are better than  regular ads because they point to it when hope's a trusted third party that's recommending the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  product. Source you send to is trusted, not Sally's... Yeah. It has to be trusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There have been studies that indicate that socially shared content is more trustworthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  than advertising. But that's usually socially shared from a friend of yours.  Exactly. So sharing a Mashable article or advertising with a link to a Mashable article wouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  count at that level. But see, this changes the algorithms. If enough people click on that ad,  Facebook sees that people are going to that article. Google sees that the article's getting  a lot of traffic. People share it more because it comes up in their algorithms. And it's like  they're trying to create a sort of virality. Well, you heard it here first. We warned you first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to see more of these ads. I think it's a better kind of ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One more question. One more question. So I saw a sponsored post for the Cardia, the EKG thing we've  talked about in the show. It's a sponsored post. They bought it, but I like the product. So I shared  their sponsored post and said this thing works. Did they pay for that? No.  You gave them a freebie to them. You gave them a freebie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave them free advertising. In fact, I think probably people who create native content, that's  one of the side benefits is the potential to get more traffic by having that be shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me, the most important thing is advertising is good. And the good advertising is good. Bad  advertising is bad. We're all sick of the really junky, garbagey advertising, but we really,  really want advertising. And this is why I know I think that you've praised Medium's move to paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At first I was suspect, and I know Jeff I think probably still is, but it worked for me because  Baratunde became hidden behind a paywall. It was five bucks a month and I bought it because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wanted to see his articles. Five bucks a month is a lot of money for a lot of people. Essentially,  it's creating a... You basically, it would be great if all Medium content was available to everyone  with an internet connection globally. Unfortunately, $5 can be somebody's weekly salary in lots of parts  of the world and they just can't afford to read Medium. And that further advantages people who are  already advantaged. And so if you just make content advertisers supported, those of us who buy the  products are subsidizing it so that the whole world can see that content. I think that's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertising is good. Yeah, you've said that before. It's democratizing. Exactly. And I actually,  as somebody who's always worked in ad-supported free media, I agree. It's a bad... On the one  hand, nobody likes ads, right? So it's a bad thing in that respect. But let's remember what it buys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  us. It buys us a world, a beautiful world in which it's a redistribution of wealth that is voluntary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's beautiful. It's not taxation. In this age of fake news to redline journalism  and make it the product only for the elite is only going to exacerbate that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be bad. Yeah. That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because if you're a cheapskate like me, you're going to end up going to another source anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Cheapskate, do you pay for any news? Do you pay for the New York Times, the Washington Post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not. I do not. And if I see a story there and I hit a paywall, I'll just go to another source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do that with Financial Times. Yeah. I just say, well, I guess I can't read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's terrible. That's it. It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what you're arguing for is true is that this does need to be free and open.  And that's the best way to get the good stories out there. Because what happens is, is what if I'm not  me? What if I'm someone who maybe doesn't know the difference when they take a look at a story  and I hit the Wall Street Journal and I can't get through and I end up going to the fake news,  right? It's a similar headline, but it has a totally different-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake news will always be free because it has an agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. The other thing is that when organizations depend on advertising,  they are vulnerable to boycotts and things like that. I mean, look what's happened with Fox News  and some of the couple of shows on Fox News where there was some objectionable activity by one or  two of the hosts and everybody went after their advertisers and they went on vacation and spent  more time with their family and all this kind of stuff. The public can put pressure on semi-fake  real news type news organizations to squeeze their advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if all this is true, we want to keep ads supported free media. One of the  charges then would be to make advertising more palatable.  That's why I like this idea of sharing an article because it's more palatable,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's more effective. Theoretically, nobody likes the idea,  like you said a minute ago, but nobody likes the idea of targeting. But if targeting really worked,  it wouldn't feel like advertising. It'd be like, oh, we know what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're looking for a car? Let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I spend a lot of time searching for things that I want. I'd love it for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just come to me and say, look, this is it. So we don't need to track you and find out  what your interests are. One of the reasons that a very niche network like this works is because  it's very thin slice of the populace. But if you want to talk to geeks, we're a great way to do it.  In fact, every time we've diverged, it's really, I should have known this, but every time we've  diverged from hardcore geekdom, those shows don't make it. They don't get the audience and  they don't get the ads. So the shows that do the best here are the hardest core geek shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the stuff you advertise is not, again, don't want to make it all about a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Rocket Mortgage is interesting. There's an example because that's a mainstream business.  Mortgage lenders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it's the audience.  They want to get geeks.  What geeks do is not just interested in geeks. They're open to alternative new ways to do things.  Right.  Even if it's a bed and things like that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Casper, Harry's, Dollar Shave Club. That's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Geeks are open minded about new innovations by definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. Well, it's an interesting world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So breaking news, the Facebook results are out.  Oh, let's go check them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How bad slash good is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's tremendous again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess they made money, I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Before we get into-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two billion users. We're seeing, this is a live blog from MarketWatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two billion too many, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We knew that it was going to hit two billion.  The biggest quarter ever for hires, they're growing.  I'm going backwards, so this is backwards in time.  Expenses are going to grow-  The story's up.  For the year. Oh, there's a story up 40 to 50% compared to big growth in expenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Business Insider or Wall Street Journal has a story up.  Business Insider does too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I pay for the Wall Street Journal, so let's get what you paid for.  No paywall for you.  No paywall for me.  Facebook profit jumps 71%.  God, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me without any tech stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeez Louise.  Profit rose-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, are you like the Donald Trump of the tech world that if you close down  Twit and took all of your money and just put it in tech stocks, which you can't get now,  would you make more money than you do from Twit?  Yeah, probably. Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The right tech stock.  Right.  I know. It's so funny now because I have a lot of friends who are angel investors  and got into it for whatever reason. They're younger than I am, maybe in their 30s.  Many of these people are huge successes because they invested in Uber and Twitter.  But as I see, and companies like that, as I see those companies start to fail and falter,  these people don't look like the geniuses that they were four years ago.  I got in at the beginning on Uber. I still haven't made any money.  I got in at the beginning at Twitter. Oh, that stock's good, huh?  Are you happy now?  I bought Yahoo when it was $20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put it all into MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do have a friend, and it's actually kind of a tragic story, who worked at Waze, which was  a database company that was purchased by Yahoo. In the purchase, he got a lot of Yahoo stock.  Was it Yahoo or AOL? I know it was AOL. Even worse, he got a lot of AOL stock and did not diversify.  Probably should have.  Probably should have.  So he was living high on the hog for a while, but now not so much.  Wow.  So that's why, yes, maybe I would if I invested in the right stocks,  but I think I'll just stick with what I'm doing right now.  I like the small, slow growth of Twitter as opposed to the potential. 71% earnings per share  of $1.32. That's up from $0.78. Analysts thought, okay, they thought they'd do $1.12. They did $1.32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really bothers me that Facebook is so successful. I think they are too powerful.  They can just pick the president with a secret tweet to their algorithm and nobody could know.  I mean, it's unbelievable. It'd have way too much power.  Forget the Russians. Forget the Russians. Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Net profit was $2.3 billion a year ago. $3.9 billion one year later. Quarterly revenue up 45%  to $9.3 billion. That's more than the analyst consensus as well. That means the stock will  go through the roof tomorrow morning. Yeah, they're up at 4% in after hours right now.  Oh, wait a minute. I need the money. Oh, here's a good one. If you include Facebook and Google,  they soaked up between the two of them 99% of the online ad industry's growth last year. Almost all  the growth in the ad industry last year went to two companies, Facebook and Google. They are to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  advertising what Apple and Samsung are to phone profits. Facebook warns the number of ads in its

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  news feed is maxed out. They just added WhatsApp ads. Oh, are there any ads in WhatsApp? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Messenger ads. Yeah. I think they're smart and they're doing what we do, which is to keep units  down. Instagram is one every 10 posts. On Facebook, really those side ads, I don't even see them and  I doubt anybody does. They're not that important, but the periodic ads in the stream, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  effective. That's what Instagram is doing. They're getting better at the relevance there. I find the  ads, one out of 10 is irritating and off target. When I do try to tell them it's off target,  the choices of telling them just aren't quite ... I already bought a car, stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ad revenue up 53% this quarter. 53%. That's too many percent. They're doing something right.  Well, they're getting more powerful, but Google's getting more powerful. These companies are ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're doing some things right. They're screwing up a lot less than they used to,  but the biggest secret to their success is they have a monopoly on everybody. Everybody's on  Facebook because everybody's on Facebook. That's because in the game of musical chairs over time,  where technology trends match social trends, they happen to be the major social network when  everybody got on social networking before Facebook is just geeks like us who are on  CompuServe and all these other places. They will always have the mother of all network effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you understand why it's in Facebook's interest to get publishers to put content there,  why they're spending so much money now on live content, on video content.  Yeah, both.  They plan to spend 50% more this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The next thing I think you're going to see ... What we said earlier is you've got to  steal revenue from somebody else. The place everybody wants to steal revenue from is television.  It's not just live. Look what Facebook does because Facebook TV is going to be coming up very soon.  Yep. They're willing to spend ...  YouTube is changing itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're willing to spend $3 million an episode on episodic content for Facebook.  That's significant money.  I don't know if that's not Game of Thrones money, but it's getting close.  What if there were a 10-minute weekly show of interest equivalent to Game of Thrones  on Facebook? Everybody would ... They should do that. That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you this. Imagine they did a Game of Thrones, House of Cards type level  TV show. They have two billion monthly active users. They're massively larger than Showtime  or Netflix or ...  They'd make the money back in ads if they put ads.  Yeah. It's terrifying. They can basically write their own ticket and do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  House of Cards had 13 episodes in season one and it was $100 million. That's like $9 million  an episode, something like that. It's an hour long, high production value show. $3 million is  not that far off.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mike, here's why you want to like Facebook is because Zuckerberg likes things to be free.  I'm told that though they're now putting up subscription funnels for publishers,  because publishers have been whining about it and complaining about it. Even News Corp is working  with them on this potentially. What I'm told is that Zuckerberg himself just ... It grates him  of anything paid. He wants it free. The TV they do, I'll bet you they won't have premium TV.  I'll bet you they'll have just free ad supported TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need more. They're running out of ad real estate. They need somewhere to put ads.  That's why they put ads in messages.  Google has the rest of the web.  Yeah, but Facebook's got every Facebook with a lock in.  Facebook has Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't need to do more ads actually. They just need to raise prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good news. The cost of ads on Facebook rose as much as 39% this quarter.  It's a scarcity.  57% increase in the cost of some ads. These are two different marketing technology companies,  Kenshoo and Merkle. Kenshoo reported 39%. Merkle reported 57%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll just keep going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Facebook stock price up as you said 4%, Aaron. I bet you that's just the ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said it headed down first because there was confusion over ... They switched to gap  standards. There was some confusion in the first month compared to ...  I guess the market got smarter. It went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. The market got smarter. The wisdom of crowds.  What is Facebook stock symbol F?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the F stock, the F word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, F is forward. Sorry.  Should be Zuck.  I thought it was FBOOK, but I might be wrong. It's FB on the NASDAQ. Okay.  Let's see the current. Let's see the after hours. Whoa.  Oh my ...  After hours trading. Whoa.  Just launching into the stratosphere.  The blue line is right up to closing of stock. Then the gray line is right after the announcement.  You see it went up. Then there's that ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when they got off Facebook to listen to the announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then the drop. That's probably what Jeff was saying, which misunderstanding what the  revenues meant. They're currently ... They closed at 165. They're currently at 172.  The price to earnings is pretty high. 41.  All right. I'm no stock analyst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So can we talk about another metric besides money?  Yeah.  Ethereum? Bitcoin?  No. Customer ... No, please no. Customer satisfaction.  The American Customer Satisfaction Index released its 2007 ...  Yeah. You knew this was coming, Jeff.  And Google Plus is the most satisfying social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the weirdest story I've ever heard. How did that even happen?  I'll tell you. They don't have ads, for starters.  The most loved social network in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you how that happens. Everybody hates the other social networks more than they used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But is this a poll or is this measuring actual ... Yeah, it's a survey.  So that's what happens. Same thing happens with PBS. Everybody says they watch PBS,  but really they're watching The Bachelorette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This isn't about popularity. This doesn't tell how many people are on Google Plus.  It says the people who are on Google Plus like it better than the people who are on  Facebook or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a survey of 5,000 consumers who responded over email.  And they were asked, what do you use? What do you like? What were they asked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And so the ranking, just so you know, it's based on zero to 100 points.  Google Plus, number one at 81 points. Pinterest, number two.  What's interesting about both of those are both of those social networks did a little  analysis on Google Plus about this. Don't have a lot of ads.  Well, what they have in common is there are areas where ... So think of the clash of argumentation  on social networks like Twitter. Twitter invites people with diverging views to come together and  argue with each other violently. And everybody's sick of that. And so I think they're taking it  out on those other social networks. Google Plus and Pinterest are all about people's interests.  And like-minded people, you can ... What you do on Google Plus and Pinterest, and also Reddit,  which is not on this list for some reason, is you find your tribes, you find your communities  of people who generally like the same things you like and who agree with you more or less about  various things, and you interact with those people. It doesn't throw together opposites  so that they argue and bicker and all that kind of stuff. And then if you look at the bottom,  it's LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube. Those are places where people are clashing and arguing  and disagreeing. Not LinkedIn so much. Wikipedia was number three, which is not a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on. Why is it even on here? I think you're onto something, Mike. Because last week we talked  about Kevin Ruse's column in the New York Times, in which he went into 100 secret groups on Facebook  and said, maybe this is the future of civility. But exactly what you're saying, people are finding ...  Now we're going to get the echo chamber argument back again, but it never goes away. But yeah,  you get to find people who share your interest, and there's no reason to argue with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. And I think the news and discourse has been poisoned by weaponized information,  by fake news, by propaganda, by all these crazy people screaming at each other and trying to  distance the public from other members of the public. It's very divisive, and everybody's  kind of sickened by it. And if you go to some of these other places where you can just pursue your  interests and talk to people who are rational, it's a beautiful ... It's better. And so the fact is,  the Google Plus isn't as good as it used to be when it ranked lower. Google Plus has gotten worse.  Several other social networks have gotten worse, and several social networks have stayed as bad  as they've always been. But more or less, the places where people are bickering and arguing,  and where there's trolls and harassment, their ranking, the social networks, their satisfaction  of the users is lower. And I think it's not because of the qualities of the social networks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's because of the decline in civil discourse. Here is an article, which is probably a little  stingy to Facebook right now after their big announcement. Facebook worker living in garage  says to Zuckerberg, you don't need to travel across the US to learn about people's hopes and  challenges. Just talk to your cafeteria workers. This guy works at the Facebook cafeteria,  apparently struggling to make ends meet. A little wealth inequality right there in Lotusland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And their house, by the way, and this is a true story, is smaller than the giant vault Zuck built  underground where he keeps all those Scrooge McDuck gold coins and his big treasure chest.  Does he really have a vault? No.  He must. Come on. Wouldn't you have a giant, richy rich vault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd have one of those safe rooms that you go into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have the swimming pool full of gold coins that have little dollar signs on them  and just swim in it. That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a bad job. They both work there, Victor and Nicole. Nicole makes $19.85 an hour.  He makes $17.85 an hour. The problem is that they live in Silicon Valley. That's actually good pay,  but they live in Silicon Valley and you can't live on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are places in the Bay Area that are so out of whack. I think in Marin it is that if you're  below $100,000 a year, you're in the poverty. They have lived there their whole lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, when they were growing up, his father was able to buy a small house there from his earnings  as a landscaper. When they first got married, they were earning 12 bucks an hour as Chipotle managers.  They had their own apartment, but then Facebook moves into Menlo Park and they have to live in a  garage because that's the best they can get. Facebook is planning to build new apartments,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  including low-income units, but they can't build enough. It would be interesting to see companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like Amazon and Facebook, and I think they're moving in this direction, create basically  company cities. Isn't that what Foxconn does? It's creepy. Oh, my soul to the company store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. You have to buy. That's also breaking news. What's that? They're going to build a U.S.  plant. They're going to build an American plant for 10 million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Donald Trump tweeted that Apple had promised him that he was going to build three big, beautiful  plants in the U.S. At least one of those was real. Maybe there are more coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just love how the president is taking credit for Apple's. They've moved stuff to the U.S. before.  And he thinks that if you bluster, then everything moves. I did it all. But I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this news is timely. It's right after the tweet. Apple's immediate reaction was no comment.  Apple did, you remember, famously try to do an assembly of the Mac Pro in Texas that failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also failed was, remember, their factory where they were going to build Sapphire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and they got sued by the company. They sued the company or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they built the whole factory and then they ended up closing and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But is that a statement on the quality of American workers or the cost of American workers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's supervisors. The U.S. cannot produce enough factory supervisors with the education and training  and engineering training. We're maxed out on engineers. We need to import more engineers,  more programmers. That's the kind of thing. You can get lots and lots of workers if you pay them  enough. But it's like that's what China has that the U.S. doesn't have. It's just legions of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  trained managerial level engineering talent. So this is Foxconn, not Apple, but Foxconn, of course,  makes the iPhones. Foxconn wants to build a factory in Wisconsin. They did the same.  They've been thinking about that for years. They did the same in Brazil because Brazil had high  tariffs and the only way to make a reasonably priced iPhone in Brazil was to manufacture it  there. Apple is going to do the same in India. India also has very restrictive rules about what  non-Indian companies can sell in India. But there's not that kind of pressure in the U.S. yet.  So they're going to build a $10 billion manufacturing plant with 13,000 jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all about jobs. There's 13,000 jobs a lot for a factory that size.  What makes it possible to manufacture in the U.S. is robotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember, the Foxconn replaced 13,000 workers with robots in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not so long ago.  They're going to get ahead.  And they're thinking long term. So even if you hire 13,000 employees, it's kind of like Uber  drivers. They're essentially just training Uber self-driving car technology. That's what they're  a placeholder until the self-driving cars hit. Same thing with any sort of factory you build in  2017, 2018. You're essentially building a factory that will sooner rather than later be mostly  robotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I correct myself. Foxconn replaced 60,000 workers with robots in China. 60,000.  All right, let's take a little break. We'll have more. Mike Elgin is here. Digital nomad,  Mike Elgin, the world traveler. You can find more about him and what he and Namira are doing at  gastronomad.net. Their next event is in Barcelona in September. You're going to do  Fez Morocco after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a bunch lined up, Leo. We're going to do Italy. We're going to do France.  We're going to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to put me down for Italy.  You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously, where in Italy, you think?  Prosecco Hills. That's what we were doing.  Put me down.  Yeah, you're going to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put me down for Italy. I don't care when or where. I'm there. Well, I know where. Aaron  Newcomb is also here. He's at New Relic these days. You can find him on the Twitter at Aaron  Newcomb. He's, of course, the founder and runs the Benesia Makerspace. It's going great there.  Doing well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. In fact, we just opened up another 1200 square feet for classroom space and  dedicated electronics work areas that can be hopefully a little cleaner because they were  in our other shop with all the woodworking and metalworking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's where the future of manufacturing in the United States is going to happen,  is people learning these skills in hackerspaces. I think that's awesome.  That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What you're really doing there is, I think, a little bit towards what Mike was saying is that  you're teaching people how to be innovators, right? Not just workers on an assembly line,  but you're teaching them to think critically and to come up with new ideas. I think that's,  again, getting the knowledge and the confidence to be able to do that is where the future lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun. It's a great hobby. Aaron is a regular on many of our shows. In fact,  we've got to get you back. We had you scheduled for the new screensavers. You couldn't do it,  but let's get you back in soon. I would very much like to get you on and talk about your latest  making projects. Also, all the way from Australia, where the sun is just coming up on Thursday  morning, Jeff Jarvis is, of course, a blogger at buzzmachine.com and at Twitter is at Jeff  Jarvis. Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom. Summertime is here, the time for family vacations,  sunscreen, barbecues, but, and I know nobody wants to think about it, it might be a good  thing this summer to prepare for your family's future with an estate plan from LegalZoom. You  see it's National Make-A-Will Month next month. Perfect time to make sure you're prepared for the  future. We did this. Actually, Lisa did this and it was great. You get a great kit, all the forms  you need, and then if you need legal advice, LegalZoom is not a law firm, but they have put  together a really nice network of independent attorneys now in all 50 states. They finally got  to those last few states.

Elon Musk said  AI ought to be regulated. Last week we talked a little bit about Rodney Brooks, who's the creator  of iRobot and is a professor of robotics at MIT. He might know a little bit about AI. He says,  all the people want to regulate AI, don't work in AI. He said, what does Elon want to regulate?  You know what you ought to regulate? Self-driving Teslas. That's what you ought to regulate.  Now Mark Zuckerberg weighs in and he says, Elon's views on artificial intelligence  are pretty irresponsible. Why is Mark weighing in on this? Does he have something up his sleeve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're working on AI. They want AI replacing their algorithms in the future so that AI can  just figure out what you see, what you don't see, figure out the advertising. AI's can be huge  in the world of social networking and he's counting on it to be competitive. Also, by the way,  Facebook has amazing face recognition. That's based on AI, machine learning, and it's incredible.  It's better than the FBI's. They can recognize your face even if your back is turned. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's your head. Zuckerberg says, and I kind of agree, this is like what you've talked about in  the past, Jeff, with the techno panic. He could have been taking this out of the Jeff Jarvis  playbook. People are arguing for slowing down the process of building AI. I find that really  questionable, says Zuckerberg. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. As an example,  he says one of the top causes of death for people, car accidents. If you can eliminate that with  self-driving cars, that's going to be a dramatic improvement in people's lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any technology can be misused. That's what Zuckerberg says. It doesn't mean you should control it.  Yeah, the irony here is it's techno panic from the most technological person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably we have. Elon Musk. Meanwhile, Elon says, Mark Zuckerberg's knowledge of AI's future is  limited. They're kind of in a little pissing match. Cue the cats, please. Cue the cats.  Of course, Elon's never been shy, like Steve Jobs and others, of saying somebody's stupid if he  thinks they're not as bright as he is. And in unrelated news, Elon Musk's news feed is empty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and his posts are not going to any of his friends. I wonder if Musk has a Facebook page. He's got it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? That's the thing. He's got it. Everybody has to. But isn't that, I mean, with him going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to the governors and saying they should start legislating and all this kind of stuff, isn't  that kind of like calling fire in the theater? I mean, I agree with those Mark included that have  said, like, that is irresponsible. Like, why would you say that? This is something that's,  you know, in its infancy, and it's something we can definitely control. It's okay to raise a concern,  but don't go to governors and say, start legislating this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because those are the people who will, first of all, can and don't have and truly don't understand  it. And we'll listen to somebody like Elon Musk and say, Oh, we better do something right now.  Brooks point was, Rodney Brooks at MIT's point was, well, what are you going to regulate?  Either something exists or doesn't exist. And since it doesn't exist at this point,  he also says anybody who does AI knows it's not that smart. It's a long way to go.  Elon's response to Mark Zuckerberg's crack. I've talked to Mark about this. I love this.  I need a voice for this. His understanding of the subject is limited.  Wow. What a snotty tweet. All right. Well, it's it's there's nothing to say here except  And I think I think we are in agreement that it's it is. It is like cost crack

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  crying fire in a crowded theater. Yeah. It also reminds me remember, I think it was I  think it was Warner Brothers. I think I think it wasn't it many, many years ago when when this is  a great anecdote, I forget which book had it where the Google guys, the founders were Warner  Brothers and Warner Brothers basically said, don't ruin advertising. You're messing this up.  Yeah. Well, too late. They ruined it. I went to an event in Washington last week,  where there we were trying to the Americans in the room were trying to basically convince  the Europeans to stop trying to regulate speech. Good luck. Well, Google has responded to remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we talked about the Canadian court that said Google had to strip libelous posts, postings that  the Canadian court considered libelous had to strip those postings not just in Canada, but from the  entire Google search worldwide. Google has gone to the ninth district court in California  to get that overturned. They asked the judge they said they told the justices that the Canadian  case's outcome runs counter to America's First Amendment. And so Google's asking the US judges

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to reject the findings of the Canadian court. I'm not clear what the outcome would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there an international court that adjudicates this kind of stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but he didn't go to that. He went to judge in the US. So let's say the US judge agrees and  sides with Google, then what? Then what? Because basically, you're talking about Canadian law and  they can take action against Google's activities in Canada. That's their leverage. That's their

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  only leverage. But this is the world where we are now. Right? This is where Google is going to pit  nations against each other in a Japanese monster movie, Fight in Tokyo Bay here and stand back and  watch. But does the nation have the same authority that it had in a truly international world?  It does not. That's why we're seeing the rise of nationalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does within the nation. What Canada is not allowed to do and shouldn't be allowed to do,  in my opinion, is overrule the First Amendment in the United States.  You can drive to the Google campus from here in like an hour and a half.  If I'm going to Google to get information about what is actually on the internet,  not a censored version of that, but what's actually on the internet, which again isn't  entirely true, but what right does a foreign government have to step in between me and Google  in a country that has the First Amendment? I say they have zero right to do that.  It's also cowardly on the part of the Canadian judges doing this and the Canadian government  people who support this. Because if they want to be censors, they can build a great firewall of  Canada and they can censor the internet, just like China does. Stand up and take your lungs.  If you're a censor, you're censoring. Don't have Google do your dirty work.  Exactly. Again, the slippery slope argument is obvious. China is going to decide that nobody  in the world can talk about Tiananmen Square and Russia is going to decide, etc. Forget about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Mike, what's going to happen I think is the doctrine that Google and Facebook want,  I think here is, whether we like it or not, we will follow local laws locally.  I think what they're trying to get is the United States Court to say,  thinking about the First Amendment though, is it's about government censorship. Here's the  really weird thing about it. It's about American government censorship in America.  Yes. But if they can say, listen, we've got two countries with two different rulings,  we're just going to follow each country unto itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Canada wants to punish Google financially with fines or whatever, then that's the course it has  to take. If Google actually agrees with this ruling and actually performs that censorship,  I'm moving to Bing. That is outrageous. They cannot do that. If money is so important to them  that they would do that, then I'm willing to use a search engine that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also a French case, a right to be forgotten case in France that Google is appealing to a  European court. Of course, they've lost before, but I think that's what it was. I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mentioned Bing. That's the other bizarre thing about this ruling. It doesn't apply to Bing or  other search engines. Only one company, even though these links exist on the other search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of laws overturning state, national laws overturning laws of other lands, how about  a national law that overturns the laws of mathematics? I like it. The Prime Minister  of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, says, let me find the exact quote because it's pretty funny. He was  challenged on whether it was possible to crack down on encryption because, well, the encryption  is governed by the laws of mathematics. You can't really stop that from working. You can try.  Turnbull said, well, the laws of Australia prevail in Australia. I can assure you of that. The laws  of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Australia. I think they should start with overturning the laws of physics because those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are more dangerous than the laws of mathematics. Australia is one of the five Is and of course,  I'm sure this will happen in the US. England's done it. Australia is proposing something similar  to the English Snuper's Charter, which would force companies to hand over the clear text  contents of encrypted messages on their services. The problem is, of course, if they don't have the  clear text, they can't do that. So the only way to adhere to that law would be to break the encryption  to put a back door in. So we'll see. Or to disallow encryption. Yeah, to disallow it,  to say there's no encryption or we're going to hold the keys and if we're asked, we'll give them  the information or we'll give the government a back door, all three of which have been proposed  by various governments. What a surprise. I'm sorry, Prime Minister, but you can't overturn  the law of mathematics. It's just, it's not that kind of law. You should overturn Moore's law. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that would help. Yeah, it's not just not that kind of law. I'm quite enjoying the, we're not enjoying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but watching with interest since I don't have a dog in the cryptocurrency hunt, the various dramas  that are going on in Bitcoin, you know, the potential forking of Bitcoin. And last week,  you might have noted that the biggest heist in the history of cryptocurrencies occurred  in $31 million worth of ether. That's the currency of the Ethereum network.  We're stolen in a matter of minutes. In fact, it could have been a lot worse, but fortunately,  somebody caught them and analyzed the attack. They couldn't reverse the thefts that had occurred, but  they protected the rest of the wallets. They actually hacked them before the bad guy did.  And so they hacked all the remaining at-risk Ethereum wallets, drained their accounts,  preventing the attacker from reaching the remaining $150 million. Unbelievable.  And that, and then today's story that the SEC has decided that ICOs are  are  regulatable. It's not exactly the same as regulating Bitcoin, but it's a kind of a step down that road.  Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday ruled that some of the coins for sale in the  initial coin offerings are actually securities and therefore subject to regulation. So ICO is a really,  um, it's like an IPO, but for individuals and small companies, right? In an ICO,  which can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks, a company will invite people to buy  digital tokens. Kind of like on Kickstarter or Indiegogo to fund a project, but you do get,  you get some stake then I guess in the company, but it involves blockchain software like Ethereum,  like Bitcoin. Otherwise, you know, the ledger can be tampered with so that you need some way  of making sure that everybody agrees about what happened and it can't be modified.  To take part in an ICO, you send Bitcoin to a website run by the company and then you get  these digital tokens. The tokens, so this is, this is what the SEC wants to regulate is these tokens,  because it looks a lot like stock, right? The tokens give the holder a right to participate  in a, in a, in a pre-specified blockchain activity. It depends on what the company  wants to do. The company might say, um, you have to have a token to, uh, join an automated  investment project to get access to certain services or I mean, it could even be to vote  as a shareholder, but the tokens can also be bought and sold, right? I have a token I gave  the Mike Elgin digital nomad currency. I gave you some Bitcoin. You gave me some tokens  that I could sell that to Aaron. And so that is kind of a lot like securities. And the SEC said,  yep, these are indeed securities. So this was actually a part of an investigation to a  journal and company called the Dow or decentralized autonomous organization  that raised 150 million in ICOs last year. It feels pyramid-y, doesn't it? Yeah. And I  think it probably should be regulated. Um, but it did cost a little money to Ethereum holders. The  price of Ethereum went down 10% yesterday on that news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus it also sounds like a mineral you'd hear in the movie Avatar or something. ICO. Ethereum.  Ethereum. I know it does. I like Ethereum. Unobtainium. Unobtainium. So, but you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is not the first time, uh, you know, digital currencies, cryptocurrencies have been stolen.  They're not, you know, they're kind of not that secure. Yeah. Uh, although they seem like they  would be, but, but they're not. Yeah. Yeah. It'd be securable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be securable. And it's a lot less interesting than a bank robbery with like, you know, Bonnie

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Clyde with the Tommy guns. It's also a lot more lucrative. 13 million could have been 180  or 31 million. It could have been 180 million. Yeah. I don't know where you spend this. Did you  read, um, uh, the Silk Road book? No, Nick Bilton's book. I got to read it because Nick's coming on  triangulation pretty soon. It's very good. I heard it was very, very good. Couldn't put it down. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool. I listened to it on, on Audible and it was just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has added SOS alerts, uh, kind of like Facebook safety check, but they've added them to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  search and to maps. The weird thing is that humans are putting these together. It's not algorithmically  determinant, which is like, wait a minute, what businesses Google and I mean, I imagine they  may have a long-term. I think what you're talking about natural disasters, you probably don't want  to trust it to a machine, but then why is Google doing it? I mean, isn't trusting things, what Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess it's valuable information for there's. The reason is it has all these mechanisms to be able  to, um, uh, distribute through maps, through phones, through browsers, through, I think, I think that  they make sense as a great, when disaster strikes is Facebook really the first place you're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to turn? Well, that safety check is cool. I mean, there've been some problems with it and  there's always the issue of if you're in an infected area, you know, there's been a tornado  or tsunami and you don't use Facebook or you don't check in, right. People might think all  they didn't make it. It's not universal enough. This isn't, this isn't really like this. This,  this collates information you might need to know from governments and other authoritative organizations.  Uh, and, and it's, so that's why they wanted humans. It's, it's a curation effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In, in fairness, the, the Google's, uh, past efforts at providing information in certain,  uh, sort of disasters or whatever has been amazing. You know, they're providing maps and  all kinds of, you know, the flu map that they did and things like that. Yeah. I mean, they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're good on data and they will aggregate data from, uh, first responders,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trusted media outlets, government agencies. And if you think about it, the best place for that is,  is on the Google and the Google app, right. With the cards. Right. Oh, I wonder if you'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be in Google now. They mentioned is they say if you're near a major crisis near, you have to be  in the vicinity of it and you search for related words or phrases on Google, you may see a banner  indicating there's an ongoing crisis followed by emergency information and resources such as  useful translations or phone numbers. So let's say you're in Thailand and there's a tsunami,  but you speak English, you search for, uh, what do I do in a tsunami? Right. You could get some  useful information there. If you've installed the latest version of the Google app and your  location, oh, you're right. And your location is turned on. You may also receive a notification on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your mobile devices home screen. That's, that's a good place for it. And I would love for Google  to get more aggressive about putting that screen in our faces better. Yeah. At least take over the  lock screen. Yeah, absolutely. Why not make it optional? Of course. But, but you know, you have  to go find it and that's, it doesn't quite work for that type. I also like this. They're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do it on maps. So if we are looking at a map and we, you know, and there's tornadoes in tornado  alley, we will see, even if we're not there, California, we'll see, uh, some sort of indication  and that there's something going on and there's an alert and you can click it and find out more.  I think that's really useful map information. I like that. I mean, they do it. I mean, they do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  already with Amber alerts, right? I mean, I know that's built into the phone functionality. I,  subscribe to those and that is in your face. Excuse me. It really does get your attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when there's an Amber alert. Right. No, I agree with you. Um, I'm just going to zoom out here,  see if there's anything going on in the world. I mean, a lot of the Facebook things, uh, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they've been touch and go with, uh, with, with their service. It's mostly about reassuring  loved ones that you're okay in a disaster. The world has disappeared. Yeah. No, that's it. Oh,  my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Nevermind. Yeah. Um, and you know, but it's like, you know,  there's a disaster in Australia and Jeff doesn't check in and you know, everybody's like, well,  he had a good run. He was, uh, he had a good life. The only thing he left was good bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there, by the way, this is drives me crazy. See that there, this guy, I'm not going to highlight  it cause it'll show his name in Joplin, Missouri has shared his location. What do you care?  Yeah. Does what did we do about it? Can I just, can I get rid of that? That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause people do that with me. See, here's somebody in England. I get it all the time. I'm like, I  don't, first of all, I don't need to know. And I don't want to see them on the map. If I were in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your family, I might care, but I don't want to see this guy's. Same thing on ways. When ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tells me somebody is driving, how can I possibly use that information? Right.  Trying to be a social network. It's an attempt to be so stupid social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Google should at least give you controls. Like if they aren't in your contact  list, for instance, I don't, they shouldn't be able to add their face to my map. Worst thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about ways though is when it says, um, it makes you confirm that you're not driving. It's like,  what are you, my mother? Oh yeah. Well, I think it probably doesn't do that for local laws and  stuff. That's, that's, that's like, they have to do that. I mean, yeah, they have to Google maps  doesn't when you get in turn by turn directions, same company. Yeah. Ways will now be part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android auto. It's coming soon to, uh, auto. Uh, what is it? Apple's thing, car, Apple car. I can't  remember. Um, did you ever get a car with Android auto, Jeff? I know you. So here's the deal. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, so I, I actually write a post about this cause I, I, I tortured all my friends, including  on Twig about this car. I bought a Mazda CX five, which I absolutely adore. Love this thing.  And I gave up on getting Android auto. I said to hell with it. And then after I got it,  they announced that they're going to port Android auto onto it. We don't have a date yet,  but they've announced that. So I will get Android auto in the car. Yay. Nice. Uh, we're looking,  uh, they'll complain about it and I won't use it and I'll send it back, but you know, I'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Roberto Baldwin, uh, showing how it works on a, this is a Chevy Cruz. Chevy's one of the  cars that has Android auto. Uh, at least it wants to buy a car in the, at the end of the year. Uh,  her lease runs out and on her old car. And, uh, we're really, I would, I, I was thrilled to see  that at least a couple of the cars she's, she wants an electric car. She's looking at having  Android auto. That would be fantastic. Carplay Apple's carplay. Yeah. Yeah. So by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  their instructions for the Mazda, I could, uh, side load Android auto into the car.  Oh, good. Somebody, somebody came up with something for that, but I don't think I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my car. I love, uh, ways. And I think having ways on your dashboard, you could have,  you know, it's Google maps before, I guess apps have to kind of prove themselves,  right? But there is one thing that worries me a little bit. And Roberto is pointing this out  right now. If you, if you look at the dashboard, he's got that ways screen where you can report  hazards ahead. I don't think that that's an example of ways, you know, ways should say,  you can't do this right now. You're, you're, you're driving. Yeah. I mean, I, um, plus, plus it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the stupidest, stupidest alerts, you know, car on the side. Yeah, it was fine. My favorite is  pothole ahead. No S. Well, if there's a big pothole, it does potholes everywhere.  Pothole ahead. I'd want to know. Yeah. And then you get these jerks. It's probably somebody's kid.  You're in a rainy day and they'll say every two miles, they'll say it's rain ahead, rain ahead,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rain ahead. And you can't turn that off. Yeah, I do. I have the thing where you wave your hand  over your phone and then you can say it, but, uh, this is on screen. I don't think they have that  feature in not Android auto. So, yeah, I don't know. I always kind of made, I've tried Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  auto a little bit running it on the phone because you can do that now too. If you don't have the  option of putting it in the car. And it's okay. It's all right. I don't know. I find it just as  easy to keep the phone running the way it is and use it or not use it. Sorry. It's a little bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  though on the screen, right? It's bigger icons, a little bit easier to manipulate. They blow things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  up a little bit, ease a little bit on your phone to make it easier to read. But they also disable  some things that you can't do everything. Right. So yeah, which is irritating. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd rather have a much use Android auto in one car. It just, I gotta say it did after all the  seek desire for me to get it. It irritated me and how much it, and Mike, this is your point,  how much it was a babysitter. Yeah. You can't take that with you. Yep. Yep. Can't take it with you.  It's Jeff. Or what's that commercial now? You're not taking that with you. Andrea Alicia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's it like outside? Let's see. Android users are going to get the latest emoji soon. We're  going to do on Saturday. Our friend who's on the Unicode committee, the emoji committee at the  Unicode consortium is going to stop by talk about, they're talking about new emojis already. They do  it all the time, but notice something about these new Android emojis. They're not blob.  They're circles. Highly controversial. Oh, are you going to miss the blob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think people liked them because it was a differentiator and now they're joining  the herd. But you know, you could actually get your own emoji, Leo, you know, people on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  committee. Right. So well, Tanya, Tanya Hall got a milkshake emoji. She talked to Jeremy and said,  there needs to be a milkshake emoji. It's a good point. And he said, you're right. Now they don't  call it okay, just so you know, they don't call it milkshakes. They call it glass with straw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can decide what's inside. I say it's a milkshake. What would the perfect Leo emoji be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would it be? Well, they already got the middle finger. Let's see.  I don't know. Listen to my show. I don't know. I don't know what it would be.  Do you have you guys? Your guys are all Twitter verified. You got the blue check, right?  Now you can meet other people with blue checks. It's a dating app  for verified Twitter users called blue. Wow. That's a terrible idea.  It's free to join if you're verified. It's rolling out to San Francisco, Los Angeles,  New York, London, and Tokyo. It's only going to go live once it has a thousand local members  in your neighborhood. Only 150,000 people have the blue check mark on Twitter. And most of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  come from the world of journalism and media. Exactly. That's the, I mean, it's that you really  want to meet us. No, you don't. You don't. Actually, actual celebrities, TechCrunch points out like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift probably don't need to date using their Twitter verified status.  But it's, you know, hey, it's an interesting idea. So it's from the same folks who brought you Love  Flutter, which is another, I think, Twitter dating app. Leo, I don't even want to know what that is.  I want to sign up for blue by Love Flutter, but I'm not on the market. And I just want to  see what it, you know, like, could you even meet anybody that way? But I know if I signed up for  it, it wouldn't go over well in my house. Date verified Twitter users. Twitter verified? Get blue free.  Lisa is not verified. She can't get verified. Even though she's the CEO of a major media company.  Behind the camera instead of in front of it. Yeah, it bugs the hell out of her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, yeah, it's I think ostensibly the reason they have verified users is because  people imitate your name. And I petition them actually. I was I was unverified for a long,  long time. There is a form now. Yeah, there is. And even the first time I filled it out, they  ignored it. And then and then I sent them the list of the other Mike Elgins using my profile picture.  And there was dozens of them. Right. I'm like, look at this. This is why you have verified.  And then they verified me. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think that they I was a real Twitter basher for a long  time. And I always suspected that they withheld the verification for that reason. Exactly. And  and then eventually I just demonstrated they're just all these people using my name and profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  picture. And so yeah. So this is you can now date celebrities discreetly.  You've got a blue check. And journalists, mostly journalists, the safest dating community ever.  Do you know what's going on in the tech community these days? Twitter blue tick, you're in. This is  so silly. You know, I'm sure this isn't really about dating. This is about mining something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is about this is about creating an exclusive club and using it a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I think. That's what I think. This is about changing the gene pool.  Yeah. For the worse. What if what if the world were populated only by descendants of blue tick holders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be like Gattaca, but you'd have to have a be verified on Twitter instead of the Twitter says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's taking action against 10 times the numbers of accounts it did just a year ago. The abusive  accounts and it's working. Do we sense that it's working? Any of us? You know, I was listening to  an interview with what's his name? The guy that you were talking about a couple of weeks ago,  Kamal Ananjani, right? The guy in Silicon Valley, right? Oh, right. Right. Yeah. And his new movie,  The Big Sick. Yeah. And he said he was talking about Twitter. He said this was on Fresh Air.  He said, I don't I don't read my replies. And I, I turn he says I highly recommend everybody turn  on the quality filter. The problem that probably works. He doesn't see anything. Right. The problem  with that is he doesn't see it. See, I can't do it. But for him, I guess he doesn't care if somebody's  saying bad things about him. But I kind of like to know. Yeah. Yeah. Dinesh and Silicon Valley.  Yeah. Yeah. And and we're gonna go see that movie tonight, by the way. Oh, good. See that, Jeff,  you were singing his praises. The Big Sick. Which one? The Big Sick. I liked it a lot. I liked it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  lot. And of course, there was kind of a PC response. And that South Asian women aren't presented as  well, because they're the foils in the comedy plot. It's kind of inevitable. But but I think  it's really good. I like sort of their story. Yeah. Emily Viggo. Yeah, yeah, it is. It is. No,  it's charming and fun. And it was great. Charlie Ward. See, um, Dunkirk. Who? Dunkirk. Are you  gonna go see Dunkirk? I saw Dunkirk. And? Oh, you did? Oh, already? What'd you think? Okay, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no spoilers. I was just about to say. Well, I don't want to say how it ends. Yeah, it's very good. I  like Christopher Nolan. He likes to play with time. So there's it's a jumps around in time a little  bit, which I think might confuse people who aren't familiar with Inception and his other movies. But  I thought it was really good. Yeah, it's very well done. It's you know, it's a very  important story of World War Two, but a very small slice of World War Two's history.  And I thought it was very well done. Yeah, the Germans win, but only briefly. Ah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw Wonder Woman for the first time last night. Oh, really? Oh, that's fantastic in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Claire Underwood. Yeah, she's Jenny. She's fantastic. Yeah, Jenny from the hood. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love where we really that we veered all over the place with that one. I love Claire Underwood. Yeah,  Twitter says that it's getting better. But Charlie Wartzel writing in Buzzfeed News  says it's not it's not getting any better. Yeah, there's just as much rude stuff as ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually might have gotten better in terms of their tools and worse because of the election.  So I've noticed that a lot of the vitriol and stupidity is all around the new president.  There's a lot of that. And I don't know if you saw a series of articles that basically talked  about how people are trying to get into the first first replyers. Yes, because they figured the  president will see it. I started that. Have you been blocked yet? I have been blocked by the  president. Yeah, I'm so proud of it. I should get another Twitter badge for that. I got blocked by

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Donald Trump Jr. But I'm still trying to get up to Donald Trump, Sr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You haven't blocked yet. Yeah. No, blocked Chrissy Keegan. Yeah, perseverance. That's the key,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff. But but anyway, I wrote this article for Medium some time ago saying if you get in,  if you reply within the first three seconds, then the president won't see it, but his his fans will  see it. And you can it's a way to reach it to go across the bubbles. And then recode picked it up  and they published my Medium post. And then BuzzFeed did a thing referencing the recode article.  And lots and lots of people are doing it now. It's like the new thing. And but here's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interest. BuzzFeed says it really, unless you're a celebrity or a journalist, you're not going to  get any satisfaction if you report somebody on Twitter. Absolutely. That's the problem. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the problem with Twitter. They're bragging about how their system is better, but they still don't  let people delete replies. They have to be able to. You said this before. This is the key. And they  want to maintain control. So you can beg and plead and they'll basically like you just said, Leo,  they will listen to you or not listen to you based on who you are. It's really a it's really a kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of a bad system. Yeah, that's some really bad examples. The Associated Press just put out a  tweet that the Twitter is not going crazy over. The AP has deleted a tweet about a giraffe being  born because it included a photo of the wrong giraffe. A new tweet is upcoming. Fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fake news. People are loving that. They're loving that. How can you tell one giraffe from another?  They all look the same. I'm not going to stick my neck in on this one. No, I shouldn't say that. It's racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All giraffes look the same. But I do have a prepared statement about this whole area where  people say fake news. Fake news providers do not issue retractions. They don't issue apologies.  They don't do corrections. They deliberately say fake things and then they spread it more.  And that's the difference. So you can't criticize CNN, for example, as fake news when they fire the  people who did it, issue an apology, all that stuff. That's not what fake news organizations do. So  if somebody's issuing a correction or retraction, that is not fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to read a really depressing article, read Charlie Wartzell's article in BuzzFeed News  about Twitter. And there's plenty of examples, not for the queasy, not for the weak of stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what should they do? We've discussed this over the years and I've always said that I love the  open Twitter and the open Twitter enables people to start revolutions. But is Twitter responsible?  If Google and Facebook are each starting to account for quality more, which they say they're  starting to do and I see it happening, Twitter does not at all should Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure what the I'm not sure exactly what the question is, but they make themselves  responsible because of the way that they do reporting. That's on the fake news side and in  making the content better, they're doing that through algorithms, which is another bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what we make it so impossible. Right. Right. So the problem is their default is always to not  take it down because they're Twitter. Right. And pretty much Facebook's default is that too,  but Facebook can then stop promoting it. So at least that helps. But should Twitter have a  should Twitter enact a more a policy that enables people who complain to get stuff taken down or is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that counter to the internet and Twitter ethos? They need to set up mechanisms so that it's self  policing in a way to the greatest extent possible. If they are the ones that look at aimed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it'll get gamed. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Right. Right. And then they have to  trust that. Armies will come in and complain about you, Michael. And you're doomed. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's it's it's problematic because they basically have policies that,  you know, if you're threatening somebody, you get booted or whatever, if certain they added racism,  some other things. But like, what is racism? I reported a whole bunch of people for racism  on Twitter and nothing happens. And, you know, different ideas around the world about what  what that means. But you should be able to craft your own sort of social space on on all these  places and have the replies be under the control of the person who did the post that people are  replying to. And again, I'm, you know, I'm broken record on this issue. But that's really the key  thing. That's Facebook lets you do it. Google Plus lets you do it. Almost everybody lets you do it.  But Twitter doesn't let you do it. Twitter themselves at the corporate level want to maintain  personal control over who gets booted, who you see, who you don't see and all that kind of stuff  through both algorithms and also the reporting system. To be clear, somebody in the chat room,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some idiot in the chat room said this Twitter harassment thing boils down to this. These  journalists and celebs are used to saying something and having it be gospel. They hate being  talked back to, especially by the unwashed masses. But that's not what we're talking about. We're not  saying we want to have criticism banned or disagreement banned. Right. We're saying  vile threats against your person should be, the person should be banned. It's not, it's not.  So we have to read, we want to recapture civility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't even have to be civil. I don't care if somebody's uncivil. But if they, but look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Charlie Wartzel article and see if you think, I'm not showing it now. See if you think those  tweets, I'm not going to show them on the air, are somehow valid criticism. If somebody says,  I have this, I have this gun and I'm coming to your house and as a picture of him with the gun,  that's valid criticism? Hell no. Well, that's a threatening tweet and the guy's account should

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be taken down. But again, these, these threats are, as soon as they ban, successfully ban  explicit threats, then they figure out there's, they're always testing the limits. So it's like,  they learn where the edges are. That's fine. If they stay within the edges, that's fine.  Right. You should be, you know, you should be knifed. Is that different from I'm going to  knife you? I mean, is it, I mean, it's like, it's a fine line. So here's part of what I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  what I think is happening in society. There are these pictures, somebody last week tweeted a  montage of photos of those, of those various people in various parts of the country who did  things like scream horrible racist things at kids birthday parties and parks. Somebody, God bless,  on the internet, videos them and shames them online. And the next thing you see is them crying  their eyes out in court. And I realized it's as if they got transported from a land of fear and hate  back to civilization. Is it, but, but the question is, do you have to go that far overboard  to reclaim your civility, to reclaim decency, to reclaim your sense of humanity? Or, or do we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  intervene before that? By the way, Twitter's quarterly results come out tomorrow. We'll find  out if any of this affects the bottom line. One of the, the only thing the stock market cares about  is how many people use Twitter, right? How many hours you spend. And this is the reason why there's  no incentive for Twitter to do anything about this, because as long as they show growth and  there's more people on it, they don't care what those people are saying on it or how they're  acting on it. Twitter said last quarter they had 328 million users, just as a benchmark. You could  see how that, if it's up or down, that's how Twitter's stock will be. It's currently, Twitter's  stock is up 41% since its low in April. So there, people believe in Twitter. Not sure why. I think  because of the president, frankly. I think if you didn't have Donald, I don't know if there'd be  anything exciting about Twitter these days. Twitter is mostly pretty- He's done more for Twitter than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  probably anything in the last few years, for sure. The funny thing is that it's really not him. It's  the media that has made his Twitter account the center of attention. So let me- Well, but when he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  makes, as he did this morning, announces on Twitter and nowhere else that they're going to ban transgender  people from the military, that's how he makes his executive order. Exactly. That makes Twitter  extremely important and relevant. But it's important- But it- Doesn't matter what the media says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's only the media that's making it into the phenomenon that it is. Let me give you an example.  Former President Barack Obama has massively more followers than the president does, even the combined  POTUS and real Donald Trump accounts. And his average tweet gets far more engagement, far more  sharing, far more likes, all that stuff. And you never even, nobody ever even talks about it,  it's all just bland. Yeah, he's not the president of the United States. But even when he was,  it's all bland, it's nothing unpredictable. Oh, I see what you're saying. And so the media doesn't  talk about his tweets. They ignore his tweets. But the media is the thing that amplifies Trump's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tweets. I never saw Obama's speech to the Boy Scouts or George W's or George HW's, because it was bland,  pablum, be good citizens, go out there. So, but that's where Trump is really excellent at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  entertaining. Well, he's, so here's how I look at it. Here's how I look at it. He's, Trump talks  about how he hates the media. He loves the media. The media is his instrument and Twitter is how he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  plays the media. I mean, this is his lever. No, he's a master of it. But it's not just Twitter,  I got to tell you, he's a master of media manipulation in general, in every way. He uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  his speeches and rallies and also Twitter mostly to get the media to cover him incessantly. But  again, he's not having the impact on Twitter. He's having the impact through Twitter on the media.  Okay. So you don't think he's a benefit to Twitter and its stock price? I don't think he should be,  I do think he is. Absolutely. I mean, he gets every media outlet to talk about Twitter for  starters. I mean, that's really what the phenomenon is. That's all I'm saying. If it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  weren't for Donald Trump, I don't know if Twitter's stock price would be up 41% since April. I doubt it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  would be. I don't doubt that at all. You're absolutely right about that. Google study says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that, I was surprised that this number was so low. Ransomware victims have paid out more than $25  million since last year. I would have thought it'd been a lot higher. Yeah. But- All the hype given

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to it. Yeah. Actually, it's over two years. I think for reality. Yeah. Maybe that's it. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's it. Maybe ransomware is overhyped. Well, some ransomware asks for small amounts. Some  ransomware, the mechanism that they use to threaten is broken. So even if you tried to pay,  that doesn't work. Right. And then a lot of people just don't pay it for one reason or another. So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on Windows Weekly earlier today, Paul Thurotte, pick of the week, Kaspersky antivirus,  the free version. Kaspersky is the Russian antivirus company. It still is a very good  antivirus. I don't have anything wrong with the antivirus. But there's some question about Eugene  Kaspersky and the company itself. In fact, there seemed to be a smoking gun and emails uncovered by,  I think, Bloomberg Businessweek that showed that Kaspersky, the company, worked for the FSB,  the Russian security firm that had written software for the Russian government. So I'm just  curious what you guys think. Aaron, would you install free software from Kaspersky?  No, not at this point. Let alone, I mean, we can set aside the dubious value of an antivirus these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  days. Yeah. Yes. But let's say- Yeah, I get asked that question all the time with all the latest news  about these things is, oh, which antivirus thing should I install? No. No. No. Just keep Windows  up to date and run that if you're running Windows. Or use a Chromebook. That's right. Or use a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chromebook or run Linux. How about that? I don't know. I mean, I don't want to cast  aspersions on the guy if he's innocent. I mean, I've met Kaspersky. Everybody loves-  This is by the way why he gets- He's very smart. This is why he gets a free pass from a lot of  media. Everybody's met him. I haven't met him. But a lot of people met him. Paul's met him. And they  love the guy. Yeah. They love the guy. He's a real charmer. I find charming people to be more  suspicious myself. Yes. Yes. I've always wondered about you, Port. Oh, I'm a Russian spy for sure.  I'm one of those- Frank Underwood. Frank Underwood. Your sleeper is what you are. Frank  Underwood. Very charming. Is that a French name? You're like in the Americans. All right. I  apologize, Eugene. What do you think, Jeff? You know him. Is he a Russian spy? I might trust him

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  personally, but I can't trust anything out of that country. No. And Congress, by the way, has said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nobody is to install Kaspersky products on any computer used. I think in the U.S. government,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would think. And if you can't trust Congress's software recommendations, what can you trust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they also remember they said, what was it? The Commerce Department said no Huawei or ZTE  phones. Let's see. This is from July 5th. Congress casts a suspicious eye on Russia's  Kaspersky lab. Casting Kaspersians. Best Buy loads Kaspersky software on its computers. The Federal  Bureau of Prisons uses Kaspersky. So do many state and local governments.  NPR points out Kaspersky lab is also among our financial supporters. But the House and Senate  Armed Services Committee have approved legislation that would bar the U.S. military from owning or  using any products made by Kaspersky. I don't know what the status of that law is at this point.  Kaspersky lab is used by hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, said Marco Rubio.  To each of our witnesses, the six intelligence agency chiefs speaking to the Senate Intelligence  Committee. To each of our witnesses, I would ask, would any of you be comfortable with a Kaspersky  lab software on your computer? Dan Coats, director of national intelligence. A resounding no from me.  Mike Rogers, NSA director. No. CIA director Mike Pompeo. No, Senator. FBI, acting FBI director  Andrew McCabe. No, sir. Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart. No,  Senator. And to get it unanimous, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency director. I'm glad  we have one of those. Yes. Robert Cardillo. No, sir. I mean, if it was open source, maybe, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because then you could take a look at it, right? But that's, that's why we need open source software  for this kind of stuff. You can take a look at the code and make sure it's okay. And this was before

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kaspersky was offering a free copy to every American. I don't know. You know, it could go  both ways. It could be he wants to, you know, make nice and say, look, I'm a nice guy. Yeah, it could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be, hey, use free software, please take two. I don't know. Could be. We don't know. I think if there is  any nefarious relationship with the Russian government, how that would most likely play out  is that they would have special access to information from that company. And I don't think  it's going to be malware on everybody's devices, turning on the camera and beaming it back to Moscow.  I really don't see that happening. But I, but I do. What if though, what if it had a trojan built

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  into it that could be activated, could be activated in a case of invasion, when the invasion happens,

I feel like in Seattle, but I could be wrong. Nobody knows.  Or maybe, or maybe it's just, oh yeah, she said she was going somewhere. I think, yeah, but it was  just vacation. Yeah, yeah, it was vacation. Yeah. Okay. I forget where. How dare she? Good. Nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has the sound thing been fixed? I think it's not you. It's the software has nothing to do with  what's what's University of technical stuff. Also with this Mike Elgin, highly recommend you  visit Mike's site and find out about the digital nomadic life gastronomad.net. Actually, yes,  it's gastronomad netnet. Sign up for the gastronomad event coming up in September. You still have room?

Our show today brought to you by my fine mattress.  Jeff, you need this. A good night's sleep on a Casper mattress. Casper is an online retailer  of premium mattresses designed and made in the US of A. They're revolutionizing the mattress  industry by cutting out the middleman. No more do you have to deal with resellers or spend that  money on the mark up there. You don't have to worry about a showroom. And they pass the savings  right onto you. Now wait, you may say, wait, Leo, wait a minute. Hold on there. I can't try before  I buy. Well, sort of you can. Because when you go to casper.com slash twig and you buy a wonderful  Casper mattress, and trust me, you will love it. Here's mine arriving in a very compact box. I  already have my jammies on. I really like this mattress. You have a hundred nights to sleep on  it. And if at any time in the first hundred nights you say, yeah, it's okay, but it's not great, or  I want a different one or whatever, you just call them. They come, they take it away and  they refund you every penny. So really you do get to try before you buy. Well, you have to buy it,  but you get to try. And if you don't like it, your money, a hundred percent refunded. It is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it really Casper's back in the rundown. Just to be able to watch this ad.  This is native advertising the way it's meant to be. For those of you not watching a video,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's now a slow motion video of me falling into my Casper. Pretty soon Ozzy, the late Ozzy,  the dog will show up. He likes it too. Do you actually wear pajamas?  Actually, I do. I don't wear those though. Those are just for media. I usually just wear underwear.  I don't have professional pajamas like you, but Casper's, I don't know if they sell pajamas. They  certainly sell mattresses. They are a wonderful kind of mattress. It's a combination of  memory, supportive memory foams that gives you, I don't know how they do it, just the right sink.  Your knobby bits are supported. They sink in. But then just the right amount of firmness.  Just trying to picture what the knobby. Whatever your knobby bits, mine are my hips.  Because I sit by my side and I want them to sink in. But I don't want, I'll get a sore back if the  mattress is too soft. So it's weird, but it's perfect. It's just right. Both supportive and  soft. I don't know how to describe it. And it's by the way, highly breathable.  Smell it. Now some mattresses, you have to air them out for like a week when you get it. This one  used it right away. There was no odor. It's wonderful. It's great for these hot summer  nights. It's really cool. Long lasting comfort and support. And you can buy it online and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  completely risk-free. And I have to add also, there's a lot of emphasis on sleeping, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to work in bed. I do too. And you know what I bought? I highly recommend it. The Casper is  flexible. It doesn't have springs. So you can get one of those motors underneath it that raises  the head up or the feet up. And that works. Yeah, it works great. It works better with the Casper  than with any other mattress because it's flexible. It just wouldn't work with a regular mattress.  Right. Yeah. No, it couldn't. You break it. So the Casper is perfect. And then you can type.  Yeah. That's cool. I love it. I do. I work in bed now. Free shipping and returns to the US and  Canada and now the UK. Good news for those of you listening in the UK. We've been, people complain  because they say, I want one. Go to the Casper mattress site today and you'll save an additional  $50 when you use the offer code TWIG. It's Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twig. The offer code is  TWIG, T-W-I-G. Terms and conditions apply. Casper dot com slash twig. Save $50 on your brand new  Casper. They don't call it Casper the friendly mattress, but they should. They should.  All right, Mike, you're our visiting celebrity. You got a couple of things here. I do. It's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  two different URLs. It's basically, there's a company called Hunter and they have a new  thing called Tech Lookup. This is an alternative search engine. And this is at techlookup.hunter.io.  And what this does, this is a really fascinating thing. This is great for web developers, but  probably for any curious geek. What it does is it enables you to search websites by technology. They  have 115 technologies. And these are not just technologies, but branded plugins. For example,  if they use Amazon EC2 or Amazon S3 or Cache. It can tell what they're using. Exactly. Or if it's  Blogger, if they have Twitter plugins, if they have Google charts in there, if they're using Pearl,  PHP, Python, Ruby, if they have widgets from Facebook or Outbrain. How about if they use New  Relic? You can give it a try, but basically you search for the technology and then you download  it into a spreadsheet and you have all the companies and all the websites and URLs that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are using these technologies. You'll be glad to know, Aaron, 121,000 websites use New Relic.  That's more than that. Yeah, I was just looking that up too. That's the ones. And we're in them.  So you can't say, I wish we could say, what technology is Twitter.tv using?  But it doesn't work that way. But if you know one of the technologies, they should show up on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  list and it'll be a long list. But so this is something that's interesting to certain types  of geeks. If you're not one of those types of geeks, this company has their older product is  fantastic. And I use it all the time. It's basically an email finder. The best implementation of it is  a Chrome browser plugin. And you can get this one at hunter.io. It's a Chrome plugin. And then  you go to a website and it gives you a button. So if you're at a website, you click the button,  it'll show you all the email addresses associated with that domain. Whoa. Yeah. And it gives you,  it ranks them. This is a hacker's dream. Oh yeah. And you can rank them according to how many  references they find on the internet for those email addresses. So you can find the CEO's address  and the customer service very quickly with a single button. Oh, I do like that. That's that's  hunter.io. That's right. And that's free. And, and I've been using it for a long time. I use it to  contact sources. That's a great idea. Would be sources. Yeah. And it works great. And I love  that plugin. One click and you just see a long list of all the email addresses. So I could enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  twit.tv and then find all the associated email addresses. Oh, and they're all blurred out. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what they are. You notice that the 20 sources is this one. This one's 20, 20.  Where are they getting those from? They're references online. They're finding these  on the internet and they're saying, oh yeah, they're, we found 13 examples of that particular

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one that we're looking at. Tickets at twit.tv. Here's all the names of the hosts.  Once you create the free account, then it'll unblur them. Yeah. Yeah. They're blurred. And  I'm only seeing a handful of them. There's 78 total. Well, I'll vouch for this. These are all real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Fantastic. That is very useful. I can see. Yeah. I can see how you'd use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, a number for us. So yeah, I like this one. Remember 11 years ago, I think we  had the show. How long has the show been on? Oh, probably that long. I don't know. Let's see.  Well, this is episode quarter 15. I think we all gasped. Yeah. I think we gasped when Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bought YouTube for 1.65 billion. No, we weren't doing this show when that happened. No, we weren't.  Okay. But I would, I did gasp, but I don't think we were doing this show. Everybody gasped. We all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  got gasped. Now, CNBC, a tech analyst named Victor Anthony said on CNBC that he estimates that if  YouTube were a stock on its own, it would be worth 75 billion. Yeah. And I would say Google  definitely got its money's worth. They did fine. Yeah. It's worth five Twitter's  or it's a 45 X on the investment. And it was all stock. Sweet. So our first episode was August 1st,  2009. Okay. So we will. I thought so. I just thought I had this memory of us saying,  1.65 billion. I must have said it somewhere else. Yeah. It's called false memory syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all did it. It is. So let's see. August 1st is coming up. You know, this, this actually  really is the last episode of our eighth year. Next episode will be the beginning of our ninth  year. Nice. Wow. That's right. That doesn't seem possible. Are you sick of me yet? This is so  happy birthday. This is really our eighth anniversary. We should get some. Our ninth birthday.  Paper hats and confetti. Wow. I'm glad you asked that, Jeff. I mean, August 1st is just a few days  away. Who would have thought who to thunk it. What were we talking about? FCC investigates

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, we're thinking about doing a show about Google. Yeah. Sure. What the heck? Yeah. We were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  FCC investigates Apple and ATT over Google voice app block. Why free works and using canned responses  in Gmail. And just out of curiosity, I just wondering how long the show was. Now, now Google,  54 minutes. That was all must've been a long time ago. The days my friends. But you know what we  still have? We've never gotten in nine years, gotten rid of that. Horrible theme song. Yeah.  It's the worst. The only reason it's still there is I never hear it.  Right. If we had a band, if we had a studio band playing it, I would know what it is.  This week in Google, you throw tomatoes at first. 2009. Lots of people like it. It wouldn't be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a band playing it. It would be traveling minstrels. This show is brought to you by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why I picked it? A, because I could get it. I paid the royalty for it. But B, because I  was going to be you, me and Gina Terpani, right, Jeff. And I thought, well, I wanted a fugue  because it was going to be like a counterpoint, a contrapuntal arrangement between you. And then I  would say something and then Gina, and we would interweave like that. And so I tried to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something that was a fugue. Can you say contrapuntal on this show? Edit that out. Yeah. That's, we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to get an adult tag. Unnecessary, unnecessary censorship. Did you do your, you did do your  number. There was a YouTube purchase point price and what it would be worth. 75. I have more, but.  No, that's a good one. That's a good one. It's also interesting that the parental control app on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google has a number that causes a problem. What number? 13. What? Because, what was it here? Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where was that? Which is the age you have to be. That's the COPPA age of the age of consent under

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the child online protection. I blocked so many kids on Google plus, there's so many kids under  the age of 13. And I post some picture of food, some beautiful food and people are like, that looks  amazing. That looks delicious. And then somebody's like, yuck, that's gross. And I like that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's like a nine year old. If you sign up for Family Link, that's Google's new parental controls.  I didn't even know they had this. At the age of 13, a child can choose to graduate. In other words,  the parent doesn't decide, the kid decides. That's weird. That's the age of majority when  in Google land. That's weird. The minute you're a teenager, bye bye restrictions.  I don't know if that's so, I don't think that's so bad. What do you think? Well, if it over,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if it over rules the parents, the parents are still in charge until 18. But I think Google doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  want to have anything to do with it. Yeah, right. That's interesting choice.  Yeah, it seems young. It's for Android phones only. Don't go looking for it on the internet.  Well, certainly I think parents should assert some control over kids until they're 18. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  good luck with that. Yeah, good luck with that. I've tried it. It doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I use the controls, the parental controls built into the router I use.  One of our sponsors, Eero, and Michael's 14. And I'm there. There are filters on his all his devices.  But you know, kids could get around it because he has a phone if he really wanted so he can get  around it. Aaron Newcomb, what do you got for us? Well, this is something that's not new, new. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was new to me last night when I was doing some research. I don't know, Leo, do you have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tried out any of the eight bit dough controllers? No, I have a switch and I love my switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do too. I love my switch as well. But I use the stock controls. What is eight bit dough?  So eight bit dough has been making these controllers for years that are very popular  among folks like me that like to build their own arcade controllers, for example, or do emulation  because they make these controllers that look kind of like in some cases exactly like the old  controllers. They're Bluetooth controllers and they work with just about anything. Android,  Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi. They'll work with anything. And they're fairly inexpensive.  They look good. They're fairly inexpensive. They usually come with a case. They're well built.  So anyway, they're pretty popular, especially in the emulation crowd. And they released at E3,  they released a new controller and they said, this one's going to come with the right version  of the Bluetooth so that it will work with Nintendo Switch. Everybody really was excited  about that. And at the time I was like, okay, this is all just software though. Why don't they make  this available for all their other controllers? Because they're not changing the hardware, right?  They're just doing something in software and lo and behold, that's exactly what they did.  So if you have one of these eight bit dough controllers, if you've bought one and you want  to use it with your Nintendo Switch, you can. All you have to do now is upgrade your firmware  to version 4.0. And almost all of their controllers are now compatible with Nintendo Switch. So  if you don't necessarily have to go out and get the game controller that you can buy specifically  for Nintendo Switch, you can use one of these eight bit dough controllers. I've got the one that looks  like the old NES controller, except they've added a couple buttons and some shoulder buttons so you  can actually use it with the Switch more effectively. But yeah, good news for people  that have these controllers and they're fun because they're retro, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room is saying, how's the D-pad on these? They feel good?  Do you have one? Yeah, they feel great. Okay. They don't feel cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, not at all. I mean, they're not the highest end quality, but they're pretty nice.  The buttons are solid, they're responsive, the analog sticks are pretty good. So yeah,  I mean, I would highly recommend them. They've been doing some really cool stuff. They come in  a fantastic box. They've done really good. I mean, it seems weird to say that, but the packaging is  actually really nice. Actually, you know, they are, I mean, 42 bucks for the NES 30. That's not cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for something like that. So they should be good. That should be a good, those should be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  switches and all that. Yeah, you can see there they come with, they even come with a little  keychain, which is interesting. It's the wrong controller. They're trying. Yeah,  yeah, they're trying, but I would highly recommend them. And especially now that you can  get support to make them work with the Nintendo Switch. Be great. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friends, we've come to the end of another fine, thrilling, gripping edition  of This Week in Google. Three episodes in one. It was. How so? Well, it's just longer than it  used to be.
