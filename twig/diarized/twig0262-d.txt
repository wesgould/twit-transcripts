Twig, the show that covers Google,  but not just Google, the cloud, the Facebook, the Twitter,  all that stuff.  Jeff Jarvis.  And anything that's irritating me.  That's what we cover.  And anything that pisses off Jeff.  If it's in Germany, anywhere, he'll let you know.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He is the professor of journalism  at the City University of New York.  Book author.  His most recent is called Public Parts.  He's also a blogger at BuzzMachine dot com.  And a man about the world.  World traveler.  Hey, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey there, I just sneezed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's got allergies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kept waiting for Chad to switch to me to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cute.  Oh, now I sneezed on my touch screen.  That's terrible.  Gina is swamped with work at thinkup.com.  Her startup happens from time to time.  But good news, Matthew Ingram is here.  It's always great to have Matthew from GigaOM.  And he's up, but you can tell he's at the cabin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you cut those logs yourself, Abe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I did not.  That was someone a hundred or so years ago.  It's beautiful up there.  It's hemlock, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hemlock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Whole cabin is hemlock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're obviously in New England somewhere, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Ontario, Northern Ontario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ontario.  Doesn't everybody in Canada have a summer cabin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not everyone, but-  Almost everyone.  We certainly haven't, we certainly haven't enough room  if everyone wanted one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Sweden.  It seems like everybody in Sweden has a summer cabin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Robertson Davies,  the wonderful, wonderful Canadian novelist,  always said that Canada is not like America.  It's like Scandinavia.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very similar, yeah.  It's cold a lot of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are friendlier.  They're nicer.  Friendly.  Yeah.  They don't have Mounties in Scandinavia, however.  True.  But hemlock, wow.  Is that, I always think of hemlock as the poison  that Socrates drank.  But that's a tree also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you don't want to lick the cabin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the chat room, Jeff tells us,  hemlock is the hardest of the soft woods.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always just learn all kinds of things here on-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you see Heisenberg, say hi for us.  Yeah, everybody in Michigan has summer cabins.  Michigan, Lake, going up to the lake in Michigan  is a big thing.  It's beautiful, beautiful.  I'm just jealous.  I wish I had a summer cabin.  So, what has been going on in the world of Google?  They've invested $300 million  in an underwater cable to Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So another reason I found that one interesting  was because I've been doing some research on a project  I'm kind of working on, panicky stuff,  and I went through lots and lots of old clips  from the New York Times and from The Guardian  and The Observer on the lane of the first Atlantic cable.  And I was just amazed at the jubilation.  The first cable worked for, the Queen sent a message,  but it wasn't the full message.  They didn't know that.  It took 17 hours to get the whole message across  by the time they fixed stuff.  And then the president sent a message back,  and then word got through the landline cable to New York.  And there were fireworks and parades and jubilation.  Elmira, New York, there were shooting off cannons.  Church bells rang the next day for an hour.  Wow.  Because you could send a did dot across the Atlantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was considered a huge breakthrough,  like equivalent of putting a man on the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was thinking about this.  And I was thinking that one of the mistakes  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter  and all of our dear beloved tech companies  we talk about are making these days.  Is they're not making technology?  Actually, wowie enough.  I think there ought to be a Google World's Fair.  What do you think about that?  Oh, what a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what the World's Fair was originally,  was to show progress?  Right.  I remember going to the 1965 or 64 World's Fair  in New York City.  If you drive out, if you're on the way out to JFK  and you pass a giant globe and some other stuff  that's left over from the World's Fair.  And then you in Canada, you had a Expo 76.  66, 77, 67.  I don't know.  Expo 67, that's the last World's Fair I remember.  Have there been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was five.  I was on five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were only five, beautiful Expo.  Well, I wonder whether,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if Google had something like that,  wouldn't a lot of that stuff terrify people?  I mean, if Google had a World's Fair  and it had driverless cars and all sorts of futuristic stuff,  I mean, a lot of that is kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you think back to the stuff we saw  in the GE Home of the Future and so on,  I think some of it,  and there's a little bit of this left at Disney World.  I know, I think we're just not being,  I think we're allowing the scaremongers and the technophobes  to take over the discussion.  We should be saying at some point, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The next World's Fair is coming up in Milan.  It'll be Expo 2015.  Oh, really?  Well, there you go.  There's no like, it's not the Olympic Committee.  There's no like World's Fair Committee, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I always wondered about that.  No, I don't think.  According to Wikipedia,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they originated in the French tradition  of national exhibit, exhibitions,  the tradition that culminated  the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 in Paris.  Then they moved people in Europe  and the United Kingdom did it.  The best known first World Expo was in the Crystal Palace  in Hyde Park, which still stands.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where the first TV station was set up in London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In 1851?  Right.  No, no, no.  At the Crystal Palace.  No, at the Crystal Palace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say, wow.  So there have been a number of these expositions.  Of course, the Paris Eiffel Tower was built, wasn't it,  for World's Fair, as was the first Ferris wheel in Chicago  in 1893.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Matthew, how about this as a thought?  The point of, yeah, I think that if it says,  uh-oh, look at all the scary stuff we can do, you're right.  If instead it demystified things, it explained things,  it showed you the benefits and the wonders,  it showed you a better world because of it.  Now it's just mysterious technology,  these geeks are doing things we don't understand.  And if it brought it down into life more  and said, here's where we're headed with,  even things that are scaring people like health  and data and health, and here's how information is stored  in search today, and here's how sensors  are gonna change your life, and here's, I don't know,  maybe it's not a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that's a good point.  I mean, they could definitely do,  in fact, all companies could do a better job  of pointing out why you would even wanna do these things.  So why would you want to give all your data to this company,  or why would you wanna log in every time you do X or Y?  Why would you want sensors and everything?  And to give you the kind of, like people are always gonna,  you know, say, well, you could do this bad thing  or this other bad thing, but at least if you talked  about the positive reasons why you might want to  and how it could help your life,  then you could kind of start the conversation off  on the right foot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's been my research that I'm working on,  is that there are people who said bad things could happen  with every technology we've seen.  And so the telegraph, and people who also say,  they put up a paper tiger and say,  well, it didn't change the world,  it didn't bring a world peace,  and I don't know if anybody said it was going to,  but the telegraph was ratcheted up that way  and then shot down.  The funny thing about the telegraph was after all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just gonna say, when you mentioned the telegraph,  it reminded me, I had just seen a news story,  someone posted on Twitter a sort of image  of this news story from the early days of the telegraph,  and they were criticizing it  as speeding up information too much,  and why would we need all this extraneous information  from some far away place?  And there was Adrian LaFrance.  Yeah, and it was exactly the same stuff  people say about Twitter.  If you had just taken out the word telegraph  and put in Twitter, it sounded exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, there must be some sort of need  for higher speed connection between California  and the West Coast of the United States and Japan.  This cable known as Faster will cost in total 300 million.  I think this headline is wrong.  Forbes says Google invests 300 million.  No, it's a total 300 million.  Google invests in a $300 million cable.  Google's investment is not that high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And didn't they just invest it in one  a few years ago, didn't they?  It's interesting.  This is not their first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they invested in other underwater cables, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're interested in the technology,  it is a six fiber pair cable  and optical transmission technology's initial capacity  of 60 terabytes, I'm sorry, terabits per second  with six pairs, because each pair is capable  of 100 wavelengths each, 100 gigabits.  Wow, that's really interesting.  That's a lot of capacity.  China Mobile International, China Telecom Global,  Global Transit, KDDI, and Singtel, the other investors,  mostly Asian telecoms.  NEC, I didn't know this, is it the same NEC,  Nippon Electric, is the top vendor  of submarine cable systems.  They'll be the system supplier.  Google.  I had to get on a printer business.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they also sell the equipment that the NSA uses  with the subs where they tap into the cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, if you're gonna build a cable,  you gotta build that in, it's a lot easier.  That's right, Google subs, not Google, NSA subs.  Do they actually go down to the cable, tap into it,  and then come back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They drop a thing, they drop like a device,  and it attaches to the cable,  and then they just suck the data out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incredible, incredible.  At Google, this is Google Senior Vice President  of Technology and Infrastructure,  Google Fellow Urs Hötzel,  post, at Google, we want our products  to be fast and reliable.  That requires a great network infrastructure,  whether it's for the more than a billion Android users,  you gotta get the plug in,  or developers building products on Google Cloud Platform.  Sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean.  Oh, I like that.  That's why we're investing in FASTA,  a new undersea cable to connect the West Coast.  It's to two coastal locations in Japan,  and the capacity is 10 million times faster  than your cable motor,  me threw that one in,  to Chikura and Shima in Japan.  There are already 200 fiber optic cables undersea,  transport internet data around the world,  carrying more than 95% of trans-oceanic voice  and data traffic.  So you might think it's satellite, but that's too slow.  It's underwater cables.  They carry 51 billion gigabytes a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook has this.  Yeah, so Google invested in Unity in 2011.  Yeah, this isn't the first time.  And SJC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook has done the same.  They have a stake in a underwater cable consortium  between Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore,  Hong Kong, and China.  It's kind of interesting.  I'm not sure why these big companies get involved in this,  but it's kind of interesting.  It will be lit up second quarter of 2016 in the US.  It will connect to hubs in LA, San Francisco,  Portland, and Seattle.  It's kind of neat.  I'm not, it's an interesting thing that they feel  they need to get in this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's not unlike having to be in the,  you know, it's both ends of it.  They're in the fiber to the home business,  and they're in the fiber to Japan business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I understand kind of doing it in the US  to just kind of to kick current ISPs in the butt.  I mean, that makes a lot of sense.  Which is kind of working too.  It is working.  Time Warner and others are starting,  Time Warner Austin's now got 100 megabit symmetric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Austin really has benefited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what they ever have done to that wasn't for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, of course not.  I think Austin among all the cities has benefited a lot.  I guess because it's probably larger than KC, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't mind if I bump in, but you know,  what's that quote to write great software?  You need to make the hardware.  It's kind of how I feel with this in Google.  It's so infrastructure.  They need to make sure that they own  part of the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Chad Johnson, our producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, when you think about it,  the quality of their apps, the quality of their services,  people notice billions of a second  when they're loading pages.  Google's, I mean, that's a huge part of their UI  offering to people is it's gonna be fast,  it's always gonna be there, it's always gonna work.  And if you're using Google now or something  and it's trying to get information  and it's slow because of someone else's network,  that looks bad on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was wrong.  They're also, Comcast and Time Warner  also increasing speeds in Kansas City.  Yes, that's right.  I was wrong.  So it is, it's everywhere, right?  Comcast is having an impact, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found that quote, Matthew.  So far, as the influence of the newspaper  upon the mind and morals of the people is concerned,  there can be no rational doubt  that the telegraph has caused vast injury.  Superficial, sudden, unsifted, too fast for the truth  must be all telegraphic intelligence.  Does it not render the popular mind too fast for the truth?  10 days bring us the mails from Europe.  What need is there for the scraps of news in 10 minutes?  Oh my God!  How trivial and paltry is the telegraphic color?  It snowed here, it rained there,  one man killed, another hanged.  Even the Washington letter has, did,  oh, I can't read the word in that type.  Since the innovation, and I can conscientiously recommend  my own epistles prior to 1844,  in preference of those of later years,  said the New York Times Washington correspondent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the equivalent of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also says that it will be of great use,  cannot be questioned,  but how will its uses add to the happiness of mankind?  Has the land telegraph done any good?  Has it banished any evil, mitigated any sorrow?  Wow.  Is there any consequence that you in New York  should know on Tuesday rather than on Wednesday  that Jones smashed the nose of Thompson in Congress on Monday?  Upon the whole, is any more money gained or lost  by the cotton speculators of New York and New Orleans?  Because they know the variations of both markets  five minutes rather than five days  before their operations take effect.  Is not the anguish of relatives increased  by hearing day to day that the wife or son  has breathed his last, and by receiving 10 days  after the sad details of sickness and death?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just find it interesting that John C. Dvorak  was writing even then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, that's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the New York Times, 1858.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  I think back to my first trip to Europe as a kid.  I was in fifth grade.  It was in 1967.  And we spent the summer there,  and I was so interested in baseball at the time,  and I wanted to know the scores.  And you couldn't get the baseball scores  until like 36 hours later when the Herald Tribune came out,  and they used telegraphs or something  to send the baseball scores.  And now everything's instantaneous everywhere.  So it isn't even just from 1860.  It's from 1967.  I mean, we've seen a huge revolution.  And I don't think anybody would agree at this point  that faster information is worse,  but we do have to learn how to sift  through the faster information.  In fact, all you have to,  a number of people wrote after Robin Williams'  untimely passing earlier this week  that Twitter is now where people go to die, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Kevin, I mean, Matthew,  you had some things to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't you?  And Dylan Byers was complaining about  how Twitter turns into the worst possible place  when people die, people like Robin Williams.  And I argued that it's actually, I find it the opposite.  I know there are horrible things like his daughter  was basically driven off Twitter by trolls and so on.  I'm not saying it's a paradise or that nothing bad happens,  but I actually enjoyed seeing people talking about him,  mentioning movies that I had forgotten about  or mentioning roles that I remembered.  It felt very much to me like standing around  at an actual funeral, talking to your friends or acquaintances  or family members about that person.  I enjoyed that.  It helped me remember what I liked about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel so bad for his daughter, Zelda,  but I think you're right.  And trolls, just what are we gonna do about this?  This is so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is terrible, no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I found, I guess, Matthew, I go through a cycle on it.  On the one hand, what's gonna happen  when something horrible like that happens,  and I found I was a great fan of Robin Williams  and remember him from his days on stage in San Francisco,  and I kind of couldn't read it.  So at first I knew what was gonna happen,  as everybody discovers, he died, he died, he died.  Okay, we know, we don't need you to be the town crier on this.  Then there were personal reactions back,  which like you, I do appreciate.  And then comes the media overdose.  We couldn't go anywhere where they're rehashing  the same thing, and the basic single bit of news is,  this tragic moment, he's dead.  That's the news.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually, it got even, I mean, one of the things  I mentioned that I didn't really get into was,  after the, oh, he's dead, and the sort of mourning,  then came the press conference,  and police effectively giving-  Horrible.  You know, really horrible details about-  Horrible, they gave out his street address,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and details that were just not for public consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I heard all morning Joe this morning.  Yeah, I mean, it was Andy Carbon at one point said,  Andy Carbon said, you know, they're basically,  this is basically, the police press conference  is basically how to, you know,  it gave so many details about the suicide,  which is generally frowned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not the, yeah, in fact, there were,  one of the things social media did so well,  Jenny Jardin on Boing Boing referred,  and a lot of people subsequently referred to a document  about how to communicate about suicide,  to try to minimize the contagion factor,  because there's a strong contagion factor.  I think in total, I mean, obviously there were trolls,  and there was some horrible stuff,  but the worst people were the media people,  not the social media people.  Agreed.  Mainstream media, and the police were far worse.  ABC setting helicopters over his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was ridiculous, and on morning Joe this morning,  they complained that there was a story on ABC  about family asked privacy respected,  and then a link went out of any fact,  go see video right now from over their house.  Right, see video of the house.  No news value whatsoever.  Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing I did find interesting,  apart from all the bad stuff,  was because he had fought depression and addiction  for so long, and because he committed suicide,  there was a lot of people talking about depression,  talking about suicide, talking about how to deal  with those things, talking about steps you can take,  or places you can go.  That kind of thing is actually hugely valuable.  It very rarely gets talked about in public,  and so I thought that was a big benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's hope.  One issue with it coming at a time of death  is that we tiptoe, and The Guardian had a piece  this morning saying that suicide is not a selfish act,  and as I think about his children,  I'm not sure that I agree with that,  but one can't say that.  Especially in America, there's a time of,  in UK they do pretty blunt obits  that bring up people's faults.  We don't believe in doing that in the US.  In Canada, you're always nice, so that's the way you are.  And so there are some difficult things to talk about too  that you don't say because of the respect of the past.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the 140 characters eulogies,  kind of, on the one hand, it's really great  to see the outpouring, right?  And to hear what other celebrities,  their memories, and so forth,  but you can't say that much in 140 characters,  but at least it's something.  I think it is at least initially a chance  for everybody to express how they feel about it.  Yes.  And to get together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember some of these issues came up when I,  it was a couple of years ago, a friend of mine died,  a close friend of cancer, and he was in the media  and was a heavy user of social media,  and so I, on the spur of the moment at his funeral,  I decided to live tweet his funeral.  And in part, it was an experiment,  but actually in part, it was a tribute to him  because he was such a big user of social media  and he was always experimenting  with different ways to use it.  And I got a lot of, the funny thing was,  I got a lot of support and I got a lot of criticism.  A lot of people said it was not appropriate  and it was kind of just unseemly.  And then I had a lot of other people,  including family members of his,  who couldn't make it to the funeral,  who said, thank you for doing this  because we weren't able to sort of participate.  And so we got a window into those events  through you tweeting.  So to me, it showed how there is still a lot of resistance  to that sort of thing,  but how there's also a lot of benefits  that can come out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if you may tweet,  I wanna go run record right now, Jeff and Matthew,  you may tweet live or otherwise my funeral.  I encourage you to do so.  And we could have a live stream.  Just don't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We will wear Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, wear Google Glass.  Well, you know, here's the question  about your digital will, and this has been talked about.  I suppose one should put in a safe place  one's passwords and such and digital wishes  so that one's family could do with my blog what I want  and get into my Gmail and such and so forth, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, aren't there sites that do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was one, we talked about a year ago  where if you didn't post something  within a certain amount of time,  Brian Brushwood did that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't that a Brushwood that he has a site in the feed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the idea is if he dies,  if you don't hear from me,  what it'll start to do is it will start to,  instead of giving away passwords,  it'll just start to retweet and redo everything  that he did the last year.  So it's a digital ghost.  It keeps him alive.  It keeps him alive.  It's a digital ghost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daniel Suarez's Daemon, which is a wonderful novel  the premise of which is that a brilliant programmer  and game developer creates a Daemon  that is inserted into the public internet  upon his death and it does all this stuff.  It comes, basically it comes alive on the net.  We don't yet have that technology.  I know, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Google has the built-in,  you can give an address or email address  and phone number of the person you want to be notified  if there's a lack of activity in your account.  I think it's Gmail.  That was new, yeah.  Yeah.  Is it a LAMP thing?  Did you do it?  Not sure, yeah, I did.  And so if you don't log in for a certain amount of time,  it notifies some next of kin.  Pretty sure that's how it works.  I forget what it's called though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember when they announced that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to leave my blog up  but turn off all the damn comments.  I will not be trolled in death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just need a bot that can reply on your behalf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Public Policy Blog,  plan your digital active life  with Inactive Account Manager.  Inactive Account Manager.  It sounds like an April Fool's joke.  Inactive, so search for Inactive Account Manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least they didn't call it Dead Account Manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems morbid and nobody wants to think about it  but you make a will.  I mean, there comes a time when you...  Sure.  Especially Jeff, you and I,  as we approach our later years,  where you start thinking about this.  Although it could happen to anybody as we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually I've thought about,  I've got probably 30 gigs of data on Amazon's AWS  and on a bunch of photo services  and it's all password protected.  If my family wanted to get any of the photos  that I've taken for the last 15 years,  get the actual original copies,  they'd have to get into those accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm looking at it right now  and you can either have it alert you before they delete it.  Are you dead yet?  Dead yet.  Right.  Your timeout period could be a month  but you could set this...  A month of no mail, is that what it is?  Of you not logging in.  And then you could set it up to 18 months.  Then you can add notifications  so you can notify...  I wanna do this.  And then optionally you can just delete your whole account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll just get rid of it.  See, I don't know if I wanna do this.  Now I use LastPass,  so all I'd have to really do is give my next of kin  my LastPass password.  Or maybe an attorney or if you're paranoid,  split it up half to the attorney,  half to your next of kin,  put it in your will.  And then in there you could have a LastPass secure note  that would say what your last wishes are.  I think the inactive account manager is not quite right.  So the idea mostly of that is to just  to delete your account after...  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's an optional.  You can optionally delete it  but you can notify all your contacts to give you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny they say,  what happens to your account when you stop using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can share here, add a trusted contact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a nice way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can give a loved one access basically.  Yeah.  You can also end up in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I might just be in jail.  My account will time out.  I don't think there's a jail setting.  You could add up to 10 trusted friends or family members.  This is good.  And you could,  I wonder if can you create an email  that should be sent up upon your death?  That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be a good feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're reading this,  it's because I haven't logged in a Gmail in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I want, Leo?  What?  I want a tweet funeral.  You could tweet...  I want a tweet memorial service.  For me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for you or for me too, I want my own.  You would want that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should get this all on record.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is on the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is on the record now.  If deaf, whoever, actually it's kind of depressing.  Robin Williams did this with Louis CK.  If ever, whichever one of us pre-expires,  the other will live tweet the funeral.  Done.  Oh, and don't...  This is good.  Dr. Mom, you're thinking, she says,  remind people not to deactivate the phone of the dead person  in case of second factor authentication.  That's right.  Keep the dongle alive.  I would imagine, I don't know,  but there are a lot of loved ones.  I mean, look, when you pass away,  there's a lot of cleanup anyway, right?  But I would imagine a lot of loved ones,  this is just one more area of cleanup.  Facebook has a process.  Facebook actually, I think handles it well,  where if you pass away,  your next of kin can notify Facebook,  and they'll take your Facebook page  and turn it into a memorial, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is good because then it doesn't,  this happened to me with this friend who passed away,  once it's memorialized,  it doesn't show up in the sort of recommended things  because at one point, this friend's page showed up  and it was like, your friend's having a birthday.  And I was thinking, I'm pretty sure he's not.  So maybe you could stop showing me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel so bad for Robin's daughter.  There were trolls posting unpleasant images  and terrible comments.  Initially, she asked her supporters to report the trolls,  but then she realized that was a mistake  and decided it was better for her just to delete  her social media accounts entirely.  She did not, she says, she posted on Twitter,  I'm sorry, I should have risen above  deleting this from my devices for a good long time,  maybe forever time will tell goodbye.  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is just awful.  At a time when she could have received support  and recognized the alarm for her father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Horrible, horrible people.  And I'm sure most of the traffic was supportive and loving.  Yep.  But then these sad bent people,  it's just, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and the other thing that happens,  I don't wanna give the guy any attention,  but I had an episode this week of trolling  where someone used my identity to go after somebody else  and affected my reputation.  And what's really equally disturbing  is the people who then egg it on  and take their responsibility for what they're doing.  And I said to someone-  Well, that's just trolling and then it's trolling too.  Exactly, I said there was someone  from a very large important newspaper  or a very large important job there  who was gleeful about this trolling of this person.  This prominent person,  this prominent person who thought that I was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait till it happens to you, big shot editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  So I went back at him today and I said,  egging on the troll is trolling itself.  You're an accessory to the crime.  And I said, by the way, why don't you say the things  that you just said straight to the face of this person?  And I put that person's Twitter handle in there.  Come on, big shot.  You wanna talk about how you don't like the person  and how you're encouraging the troll?  Go ahead, you have any fa hungas?  It's just depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, so sad. And unfortunately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a lot of these things start  because it's seen as funny  or it's people just looking for lulls  as they call it on 4chan.  And then it just escalates  because everyone's trying to one-up the other person.  And then eventually it just descends into,  the most horrible thing possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where Gina was talking about this problem  and with Twitter and I see some movement now,  and I think you wrote about this too, Matthew,  or you linked to something about the,  of having shared blacklists.  That could turn ugly too,  but if the people you care about and you trust say,  I'm muting this person  and I wanna, I would trust a list of who you two muted.  And you might have personal individual reasons,  but probably that's a good indicator that says,  let's just give them no attention  because the one fuel to the troll will tension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even blocking them though is fueling them  to some degree, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they know they've been blocked.  I did write about that.  So Glenn Fleishman wrote something for Boing Boing  about this idea and I was discussing it with him  and then wrote about it.  And it does have a lot going for it.  I mean, the one big benefit is,  you don't have to rely on Twitter  to figure out who to block or ban.  This is a much more sort of crowd sourced,  different groups can have their own shared lists.  So it's not like a master list of who's blocked.  It's different groups can come together and create their own.  My fear is that those things can in themselves  become tools of harassment.  So the, for example, vice,  someone wrote about being added to one of these block lists  and I'm trying to remember her name now,  Caroline Criado Perez.  A British journalist, she was harassed on Twitter  and was quite critical of the way Twitter handled it.  She's actually on a blocked list  because she posted something  that someone thought was offensive towards transgender.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, people should be allowed to collude  in who they don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, sure they should.  My only fear is that it's, if it,  I mean, it's a double edged sword,  I guess is my point.  It just makes me nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I liberally use the block feature of Twitter.  It's the best thing in the world.  And yes, I know others are seeing these,  I'm not and as, you know, out of sight out of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To a great extent, Leo,  but that was the problem with my episode is that I,  I've long blocked this person.  And then I saw that there was notoriety going on.  If it hadn't reached a level of notoriety,  I wouldn't have realized how this trolls victims.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's the argument against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was such a terrible person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knowing what's going on,  that's the argument against blocking  is your ignorance is bliss,  but you don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so I immediately tweeted to that prominent person  and I said, this person's not me.  And he was gracious and came back and acknowledged it  so that I know he now knows somebody I know,  somebody I've met, I have common friends,  a prominent person.  And, you know, it's just, it just goes over the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting.  He knew, he understood immediately though  what was going on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, he didn't.  That's the point.  See, that's the problem.  He went attacking back saying, you know,  what a slime ball you are to say these horrible things.  And he thinks it's me.  And people, well, you can see that it's not  the real accounts.  Well, he's not, there's no obligation to him  to go look for my red, my green check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not sophisticated enough to know  that these things happen.  And it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody's going after him.  When somebody's going after me, I just want to get away.  I don't want any on me.  So I'm not gonna go spend time to investigate.  That's a bogus standard.  And it was just playing out now trolling.  It was somebody attacking this person  and this person thought it was me.  And, you know, I just, it goes over the line  and I've just had it.  I've more than had it now.  And, you know, fine, have fun.  I don't want to be accused of having no sense of humor  and so on, but, you know, trolling people.  Somebody said that this prominent journalist  said of this important person,  well, some people just, you know, deserve to be trolled.  I said, that's like saying someone deserve to hit and run.  No one deserves to be trolled full stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what do we do about it?  I like this idea of collaborative lists.  There's no facility that,  there's no feature of Twitter that facilitates this,  but we could easily just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Matthew's point,  there shouldn't be a reversal blacklist  because then, you know, you'll just find  somebody you don't like on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if Glenn and Matthew want to send me  a list of people that you don't follow,  I'll send you a list of people I don't follow.  That's a good start, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and you see- And so Glenn mentioned,  there's a service called The Block Bot,  which is the sort of most developed.  And then there are a couple of other projects  that are trying to do similar things.  So you could share a block list  and it would integrate with Twitter or with Tweet Tech.  And so if you agreed to opt into this list,  then certain people would automatically be blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always look for a technological solution  to these kinds of problems that were spawned,  in fact, by the new technologies  that allowed people to do things they couldn't do  or couldn't do as effectively before.  I mean, I'm sure there've always been trolls,  but that's a good way to handle it.  Let's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another one is on comments on Disqus,  and I think on WordPress as well,  when you see, they'll give you  a high level of suspicion index.  I almost want that.  If I see somebody who's being an a-hole in Twitter,  and if I can see a little mark that says,  how many of your friends are blocking this person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm joining The Block Bot.  That sounds like a really well-done idea here.  And it has a list of a lot of blocks.  Oh, you could see who's blocked on here.  Holy cow.  That's the problem.  This is Sisyphean.  I mean, you're never,  it's so easy to create a new account on Twitter.  Oops, sorry, I just closed it, sorry.  It's so easy to create a new account on Twitter  that this is only of limited value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is also a universal list, right?  Right.  That's not-  Yeah, I got a problem with that  because that can be gamed so easily.  Yeah, I don't want to block people  because they don't like Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  I want to block people that don't like me.  Right.  All right, well, good conversation as usual.  This is the show for deep philosophical discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, geez, yeah, death and trolling, geez.  And the confluence thereof,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the intersection of death and trolling.  That's the internet.  There's the internet in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you've noticed,  but I'm using a Lenovo Chromebook right now.  This is something we're reviewing.  How much is that one?  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much is that one, do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is one of the cheap ones.  The only difference is it has a touch screen, which is okay.  It's not, the problem is with cheap hardware,  it's not responsive enough to be a satisfactory experience.  And so what I did, I sat down with it last night,  I was using it, and then I switched back to the Pixel  just to experience, and this is why I think you like  Chromebooks so much, Jeff Jarvis, you're using the Pixel.  Yeah.  That you can't even buy anymore,  even if you wanted to spend $1,200, you can.  Oh, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  $1,200, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With LTE, $1,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than a MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a damn fine machine.  And I didn't have to buy any more software for it,  don't forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As an example, we were looking for a machine  that had keys that light up.  The only Chromebook with keys that light up is the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you need keys that light up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, the person likes to type in the dark.  Yeah. Oh, okay.  This is- I find it really handy.  Lisa wants to give a Chromebook as a gift to an adult friend,  and that's one of the criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you shouldn't, Leo.  I already have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We feel that Jeff needs more Chromebooks.  But the problem is right now that except for the Pixel,  all of these are pretty much cheap netbooks,  and you don't have a great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Acer-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This new Acer 13, it's not available yet, I've pre-ordered it.  It's 1080p, 11 hours battery life,  that's the best I've ever seen on a Chromebook.  It's not that expensive, $379.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the higher end, it's a $279.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the higher end with the four gigs of RAM,  and it's using this new Tegra K1 processor,  which is not only 64-bit, but desktop class.  I mean, it's a fast process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The video shows it's pretty fast stuff, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never have never-  I mean, even this less expensive,  it's running on a Celeron, is snappy enough.  It's just the touchscreen that's not that snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem I had in my original Samsung,  and they've come to it with the two gigs,  it just slowed the molasses at some point.  Four gigs, somebody emailed me,  a fan of the show emailed me yesterday,  and I just said, four gigs, four gigs, four gigs.  I think that makes a difference, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  Although we bought from Michael for school a Chromebook,  the Acer C720, which is widely recommended.  And it's fine for him, he doesn't know the difference.  He's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He watches PewDiePie on YouTube though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean- Yeah, but I mean, he's used a MacBook.  He's got a Mac Pro to play games on, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was talking to a good friend of mine today,  and they bought one for her daughter in school,  it was in high school.  And just to set the advantage of number one,  if a computer gets stolen,  no big deal, everything's in the cloud.  Number two, they forgot to put the thing on,  blackboard, whatever it was.  Nope, it's all in the cloud.  There's no, I left my homework at school.  It's just for a student,  it makes a lot of difference, I think.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, so I'm tempted by the 13 inch,  just because I want the- Yeah.  The 279 version has 13 hour battery promised.  Yeah, isn't that amazing?  The 379 version with the greater screen  has 11 hours promised.  Wow.  But that's a long flight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want the battery life.  I mean, if you're gonna use it.  So we've said, we've issued the call before,  so people need to do mid-range Chromebooks.  Pixel, I think everyone agrees is too much.  It's hard to recommend somebody spend 1299 on a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I would spend 600, $700 for-  I think you could do a good one for five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really do.  I don't think you need to get that expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you took all the features,  what does the Chromebook give you?  It gives you a touchscreen, gives you LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe for that, 600.  It gives you high res.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to have a GP.  I think you need to have a better GPU  because I think you need to have the screen be responsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't even know what this thing is built on.  What is the Pixel built on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's an i5, but I'm not sure, actually.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wouldn't mean anything to me anyway, so.  Like, look, me looking under the hood of a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like you got four on the floor  and a Hurst shifter in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  So I got a question for you, Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I opened it.  Oh, OnePlus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a question, yes?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I went through, it took me two thirds of a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get this working.  What?  Why?  Trying to get the, I went to the Apple store.  It was the wonderful Alex Hugo, who was a fan of Twig.  Wait a minute, you took it to an Apple store?  Yeah.  I took it to an AT&T store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the guy looked up the, what is it, AVN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  APN?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  APN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  APN.  Mine worked right out of the box.  You had a problem with the...  Well, yeah, it didn't work.  And then, so there were changes.  I don't know what finally got working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were changes to some of this.  And then Alex, this wonderful, wonderful Twig fan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  who's helped me before, has rescued me before.  So you weren't getting data  because you had the wrong answer.  No, I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't.  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You weren't getting data  because you had the wrong APN settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we thought that was it,  and then it still wasn't getting it.  And then it turned out my account was not provisioned  for 4G.  I don't know how that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What phone are you using, a Nexus 5?  Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then, so now, okay, so I put the same in,  and now it's working.  But here's the problem, I think.  It doesn't fail down below 4G for data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it does.  Jeff, you're, I don't know.  You have problems that are unique to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm, I have a cloud, I have a, I have a,  I have had this, I have had this on 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have had this on 2G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it a, is it a AT&T or T-Mobile?  AT&T.  Oh, so the data won't fall down to 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're trolling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the cloud I live in, Leo, it's dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You live in a dark cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And raining.  It's not just over my head.  I'm in the dark cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, you could have screwed things up  by changing the APN settings.  Mine worked out of the box.  I think it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is your, what's the name of your APN?  Oh, I'll have to figure that out.  Go under mobile networks and then access point names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Preferred network type 4G recommended.  I have WAP.singular, which is correct, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works on the WAP?  Wow. It shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Your mistake was trying to fix something  that wasn't broken.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, WAP.singular.  That's the one that works, geez.  Well, it doesn't mine.  My username is WAP.singular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're all right.  They're all the same.  gprs.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it does, yours fails down to 3G.  I'll have full bars at 3G, but no 4G and then no data.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It even says preferred network type 4G, 3G, 2G.  I did that too.  I did that too.  Uh, I don't know.  I think somebody messed with you, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the other issue with the OnePlus.  Other than that.  There's a guy who said,  if you couldn't get it working, I'm gonna buy it.  And he was very nice about it, he's a Twig fan.  And he said, but I'm not trying to live  on your misfortune, Jeff.  Go talk to Gina, try to get it working.  But if not, many just tweeted me yesterday saying,  I'm not so sure I want anything from them.  Did you see the sexist campaign they were doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got something to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They, and in their defense, I agree it's a bad idea.  What they said is, you know,  the whole way OnePlus has worked,  which is weird to begin with,  is that you have to somehow either participate  in a contest or a requested invite  or get an invite from an existing customer  to get this phone.  It's in very, very short supply.  The reason we all use it and like it  is because it is a very high end flagship phone  for 350 bucks, 64 gigabytes of storage.  So that's, you know, it's a good price  for a very nice phone, five and a half inch phone.  They've gotten in trouble.  Their first contest, that was dumb.  They asked people to destroy the phone, send them a video.  And then people pointed out,  well, you're destroying something  that's perfectly useful.  It could be handed on to somebody  who doesn't have a phone that could use a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You throw it out in the garbage and pollute the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a bad, so they then say,  oh yeah, we're stupid, sorry.  What we should have done is say, you know,  I don't know, they modified the contest.  So the most recent contest, I agree,  Tone Deaf said, ladies first,  send us a picture of yourself.  Do you have to be with your old phone?  But send us a picture with yourself.  This is another contest, right?  And we'll put you in a drawing  for one of these phones or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They had to write something on their body  and men were gonna take-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't hear the write something on your body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And men were gonna vote on-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry, you're right, then that's horrible.  The audacious one plus-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, I misunderstood that.  I didn't know that they had to do something  more than just send a selfie.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Write something on their body?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or they can hold a sign, but what if you're  gonna be voted on, clearly the less you wore, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me read, let me-  I didn't see that, okay.  Then there's no-  Then there's no-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then there's no logo on a piece of paper or their body.  Guess who's gonna win.  And then the top 50 most liked women-  In the forums.  To earn a T-shirt.  Wear a T-shirt and the opportunity  to pay full price for the phone.  Oh yeah, you're right.  Nevermind.  Yeah, that's bad, that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beyond tone-down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevermind, would it have been okay if they said  ladies first, send us a picture,  and we'll have a drawing for an invite and a T-shirt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drawing, yes.  Drawing, I think it would have been fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having the forums vote was a mistake.  Beauty contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beauty contest with your logo, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I misunderstood.  I didn't realize that you had to do that.  That's ridiculous.  And by the way, you don't get a free phone,  you just get the opportunity to buy a phone.  Which is already weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like the American apparel of phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember though, they're in China,  maybe there's a cultural gulf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're being so charitable.  I like the phone.  It feels good, it doesn't feel too big.  The size is about right.  There's been a lot of backlash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of the back, and by the way,  this is a good one, lady sends a picture of herself  flipping them off with the OnePlus logo on her hands.  That is my favorite.  I'm not gonna show it, I'm not gonna show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she writes something on her hand, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's why I'm not gonna show it.  Yeah, that's rude, nevermind.  But you know, they've also incurred a lot of wrath  just because how they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Tony's saying on the rundown,  cultural difference, Tony Wang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tony's Taiwanese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he says they're trying to get more female owners,  cultural difference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Tony, beauty contest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did say no nudity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but that's the far end of the boundary.  Anything up to that?  You're gonna get more votes.  No, you're right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a nice phone, the battery,  you're right, it's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think your problems are unique to you  and I think your big mistake was bringing it  to the AT&T store.  I don't think AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it wouldn't work, it wouldn't work.  Well, the guy at the AT&T store should have done  what Alex did, dear Alex, thank you Alex.  Who was by the way, just a fan who works  in a store in Illinois.  And he helps me out because I need help.  But the guy at the AT&T store that I went to here  should have checked my account, I guess.  But it wasn't until the provision for Ford,  unless it was a provision for 4G, I got no data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's something wrong with your account,  it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the end, there were so many variables  I couldn't figure out.  Five, Nexus 5 does 4G, right?  I have Lenin on my watch screen.  You commie you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do you have Lenin on your screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, Marks and Engels on my.  You commie?  Yeah, I just decided what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really wanna rub it in, huh?  Yeah.  Now we know your real sympathies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My last trip to Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, when we were, where were we?  We were in LA.  There is a, they took all the statues of Lenin  down in Russia, but there's a statue of Lenin in LA.  Really?  The Cavie had to point this out.  He said, he was the only statue of Lenin,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they don't have him anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was Armenian, he wasn't happy about the Russians.  So, Mr. Dark Cloud.  Good news is that they are upgrading this now to 4.4.4,  and they're fixing a lot of the issues.  One of the issues with the OnePlus that Jason had  when he reviewed it, is it was turning itself on  in his pocket, and they've, they realized that was a problem.  They fixed that, and there's a significant update coming.  Any minute now.  Many of them are.  How are you gonna get updates from Jason?  Just get it, it'll automatically let you know.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's, I would just say this.  I think that the battery goes way beyond the Nexus 5,  but as a whole, it's not a quantum leap past the Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  The camera's a quantum leap past the Nexus 5.  The screen's a quantum leap.  The speed's a quantum leap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll just say this, a non-twiggy kind of person  asked me today, who's iPhone is dying,  and I said, go Android, and she said,  what phone should I get, and I thought,  and not the fact that you can't get this,  but I said, get a Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I wouldn't get a Nexus 5 now.  It's a year old.  That's crazy talk.  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would say the M8 is very good.  The LG G3, I hear good things about.  The Nexus 5 is old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You saw, by the way, that they have now  paired down the Play Editions to two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I saw that.  On the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Moto G and the, what is it, LG?  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Right there.  Those are the GPE versions.  That looks like an HTC One and then the Moto G,  or the LG G, LG.  The M8 is still great, and I think the Google Play Edition  of the M8 would be also an excellent choice.  The good news about the Nexus 5 is cheap.  Can you get it still?  Are they still selling it?  Or is it out of stock?  They're still selling it in stock.  Yes, sir.  The price is right on that.  It's a year old phone, and I feel like  there are better choices out there.  Chad, would you buy a new Nexus 5?  Yours is cracked and is schmookered.  No, I'm in the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you wait, basically, unless someone needs a phone today,  then I would suggest the Nexus 5 or the M8.  There's gonna be great stuff coming out.  That's the thing, is if you can wait  until the end of September, you're gonna be  so much more happier with the selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And where is the Nexus, wouldn't be the 6,  because, well, it could be the 6.  Where is the next Nexus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been rumors only.  Yeah, rumors, that's all.  Is what we know.  Not good rumors, not reliable rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not at all.  All right, let's take a break.  I'm gonna come back with more.  I actually have to do the change.  We're gonna try something.  We're gonna do the change block minus Gina.  It's gonna be very quick, very quiet.  We'll just play the trumpets, then play the drums.  That'll be it.  Our show today, brought to you by the best place  to get stock photos, illustrations, videos.  Of course, I'm talking about Shutterstock with, good Lord,  40 million images now.  They had a quarter of a million every week.  40 million, 579,549 royalty-free stock images.  284,000 new ones this week.  Most of them from professional photographers and artists,  each individually reviewed for quality.  And with their great search engine,  you're guaranteed to be able to find anything at this point.  40 million, I think you could safely say,  anything you search for.  The great thing about the search engine,  as I've mentioned before,  you don't just search for things.  You can add emotions, you can add color,  you can drill down by subject, by gender,  by the number of people or no people in the image.  And they're all royalty-free, which means,  ha ha, that's your phone right there.  Ha ha ha.  They're all royalty-free.  What did you search for, broken phone?  Cracked screen.  Cracked screen, yeah.  Great for bloggers.  Actually, filmmakers use it too.  I noticed Shutterstock got a credit  in the Guardians of the Galaxy when I was there.  So, I mean, it really is great.  Go to Shutterstock.com.  You don't need a credit card.  You can just create an account right now.  Start using their search tool, their lightbox,  to save images you like for inspiration,  to share with colleagues and clients is a great tool.  And if you do decide to buy an image,  we're gonna get you 20% off on your new account.  Go to twig814, that's the offer code,  twig814shutterstock.com.  Free to try, though, and try the app.  They have an Android and iOS app that's just spectacular.  Just great.  Shutterstock.com.  Remember, when you go to buy an image,  use the offer code twig814 to save 20%.  A little thank you and a welcome to Shutterstock.com.  All right, let's try this.  Jeff, we could tag team the changelog together.  You wanna do that?  Ah, dandy.  All right, play the trumpets.  The Google changelog.  Time to see what's new, new features in the Googleverse.  Let's see, why you take that first one?  Since you-  That's the only one I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put it in there.  So now, Motherboard says that legally,  satellites are now allowed to get twice the res,  to go from 25 to,  go to 25 centimeter resolution,  twice as detailed as the previous limit of 25.  50 centimeter.  Whoa.  The US government has relaxed restrictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the government images are that clear,  but they've never allowed Google to publish them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so the joke here was watch out,  Google will soon see your face in the sky.  Actually though, that's only if you're looking up at it.  I figure what it's gonna see is your bald spot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My uncle.  But you know, I was thinking-  Yeah.  So there's some guy talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking about this the other day.  Yeah.  I'm in one of the skyscrapers in New York,  because we have them, and I'm looking out  and you see all the,  what elsewhere would be the under life of buildings, right?  The tanks and the air conditioners and the ugly stuff.  It's weird how we don't have aesthetic requirements  for the tops of buildings.  Because-  And now we have drones and satellites.  I guess maybe we will.  Yeah.  I think we need prettier tops of buildings.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people should plant flowers on their buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I think we need a top down beautification campaign.  I'm gonna be the Lady Bird Johnson of the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you crack me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  All right, Lady Bird.  Well, I think you should keep America beautiful  and make the rooftops beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And make the NSA happy.  And make the NSA happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google changed things with Gmail a little while ago.  They added support for non-Latin characters  in email addresses.  But you can't create an account that way,  but at least if somebody sends you an email in Cyrillic,  you can get it.  However, it turns out scammers are starting to use this  by using non-native letters to fool you  into trusting a message contents.  So they're now tossing out email  with odd combinations of letters  that look like they represent phishing attempts.  So if they use a, let's say an alpha  instead of an A and the word bank,  bonk of America,  you'll be able to, you'll know and Google will,  they'll know it more importantly  and they'll filter that out.  Other email providers are gonna have to do the same thing.  Yeah, bonk of America.  And I guess because there are some Unicode characters  that just don't appear on the screen,  you could even have invisible characters stuck in there.  But of course the computer knows, a computer can see that.  Oh my God, they're scanning my mail  for non-Roman characters, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a little-  For that Android.  Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  We didn't rehearse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do the next one.  We should have rehearsed, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Takes two guys for Plane's Gina.  And not well at that.  No, says that Google Play Music  is quietly introduced a four device limit  per account per year.  No, no, four device deactivation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So, right, you have 10 devices, okay.  Still, that hasn't changed.  Oh, so you can't switch I's.  But remember, for a while,  one brief shining moment,  you were able to deactivate at will anytime you wanted.  So-  You could have 20 devices.  Yeah.  Well no, you can have 10 devices,  but if you got to 10, which I do all the time,  this hits me a lot because I have so many phones,  and I try to activate a new phone on Google Play Music,  and they say, well you've got 10 devices,  well I can just easily de-off some old devices.  Now you'll only be able to do this  four times a year.  So quickly de-authorize everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's retroactive.  Oh crap.  So even if you've de-authorized stuff already,  it's taken effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people, this probably doesn't bother,  but it really affects me because I have so many devices.  And like this notebook, this new Chromebook,  I'll have it for five minutes,  for a week to review it and then send it back.  So I authorize it for Google Play Music,  and now I can't de-authorize it.  I guess the real takeaway from this is be very careful  when you authorize it,  because you're not going to be able to de-authorize  more than four a year.  And I would guess, this is-  You know, I have a confession.  Yes, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't used Google Play Music.  I don't use any of these streams.  Oh, I love it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one do you like best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well there's some really good choices.  In fact, we were playing with Beats Music the other day,  then Apple's newest acquisition.  They actually do a very interesting job.  It depends what you're looking for.  Basically all of them, Spotify, Beats,  RDO, Rhapsody, Google Play, Amazon Play,  have the access to the same 20 million song library.  As far as I could tell, they're pretty much the same.  There's a few areas where maybe they might have  an exclusive on one artist or whatever,  but it's pretty much the same music.  Prices are all the same, 10 bucks a month,  that's pretty much the standard.  It's more the features.  So one of the things I like about Google  is I can upload my entire collection.  So up to, what is it, 25,000 songs?  I can't remember what the limit is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's nice because I have stuff in my collection  that isn't on Google Play Music,  isn't in that 20 million song set.  So I have access to that, and of course I have access  if I pay the 10 bucks a month to every other song,  and I can listen.  They have very good radio.  I think Google's, I really like Google.  I, oh, careful, careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not gonna use the Kyocera Hydra again,  so might as well deauthorize it.  I'm at nine, so.  You see where we are?  You see the problem for people like you and me?  And I don't review as many phones as you do,  and I'm hitting my limit.  This is absurd.  And I wish there was a way that I could call and say,  my situation's a little different than the normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Apple has the same,  I think this music industry that enforces this,  Apple has the same kind of restriction.  Once a year you can deauthorize everything,  but if you call them sometimes they'll be nicer,  but I don't think they're gonna be nice about it.  Audible does the same thing.  I think these are restrictions placed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  by the content creators, not by these companies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wouldn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I like Google Play Music.  On the other hand, Amazon Music's also a good choice.  Their radio selection is not very good.  Their Amazon Prime Music, which is free  if you're a Prime member,  has a much fewer than a million songs in the library,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so it's not very good.  The other reason I like Google Play Music,  is you can do radio a lot easier,  and you can do radio off of playlists,  which Amazon still hasn't quite nailed down.  Also Amazon's interface is very kludgy.  You have to download a little application to upload music,  and now Google has done away with that on their service.  You can do it just from the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but yeah.  See, I still use a Google plugin  because I want it to be running all the time  so that when I add new music it just uploads it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do that as well.  I just find that, and then also,  once you've added your music to the Google verse,  any Google app that's gonna tap into music  is gonna tap into all access,  and so just being part of the ecosystem is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, if you have a Chromecast,  Google Play Music works with the Chromecast,  and they recently added Sonos support,  so as a Sonos user, then now it's a no-brainer  because I can cast music from my Google Play Music  to my Sonos.  That's awesome.  So, it all in all, oh, and there's one other thing  that makes Google Play Music really awesome.  They have a little dice widget.  So you tap the, whoops, let's go back to my homepage.  You tap, whoop, go back to the homepage.  Tap the dice widget, it rolls the dice,  and then picks a random song for you.  Actually, this is the I'm Feeling Lucky radio.  I like it, I like that.  Also, if you use Android,  it makes sense to use Google Play Music  because you could do things like,  you know, listen to Del Shannon,  and it will play Del Shannon.  I guess it'll do that with Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it can do it with almost anything,  but yeah, it's kind of automatic, right out of the box.  It seems natural.  Yeah, you don't have to tell it what your default is  if you have all access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing I found, I was assuming when I did the,  you know, Play Me Station based on this album,  or based on this thing from my music,  that the algorithm would be a bit better  sort of suggesting similar songs  that I know you can thumbs up, thumbs down them.  But I think I had one prodigy song in there,  and then all of a sudden it was recommending  every screamo death metal, you know,  and I had to just keep saying no, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, the good news is you have unlimited skips,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which you don't have on Pandora, so at least that.  I think all of these recommendation systems  have failings.  Pandora always sneaks a Beatles song in no matter what.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have the Beatles catalog.  Because they have it.  Because they have it.  So it's playing Bob Willis and the Texas Playboys  Sugar Moon, which is I think a really excellent,  I'm feeling lucky choice right there.  Now I probably wouldn't have,  I think I could thumbs up,  indicating a lot more of that.  I think, I think I picked Google Play Music,  but we're gonna, this is,  this is This Week in Google.  It's well done, yeah.  I think it's really well done.  I think all the radios have that problem.  I'm looking at it all night.  Even though they're not a sponsor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on the show for a while,  I actually do listen to Audible a lot.  Audible's awesome.  This week, I got all unhappy with Amazon,  because when I buy Kindle books,  I have a decent sized little gift count,  which has been gifts over time,  plus things I've earned from Amazon stuff.  And it insists upon taking out of that for Kindles.  I'm doing some work right now,  and these are business books.  I don't want to use my gift money for that.  They will not let you take that as an option.  There's no option.  You need another account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pushing my book reading.  You need a business account and a personal account.  But I'm using the same device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't do that.  Oh, that's right.  I'm pushing my book reading over to, guess what?  Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm disappointed on this yearly four  device deauthorization limit.  I think this was previously the rule.  They had been very lenient, which was nice,  but that's changed.  Finally, speaking of Chromecast,  now you can Chromecast your G Plus stream.  I love this, to your big screen TV.  So I'm going to go ahead and do that.  I'm going to go ahead and do this to your big screen TV.  So browse and it resh-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your family, or your strangers to your family snapshots.  Yeah.  You can flip through posts with manual controls,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or it has autoplay.  It, I don't know.  It doesn't sound like, look like it reformats too well.  It does, big images do fill the screen  with the post content at top and the source at bottom.  But I'm sad to say no animated GIFs or GIFs.  What?  What?  That's just an oversight.  I'm sure they'll fix that.  Chromecast gets more and more useful.  I have to say, I love it.  And that's fun.  I haven't tried it yet, but I did get the new version  of Google Plus.  I'm looking forward to trying it tonight.  And that is your Google change.  Damn, I hope Gina comes back next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, come back.  Come back little Gina, come back.  Come back Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We miss you.  Come home.  Come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of Snowden news.  I'll skip that.  I don't, Snowden's got three years to live in Russia.  Reminds me of the old joke.  First place, three years in, a three year trip to Russia.  Fourth place, five year trip to Russia.  I don't know.  Okay.  Twitter admits that there are 23 million active bots.  That's not necessarily bad.  I follow a lot of bots.  It's not spam bots necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually not, that's not true.  It's not true.  Quartz reporting this.  Yeah, I actually wrote about that as well.  And I made the point that you just made,  which is some bots are good.  Some of them are funny.  Some bots actually have useful things to say,  some sort of automated accounts give you information  that's useful like,  We have a bot.  For Twitter, for whatever.  We have a bot for Twitter.  Yeah, so those things are useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Says when the next show is, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But so what happened was Twitter updated its 10 queue  and it tried to clarify a number that it gave before.  And by trying to clarify it,  it kind of made it less clear, if you know what I mean.  So they said before they had estimated that 14%  of users were accessing Twitter  through some third party application.  So then they tried to narrow it down a little bit more.  They said, actually it wasn't 14.  It was 11.  And of that 11, 8.5% were accessing it  through some automated service  that didn't require user input.  So what Quartz did was take that 8.5%  and assume, well, that means 20 million,  23 million are bots.  But it was explained to me by someone close to Twitter  who didn't wanna be named,  that the language in the 10 queue,  what they meant was automated services that pull tweets,  not automated services that post tweets.  So they're talking about a notification layer on your phone  that basically just displays tweets  without you having to use the app or go to the website.  That's what they meant.  So not bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, I'm surprised there's only 23 million.  Yeah.  Doesn't every third party Twitter app do that,  poll tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And so what I thought was interesting  was it was a small number.  That means there's that many.  Like Twitter basically controls 90% of the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay, Quartz completely screwed that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's-  To be fair, I read the 10 queue as well,  and it wasn't clear.  It just said without human interaction.  It didn't say just pulling tweets.  Right.  But there's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're posting a tweet without human interaction  and reading a tweet without human interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  So the short answer is they don't know how many bots  there are or they're not saying,  and bots are included under the spam heading.  But they're not necessarily spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because a lot of bots are very useful.  Things that give you a weather.  One man's thought is another man's spam.  There's lots of traffic update bots.  I mean, those aren't bad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one I mentioned was Kim Kierkegaard.  Do you follow that at all?  So it's a mashup of Kim Kardashian's tweets  and Soren Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy.  It's hysterical.  I'm gonna add that right now.  It's awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kim Kierkegaard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That guy should get a medal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is that a bot because it's doing it automatically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a bot.  Really?  One of my other favorites is defunct,  but stealth mountain.  If you use the phrase sneak peak and you spelled peak wrong,  it would respond automatically and say,  I think you mean,  because lots of people say peak like the mountain peak.  It's just one of those grammatical things  that drives you nuts.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should have another one of those.  So it's actually, the account is Kim Kierkegaardashian.  Say that three times fast.  Just as the spirit is invisible,  so also is its language a secret.  And sometimes you can't tell when it's being sarcastic.  I don't see any Kim in that.  Here's another.  Do the big one.  Go down, go, yeah.  Again, I am burdened by a heaviness of the soul.  Not gonna call it baby weight because that's an excuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sea struck up its song with a deep, calm solemnity.  The souls of the dead came forth to hold me  in their comforting embrace, yacht life.  Or I'm on a boat, yacht.  I love your tumbler's infinite scroll down feature  and the unfathomable insatiable emptiness behind it.  That's human written.  There's no way a human didn't do this.  Look what I found in my luggage.  All my worldly troubles and sorrows.  My look is never complete without indescribable suffering.  That's one to follow.  That's good.  But I think a human's writing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely.  Yeah, that's no bot.  But they tweet them automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, oh, well that, yeah.  I mean, what if you use HootSuite or something  to schedule tweets?  You're sort of a bot.  That's sort of a bot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of a bot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I tell you, it's hard to use a Chromebook to do this show.  Ah, dee dee dee dee.  Oh, I don't think we have to talk about Facebook Messenger.  We've talked about that quite a bit on the show.  Twitch, you know, it has not been officially confirmed  that YouTube is buying Twitch.  Is that right, Chad?  Twitch has not announced it yet.  It has not been announced, but twitch.tv,  which was owned by Justin.tv,  must, they're making changes  because they shut down Justin.tv.  And they did a boom, boom.  So I expect that to happen sometime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If not, whoops.  They've also implemented a YouTube-like  audio scanning feature to look for copyrighted audio.  In Twitch.  Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they do a nice thing.  They just turn off the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mute it.  So if, but it's kind of amazing  because if there's a two hour stream  with three minutes of copyrighted audio,  the whole two hour stream would be muted.  Yes.  Even your narration.  Everything, everything.  Now this is not for live events.  So they're still not scanning live  and they won't mute your stream if it's live,  but anything that's been recorded and archived  for the four or five days that it's up now,  it will be muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason this is concerning  is because of course there has always been  a little tension between the game owners,  the video game content creators,  and these broadcasters over who owns the copyright.  Not all, many, many video game companies  realize this is a very good thing indeed for them  and sells copies of the game.  But a few have issued takedown requests on YouTube  and there is a real cause for concern  for the viability of Twitch  if the same thing should happen.  I think that actually if YouTube buys Twitch,  that's very good news.  Remember when YouTube started before Google bought it,  there were serious concerns.  I remember interviewing Justin Cahn saying,  how are you gonna stay in business?  Not Justin Cahn, that's Justin TV.  Brian, the founder of YouTube,  saying how are you gonna stay in business?  Because NBC at the time was suing them,  Viacom was, people were pissed off.  And had YouTube not been acquired by Google,  they might not have survived,  but Google with its great power kept that,  worked out deals with content creators.  Content creators started to realize the value.  I imagine Twitch, the same thing would happen  with gaming companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the MP in chat rooms corrected me,  it's only 30 minute blocks, not a two hour.  So it's 30 minutes of time.  So I guess I had only seen a snippet  that was less than 30 minutes  and the whole thing was muted.  I went, wow, they mute the whole video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They actually said their technical guy,  or sort of the CEO did a Reddit ask me anything  and said that they were gonna try and get better  at doing discrete chunks  instead of just massive half hour muting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and another issue is that sometimes  something will be in game.  Well, that's what that's my question.  That the game has questions to.  Yeah.  So let's say, BioShock has a music play  that they got the license to,  but then the actual license holder of that music  hears it in your stream and they block it.  That would be a problem.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's gonna be another one  where YouTube and Twitch have to go to the electronic arts  and say, hey, from now on,  when you negotiate these licenses,  make sure you include this additional usage  because I'm telling you, it's good for the game.  I don't care if more people watch somebody  playing Legends of Zelda.  What is that?  League of Legends, then buy League of Legends,  which is probably the case, right?  I would guess, Chad,  that more people are watching people play  League of Legends on Twitch  that are actually buying the game League of Legends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  It's, I mean, we don't see that with Minecraft.  League of Legends is a free game anyway.  Oh, well.  Now, but with League of Legends,  like there's the monetization that they have  on League of Legends is kind of amazing.  Is it in-app purchases?  Is it during gameplay?  Basically, and it's mostly all skins or things.  Yeah, things, and then also different characters.  So like they'll, all the characters cost money.  So that's a bad example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just used it because it's the number one game  on Twitch right now.  But the other games that you buy,  Titanfall, you might be,  more people might be watching people play Titanfall  than buy Titanfall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, but I do think that there is  a definite correlation between how many people stream  and how many, how many sells,  but it's probably not the same amount.  It would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, Goat Simulator took off  thanks to people watching other people play Goat Simulator.  I think Padre SJ, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think you're right that more people  watched Goat Simulator than actually went out  and purchased Goat Simulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not as much fun to play

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as it is to watch somebody play it.  Right, but still, it definitely drove sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it helped Goat Simulator,  and I'm sure they made more money than they would have  if others had not been playing it and watching it.  Yes. Right, right.  Is this new?  Because somebody in the chat room keeps saying this is new.  Google for Education, Google Classroom,  I think we talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had mentioned that they were going to start something,  but this is new. It's now out.  Yeah, this is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Designed hand-in-hand with Google Apps for Education.  So basically, is it Blackboard?  Is it Moodle?  What is it?  Designed to help teachers create and collect assignments.  Yeah, paperlessly, including time-saving features  like the ability to automatically make a copy  of a Google document for each student.  Oh, this is nice.  Creates drive folders for each assignment  for each student to keep track,  help everyone keep organized.  This is a little bit like Blackboard or Moodle.  I'm not an educational expert, so I'm not sure.  We use, up at Sonoma Academy,  where everybody gets a Macintosh, it's a one-to-one program,  but we do use Google Apps for Education, but we use Moodle.  But I have to wonder if they might migrate  to something like this,  if it can do many of the things they use Moodle for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is- So now they said anyone  with a Google Apps for Education account can use it.  Wow, free. Quite open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's pretty a pretty big deal.  Sam Harrelson's in the chatroom.  He says he's the EdTech director at a school.  He says, we're really excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because Moodle, actually,  have you ever looked at Moodle?  It's not, I'm not a teacher, but-  Ugly as sin.  The UI is horrible.  Yeah.  You can skin it.  It's like punching yourself in the face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can skin it, but we're having a really hard time  getting teachers to use it because its UI is so bad.  Everybody likes the functionality.  Yeah, kids are used to real user interfaces.  Real software.  Wow, this is great.  So you can read more at classroom.google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who do we lose?  Jeff's ghost just left us.  Oh, that's why we have no audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you hear me now?  Yes, we can hear you great now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Okay.  He's doing a Verizon ad.  Of all the people in the world who would not,  I would not expect to do a Verizon ad.  It would be Jeff Jarvis.  Can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I have no idea what happened, but thank you,  I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay.  So big, big news actually from Google.  And bad news for, Moodle's open source and free,  but Blackboard is not.  It's gotta be bad news.  Blackboard sucks.  Well, that's what I hear.  Everybody who uses Blackboard and Moodle say,  God, I wish there was something better.  Terrible.  Maybe Google has found the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep trying to get our place to just switch  over to Google entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, more and more,  I think the schools should not buy MacBooks,  which are still eight or 900 bucks.  And I wish, again, another case where,  if you had a really nice $500 or $600 Chromebook,  it'd be a lot easier to recommend.  They'd be saving money,  but they'd get a good quality computer  that students wouldn't complain that we've,  you've given us a netbook.  And then now they've got Classroom.  Pretty compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and don't forget how much education  was a part of Apple's growth strategy  with the next generation.  Google's starting to copy Apple's education strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Just, it's in the cloud  when I signed up for community college.  The whole cloud infrastructure,  except for Blackboard, was Google.  Whenever I got my email, it was a Google Apps email.  All of our docs, all of everything was Google,  except for that Blackboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blackboard's going, I would guess.  I'm sure there are things you can do  with Blackboard you can't do.  It doesn't look like, for instance,  grading is built into Google Classroom  and stuff like that, but.  Good.  Kill grades.  Kill grades.  I haven't read this article.  Maybe, Jeff, did you put this in here?  Jezebel starts open revolt against Gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this was a fascinating thing.  Jezebel, of course, is a Gawker site,  and they had a real problem with trolling rape gifs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Jezebel is a site aimed at women.  At women. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At Gawker, and they couldn't get the attention  of the company and the developers  in the prioritization list,  and so they wrote just a vitriolic public post  about how Gawker's not paying attention to our problems,  and guess what happened?  Next day, Gawker said, okay, you're raised up the dev list,  and now it's happening, so good for Jezebel.  Yeah, I thought that was fascinating.  They played Gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They actually, Jessica Cohen, the outgoing editor,  apparently complained to Joel Johnson,  who's the editor in chief, and he said,  "'You should write about it.'"  I mean, that's the one thing about Gawker is,  and it's one of Nick Denton's fundamental principles.  Everything should be out in the open,  including all the fighting and arguing,  and so they wrote about it,  and Joel, to his credit, said,  both on Twitter and in a comment on Jezebel,  "'Thanks for mentioning it.  "'You're right, I dropped the ball.  "'We need to solve this problem.'"  And the last, they did an update to the post  and said that they're going to reinstitute pending comments,  which they used to have, so you'll be able to see  that there is a pending comment that hasn't been approved,  and you can choose to look at it or not,  and that gives you the sort of leeway  to not be surprised by some violent porn gif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was only a matter of time, but at Black Hat,  hackers showed that they could infect Nest thermostats  and turn your heat up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this a big deal, or have I seen something here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a big deal, and I'll tell you why.  I agree with you.  My first reaction is,  so they can change the temperature in my house?  So what?  But it's more than that.  It's more than that,  because the Nest thermostat is on your network,  and so the real risk is,  and we're gonna see a lot of this in the internet of things,  that these poorly designed things  that are connected to your network  become entry points for bad guys.  Access points, exactly, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they get access to one poorly protected device,  they get access to your whole network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they were able to compromise the Nest device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What did it take to compromise it?  Did they have to have it physically, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't, it looks-  It's a long reference to being a used Nest.  I love the, you know what they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I swallowed something the wrong way.  And I love what they did in the demo.  They put a text up on,  they actually changed the image on the Nest.  The Nest has a LCD screen at its heart,  which normally just shows the temperature.  They put a little howl eye up, and the words,  I know that you and Frank are planning to disconnect me,  and I'm afraid that is something I cannot allow to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yikes!  Which is really funny,  because the Nest has a built-in battery,  and so even if you rip it off the wall,  it will still- It'll still say that!  It'll still, yeah, the live screen will show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that story was updated with a comment from Nest.  They said physical access was required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well that's trivial.  Okay.  Yeah, and meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's not trivial.  That's a big deal.  It's not as if, you know,  what, my cleaning lady's gonna come in and pull the Nest?  So what it really says is, don't buy a new Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they had to have physical access, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so why is this a-  It's not an issue.  I don't see this big alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  If you have access to any hardware device,  if a bad guy has access to it, you're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he was saying the story's trivial, not the fact-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm saying this hack is meaningless, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They plugged a USB device into it,  and put it in developer mode,  and then loaded their own software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long?  I could do that.  That's not-  Techno panic.  I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it isn't really,  because actually this was one of the themes  of Black Hat and DEF CON,  was that these devices generally don't have  the same attention to security  that a router might or a computer might,  and this is an avenue, an attack avenue,  but it has to be-  Okay, okay.  It has to be attackable over the internet,  or it's meaningless, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's partly because they know  that the device is gonna be in your home,  and if a bad guy comes into your home,  they're probably gonna be stealing your jewels,  not hacking your Nest.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unless, the only thing I could think of  is the NSA pre-hacked routers  that were then sold and shipped to customers.  That's a different matter.  They could pre-hack the Nest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the truth is, whenever we buy any technology,  we are trusting that the manufacturer of the technology  has not embedded malware into it.  That's the very nature of what,  there is a trust relationship.  When you buy anything,  there's a trust relationship  that your garage door opener  doesn't have a microphone and camera in it.  You have to trust the manufacturer.  So to say, oh yeah, a manufacturer could do bad things,  well yes, absolutely they could.  They have always been able to.  Of course, it's a little different  if something's always online,  because then there's somewhere for that garage door opener  to send the microphone in there.  To send the data.  Yeah, right.  Send the audio, video.  The IBM PC, 33 years old.  It's still a youngin'.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and that's basically how long I had a PC,  a real PC, 33 years.  But my original was an Osborne 1,  but that's been as long as I've had it,  and now I'm on Chromebook.  So that's the limit of my personal computer era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IBM shipped the first PC, the 5150,  because every IBM device had to have a number,  on the 12th of August, 1981, 33 years ago today.  And the world, I think the world changed.  It's quite a story, and worth remembering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can still feel that keyboard under my finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it was a good keyboard.  Damn fine keyboard, that clicky clickety click keyboard.  Very clicky click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think you'd like it today,  but I think coming from typewriters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Four points.  I like the Atari 1040.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I had an Atari 400 and 800,  but I remember when the 1040,  that was an attractive looking guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Osborne 1, man, Osborne 1.  1040, 1040 was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  1040ST had a trash icon, had desktop icons,  had drag and drop, it was incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was jam, right?  Wasn't that the OS, the graphic OS?  Jam.  Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah.  It was pretty sophisticated for those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And MIDI support too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  And how much memory, 48K?  Oh, I don't remember.  My Atari had 48K.  I think, I don't know if they went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think my Osborne 1 had 96K.  96, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh.  And the first IBM PC ran at 4.77 megahertz.  Not gigahertz, my friends, megahertz.  All right, time to wrap things up  with picks and tips and the like.  Do you want, Matthew, do you wanna throw us a tip  or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Give me a minute.  We'll go to Jeff and I'll-  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis will give us a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this week on August 19th,  it will be 10 years since the Google IPO.  It came out at an astronomical 23 billion.  According to this story,  I don't know why I haven't checked it right now,  but it was 390 million.  That makes a 17X value increase.  Third largest evaluation in the world.  Pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's number one, Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should know that.  Apple, then Exxon Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Exxon, Apple, Exxon, Google, the big three.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Pretty amazing, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything you've got,  or should I vamp some more for you?  We didn't talk about, you know,  and this was something we talked about on a  tweet on Sunday at Security Now yesterday.  We probably should mention this,  that Google has decided to rank a little bit higher  sites that support HTTPS, secure HTTP.  They're gonna use it as a ranking signal.  They say we're only gonna do a 1% ranking improvement  for right now because we wanna give people-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a lot of things, it doesn't really matter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in most things it doesn't matter.  Right, that's the only issue.  I'm somewhat in support of the idea of HTTP everywhere.  We've talked about that on Security Now a long time.  And I think it's a, you know, certainly, you know,  Facebook and Gmail should use it and do,  but there's no reason why I should have to encrypt  my traffic from twit.tv to your browser or vice versa.  Just, it's a waste of, you know, CPU cycles  and it's expensive.  You have to buy a certificate for, you know,  50 bucks a year or more.  Right.  So they say for right now it's only a very  lightweight signal affecting fewer than 1% of global  queries and carrying less weight than other signals  such as high quality content.  Well, I would hope so.  Well, the site's secure, the content sucks,  the site's secure.  Meantime, over time we may decide to strengthen that  because we'd like to encourage all website owners  to switch to HTTPS.  Doesn't make any sense, Google.  I agree that there are lots of sites that should be secure  that aren't, but there are many, many, many, many, many,  many more sites that don't need to be secure.  And I don't think you could argue this is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you guys agree.  Steve agrees.  Of all people, I mean, Steve Gibson,  who's been lobbying for HTTPS, said no.  This is crazy.  Is that your daughter?  Yes.  Time to go fishing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet, no.  All right.  Well, you've been here.  I do have one thing.  Yes.  I do have one thing I was gonna mention.  I can't remember if I mentioned this before,  but did I mention Vellum, the New York Times Labs?  It's a...  I don't think you did.  It basically sucks in your Twitter account  and then shows you links that people you follow  have shared.  No.  It's quite well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  V-E-L-L-U-M dot N-Y-T labs dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's really well, it's very, very simple.  It just shows you who shared it  and it's kind of a way, if you've been away on Twitter  and you feel like you've missed some interesting links,  you just go to Vellum and it shows you  what people have been sharing.  I've been using it a lot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  I'm logging in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my students had a business  that was gonna do that and more,  and she never, you know, you can have all the ideas  in the world, but it's all execution.  I wish she'd pursued this about five years ago.  Yeah.  Because taking the links that you have in a day,  that's the meat of the value.  And then analyzing that can bring a lot of,  a lot of, you can add value to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's, you know, there's paper.li  and other things like that that do that,  but I think it's really well done and it's well designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as soon as I get my second factor authentication code  from Twitter, I'll be able to pull it up.  Oh, you've already got it.  Chad, you're so good.  And it's pretty.  They don't have an app for this though.  It's just a webpage, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fast though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Instagram hires a new chief.  I didn't know that.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  Look at that.  News already flowing in.  I know.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I have like my groups, my lists.  So if I wanted to create a list of people  who make news and not follow them,  I could do that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's actually good.  I do that all the time, yeah.  That's great.  I'm authorizing it right now.  Vellum.nytlabs.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also have multiple people share it.  It looks like their icons will show up multiple.  I'll see seven or eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say more and more I'm using things like Nuzle,  which is Jonathan Abrams creation.  He said the guy did Friendster, Prismatic,  Brad Cross at Google did this.  These are social news feeds.  Same idea, not just Twitter.  It could be other social sources like Facebook.  But they work really well and it's a great way  to surface news that I might not otherwise see.  A little different than like reading Flipboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Prismatic and Big Fan Brad's.  They've changed a little bit.  So they're focusing much more on the discussion  within Prismatic around those links.  Whereas Vellum and Nuzle are still pretty much just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The dashboard that shows you.  Yeah, I've been using Prismatic and Nuzle  pretty much every morning to look at see what's going on.  You still can't beat Tech Meme though  for just like here's the 10 big stories.  Yeah, it's just boom.  It's right there.  And does anybody still use Google News?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jesus, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually, well, I use it every week for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you?  Yeah, I will too, yeah.  The SciTech section?  Yeah, I mean for me, like Tech Meme is what I want to know  what people are talking about.  Google News is what I want the algorithm to think.  Yeah, what does the algorithm think?  What do the bots think?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use Google Play Newsstand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Newsstand is a great app for Android.  It's like Flipboard is beautiful.  Is it?  Well, I always assume it's just trying  to sell me magazines, but no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not, it's not.  And things like, it's how I actually read The Verge.  I prefer to read The Verge on Play Newsstand  than I do on The Verge.  Really?  Yeah, I think they've changed it.  But you still make a really good point, Leo.  Not to insult anyone who's there  and they're wonderful people,  but I think Google News is preserved in aspect.  Yeah, it's terrible.  It could really show the way in so many ways for news.  It could do so much.  And it's not competitive,  apart from the Germans and Murdoch,  just never mind them.  It can send traffic to news sites in amazing ways.  It could understand me and my tastes and my interests.  I'm arguing constantly now that news  has to become a relationship business.  It has to give me higher relevance.  News sites don't do that.  And what Google News could do in the long run  is share data about me and my interests  with news sites, with my permission, of course,  and could bring me more relevance  across the whole pantheon of news.  But it just kind of sits there.  It's pretty, it works well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I was at the Journalism Festival in Italy,  I talked to a couple people from Google News  and I basically said exactly the same thing.  There's so much it could do.  There's so much more that it could do.  It was pretty good five years ago  in terms of showing you headlines,  but there's so little personalization,  there's so little intelligence.  For a company that's built around intelligence  and has 1,500 math PhDs or whatever,  there's so little intelligence in that product.  And it feels like there's two guys working weekends  in their spare time on the thing.  But it's not, it's a very talented team

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of very smart people,  but I don't think they put any glory behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think they shared my frustration to some extent.  And the only thing one person said, who I won't name,  was that it's run by the product guys.  It's not run by journalists.  The technologists or journalists, yeah.  Right, and so the product guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A good product person always says,  how can we make something better for the user?  What does the user want?  Let's meet those needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  These were my product people, and it was fun.  They have to sort of get past,  so the product guys control the feature list,  what we're gonna do with it.  And so the things that they wanted to do  are not necessarily what the product guys wanted to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But a product guy, I've heard it said lately to some people,  when editors talk to technologists,  technologists say to the editors, you're a product person.  And a product person properly molded  is the voice of the user.  Sure, yeah, I agree.  And so I have no problem with product people  running the show, so long as they are a good voice  of the user, so long as they plumb the possibilities  well on behalf of users.  And I think there's just so much more  that Google News could be.  Maybe they're scared of it politically,  that the more they touch it,  the more German is gonna know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, I was gonna say maybe they're afraid  of adding too much functionality,  because then it'll just become an even larger red flag  for media companies to jump on Google and say your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's easily, that's where they share things with them.  I mean, give reports to the media companies  how much traffic we're sending you.  When you send traffic, give data about the users  with the user's permission,  where you can bring greater value.  There's a lot of ways it could be used to clearly benefit.  Yeah, I agree, I agree.  I also think embedding articles in Google News  so people can read actually more  and discover the optimal way to link to articles.  Embedded articles have a lot of value in that way.  So, yeah.  Well on that note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're gonna wrap this thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a punctual Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just feel like we don't wanna,  we wanna leave him wanting more.  No, it's not.  And. A third of the user.  And by the way, Matthew Ingram, the chat room says,  if there's a dusty old book in the basement of that cottage,  don't read it out loud, okay?
