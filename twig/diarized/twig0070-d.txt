Almost always? Not always. Sometimes you miss the show.  It makes me sad.  I cry when you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I couldn't miss the show with you turkeys.  Oh, speaking of turkeys. Happy Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, happy Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there is the smell of roasting turkey waftings at the Jarvis home right now?  No, we don't like turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. There you go.  Do you eat them? Entrarian in all things.  I'm going to find out what you eat.  Is it a big ham?  One year I suggested to my wife that we should save her effort.  And this is when her father, grandfather were alive and get a tray of lasagna.  Oh, yes.  I've never seen a sadder face than my grandfather in law as he looked at it as if it were a dead dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what my people do and Gina's people do too.  We have the lasagna.  We have the antipasto.  And then you have the turkey as if you haven't eaten enough.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's always the antipasto in the pasta.  In any meal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you have the turkey stuffing, sweet potatoes, green beans, pumpkin pie and a little cannoli.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then espresso.  But it lasts from noon until seven or eight at night.  Paizan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of Paizan, the great Om Malik is joining us this week.  It's great to see you, Om, from GigaOm.com.  How are you doing, guys?  It's good to see you. Thank you for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pleasure to be back.  Do you?  No turkey for me.  I'm having tofu.  Tofu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Tofu.  Do you celebrate?  Obviously, I don't know, Diwali, what do you celebrate?  I celebrate everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If this is a festival, I'm in.  Life. I celebrate life.  That's right.  You know, you can't have enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Om is a hardworking man, though.  Let me tell you, go to GigaOm.com.  I don't know how people do blogs like that.  It's so, you just, the news cycle is 20 seconds, not 20 hours.  And you just constantly working to keep up with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we're learning from the master.  That is you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just, I don't do, yeah, see, I don't do any reporting, though.  I just repeat what you guys say.  Yeah.  I talk to Henry Blodgett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on, we don't do no reporting.  Come on.  If you write the mainstream media, they always say we don't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's got to do some work.  I don't know who, but somebody's got to do something.  What did Blodgett say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I'm curious if this follows your experience.  He said that hiring newspaper reporters is kind of a disaster  because they come in, they want to drink their coffee, read the paper,  go out for lunch, come back, do one thing.  One story a day. What do you want?  Yeah. Yeah.  And they look at him like he's a slave driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You mean five, I got to file five times a day?  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we just went.  I don't know what to say.  To each his own, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this is a different, the new generation is very different from the  from the previous generation of journalists.  So, yes, you kind of learn, learn to live with those realities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Rupert Murdoch's reality is they're going to put a put together,  apparently with Apple, a iPad only newspaper called...  The Daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Daily. This is kind of...  The Daily, but he may not get away with it because there are other claims to the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and, excuse me, are you going to update it daily?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all he's going to do is daily.  Oh, that's pathetic.  This is welcome to the internet, Rupert.  It might update a little bit, but it's going to...  Every night, somebody is going to hit a button just like they did on the Gold Press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're not going to update it like throughout the day.  It's going to once a day.  It's going to update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Because this is a replication of its own wine in New Cask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says we're going to have...  I love this.  We're going to have a hundred reporters and six tech guys.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I told you Leo is drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish I were drunk when I hear something like that.  So is a hundred reporters enough?  What does USA Today have?  What does the New York Times have?  Is a hundred reporters enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Washington Post has...  Well, the New York Times is ridiculous.  It has 2,000.  The Washington Post has about 750.  Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News about 500.  Star Ledger these days probably about 250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a hundred is pretty scant for a national newspaper.  And this is going to be iPad only and paid?  Yeah, 99 cents a week.  99 cents a week, OK.  At least the price is right.  Don't you think, Jeff, that that's a good price?  Yeah.  I mean, I look at the New Yorker, it's five bucks.  I look at the Economist.  I mean, all these weeklies are charging huge amounts of money.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Leo, you can get a kind of ass traveler for a buck an issue  if you subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  On the iPad, you mean?  No.  Well, I'm talking about the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.  That's the irony of it.  In real life, you can get the printed magazine  with all its beautiful photos and all that for a buck an issue.  You have to pay more online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think 99 cents a week for a daily newspaper, I guess.  I guess we're just going to have to see what it is,  what the quality is and all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we will.  The economics of that are subscriber acquisition cost.  You have to pay marketing to bring people in.  When I worked on EW, Entertainment Weekly,  it was costing anywhere from $20 to $30 per subscriber  in marketing cost.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The presumption.  The big issue here is that I think not many people are  thinking about is the 100 reporters and six engineers.  That is a model from the 20th century.  Today's model is 100 engineers and six reporters  is how it's going to be.  And unfortunately, the old media people  don't quite get it that they're not in the business of news.  They're in the business of information.  And information comes in many different ways,  in many different forms.  And as long as they don't quite get it,  they will continue to lose money and keep  trying to bottle the old wine in a new bottle,  and they won't be successful.  I'm hoping that this new project is actually  going to be interesting because at least they're spending money  and doing something new versus Wall Street Journal or New York  Times, which looks essentially the same thing as you can buy  in print or on their website.  So there's nothing surprising about that.  So I hope they do come up with something interesting.  There is an opportunity to do that.  Yeah.  If nothing else, on a daily basis,  if they have better gossip, I'm going to subscribe.  That might be all it takes.  Yeah, that's all I really want from Murdoch's product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says it'll be a tabloid.  Maybe, Jeff, you can figure this one out.  A tabloid sensibility with a broadsheet point of view,  or a tabloid point of view with a broadsheet sensibility.  It's a mix of the two.  The broadsheets are what, like the Financial Times,  like the Sirius papers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New York Times, the Sirius papers, and the tabloids  are obviously the Sun and the Post.  It's Murdoch, so it's going to have attitude.  He has Richard Johnson, ex-Post there.  He has an ex-Manager of the Post involved.  So it'll have a posty attitude.  You know, Murdoch, the thing about Murdoch is he  loves making money, but he does that through entertainment.  I know that with news publishing,  he has always said that what he really wants  is a bully pulpit, so-called.  He loses, I don't know what the number is now, more than $25  million a year on the New York Post,  so that he has that bully pulpit.  He overpaid like crazy for the Wall Street Journal.  He has the bully pulpit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would guess he's making money on the Journal by now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard to say.  You know, there's no transparency of numbers at all  and no, no, they discount the subscriptions  very, very heavily.  It's a good ad category in good times,  but right now, not so much.  But the other thing Murdoch wants to do is he fancies  himself the savior of the newspaper business.  When he broke the unions and broke the old work rules  in London when he moved to this so-called whopping plant,  which always sounded a little obscene to me.  You're gonna give yourself a good whopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something for you in the Charlie and the Chocolate  Factory, something Willy Wonka might have a whopping plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We make waps there.  I guess I should have said that.  Hey.  I didn't mean that, WAP.  WAP.  Anyway, so now I think he thinks he's gonna rescue  the industry by saying, well, people should pay  and they should do what they used to do  and so we're gonna prove that works.  Well, good frigging luck, Rup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've got an iPad with a full web browser  and thousands of services that let you put together  a customized news page or an RSS reader kind of experience  like Google Reader, but I'm gonna pay 99 cents  to get the daily update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I look at people who buy iPads and how they use it,  I think that that's not necessarily untrue.  I think that I could see those people paying a buck a week  to have this beautiful experience.  I mean, isn't that kind of what the iPad is,  is for people who don't like the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's chew the web.  Well, usage on the iPad is mainly the web.  Is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we had those stats in a few weeks ago on the list.  That's interesting.  Well, that's telling.  It's good.  It's good for the fate of the world.  And we didn't discuss it only last week,  maybe since then, but Tim Berners-Lee's magnificent essay  in Scientific American, he responded,  among other things, to Wired magazine  and said the web is not dead from the man who invented it.  And he does decry and worry about the closed world  of not just apps, but also Facebook  and in great measure, Google and others.  And as always, we're fighting for the openness of our world.  I think the one thing which we can't ignore, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think, you know, Sir Tim is absolutely right  when he brings up those issues.  But the problem is that all of us tend to measure  the world today and the future from yesterday's  measurement tools or yardsticks.  So web, what it was earlier is very different  than the web it will be tomorrow, right?  So to kind of say that we have an idea  of what it will be is quite different.  I mean, if you look at the Twitter app,  it has an embedded browser in it.  So how is the browser dead?  Not really.  It just is different.  It's a different packaging now.  It's a different sensibility.  And I think it's essentially, you know,  in many ways, if you really think about it,  the analogy I like to see that we're going from,  you know, from what used to be the Henry Ford world  into a world where there are many cars, right?  And essentially in different formats,  the essential idea of the internet is not changing.  The essential idea of internet as an information resource  hasn't really changed.  What might change is how we view it.  That's not really saying the web is dead.  So in that sense, you know,  the guys from Wired were very sensationalist.  And, you know, from that sense, you know,  Sir Tim is right, but even he's also being  a little bit alarmist.  You know, the internet is by the people for the people.  Let people define what it will be, right?  So people at this very moment are defining apps  as a way to use it.  These are the same people who were on MySpace  and they're on Facebook  and they will be on something else tomorrow.  So I think the web is an organic thing.  It's a living thing and it changes.  And, you know, just like any other organic living thing,  it's changing its skin sort of, so to speak right now.  And I think that's a good thing.  That's a good thing from an innovation perspective.  I think it's a good thing from the perspective  of imagining new user experiences and new products.  So I like where we are going right now.  And I don't think we need to be alarmist about it.  You know, you can, you know, just remember five years ago,  MySpace was the king.  Today, they basically have capitulated and said,  we will use Facebook logon to kind of let people in.  So, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and company  cannot take it for granted  that they will be around in 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at all.  I agree with you, Am, but at the same time,  I think what Tim's saying, in fact,  to the subtitle of his article is the web is critical,  not merely to the digital revolution,  but to our continued prosperity and even our liberty.  And it needs defending.  He's calling for open standards, net neutrality,  things like that.  And I think people may be, I don't know,  is it anti-democratic to say you can't trust people  to act in their best interest in that way?  I think sometimes they-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not people.  The problem you're going to get is not people.  Business interests.  The problem is the business interests  and government interests,  very importantly, government interests as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The government's acting in the interest of business  in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're also acting in the interest of being able to,  you know, forcing businesses to hold our data  so that they can do criminal investigations,  things like that.  What Om said, I absolutely agree with,  but I think we could lose it.  The web is of the people.  The internet is of the people.  But if we don't protect that,  cue my plug for a Bill of Rights here.  But if we don't protect the principles,  if we don't create principles and then protect them,  then it'll be our own fault when we lose them.  And I think that's what Sir Tim is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're the people,  and this is the conversation that's happening.  I mean, this is part of that process.  So I agree with you, Om, that that process,  you know, is good.  But I just sometimes, some of us who maybe understand  a little bit of the risks inherent might need to nudge  a little bit in the direction of free, open, neutral,  that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even nobody is arguing against free, open, and neutral.  What I'm arguing for is people should have the choice  to access the web in whatever format they choose to, right?  Like, there is, right?  So it doesn't have, we don't have to view the web  from the eyes of a browser that was created in 1994.  Essentially, nothing really has changed with the browser.  Nothing really has changed.  You know, Gina can speak to that in terms of the tools  of creating great web experiences  haven't really changed that much.  The web itself is pretty much the way it was  the way we discovered it.  It's gotten a little prettier and we're using, you know,  more pictures and a little bit more multimedia.  But what it hasn't changed is the,  our human interaction with the web  hasn't quite changed as much.  Whereas when you look at things like apps on iPad  or on Android or whatever, you feel there is a little bit  more immersion going on.  There is a new kind of a user interaction going on  with these services.  So I think there is that element  which we also have to remember.  That's how I feel about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what-  I love our apps, but I think the apps, I mean,  I would push for HTML5 and web-based apps  and the market may not push in that direction,  especially people like Rupert Murdoch  who would like to control, would like,  he wants the walled garden  and that's what the daily is, is a walled garden, a paywall.  And I think, you know, this vision that Gina has  of us bookmarking and going from site to site  on our browser, that's what made the web so powerful.  It doesn't have to be a browser, I guess,  or it could be a richer browser experience.  We're working towards that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the linking part of it is the thing  that's the most important.  The links are the key, yeah.  Even if I subscribe to the daily,  I couldn't ever blog about any of those stories,  which makes it much less valuable to me as a blogger, right?  Because I can't link or quote, you know,  I can quote, but I can't link, you know,  it's not a linkable page that I know anybody can get to.  But I, you know, I totally agree with all of them.  I think that these things evolve.  I do trust that people will interact with the web  in the ways that they want.  A lot of apps do have an embedded browser inside them  when you are viewing content.  So it is kind of the browser and it is kind of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And for all we know, they might do that in the daily.  They might give you a share and link  and who knows what they're going to do, but I might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say and they're not going to.  They say they're not going to.  I think I've seen that, but I don't know  if that's from a source or from somebody who doesn't know.  Interesting.  But, you know, sir, but Gene, I think you're right.  It's the link, but what it got me about,  about burgers Lee's piece is he turned it around  to the, to the, to the principle here, which is the URI  and that anything that's online without a URI  is not gettable through search or through links  or through analysis.  And that the principle should be that everything has a URI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. There's a standard way to fetch content.  Yeah. Yep. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So as, as people who are in the technology industry,  let me push, push back on that.  Why do we have to have this notion of URI?  Why can't we have this notion of everything  being a social object, which can be all mashed together?  Right. Which is, that's what a URI is.  But it is just like, we are looking at URI  from an older perspective.  I think in the future, it might mean entirely different  than what it is today.  Well, in fact, it doesn't have to be linked  as in book market can be linking up.  No, I agree. But it needs an address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And like you can't, you can't see it as an object  if you can't address it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, and in the world that Rupert Murdoch would like  to create, you can't, he doesn't want it,  the free flow of this movement back and forth.  He wants you to come in, look at it and leave.  And the same with Mark Zuckerberg.  And really that's what Facebook's moving towards.  Although I would say that OME is probably  more satisfied with what Mark's doing  cause at least it's got, it's social, right?  Maybe it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just speaking to Tim Burgers-Lee's issue there.  Which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what I was saying about Facebook all along.  And I'm really glad he articulated it  cause I think he did a very good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the, you know, as far as the Murdoch experiment  with the daily, if you can share it, if you can link it,  well, it's going to be not that relevant.  I have to be honest.  I mean, that's how people like to share information  and things and articles and stuff.  And if you can do it, well, you know, it clearly, you know,  you can, you know, you can get a Botox injection  that doesn't make you 16 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's this idea that the requirement is  you have to be participating in a proprietary platform.  Whether that's, I have to have a Facebook account  to do something or I have to have an iPad, but this app,  it's just this, you know, everyone has access to the web  and it's a free and public resource.  So it's just that it's, you know,  how are you going to share daily articles?  I mean, it's pretty much going to be an ad for the daily.  It's going to say download this app and subscribe  in order to see this.  It's honestly, it's not going to go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It is certainly Murdoch's option.  It is his right and privilege  to do exactly the structure he's doing.  I have no problem with that whatsoever.  And if somebody figures out paid,  that's probably a fine thing too.  I just would not bet a penny on it.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I agree.  We're talking about, we'll get to talking about Google  in just a little bit.  Apparently they offered to buy Twitter for some good money.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But first I want to mention-  Not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not enough.  I am insulted.  Sir.  Sir, you have insulted my honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we do that though,  I'd like to talk a little bit about the Ford Focus  and the great drive one challenge,  the global focus test drive.  Don't get mad at me,  but this link twitfordfocus.com goes right to a Facebook page.  That's how Ford wanted to do it.  Okay.  But it is actually, it's a lot of fun.  The new Focus is coming out the 2012.  I've seen it already.  It is spectacular.  And it's Ford's world car.  It will be the same essential model all over the world.  It's the first time Ford's done that.  And it's very exciting.  Boy, is it a good looking car.  You've heard about the EcoBoost engines  they're putting in these,  the V6 engines with a lot of horsepower,  but very great gas mileage.  That's in the tourist show.  You've heard us talk about the 2011 Fiesta,  the most fuel efficient compact car on the road today,  40 highway miles per gallon.  And this new Ford Focus is gonna blow people's mind.  Wait till you see it.  Now through December 31st, 2010,  go to twitfordfocus.com  and create a video saying why you would like to drive  the new Ford Focus.  And I'll tell you why.  Ford will send $10,000 to the charitable cause  of your choice if you win  and send you and a friend on a free trip  to a secret location somewhat  and you are up to test drive the all new 2012 Ford Focus.  Pretty cool, huh?  To learn more and what you should submit in the entry,  go to twitfordfocus.com  and you can submit the video right there.  Less than two minutes, explain why you wanna be one  of the first to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus  and how you'd start something more for a good cause  of the local market equivalent of $10,000.  So it's worldwide.  Really cool.  Twitfordfocus.com and I'm excited about Ford,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the new Ford Focus and of course that great Ford SYNC.  It is such a beautiful car.  They had it at the blog world and it is just spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you Ford for your support of this week in Google.  So Google offers two and a half billion dollars for Twitter  and according to Business Insider,  Ev felt insulted that they would offer so little.  Then somebody else comes along and says,  well, what about four billion?  Are you kidding me?  How much is Twitter worth?  If Facebook's worth 35 billion.  No, 40 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  40, I can't keep track.  There's derivatives being drawn from the stock  because it's such a high demand, which is what it is.  It's artificially ridiculously high demand.  But yeah, the latest valuation is 40.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know much about this stuff.  It seems like anything under 10 billion for Twitter  would be kind of insulting.  And it sounds like this 2.5 billion price  was just sort of floated in a conversation.  I mean, I have to remember Ev,  founded blogger and sold blogger to Google.  So they've done kind of business deals with him before.  I'm sure that he's in touch with lots of folks at Google  and maybe they were just,  they were kind of chatting over drinks,  but yeah, 2.5 seems crazy.  Crazy low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do your sources say that that actually was an offer  or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no idea.  And they're out raising money,  apparently at $3 billion valuation.  So why would they sell for 2.5?  Right.  And I don't think they need to  and I don't think they should,  given that all the people involved in this company  have had a pretty good successful run  in their previous lives.  So Ev.  It's a good team.  On top of that, their VC,  if you look at Fred Wilson,  he isn't doing too shabbily between Zynga, Twitter, Etsy  and a bunch of others.  His fund is already returning money many times over.  So he doesn't need to push this company to exit tomorrow.  And same as with some of his other investors.  So I think they should, in my opinion, go for it.  I mean, how often does an entrepreneur sit on top  of a platform which changes everything, right?  So which is fast growing, which has momentum  and it has an impact on what close to 200 million people.  And I think that is where the guys from Twitter  should be thinking because this is like once in a lifetime  opportunity to create something which is a long-term value.  I think they should actually learn the lesson  of Mark Zuckerberg, you know, not get out too early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark got out too early?  Not, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To follow his example.  Oh, follow his example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because he did.  I agree on.  And you look, well, Fred had Delicious,  which went out for, I think the number was 40 million.  And it was kind of, oh, okay.  You understand the entrepreneur who goes home and says,  honey, I think I'll turn down $40 million today.  And she says, are you nuts?  You know, I get that, but it's about vision here.  And certainly, Ev and company can afford the vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't need the money.  I love it that they don't need the money  and so they don't have to push to exit.  That's one of the problems right now,  or it has been one of the problems  with the tech marketplaces,  that there's always this push to exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and I think there's a lot of marginal thinking  going on right now.  I hate to say this, but people have to think  for the long term, people have to think big.  The valley is about big ideas and big dreams  and building big things.  If we don't do that, then we don't find,  for the lack of a better example, Oracle.  We don't have the next Google.  We don't have the next Intel.  We don't have the next InfoNara.  People need to dream big, play for the long term.  We have to do that and I think the guys from Twitter  are smart if they're going for it.  The worst case scenario is that it doesn't work out.  Well, it didn't work out for MySpace either.  Well, no, it did for the orders.  For the orders, yeah.  Murdoch paid $4 million for it.  It's Murdoch that got it.  Right, but it didn't really work out as a service.  So that's your downside.  What's the downside for everyone?  Everybody has that they won't have a few billion dollars  versus the chance to live their dream?  Come on.  And look at some of the things people are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at this Tim Burton exquisite corpse project,  Kadavra exquisite.  I tried to do this with Molly Wood and Tom Merritt.  We had a Twitter account called Novel 140  and we took turns adding a sentence,  but it went all over the place  because we all were competing with each other.  So here's what you do.  You tweet what you would like the next line to be,  but then they vote on which one is the best  and the story will get told.  I think that's kind of interesting.  I mean, it's obviously a publicity ploy,  but it's still very interesting.  Should I read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter needs more games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  It's fun.  Stainboy using his obvious expertise  was called in to investigate the mysterious glowing goo  in the gallery floor.  That's how it started.  And then the subsequent tweets, it started two days ago.  So you can still get in on this,  although it's gone quite a ways down.  I like this.  I think it's a great idea.  And if you go to the page, which is BurtonStory.com,  you can see the tweets, the candidate tweets,  what people are tweeting so far,  and then see how the story is coming out.  I love it.  I guess use the tag, the hashtag BurtonStory.  You can follow it on Twitter, at BurtonStory.  I doubt it.  I mean, I don't know if it'll come of it,  but I just think it's a really fun idea.  More games, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, West Coasters, did you get to watch  Fred Wilson v. John Doerr at Web 2.0?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was busy.  I watched your done video.  And?  What'd you think?  You know, I'm actually a big fan of Fred now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am too.  That's what I came out with is that John came off  as a bubble boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the debate?  Whether there's a bubble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I put it at the simplest level, yes.  And it was California versus East in attitude.  And Fred was just, I think, more mature and sane about it.  And they were very respectful to each other,  but they also disagreed a lot.  What'd you think, home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with you on,  I think Fred Wilson is the social generation's John Doerr.  Yeah, John's kind of hold that now.  Well said.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't mean no disrespect to John,  but I think Fred actually understands social  much better than some of his Sandal Road counterparts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both of these, we should explain for those  who are not in the know,  these are both major venture capitalists.  John Doerr, a little bit of the earlier generation though,  yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and Fred, because of his links with Delicious  and Etsy and Kickstarter and Twitter and Zynga,  he understands social so much more deeply  and intuitively that he knows what he's talking about.  And so then the conversation,  when he was actually talking about,  I think he might have been sounding the alarm  about 12 to 14 months too soon.  That may be on Fred.  So I don't want to comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred's not so much sounding alarm,  I think I see what you're saying,  but I don't think he so much sounds alarm,  but he always pulls back.  He has a caution about him.  And I don't think it's an alarm,  I think it's just the way Fred is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jim Diedre, in our chat room says,  if Facebook's worth $40 billion,  $5 per human on the planet,  I'm pretty sure there's a tech bubble.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bubble we're talking about here is an investing bubble,  a VC bubble, I think, yes?  Or an angel bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is an investment bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, is there a,  because we don't have IPOs anymore, virtually.  So you can't say there's a stock bubble anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's an inefficient marketplace  in this pre-IPO market.  That's why Facebook is so overpriced,  is because it couldn't be scarcer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, good point.  Very good point.  It's all those derivatives that are driving the value up.  Good news for you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis,  Wi-Fi Galaxy Tab coming to Best Buy, $499.  No, no, no, it's the opposite.  Well, okay, well, that's the first part.  The second part is nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I knew your punch line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I stepped all over you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you didn't, no, you didn't.  I was just gonna get your hopes up  and then dash them, that was all.  I think I'm glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I dashed them myself.  I took the picture of that notice in a Best Buy  and it spread a fair amount this week,  but it said that, oops, our circular was wrong  because Samsung pulled it back.  Yeah, not Best Buy's fault.  No, which I mean, probably it's not Samsung's fault either.  It's probably the carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you think the carriers are fighting them?  Yeah.  Yeah, because that's what you want is a Wi-Fi.  By the way, I love the Galaxy Tab.  I think it's a great form factor.  It's very nicely made.  The screen is fantastic.  It is a great Android platform.  And I know Google, we talked about this last week.  I know Google said-  Is there a button coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's no button.  Oh, good, because I'm about to do it.  I'm gonna do it.  I went out and I bought,  I had to go all over hell's half acre  to find the Virgin Mi-Fi.  Yes. $40 a month.  $40 a month.  You cannot find it anywhere.  I drove 40 miles today and got a flat tire.  I was charging through the snow with the need to get my Mi-Fi.  And so I'm gonna do that.  And I might still buy the carrier enabled device  just so I have kind of the option,  but then not use the plan.  Right.  That's my current plan.  So I pay $100 premium to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't have to activate it,  but then you have 3G in there.  Which carrier would you use in your neck of the-  That's what I was about to ask you, boss.  There's a big Verizon for New York, right?  Be my guest.  You've got Verizon, all of them have it.  AT&T, T-Mobile.  Here's the only question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I abandoned Virgin.  Well, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should understand that your Virgin is Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but I want tethering.  Right, I wanna be able to power my laptop.  I don't wanna have to have more than one.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really thinking that since you've already got Sprint,  if you got the Verizon in there,  it would also give you more flexibility, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  So Gina, you're still not gonna do it  until Google blesses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's waiting for Gingerbread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, while I'm waiting.  Well, it's Honeycomb is supposed to be the tablet version.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gingerbread is two, three and Honeycomb is three, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's three, oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'm hanging in there.  Although I did buy the Kinect this week.  I decided to get this productivity crap.  And which game?  My arms are sore.  Which game?  Dance Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Dance Central awesome?  It's awesome.  Stand up, let's do it, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We sagged last week, we danced this week.  There's so many silly.  Groove Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Groove Snap.  Yeah, it's kinda silly.  Yeah, it's really silly.  It looks so disapproving right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So.  No, Ome says he celebrates all the time.  Dance Central is a celebration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I decided to wait on the tablet.  We're probably gonna wait on the tablet till,  because there's gonna be an Apple announcement  in January as well.  I'm interested to see what the new iPad.  There'll be a new iPad, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there'll be a new iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm gonna hold out a little while longer.  Although I have to say, I am, it's been hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Gadget says 600,000 Galaxy,  actually Samsung's saying this, sold worldwide.  That's a good number.  It's, you know, I wish it had a little bit better camera.  I don't understand why it's a 3.2 megapixel camera.  Really ought to be a five or an eight in there.  But other than that,  that's the only thing I don't like about it.  It's really well made, very solid.  That's good to hear.  Great screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New one just now, right?  That was, whose was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's a ton of them coming out.  The Acer.  Oh, the Acer.  Yeah, Acer's announced several form factors too,  which is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two operating systems, three form factors.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many choices.  Yeah.  Welcome to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Where are you on tablet ownership?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's got a Galaxy.  How do you like it?  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it has WiFi.  I don't know why people are complaining about it.  No, it has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also want to pay the carrier 3G.  So we want WiFi only, not, not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At 499 instead of 599, which you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's like a WiFi only iPad, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's an awesome little device called the iPad.  You should just own that.  Stop complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He famously sent it back.  He did a re-boxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there is a lot of things I love about Jeff.  That is not one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's been, he's been holding this in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, I, I like Android a lot.  I think the iPad is very nice.  I don't know if anybody needs either, to be honest with you.  I mean, I think a good phone  with a big screen is probably sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would agree with you on that.  I actually, I only use my iPad for reading.  That's it.  And the iPhone, I, and you know, the, I,  I have the Blackberry, which is a pain to use  because of the browser.  So I end up carrying either an Android device or, you know,  or I have a MiFi with an iPhone without a SIM card.  And I use that for surfing the web.  But it is, is definitely a pain to, to have like an iPad  is not that, you know, useful in versus like an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't replace, doesn't for me replace a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually it does replace the laptop.  It does. Okay. That's good.  Yeah. But it doesn't replace the phone, right?  Like a lot of people have thought that he would,  they wouldn't have to carry a phone or a smartphone.  They'll just carry a regular phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not put, you know, the, that was one of the things  when I held this Galaxy Tab, I thought this really,  if I had a phone in this, I'd be a little happier.  I have, I guess you can use Skype or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But it just doesn't quite work.  I feel to me like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why doesn't Apple put a phone in the iPad  or somebody put a phone in a tablet?  If you're going to carry it around, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm thinking about switching to,  to just a plain basic phone very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you just have a phone and then a smart something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And just either an iPad or, or maybe one of these tablets,  you know, Samsung devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting. That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why not?  It's like, I don't, like I've just seen the number  of minutes I use on the phone has gone down  to like less than 300 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the key. Me too. I'm down to 150 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use like Skype all the time.  Like I'm on Skype.  Texting, texting a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those services, yeah, we communicate just as much.  We just don't do it in phone calls as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think the best thing I did was actually sent  an iPhone to my parents.  So now they have Skype on it.  So it's great.  Like, so we don't even have to worry about,  the only downside is my mom calls me from India  at pretty strange times.  So I have to turn off notifications.  But otherwise it's just, it's a great, great little app  and a great little device for her.  So we talk a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Google voice did everything  was a full implementation on the tablet,  that would be enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google voice,  if it worked would be fantastic.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it worked.  It works for me.  Google voice is, yeah, it works most of the time.  There's a one, once in a while I get that I can't connect  to call, but for the most part it does work.  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw phones  and tablets in version three and version four.  I mean, I think Apple holds back these things like cameras  and that kind of thing, just so they have something  to release the next year.  I wouldn't be surprised as the market, you know,  kind of absorbs more tablets and gets used to having tablets.  If we don't see one with a phone option and a headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Acer's Android smartphone is 4.8 inches.  We mocked the Dell Streak.  It's a little smaller than a Streak,  a little bigger than an Evo or a Droid X,  but I like the 1024 by 480 screen.  I think that's-  They have a seven inch and a 10 inch, right?  Yeah, they're really covering, I think this is smart.  Acer's just covering that.  And I don't know, I feel fine with two two  on one of these devices.  I don't know what Google,  I don't know what three will bring to the table that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who got the Nexus One 2.21 update this week  and freaked out and thought that it was gingerbread  and was jumping up and down in the living room.  Yeah, me too.  This guy.  Oh, oh, 2.21, way!  It's like the sight of the little robot  and the unpacking box was so exciting.  And then, oh, there's like nothing visibly different  about the update.  It's just a security update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really shouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I heard December 6th,  getting floated for gingerbread starting to roll out.  So-  For gingerbread, but not honeycombs when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Later this year or next year?  Not sure.  I don't know, gingerbread should have been any minute now.  They put the freaking statue on the lawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, the statue's on the lawn, exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  Come on, Google, we should sound of you, Leo first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once you put the statue on the lawn, you gotta ship it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I had a better browser on my BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, get rid of that piece of crap.  What are you using a BlackBerry for?  Speaking of how-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're holding on to old models, old wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's the Rupert Murdoch of cell phones.  Yeah.  Jeez, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a phone which rings everywhere.  Tough crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't, I mean, seriously,  without a browser, I mean, a crappy browser  is kind of very, you know, last-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got BBM, man.  I got like so many people on BBM.  Just-  BBM, what is that?  BlackBerry Messenger.  Oh, BlackBerry Messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the MCI mail of our age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, BlackBerry Messenger, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on.  You know, you shouldn't be talking about MCI mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was my MCI mail handle?  It's not your name, right?  It was like a number, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was.  I just confused her.  No, confused her, yeah, I was 7251, I can't, hold on.  You never forget that crappy number.  Damn.  I still-  And Gina's too young to know-  She doesn't know what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No comment.  You never had a modem coupler

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you would jam the handset into,  and never had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was in college.  Even when you were a kid.  That was my first kind of ISP was, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google CEO Schmidt says,  no Chrome OS or netbooks for Christmas.  Ooh, Scrooge.  Well, you know, I think if I'm Google,  I'm gonna watch and see what happens with Android,  aren't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, do you think this is a planned thing?  This sounded more like we slipped on our deadlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did imply that they'd be this year, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They kind of did.  And I have to say, reading the story,  I was like, wow, they announced Chrome OS way too early.  Like it's just been too long now, I think.  But they didn't say that he,  they said they didn't, he didn't really give a reason why.  But I don't know if they're holding on on purpose.  He said that the, you know,  Chrome OS is for devices with a keyboard, right?  And Android is for touchscreen, so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's gonna be a netbook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're sticking to it, right?  It's gonna be a netbook.  I'm just surprised they didn't make it up by Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I assume that they would.  I wouldn't want to make a netbook right now.  I wouldn't want to be selling netbooks right now, would you?  This is a lousy time to sell a netbook.  That's true, good point.  I think that market collapsed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Apple made one, I mean, Apple just announced-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the air is not a netbook.  The air is a thing of beauty and joy forever.  It's a thousand dollar netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a thousand dollar netbook.  Have any of you played with Jolie Cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jolie Cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's that?  Oh, you don't even know?  You need to play with it.  It's a Tariq Crim's OS.  It's free, web-based, lots of apps on it.  You really should take one of your many netbooks.  And I haven't played with it much yet.  Got it now, but I'm curious.  It's a cool OS.  Linux-based?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Google should have just bought that  and put the Chrome OS sticker on it and end with it.  I think you're exactly right, Alvin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Because it has the whole architecture of running apps.  And make it very easy to follow through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's key, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perhaps most importantly, there's a Space Invaders icon  on the desktop shop.  I think that's very interesting.  At JolieCloud.com.  I just, that's, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do what?  It is actually pretty legit, so it's worth trying out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried all, you know, for a while I tried,  the Intel did something,  there were a lot of different kind of competing  and they were all just kind of junky.  So I kind of gave up.  I liked the Ubuntu netbook remix.  I thought that was good.  So I'll try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This goes way beyond just being another Linux build.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This should actually be an environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think netbooks are going to be the hula hoops  of this past year.  I think that you're going to look back and go,  what were we thinking?  The eight track player?  Yeah.  What were we thinking?  So I've got some very good news for Gina in just a second.  We got to run because we got to get going here.  But, because we got another show,  I'm running a little bit late.  But I do want to mention our good friends  at squarespace.com who make sites so easy to build.  If you're looking to create a new website,  go to squarespace.com slash twig and play with it.  They call it the secret behind exceptional websites.  And I'd have to agree, Squarespace just is so beautiful,  so elegant.  It's hosting plus software.  So that's kind of the deal.  Not free, but in a way I don't mind not being free  because I want to know that this place,  that's going to be around, and that's very affordable.  It's $12 a month.  That's the starting price.  You get a lot of features for 12 bucks a month.  And if you use the offer code twig,  you get 10% off for the life of your account.  But also try it first.  That's the main thing.  Go to squarespace.com slash twig,  click the green button and try it for free.  You'll be able to import your existing site in.  They've got importers for all the major platforms.  No credit card needed, just the site name,  the password, and email address for recovery  and your capture and you're ready.  And 60 plus great templates  that are going to give you a great start.  And then you can do with drag and drop and Ajax,  anything that you want to make your site look unique  and beautiful and something you'd be proud of.  It's got forms, it's got forums,  it's got photo galleries integration with Flickr  and Twitter and all of that stuff.  It's just really, just a fantastic technology,  a fantastic platform.  And their server technology is rock solid.  You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  We've tried.  Squarespace.com slash twig, try it free for two weeks.  No credit card needed.  If you decide to buy, do use that offer code twig  so you get 10% off for the life of your site.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  So I don't know, is this good or not, Gina?  The Apache Foundation says it's taking over Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's very good.  It's the first time that I felt really, really  super optimistic about Wave in a box.  So Novell and a couple of other companies  who've been working on the Google Wave code  have submitted a proposal to the Apache Software Foundation.  I'm not exactly sure how this process works,  but from what I understand, they submitted a proposal.  So the ASF hasn't necessarily taken it on yet,  although correct me if I'm wrong on that, Leo.  But basically to make the Wave Wave in a box  into an Apache project,  it would be Apache Wave.  So Apache would release a Wave server product,  which is great news, you know,  because almost all of the internet is run  by the Apache web server, HTTP server.  So it kind of gives it kind of new life.  And I've actually been beta testing,  or testing out Novell Vibe,  which is a Wave-based collaboration platform,  and it's interesting.  It's pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a smart direction.  So it's doing both in a way.  It's doing a commercial version,  and then it's going to support an ASF version, we hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Wave is definitely  going to live on in different kind of incarnations  for different places, in different places,  open source and also commercial products.  So I'm kind of prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe isn't this what it should have been?  Rather than being touted as a world-changing product,  it's a new engine Wave inside, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was the intent all along,  because Wave in a box was right part  of the beginning, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Wave was always open source.  The idea that it was one of the founding principles of Wave  was that it would be federated  and that lots of different people would run servers.  So this was kind of part of the initial idea.  I think that when Google dropped support for it and said,  hey, we're not going to actively develop this anymore,  it just felt like, well, total lack of confidence from Google.  It felt like it wasn't going to go anywhere.  But now this is, I think, is really going to give it new life  and maybe a better home.  So I'm excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. It's very exciting.  So keep that book alive.  I'll put it back in your lower third  in your links on the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I'm going to have the Android book problem,  which is that I'm going to have all sorts of Wave implementations  to cover in the book.  So me and Kevin will be up writing different chapters  for different versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an interesting shift in the Android marketplace.  Ratings, content ratings.  And Google's saying you're going to be labeled mature  if you don't get your rating starting next week.  I think this is good.  Everybody's complaining.  There are a few pain points with Android.  One is the proliferation of platforms.  The other, people complain about all the time.  I don't find it a problem,  but people complain about the market all the time.  And I think the market's fine because you can get refunds.  That's a real advantage over Apple.  I guess content ratings might make it easier.  Mostly people complain because there's too much garbage,  I guess, in the marketplace.  And I don't think that's going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I think any way to raid, curate,  and help the good stuff bubble to the top  in the Android market is a good thing  because that seems to be the biggest complaint with it.  Although I agree with you.  I haven't had a shovel with the market.  I mean, you know.  I choose what I want.  I don't just install what Leo installs  or listen to what my friends are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We use AppBrain.  We watch what our friends install.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that we're really close to it.  Maybe for a casual user,  finding the really good stuff in the Android market  is a little harder.  So it sounds like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the model I think should work.  And I think we talked about this before.  The three of you should have a curated level  on top of the marketplace.  And every time I buy an app through you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you should get a spiff.  A little bonus, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to do that because I couldn't do that.  Because it's a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, just theoretically.  Yeah.  In a capitalistic world,  leaving behind your socialist roots.  I couldn't do anything for profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that we need a curatorial layer on top.  I was back at this thing I'm doing,  trying to rethink the postal service this week,  which is so much fun.  And the whole idea of a catalog and a channel,  it's that set closed curatorial layer  as opposed to a value added curatorial layer  that I think that the marketplace needs.  Like TV needs and like stores need and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ratings aren't quite that.  In fact, the ratings are from the developers.  There'll be four content rating levels.  All preteen, teen and mature.  Developers submitting newer updated applications  will be required to include a rating.  I don't know who's going to review that.  A Python script probably.  The .py, I'm rated .py.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it'll help people find porn.  You just look for the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is what this is a response to  is the opposite that Steve Jobs said.  You want porn, use Android,  which probably sold a lot of phones by the way.  Steve, just might want to think about that next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why is there so much hate for Apple in this crew?  I don't hate Apple.  Because the show is called Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't hate Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about the cloud, it's not about devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't use an iPhone just because it's a crappy phone.  Of course, I just said I don't need a phone, didn't I?  I use an iPad.  I like an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on a MacBook right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pre-computer.  Jeff has a phone, iPhone 4.  We're all on Macs using Macs.  All right, just want to make sure.  I think we're agnostic.  I think, Om, you're falling prey to that thing  that if you don't love Apple, you hate it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not falling prey to any of that.  I'm happy using my Blackberry.  I switched away from iPhone  long before all of you guys did.  I saw it all coming.  The minute they said we are with AT&T,  I said, oh, there you go.  You knew there was a problem, huh?  Oh, there was a problem, and they wouldn't acknowledge it.  No, they won't.  Like the first day iPhone came.  See, now you're the Apple hater now, see?  No, I'm not the Apple hater.  I love Apple and I love Android.  I just love everything.  Oh, yeah.  Just till I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think we often get accused of being,  I mean, on the Apple show, I'm accused of,  I mean, I get accused of all of this stuff,  and I think that the point is not to love or hate anything.  It's just technology, come on.  I mean, it's just not.  You don't have to,  people treat it all like a sports team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's, you know, if you're not on the Apple team,  you must be a Google team member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a team sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know that it has happened though.  If you really look at it, it just is,  the discourse has devolved into that, like,  either or situation right now,  and I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think we're fair.  I think we try very hard.  Everybody here tries very hard to be fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We try to be.  There's definitely, Google and Apple kind of represent  these kind of two different, like, cultures or tribes.  I mean, just like values-wise, you know,  openness versus, very generally speaking,  but it's all technology, and both, you know,  I think both companies make credible technology  that we definitely, we're a little hard on jobs sometimes,  I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were very, very, very hard on Facebook,  and then have come back around  and are, you know, ready for the group hug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No sweaty Zuck-Hugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sweaty Zuck-Hugs, ooh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you gotta love this, Jeff Jarvis.  They're throwing eggs at houses  that are blurred in Google Street View.  In Germany.  You're the guy who called it Blermany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, somebody else.  I wish I could take credit for that.  I can't. I help spread it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan writing in Search Engine Land says,  people, Deutsche Welle reported,  people are egging homes in Essen that were blurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you throw an egg at Pixels, does it splat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing that they would go to this much effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the whole thing has just gotten so wonderfully,  fateful and common. Talk about a team sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're either, you know,  you're either a Google fan or a Google enemy, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and people, now neighbors are getting mad  at each other, because they're, you know,  I don't want my home pixelated.  Well, I do.  Google's Munich headquarters, not for the whole country,  but for Munich, were pixelated.  What?  Because some tenant in the building wanted it so.  There was also another site,  oh God, I don't have the URL right now,  that is having people go in and identify the addresses  of all the pixelated homes.  Well, that's how they're egging them.  So far, about 11,000, exactly.  And so there's now a,  there's more attention to those addresses  than to just everybody else's address,  because there's now a directory of them,  a guy named Jens Best did this.  If you search for him, you'll probably find it.  And then if you go to Google, in a lot of places,  you'll see over the pixelization,  as you can do with any photo anywhere,  now there are little photos there,  and you can mouse over and you see the buildings.  So it's a whole bunch of hoo-ha for nothing.  I'm gonna get myself in trouble here,  I think Omen's gonna come after me,  but I think that there's some strange similarity  that goes back to my argument about Germans  and their private parts, which is that-  It's always about the private parts, isn't it?  But the same kind of,  I'll try to come with a less loaded word than hysteria,  that we see over the TSA this weekend,  we see in Germany over-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think the TSA thinks hysteria?  Yeah, I think so.  I guess I haven't gone through it.  I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tweeted a whole bunch,  I'm pissing them off like crazy, this crew,  but I tweeted a whole bunch.  There's absolutely no protest at the airports.  Everything's going really smoothly.  Today's opt-out day.  And nothing happened.  But there's this idea that,  oh my God, no one can get within n inches  of my private parts, that's the American thing,  and the German thing is,  no one can show my building where I live.  And in both cases, it's an emotional reaction, I argue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a bizarre thing to say,  oh, don't show my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know- And they're saying,  but we think it's bizarre that they go to a sauna  and show their private parts,  and we here think that's the highest possible violation  you could imagine.  I don't mind showing them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want somebody to jiggle them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, well put that line there.  I'll show them if you don't jiggle them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that could be the name of the spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me show you.  I just want to do it, that's all.  Leo, did you ever do a show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like just wear an underwear below the desk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  In fact, just the show before this one,  we were doing security now.  I saw this, nobody saw it,  because I went into a commercial,  and I saw, I have two monitors,  and I saw Steve get up, he's like wearing shorts.  He's got a nice button down shirt,  but he gets up, it's whoa, party time down there.  But I think that it is a little bit of a Hobson's choice.  You've got an X-ray that we don't really know  how dangerous it is.  It sounds like it's not, which is good news.  Or you get a very intimate groping.  It seems like that's not such a great, at all,  just because I want to go home for Thanksgiving.  I don't know if that's hysteria.  Especially since it doesn't seem,  I don't think that you can make a case  that it improves security in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you're trying to prove a negative.  You're trying to say, which is of course impossible,  and it's impossible both ways.  Without this, we'll never know whether it improves it,  we'll never know whether it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think we know it doesn't improve it,  because there's a great video of Adam Savage  of Mythbusters talking about going through TSA  back and forth, back and forth,  and he showed what he had, he forgot, he had this,  these are razors this long.  He had two of them, and they never stopped him.  This stuff doesn't work.  Maybe they were fans.  Yeah, maybe, oh, it's Adam,  he's just carrying razors around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, somebody on Twitter tells me  that the site in Germany is finda.spixel,  F-I-N-D-E-D-A-S-P-I-X-E-L.DE.  And you can just go on.  F-I-N-D-E-D-A-S-P-I-X-E-L,  finda.spixel.de.  And Jens Best did this, and it's really quite hilarious,  because they've gotten, let's see, how many do they have now?  19,000 buildings identified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was surprised,  there's almost a quarter of a million people have opted out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they played out less than 3%,  but still, I thought that was a large number, too.  This is a significant number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what does gefunden mean?  To find.  Okay, so I'm gonna press gefunden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it'll find something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means you found one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So you add it to the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the bottom of it, if you go to those addresses there  and just click on those.  So I'm sorry.  Well, not all of them, though.  Some of them are...  So here's some.  Oh yeah, no, that's what there is.  So just click on those addresses,  and you see this hilarious, I would say, desecration.  Oh yeah, there's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's one.  It's just silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like, you mean you don't know what that is?  If I were standing there, I would know what, I mean,  what has that done?  It's really cuckoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you get a sense of what your neighbor is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see these row of houses, they're all exactly the same.  That's really funny.  And just this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a giant, it's just very funny looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's kind of pointless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know who does it.  I mean, it looks like the Google employees doing this  is kind of disgruntled anyway.  It's going, ah!  That'll smush you out.  I'll take care of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wasn't there also a staged birth on the streets of Berlin  that was captured by us?  Yeah, it was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I like Jeff's idea where they publish  where they're going so that everybody can put on a play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We can act out all sorts of drama on the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what people thought had happened almost,  that there was a birth there and it was staged.  My theory is it's in front of an advertising agency.  And so I'm guessing it was a clever trick for that.  But I think it was on the list, Leo, you can show it,  where you see a baby being pulled out.  I think it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, that they should blur.  Blur that, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you look down the list, I think I said not true.  And there you got it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it performance art or real birth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, click on the Gizmodo link.  Gizmodo has the full image.  You know, it's just too good an image.  Like, I don't know.  Yeah, it was super pointy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the naked guy in the boot of a car?  What was that all about?  That one I can't figure out.  Who are those Germans?  That's staged because there's like a broken umbrella.  There's this and that.  I mean, it looks, it's like a murder mystery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely people playing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so it says, click on the shot above  to see the baby in its full, fresh.  Oh, I don't think this is fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was driving.  Oh, it is because Google confirms it's fake.  It's not really the address.  It was shot as if, and then sent out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that kind of looks like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just too perfect a shot.  You can see everything.  I mean, you know, you can see the baby, the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the guy on the phone.  The guy doing the pointing.  Guy on the phone pointing.  Quick, get an ambulance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got a baby.  They pixelated the license plate, which is a nice touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently there's a hospital right across the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well that guy's type can take some of the,  yeah, all right, there you go.  You just, yeah, all right, now I believe it's fake.  But that was spreading around.  Yeah, with no record of a street birth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right.  You do see how false,  I was whacking that mole a couple of times.  People I know were saying, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get this in email.  We'll get this in our email 10 years from now.  Yeah.  Did you see?  Thank God for Snopes.com.  All right, we got a couple more stories  and we're gonna get our picks of the week too  and our tip and our number and all of that stuff  before we go any further, though I'd like to mention  our friends at Citrix who do a great product  that will save you a lot of time and money traveling  and will make your conference calls much more engaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't, I think they're gonna invite folks who donated.  And you gave money, right, Leo?  So you'll probably get an invite soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm supposed to get a t-shirt or something.  Facebook's trying to own the trademark for the word face.  Does that seem right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing more to say.  Yep.  Nothing more to say.  Did you like the Google?  I really liked the Google Doodle for Thanksgiving.  Is it still up?  I have to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, it is still up.  So for people like me who will be saying tomorrow morning,  how the hell do I make this turkey?  You can go to Google.com.  Yeah.  And there's six recipes from-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ina Garten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ina Garten, yeah, who's a barefoot contestant.  Oh, that's the barefoot contestant.  Oh, that's neat.  And there's a few recipes there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a little different for Google.  Usually you click the Doodle and you get a search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get a search results or a special landing page.  Yeah, this is kind of, it's interesting.  This is real kind of special content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I get a different recipe if I refresh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can click on the thumbnails on the left there.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brussels sprouts, no!  Oh, Brussels sprouts are good if they're made right.  Oh, I hate them, I hate them.  Oh, you know what?  Just put a little bacon in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bacon will make Brussels sprouts really good.  So you fry up some bacon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you saute the Brussels sprouts in the bacon.  That makes anything good.  And then you throw the Brussels sprouts out  and eat the bacon, it's great.  No, actually I like Brussels sprouts.  I just feel like anything that tastes like that's  gotta be good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true, it is very satisfying.  You feel very self-priced and healthy.  And then you can eat the mashed potatoes  and gravy without guilt.  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there are mobile apps for the Thanksgiving host.  So next, when you go to the Thanksgiving,  bring along a mobile app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got these checklists  to make sure you got everything done, recipe apps,  there's a few different drink mixers  for when Uncle Bert and Aunt Marge get kind of unbearable.  You can kind of give them martini.  There's a few mobile apps I linked there on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is great, this is a Gizmodo page, Mixologist.  The one they like the best is called Chow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a food...  It has a Thanksgiving dinner coach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is good, and these are all Apple apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're Apple and they have the Android section too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanksgiving planner, yeah, see this is...  Okay, Apple, Chow, pictures of turkeys, gorgeous graphics,  Android, checklist, things to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And QR codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And QR codes.  That's it, right there in a nutshell,  Android versus Apple, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, there's one Android out there  with some good pictures of roasting turkeys.  And Blackberry, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing.  What is Thanksgiving?  We do not know, we're Canadian.  It's Canadian, that's right.  We celebrated last month,  what are you talking about Thanksgiving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Blackberry does two things, it makes phone calls  and it gets email with some things you can't do  very well on any of your devices.  Well, Blackberry...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Email, Zuckerberg's killing email,  there is no email anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what's this email that you talk of which you talk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I've seen a bridge on sale in Brooklyn  since I moved here, man, I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Email's dead, don't you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw your bridge in Brooklyn.  I love it, I'm gonna tell you more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must have heard that once or twice,  you lived in Brooklyn.  Yeah, I read that a lot of times.  So let's get our tip of the week, Ms. Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tip of the week, this one I love,  this is a Google Voice tip.  You can record calls in Google Voice,  you have to press four when you're actually on the call.  Not a lot of people know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't know it for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's incoming calls only  and a recording breaks in and lets the other party know  that it's being recorded.  I hate that part, I wish they'd let me stealthily do it.  Yeah, it would be nice if it was stealth, right?  Well, a lot of people don't know that you can do that,  but now in the Gmail interface, you can receive calls,  Google Voice calls through Gmail, there is a record button,  a little red record button,  kind of like Skype's call recorder.  So you can click that and you can record calls  and it gets recorded to your Google Voice inbox,  which is really handy if you're talking to your accountant  or doing an interview, but it's only for incoming calls  and it works the same way as when you press tap four.  I think it's just gonna expose this feature  that a lot of people didn't know about.  So the little record button is kind of rolling out slowly.  So next time you receive-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would that be incoming only?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's a good question  because it doesn't make sense, right?  I mean, you really would want it either way.  I'm not sure why it is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I interview people, you know, I wanna record the call,  so I use Skype and call recorder for that,  which works really very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which works great.  Yeah, there's no technical,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't think of a technical reason for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't think of a technical reason either,  maybe it's just about, yeah, it doesn't make sense.  I mean, the consent, you can get it either way,  it doesn't matter if the call's incoming or outgoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am recording this call!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you record stuff on record calls and voice often, Leo?  I haven't used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm frequently on interviews where they use it,  which is smart.  I mean, if you're a journalist, it's a great feature, actually.  Wonderful.  Our students learn that early in.  Right away, yeah.  Our number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.  Let's see here, let's see.  I have it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here it is.  Google.  So, for what it matters,  Palin is winning the numbers in Google searches.  That makes you happy or sad, up to you,  but she's generating 16 times more queries than Mitt Romney,  14 times more than Newt Gingrich,  38 times more than Mike Huckabee,  and 87 times more than Tim Pawlenty.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what Nate Silver would have to say about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of 538.com.  Yeah.  Does more searches mean anything?  Yeah, does it mean anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Exactly.  That's why I don't know.  Well, but it, Facebook, remember we had this as a number  about three weeks ago after the midterms,  that there was some correlation between Facebook friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  There was a very direct correlation, actually.  There was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can come up with many theories behind that.  The younger, hipper candidate in a anti-incumbent world  or whatever, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a way you can, Gina,  like some programmatic way that we can do this,  that find out, you know, compare searches?  Does Google reveal that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they do the zeitgeist, right?  I'm not sure if they reveal, like, I mean,  I've honestly, I've been trying to-  Well, yeah, you can,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nevermind, what a cliche.  Sorry, Jeff, we just don't-  Real cliche of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wired and Googled.  Yeah, all right.  I was gonna do pick, please.  Have I done pick, please as my pick of the week?  I think I have, but I wanna mention it again.  We talk a lot about Instagram on all of our shows.  It's a really great Apple iPhone app  that encourages you to take pictures,  and there's a social aspect you can like and comment.  And it's frankly about the only reason  I ever use my iPhone anymore,  is because I wanna take pictures with Instagram  and share them with my friends.  There is actually a really good version of this  for Android called Pick, Please,  and I think it's very interesting.  They seem to be in a feature war.  P-I-C-P-L-Z, it's a free Android application.  And in some ways, Pick, Please has an advantage.  For instance, it has actually a web interface  so you can browse through people's pictures.  All the liking and following and commenting  of Instagram is the same.  There is an interesting feed where, just like Instagram,  and I think this is something new  that the Pick, Please people added  because of Instagram.  They have the filters that Instagram has.  I wouldn't say as good,  but people are using them to some advantage.  I'd like to see more people use it  because it's kind of fun.  P-I-C-P-L-Z, I'm Leo Laporte on Pick, Please,  if you wanna follow me.  And if you have an Android phone  and you'd like to kind of take part  in this social photography,  it's the return of mo-blogging, everybody.  It's back.  Yay.  And a lot of people's lunches, mostly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I wanna go back to what Om said earlier.  He's really right that we're just kind of limping along,  still using old forms and old assumptions.  Old, in this case, is only five to 10 years old.  But there is a need for something to break out.  Well, what do we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's have a manifesto.  What's the Om Manifesto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeez, why are you asking me these tough questions?  You started it.  You started it.  He just gets to make up,  I mean, if Jeff gets to make up numbers,  if Dina gets to say, press four, record, call,  I gotta come up with something smart.  I'm not coming back on your show ever again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, nevermind, forget I said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no idea how to fix this thing.  If I did, I would have written about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't be a lousy blogger.  You'd be out there with a startup.  Yeah, something like that.  Actually, I think GigaOM is a startup, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
