I know I always get blamed  I'm always gonna blame we did try Stacey didn't really try to change the subject last week. Well, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes, as I have mentioned to a few people in who you mailed me about 18,000  the there is going to be some intersection of tech and  politics  Maybe more so than usual this coming year  That neutrality that neutrality is gonna be on the table free trade is gonna impact Silicon Valley  Then there's gonna be a lot of that. I think it's gonna be very interesting and we will cover it in that regard, but I  Somebody said, you know, not all Trump voters are stupid and I don't think we said that and I certainly don't believe that so I  Apologize if I gave that impression  How about Alphabet self-driving car subsidiary Waymo? What about that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yay, self-driving minivans

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I was talking to Lisa the other day and she said what we really need is self-driving buses  Is do we really want to  Put a lot of individual people in cars on the road, even if the cars driving itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well from a legit depending on in cities  Self-driving buses make sense in suburban areas  No, I mean I would love a minivan actually that self-driving that I would go like a little minibus route among our neighborhood to get  My kids to school. Yeah, exactly  most yeah, I  Think the idea is once it's self-driving it'll come to you when you need it pick you up and then wander off

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the end game of self-driving cars is the end of personal car ownership because that's really wasteful  You know my car, you know a ton of metal  rubber plastics  Is sitting in the parking lot all day  And so with with with with the future of autonomous vehicles is you don't even have to own a car

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just what you know, you you uber it basically and and you get a different is I wrote this in what we're Google do  You you you get a different car for a different need right going on a nice date. Give me the give me the Audi  Holland some crap from Home Depot. Give me the pickup truck. That could be a nice date by the way the pickup truck

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll go into Home Depot. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think she means it. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just gonna say that I'm pro Home Depot for those pro Home Depot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't don't get me wrong, but date night

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure, you get it like you go to a nice restaurant drink a bottle of wine and then you can follow some home improvement shopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mentioned drunk Home Depot. That's a different matter entirely  Oh, well, it's not like you could hollow out the the aisles and make a little house inside. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have never done that. I will work on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I saw a video somebody doing that like at a big big box store

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There people live in those sometimes well, yeah, so there was a story just just today about  authorities trying to get teens IKEA is trying to stop teens from  Making it a thing to sneak inside and sleep exactly. Oh that reminds me. What's that book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everyone read it when they were kids the mixed up files of Miss Basil E  Franken weller  Someone help me come on  They it's these two kids and they go what they run away from home and they live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art  Anyone no one like this was just me. I think this is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Excuse me. No, pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. This is a YouTube video of two idiots at night in IKEA  Definitely Swedish  Hey, the good news is IKEA you can get food  Meatballs and fries that is the most unhealthy looking meal. Oh and a little lingonberry jam on the side  They're definitely sweet. It is good. That is you like the lingonberry, huh? He's drinking lingonberry juice to  Basil Basil E. Frank Weiler. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go. Okay, so this book they go and they live in the I would like to read it. That looks good  It's a great book. I mean it's for kids. Yeah. Oh  Oh, I was thinking about self-driving cars. So now we're going back to our original  conversation I was thinking  That the distribution and how you're gonna apportion out like the number of cars and where they're gonna be located  Yeah  so I think they might learn a lot from like the airline industry and if you think about like different hub and spoke models for like  airports, so I'm just trying to think and federal expert and FedEx. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, it just takes a distribution  So maybe those companies have something to offer here that you know other people

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Write so Stacy, but there's another interesting part about that  Which is that of course airlines by the need of all the regulation and the and the spots and all that  They're scheduled if airlines could be more on demand. Oh  Right, it'd be a fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As soon as we get 25 more people this flight will take off. Yeah anybody anybody want to go to Cleveland?  Yeah, no, we only need 25 more  We'll see you don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Trains and cars are gonna be scheduled. I  Feel like self-driving cars may end up being more scheduled than not  They're probably gonna look closer to like a city bus  They should just run or a subway that runs kind of constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I remember talking to Brad Templeton who is of course a legend on the internet was one of the creators of use net and is  Big in autonomous vehicles now  I don't know if he's at Google but he's very much involved in it and it was his he this was a couple of years ago  At a Christmas party of all things and he I talked to him for a long time and he really was of the opinion that the  Key to self-driving cars is eliminating auto ownership. The last thing you want is, you know, everybody in the country owning  You know 1.25 cars. It's a waste of raw natural resources  But you wouldn't need one. It's just as you said Jeff you might get a car that would take you to an RV that you would  then take you to  Pinnacles National Monument that would then take you home and a car would take you the rest away  But and I think I could see uber doing this. I really can I think that that's what uber sees as its endgame, right?  Hmm. The question is can uber make it there because this year uber lost three billion dollars  lost  Three I'm not talking about revenue. This is what they lost  They've never been profitable have they

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  AMD was never profitable is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They are spending the investors money at a burn rate that is astounding they  The revenue was five point five billion. They lost three  That's up from two point two billion loss last year  Uber does not comment on financials. They're not publicly held. So this comes from us  This comes from our friends at the information  Amir a Friday once again with the great scoops  That is just mind-boggling  They lost the gross revenue was affected somewhat by the fact that they lost China  Right, that's true. Oh, right couldn't grow at the rate  But they would have been but you know along with the growth in revenue comes to growth and losses

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow  Does it show their loss per trip Oh  Interesting or is that a metric?  I assume that's a metric that would make sense for them, but I don't know but that's that's you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unless you knew how many trips they did again uber doesn't talk about any numbers  Right lift is estimated to be losing about a hundred million a quarter or four hundred million in the year  Why boy uber's private valuation is 70 billion dollars  But some of that was based on the fact that it was in China  They had to sell the Chinese operations to a DD  Although they have a 17% equity stake in DD so that is not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is a loss to get them on everyone's phone  Until they can replace drivers with which is a huge expense. I think that's the key right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and ultimately in an environment where everybody has to take an uber because they don't own a car  But I have to say, you know my daughter  Besides the fact that she had a number of accidents so there was a safety issue involved, you know fender benders  It was more expensive. I told I said we're getting rid of your car  Take an uber anytime you need an uber or a lift to take it and I'll pay for it  and it did end up being cheaper than car ownership when you include gas insurance and  and accidents where does she live a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bay Area. Oh, okay, like you couldn't  You couldn't do that in Texas  You have to be somewhere where there's enough density of ubers to make it worthwhile, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, no, I was just thinking about any public. I mean, I assume sometimes she walks places or takes public transit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's in college so on campus she walks

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But anytime she if she wants to get into town and the town's not that far away, but it's a few miles  She uses an uber and there's enough uber and uber X's and lifts around  It's it's easier than a cab really I think a lot of people in urban areas like New York and San Francisco  Do that they don't own car. Well for years people in New York haven't owned cars because it's just impractical and take mass transit  But uber makes that even more doable  That's true. I never rent a car anymore. I'm always uber in places. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so let me ask you about that. So so when I go to San Francisco though

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I come into the airport and I you know go to Facebook and I go to Facebook and I go to Facebook  And I you know go to Facebook and that goes somewhere else I go back to Facebook and then I go to a restaurant and they go  Somewhere else then I go to Google and by the time you add up all the ubers  And waiting for them and all that the rental car in that kind of market in LA and San Francisco still seems better to me  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess so I take I  Plan my trips a little bit more clumped  So I do plan around the fact that I'm not gonna have a car and then I also usually  End up spending half the time in the city  So I rent the car in the city and then I want to drop it off at the airport and they charge like a hundred  Dollar change fee or it's like a hundred dollar fee to drop something off elsewhere  So it almost like I've worked it out. It always comes out either even or less  when I done it, so  But it could be because I'm planning I'm thinking that way well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But also remember Jeff that's a high intensity use and that's not how you use it all year round  So you're probably you may be right that for that particular situation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just saying I still I would like to stop writing cars, too  I grew a Stacy, but I just find that especially in California. I can't right however on a year-round basis

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It would stop still probably be. Oh, yeah. Yeah financially well  I feel like so much no cuz I use that car I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have to take my kid to school and pick her up. So that's two trips a day  If you go to work, yeah  I'm just thinking about like how the rest of the world may live if you're in

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One thing though a lot of the expenses of it of car ownership are hidden  Mm-hmm, right. I mean, that's why we love that automatic because suddenly you understand it costs you four dollars to drive your daughter to school  And four dollars to get her back and then you add to that the cost of insurance the monthly fees

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know this the the times I smash into fences or I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's clear to me that I save money with my daughter  But that's because of her use pattern and so forth  But and I just think a lot of the expenses of a of car ownership or hidden expenses in any event  I don't I don't know if uber has a path to profit. I mean  the take rate  From the drivers is about 20% of gross revenue  If you eliminate the drivers  There's a much better take rate  But there's also a much higher upfront capital cost to creating the autonomous vehicles and buying them and so forth, right?  I'm wonder. I mean, I think uber is a high-risk bet because  It says because it operates and this is a mirror or Friday again in the information because it operates in  Developed markets that will generate the biggest proportion of expected  Profits in the industry places like the US uber can afford to lose money for a long time in the developing markets where any?  Profits will be tiny by comparison  so  China India  hard to make money  Many of those developing markets are still a land-grab opportunity  Or uber firmly believes it's worth losing some money in the near term in order to become the market leader after which you can focus on  Profits, so it's exactly as you said they're buying market share right now  This is the Silicon Valley approach right then. It's just that this is a very expensive place, you know way to buy market share  Google you know didn't have to lose six billion dollars a year to become the premier search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay, but think about something that requires actual infrastructure  remember back in like  1998 or something when Akamai was building out its network and this is and  The only reason that those companies and there were lots of companies doing that the telecoms Amazon's the canonical example, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I was trying to pick physical infrastructure. I guess they have no that's what they spent all their money on was distribution centers. Yeah  They lost money for a decade  Because they pumped every bit they made Amazon did into  warehouses  So similar I think high capital. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's go ahead  With the tech boom with all the like telecoms infrastructure the bankruptcies in 2000 and 2001 or what helped that because then all right  What you had is these massive capital expenses that were just written off and then so I wonder if something like if uber goes bankrupt  For example, I'm not saying they will  That would be like a veritable bargain. So exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you know what that's by the way, that's history says that that's what happens in boom busts  And the most recent one was the dot-com bust in the year 2000  All those companies and all that invested money that went, you know was lost except that the infrastructure they built things like fiber  Made it possible now for the next generation of companies to succeed you can go back to the railroad same thing happened with a transcontinental railroad  All the companies that built the transcontinental railroad went bankrupt and flamed out  but we got a railroad and  Subsequent, you know train companies did fine  So there's a very good precedent for that. I think you're right. Stacy that it could be the uber is  You know the transcontinental railroad of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they'll leave us they'll leave us awesome AI. That's that's the question is so then what is their asset that actually retains its value or  either market share does it I mean, yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe this explains why Google or alphabet has decided not to build cars  They don't want to be in that position  They they they want to be the supply they want to be the Levi's and the picks and the axes to the gold rush

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The picks and shovels knew they were gonna come out today

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Love driving that one out Gutenberg me next. Don't worry

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  drink drink drink  Yeah, I wonder whether those deals will require things like  Android auto in an Android auto  You know  You know what totally lost me in other words will will will Google require that you use their connectivity and their entertainment and their no  mapping in the car that you well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe you get maybe not require but maybe Fiat Chrysler buys a bundle that includes all of that and the autonomous

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know because you know the bet is that if you're not driving not paying attention driving everywhere in the car. Yeah. Yeah entertainment matters

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, actually that makes sense big

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the mapping side it could be a legal liability because if you think about you have to figure out  What's part of the intelligence of the car because if you're if you're selling that you're gonna be liable for that, right?  So you've got a really strictly control what's gonna be happening there like the information coming to him from the car  So where do you draw the line in those packages? The music system? I don't think that it's gonna affect  You know the car really I don't know. I drive faster when I'm listening to things like rage against the machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the user interface will be will be hey Google take me to the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and there would be an opportunity to monetize that in the way Google monetizes. I don't support navigation yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She says oh you she heard you. Yeah, she did nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I've got a weird thing. I just want to mention just a side note on Android Auto real quickly because you know the Android Auto app now  Will launch on the pixel?  Automatically as soon as you get in the car  Well, unfortunately every time Lisa gets in her car, I guess I've paired my Bluetooth  So I'm sitting in the house Lisa gets her car and my all of a sudden my pixel goes to auto and for the life  I mean I couldn't figure out what was going on. It took me a few days ago. Oh Lisa just left  She's I'm pairing to her

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's the other thing is my pixel see yeah for the last like four or five days  It doesn't go today, but but it keeps on telling me I didn't hear what you said  Did you talk to me? I didn't hear what you said. I didn't understand what you said  Something is triggering without me saying  He why G double G le?  That was what was the case for a while right so certain voices would come on but they weren't saying the brand they weren't saying Google  And I was in a hotel room that was some kind of war and buzz and it was very strange. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if I were like a marketer I would be like  You know ask ask about you know Levi's jeans and then suddenly your phone's gonna come up and you're like what the  Like little guerrilla marketing tactics conspiracy. Oh  Subliminal

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Triggering that's happening already if you want to a real good conspiracy theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, it is inaudible audio signals from you coming from your TV to your phone. Oh  That is actually a real thing. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We don't know how widespread it is I was like it's not a conspiracy theory it's it's actually a real thing. Yeah  Yeah, your phone is literally listening to your TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This was a year ago in the Atlantic  The TV's on in the background. You're replying to a quick email on your phone nearby  You don't know but the devices are communicating during the commercial the TV emits an inaudible tone of your phone picks it up and  Somewhere far away a server makes a note both devices probably belong to you  And that's real that's happening silver push is the is the leading provider of audio beacons  inaudible ultrasonic  pings that devices  Respond to you have to have an app installed with the silver push code, but apparently there's a  I think this is just a matter of time right where this is widespread  That's the paranoia people are always saying to me  Oh, I would never have an Amazon echo in my house because I don't want Amazon to listen to our conversations  That's the least of it. Yeah, it's listening but in ways that are a little more subtle. I think  But I think it's a little more subtle  It's listening but in ways that are a little more subtle I think  But I don't know that's why I call out a conspiracy theory  By the way to this point here's an article from New York magazine  Google home secret weakness the word Google. Oh, I love this article. Yeah. Yeah. Well tell us about it Stace

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's basically that Google is is it hard to listen to and hard to say is it both of those are just hard to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  hard to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean it is kind of a weird word to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's this is my favorite quote from the article when yelling at the speaker to shut off an alarm in the morning  It often comes out as a mumbly  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nunciate perfectly in the morning right Dutch it'd be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  Yeah, that's the plane that they crash landed  Is that that's it internal check the internal gardens that was funny that they did that little self mockery, isn't it? Yeah  And by the way, the reason there's no butter on the toast is that Mark doesn't eat anything. He didn't kill himself

She's getting away do it now  I don't want to talk. I can just text Jarvis through a messenger bot that I built  Well, this happens all the time in our house

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, my bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this has been pretty fun  But I need some more ideas for Jarvis. So leave them in the comments and i'll try to build some of them  All right movie time Jarvis. You got it mark first. I need to teach you to make me some more popcorn  So what was the point of making this video? I'm just curious humanizing facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because uh, that's so I hadn't seen the fact that they made a promo video for this  Yeah, isn't that great? Which he says below?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, obviously this is a joke video, you know, it's not the real thing and yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I got the impression. Okay from the article that those things had actually happened like that  You know it's I thought it said in the article like the like every once in a while  It makes mistakes like turning off the lights when priscilla's downstairs in her office  So some of this is true the nickelback stuff. I don't think is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So some of this is true the nickelback stuff I don't think is true but the stuff about the ai for the parents  Tying into his crest on lights system. All of that's actually real  Okay, and being able to talk to something and text it through facebook messenger is also real  so  I don't I don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, it actually I think bothers me a little bit if the promo video bled into the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know someone's saying the nickelback stuff is 100 true

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow, so that there is no yeah, there is no but he can he can there are no good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hard code that in he's not wrong. But yes, I mean he could hard code jokes and stuff in I doubt it and that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, well, first of all, that's not jarvis's voice, right? I don't think he got morgan freeman to record  No, he did with the voice tracks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, let's see morgan freeman is that dude in the video. So is morgan freeman really jarvis? I don't know  So USA Today says that morgan freeman will

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Be morgan freeman. So yes, I think that's more of the promo bleeding into the reporting and this I don't like this is very much  a manipulation by by facebook of this story  I think  And what I don't like it is when stuff that's in the promo  The made-up comedy promo becomes fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, I'm highly suspicious so down at the bottom. There's a there's a there's a guardian piece guardian has been quite  Um lot. I recently I love them dearly with a lot. I just you knocked them you knocked them hard today

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I forgot what it was about. I did. Yeah. Oh, yeah the peak guardian peak guardian. Was that it? Yeah  Yeah guardian. Yeah  I can't remember what they were talking about. But yeah, it was a guy who's giving up all technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they loved it. They loved it. Of course. They absolutely loved it. Uh, no, I didn't put it at the bottom  I put it somewhere in the  Um, the guardian says 200 2016 the year facebook became the bad guy  Yeah, right. So I think that there you know, and I don't say this cynically, but I think there is some desire to  humanize  Uh facebook. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think  I think that you're gonna start. Okay  We need I need like a buzzer politics alert  But it's not really politics we had a great interview on monday with tim woo who of course is a genius  Uh, rick creator of the master switch, but his new book is about the ad industry. You gotta read it jeff  I know I do I don't I have it actually brilliant  Brilliant, uh, and it was a fascinating interview. It should have gone on for 10 hours  There's so much stuff to talk about in there. But one of the things we were talking about is  uh the techniques which  The trump campaign used to win the election very very very effectively and what I do think is going to happen is that  I think mark is the number one person who have learned from this  And I think this is to me a little bit of an example of manipulating  the story  I mean when does pr cross into manipulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's a funny thing. So last night I went to a dinner with a it was off the record  So a pr company to be unnamed getting together a bunch of journalists and technologists to kind of say  What do we do? What are our clients do?  It was an interesting conversation  But as somebody said to me afterwards a little paradox in this dinner that you know pr invented fake news  um, uh and and and invented all that but but um  It's amazing to me  How all these parties so i've had conversations now with facebook and google over the last two weeks about this and they're they're they're they're  I I will testify they were taking this. Yes, they're taking this very seriously incidentally

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm glad google is because it's really not facebook. That's that's the major culprit. It's google

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So so I i'll say what I said to them not what they said to me  um, but one of the things that I said is that is that  You know i've said this publicly you guys the platforms try to argue that you are reflecting the world  And you act as if the world is then true. The world is warped because you exist. Yeah, right? It's shroediger's  Platform right? Um, and and and they're not being oddly they're not being savvy enough about that. They're not  Recognizing so my advice is that you have to map the distortions so that you can act differently at the points of distortion  um, and how do you do that I I would like to see you know, take all of the  Of the conversation on reddit and this is a guy at daimler in in germany  he said that we take all the conversations at reddit and  um  huffing and post on the guardian and breitbart and and and stick them into watson or into google's ai and say give me the patterns  And show me where these distortions are, you know, you can have a disagreement, you know  How many coats of shellac should you put on wood?  but to have a  politically motivated controversy  Created controversy is climate change real  Right are different things and you've got to treat them differently because one is being  Warped and manipulated and they and they don't kind of admit that so I think they've got to also be more transparent about the manipulation  To change the focus from the platforms to the manipulators. The problem now is everybody says oh, it's your fault google  It's your fault facebook ignoring the guy the bad guys were doing this blame the mess and so they yeah  Yeah, they literally and they've got to focus more on who's doing this and why?  And and I think the platforms have to be able to say  Here's their tricks folks. Here's how they're trying to manipulate you. Here's how they're trying to use us  Now that's you know risky for them and it makes them seem less than all-powerful right now  They shouldn't want to seem all-powerful. They should want to seem human

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but using these tricks to manipulate us  To think they're human  Maybe i'm just now cynical now and I don't I don't I've but you know me i've never liked pr  I've never gone to I do do vendor meetings. I don't do talk to pr people  I don't like to be spun and i'm allergic to to the point where I actually  You know, I mean everybody else in my in my profession  Does that but I won't yeah, I know and I respect you for it  Well, but you know, maybe it I mean there's a side effect. I guess that you become less important

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I there are there are there are good and nice pr people who indeed try to get you to the right person

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The facts, yeah, but I think I can do most of that without their help  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, go ahead. Stacey. Sorry. No. No, i'm i'm listening to you guys. I'm thinking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This going forward and what do you do?  Well, I do I do talk to pr people, yeah  I am acutely aware of being spun. I would also say that most people in  Yes, everyone is going to try to manipulate you all the time and you have to be aware of that and you have to be a bit  Cynical and I think that comes with critical thinking and something that we don't emphasize in school at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Amen, that's the key. That's what emily is saying in our chat room. We need a course on how to be a true skeptic

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By my my daughter actually her school they're teaching them that but I just I was on okay. I'm I love  Fashion and beauty sites so I was reading about like there was this story on like the cut and it's like  Should you use under eye cream and the writer was like, I thought you should never use it  And I was like, oh my god, I don't use under eye cream. I thought it was silly too. What is she gonna tell me?  I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Maybe you saw that ad on facebook the chinese guy with the big bags and they went away

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is a legit story or this is I mean this was positioned as a legit story  And then her quote was from a dermatologist working for the oil of ole  and I was like  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. So I mean like but you could say that because you had the fact  That he was being paid by oil of ole often. That's not communicate not said yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, that was that was a legitimate article and granted, you know beauty magazines calling their articles legitimate as a little iffy  But I mean that was not an ad that was journalism. Yeah, but it's an ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We talked about that with tim woo, you know  I love this there the word halitosis didn't exist until listerine invented it  Uh people did not brush their teeth  Until claude hopkins  Created the the notion that you you need to brush your teeth with some gritty substance aka pepsodent  In the 30s people didn't brush their teeth before then he invented brushing their teeth

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you imagine though how yucky your mouth felt all the time? Yeah, that's the ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It said run your tongue along your teeth is feel that film  That's slime  And then with listerine they actually had a woman who was always the bridesmaid never the bride. That's where that phrase comes from  Because she had halitosis  It's really I mean this is stuff that's seeped into our consciousness  We still know he points out talk about the catalac health plan, even though catalaki today is probably not  You know by most if you ask the 25 year old, what's the best car out there should be the tesla?  Yeah, they're not gonna say catalac  But that term but catalac because of us and there was no such thing as brand advertising  Until the 40s or 50s but at that time it was so effective coca-cola catalac and a bunch of other brands  Became burnt into our national psyche to the point where catalac is now an adjective used to describe something. That's really the top of the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's challenging is though the the  Market for advertising has changed so utterly. I mean we went through the you know  Sponsored tv shows to like 30 second ads to big glossy magazine things  Which actually are still sold today. I saw in my new yorker the google search terms are like many full page ads  um, but  With social media with the like segmentation of the audience. It's becoming really interesting to see how advertisers  I guess create these mass culture phenomenons or even if they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's okay. So that does play into  how  The trump campaign and I think from now on every other campaign political or advertising  Is going to handle this they did  highly specialized niche advertising  And they were able to do so because they're the company cambridge analytica, which they hired a british company  Had administered you ever take a facebook quiz a lot of them come from cambridge analytica  And the quiz, you know, which which game of thrones character are you is not about that quiz it gets vastly reshared  It's about gathering information about you and they've done so over such a long period of time using all sorts of techniques like  Facebook quizzes that they can very easily  Break down facebook users not into just demographics and economics and age and gender  But into are you a depressive type? Are you a happy-go-lucky type?  What's a manipulation what message would appeal to you and as the as an example  If they want to do  so, so in other words many of  trump's  Advertisements were not targeted  Were targeted very cleverly some of them for instance were about voter suppression to discourage you from voting  If you were going to not going to vote for donald trump some of them were  So let's say we know we want to get a trump voter who's in favor of gun control, but that's not all  some people  Uh are more uh scared types. So we're gonna use you know  Crime is up 45 percent  Line to get to them. Some people are libertarians. They want to preserve their rights  So we're gonna use a different ad to them and all of this dark advertising was facilitated by this incredible  Platform that facebook is to target micro target and most of us never saw any of those ads  Advertisements  You know, and so it's I mean this is happening already and and the the the key is  And that's why I'm a little worried about this mark zucker video  I think we're gonna start seeing this in spades

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there are two challenges there one is if not everybody sees it  It becomes much harder for like journalists to check it right fact check it and dispute it  But two it's advertising to you  Specifically based on a personality type and it's designed to manipulate you at a much deeper level  exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And so how it toasts us and you're never gonna get married because you have bad breath  Is is a punter's game compared to what they're doing now, but but okay, but but here's here's the argument, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, and and I don't always agree with this but but the argument is we in media are storytellers. I actually think we're fact  Deliverers, but but fine. I'll stipulate we're storytellers. Why do we say that? We say that because we manipulate emotions  What is a movie? I want to see la la land. I was practically in tears. How was that? Was that good?  It's very good. I think it's very good dying to see it. I'm gonna go see it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you should  It's not my most manly moment to say that but it's it's really you know what I cry. I cry all the time. This is the dead baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the dead baby problem. Jeff every time you want to be santa claus baby  No, no the dead baby  So anytime you want to write a boring policy story or a deep text story or something you look for the dead baby  And it's basically as a journalist. I could bring you the most  Yeah, I can bring you the most damning set of facts and the perfect example of this is I think was sarah kiff in  Oh, man, she wrote about like hospitals using some  some form of  Like bad needle sharing not needle sharing bad. I i'll have to go look for it. It was a great story highly investigative  Would have gotten her nowhere except a small child died because of it and that was her lead  and  Yeah, if you don't have a dead baby, you don't have a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember back when I was in the Chicago Tribune the the the managing editor would come to the task force where I was  Briefly the copy editor and he would write the headline and say go find go fill in that headline and find me the victim  Yeah, so we've always done that in media, but we've done that otherwise. It's abstract. Oh, well, okay  But but but what are we doing? We're manipulating

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're manipulating your emotions. So this is why I think journalism as a  Good  We are only as good as our storytelling as the stories we can tell right and I think actually  What we're seeing is a need for fact checking and a need for analysis. That's true  But it's probably not journalists that are going to do it  It's probably more like analysts that are going to do it and you can hate me for saying this  but I feel like we need an ethical class of analysts and that actually  hopefully  Goes towards people doing niche and hands-on and really in-depth kind of journalism as opposed to like  widespread  Media that's going to be for like the masses and they're not going to be as informed. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't forget the dunning-kruger effect  What is the dunning-kruger effect? Oh, you must know jeff what the dunning-kruger effect is  So somebody in the chat room said well, this is you know, this only fools dumb people. No, in fact  It fools smart people more  The intelligent this is the dunning-kruger effect a cognitive bias in which people reach erroneous conclusions  And make unfortunate choices  But their incompetence robs them of the meta cognitive ability to realize it. You might think well, that means they're stupid, right?  No intelligent people  Competent people actually

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Make more mistakes because they think they're widely read  They think oh no, i'm i'm gathering all the evidence  And they don't doubt themselves as much  Now this actually that's the opposite of the dunning-kruger effect where the intelligence  Falsely assume that others have equal intelligence, which is why being smart beautiful or talented can result in lower self-confidence  That's another one, but there is a side effect. Uh, maybe i'll call it the dunning-kruger  Corollary that in fact smart people are more are just as manipulable. In fact in many cases more manipulable

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so go to the next item. Yeah  Below the zuckerberg. I put up another link related. Let's go to that. Tell me if you think that's real or  or  fabricated  Uh  On the rundown right below that link bill asks mark bill. Yeah, so take a look at that. Okay, let's see  This is this is in the comments under that post on mark zuckerberg's  Oh, it's bill gates. Hey mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can jarvis secretly order a hamburger have it delivered to the back door asking for a friend?  Wow, and bill says like a brick responds mark says I think I could build that for you bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so  Is this actually bill and mark having a conversation? I doubt it people have any conversation. I doubt it. Oh, what do you think maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got to be approved. Hopefully it's approved by each of them  Maybe it's bill I could see bill doing it. Well, they both have blue check marks

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think bill's people talk to mark's people probably but maybe not  You know bill gates is a human being he might I could that's what i'm saying  I could see we don't know when you're being skeptical  The problem with being skeptical is you don't believe anything anymore. That's what i'm saying the world loses all of its magic

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing i've i've i've been in positions where you know  We get a grant and we got to write a press release and I end up having to write the press release because I can write  So what do you would do? I make up quotes for everybody else. They approve them, but I make them up  I was that's what you do. Oh, no, I do that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We you have to do that because nobody wants to write their own quotes. Exactly. So that's that's a lie

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, is it okay if I say this for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Television b-roll is a lie television nadis are are a lie  uh, you know we we we  The person is not really typing anything. They're typing to make the the camera happy  What's walking down that hall of the nowhere? What's a naughty a naughty is the response shot?  so that  i'll just

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you only have one camera and you're doing an interview you turn it around the first part of the interview you just record  All the answers maybe you get the the got back of the anchor's head  But but mostly you're just recording the interviewee then the interviewee leaves the camera goes around to the other side  And you nod you may re-ask the questions, but also you might you'll go

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but it's also this horribly awkward thing for the interviewee because  You just to do so you're talking to the person but the person can't respond all they can do is nod at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Well, but what it's used for most importantly is if you want to edit the response of the interviewee  You if you just cut it you'd have a jump cut people would know you edited it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what you do is a wonderful thing, right? YouTube, right? YouTube made the jump cut acceptable. Thank god  That's a more honest way and maybe maybe a tv

Transcript:  But what what I always do is I cut to me going. Mm-hmm. And then you can surreptitiously  Chopped some words out  It's a terrible it's all lies leo. It's all lies  I actually am living a living reaction  And of course being in reaction to something is also probably not a healthy thing  Totally exists as a living reaction to years of doing that kind of stuff  Uh, you know, that's why we're live to tape  Uh, in fact when we started doing a tech tv, I said we're not going to edit out the computer crashes because  Tech shows up to then everybody everything worked perfectly and it looked like it was so easy  You felt you're so stupid. This is such a disservice to viewers  Who it doesn't work that way for them? Yeah, and it's a really good point  And and so a lot of what we do and once I don't talk to pr people I don't accept  loaners all of that stuff you don't do uh, uh, um junkets  Embargos don't do ndas or embargoes and and by the way, i'm not knocking people who have to do that  There's a lot of reasons why you have to do that. Not everybody can afford to buy everything  In fact, we do often we used to we had a review show we took loaners because it wasn't just me  It was other people. Um, so we took you know, we're loan units and we always I had strict rules about it  We always sent them back and all that stuff  um, but uh, you know  It's a luxury but I and so I understand when people if you're in a print  Print journalist and you got lead time you have to do ndas and embargoes and all that stuff

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know one thing that bothered me here's a trend that's bothered me and I got bit by it yesterday  Uh, we might have all gotten bit by it  Uh, it's a it's a new kind of fake news on facebook. It's not fake news. It's just old news

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, well that happens. Yeah a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yesterday everybody I know on facebook posted this thing that the last night was the darkest night of the year  Except it was an article from 2010

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I said it was moon last night  Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was the winter solstice in 2010  Coincided with a full moon and a total lunar eclipse  So it was the darkest year since you know 1684  But that was 2010 for some reason everybody all at once posted it  And it became the thing on facebook yesterday, even though it wasn't true. It was just old  And I don't think that that's some bad guys  Yes, thank you for debunking that cnn  I felt like an idiot. I mentioned it on security now and then I realized and I immediately retracted it but it was too late  I already said it  Why does that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead. I was gonna say someone picks it up somewhere and shares it. I mean that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Probably innocent I would think yeah, it's the easiest fact checking you can do. Yeah, look at the date  So it used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some places don't put the dates right this drives me absolutely bonkers me too  Okay, sorry. I'm very passionate about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I actually had a fight when I started all my sites when I was working in advance  They wanted to put the date on the home page  And I said no, you know what day it is put on the story fine  But on the home page now story I I I did two bad retweets today. That was one  The other one I did was the guy who was supposedly kicked off a delta flight  For  Speaking on the phone to his mother in arabic  Yeah, big video all kinds of things  And so I you know, I'll put passes when people I trusted passed it along I passed it along and then bingo  he's um  A notorious prankster. Yeah, he's done all kinds of other things. So and some people are trying to say well it still reveals things  Well, no, it seems like entrapment  And and and he was this was fake news. He was he was pranking. He was he was manipulating us  purposefully  And that so that means the definition of fake news

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to be like you remember and apparently she is real but the seven-year-old girl in aleppo  Who was tweeting? I read all of those stories and I think even the times had a story on it. I was like this  feels  Too good to be true and not too good  But like too good of a story to be true and I was like  Just and I couldn't trust anyone and I didn't retweet any of these stories because I was like no way  No way  And now but then  Yes, she's out the world's a good place, you know  The world's still a terrible place, but whatever but yes  Like you totally doubt yourself now in the alternative is to sit back on these things and not feel like you're part of the conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which is terrible for social people like us, but that is you're absolutely right. So so some important fact checkers  Did track down and did go to the effort to confirm?  Though there was some caution you didn't want to publish that too much and publish too much information about her  But so so so she turned out to be by all accounts now real. However, then she appears on erdogan's lap  Delivering a scripted line. Oh dear. It couldn't be more manipulative with erdogan  It's just it just makes you feel like the dirtiest santa claus around. Oh dear, you know, and and so anything gets used and corrupted

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Watch the scene it's like she's a hostage having to having to say the sentence no correct me if i'm wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, never mind, I don't want to get into it  But that's why I see fake news is  Limiting fake news as being somewhat of a problem  maybe if you do it right though that prevents this kind of thing from getting repeated like  Uh leo, did you notice that was 2010?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did that like an april fools. Oh, I think it was an april fools joke from a long time ago about like the mars rover being sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know that was he actually the mars rotor actually tweeted  But then it was a fake twitter account from the mars rover. Well, but but leo this is key

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is key to what facebook is doing  Right. So facebook is giving you more information at two important points when you want to read or when you want to share  It would actually fix that wouldn't it? It would fix it because all you have to see is oh a hundred of your friends have said oops  And and you'd say oh, thank you for sharing for sparing me this embarrassment  Um, now other people want to share it anyway, that's fine. That's their right to do and they can be wrong  But I want to be right  I think most people want to be right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think we want to be we want to be considered so we want to be considered an expert  So we want to be right and then we want to share that with people and  We also want to talk to people about things that we see and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, what's changed it's the same thing I talked about last week is that if you had done that at the office  And said, oh did you see this?  And then later you realized it was fake. No harm. No foul then but that satisfies that sharing thing  The problem with twitter is it is both the office water cooler and a permanent record of your stupidity

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well facebook too. I mean any the internet the internet so not twitter  don't  What that's what twitter is I well, no, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's what the internet is. Yeah, but twitter feels more casual. I think twitter's a little worse than facebook because it's a little more  It just kind of lends itself to really off the cuff stuff. Yeah and fast and fast  I I won't honey. You can have your twitter addiction. That's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you just call me honey? I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I apologize  See now if I had tweeted that that would have lived forever  But instead I did it on a podcast that no one listens to so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go, who was it who someone tweeted and I thought this was hilarious  Nothing is as secret as the last thing someone says on a podcast and I was like, yes, that's really true

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's why we save our ads for the end. Yeah. No, wait a minute. That's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, oh, dude, what time is it? Do we need an ad? Yes

There's one republican one democrat, but that doesn't I don't think look if there's one thing  We've learned is this is no longer breaking down on party lines, particularly  I'm sure you could find a democrat who doesn't want that neutrality either. Yeah  What about that john ledger guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's here's a technological solution may not happen, but let's let's walk with stacy down polly and elaine

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The reason we need net neutrality is because i'm with you schmupy i'm holding your hand. Let's go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have terrible broadband competition in this country. If we had good competition  Net neutrality becomes less important. I I people hate when I say that but it's true. No, it's true  Uh  So we now have because of some of the actions  But of this fcc and some of the investments that google and facebook and others are making in wireless gigabit broadband  It's conceivable that we could have  Real broadband in only urban areas though, and that's where my analogy breaks down  So who's going to be screwed people in middle america who voted for trump overwhelmingly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, yep true same with health  But we don't talk about politics

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well when the intersection of net neutrality in politics, um  You know, there are those people there are many people in fact  We have a regular in our chat room and on our shows who is an internet service provider in wyoming  I think or montana somewhere in the midwest. He's a wireless internet service provider  Uh, brett is it brett? Yeah. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hi brett

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I call him schmupy  Uh brett, uh brett is dead set against net neutrality. He said yes he is. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he's an isp. He hates google. So the reason brett is  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I haven't talked to brett. You don't have to speak for him. We we've had him on and we've had him talk about it  over and over again, so  uh he and I did because he has a  I think an informed point of view about why net neutrality is no good  um in any event

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's stuck on a wireless isp he has to buy his backhaul from the carriers which right  And this fcc was actually dealing with an issue near and dear to brett's heart which was special access and I guarantee you  That special access is not going to come up again. So that's a shame because it's a big deal  but  But no one cares about special access because it's so boring. What is special access special access is  carriers so  To buy backhaul to the public internet if you're in a remote place, you actually have to buy circuits from  Verizon or at&t the big company sprint who own those circuits whoever the incumbent in that area is right?  Yes, and there's the pricing of those is set by those companies and so it can be very expensive  for  Not just small isps like brett, but also  Carriers like t-mobile so t-mobile has to spend a lot of money on  They basically pay verizon when you make calls in rural areas  so that is special access in that the issue there is should the fcc regulate this because it is  Another situation where there's kind of a monopoly because of the equipment and infrastructure  So now you know about special access, yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and I always I always told I always said to brett well you were in an unusual situation  I don't think that that necessarily means net neutrality is a bad idea  By the way, the guy we interviewed on monday coined the term net neutrality  Yeah in a paper in 2006 called net neutrality and broadband discrimination  And I wish everybody glommed onto broadband discrimination  Instead of net neutrality because net neutrality is too hard to explain to people but everybody understands like saying google

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just hard to say, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not okay google  I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Is it this guy or what?  there's a guy who owns a lot of  Fake news sites, but he's got this very interesting kind of retail approach to fake news  And they were creating posts that celebrities had moved  To i'm trying to find it here  on uh to your town  And they're very effective, but they're kind of they're not they're obviously not shared globally  They're shaded shared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are not those do not sound like legitimate news

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have of course the guy has a google adsense in all of these  Websites and it's the same id  And they were able to track it down really did their buzzfeed is doing some great, uh journalism  They think and I i'm going to say allegedly because a guy denies it  Uh to uh a guy who lives in atascadero, california  Just up north here  Named justin stimps is it smithson?  He's a a commercial pilot works for charter airline and slo. He's uh in his 30s  Over the years, he's registered and launched many websites  And it's this google adsense id is associated with him  And it's on everywhere  And he has registered everything from jennifer love hewitt picks to foxbusiness.xyz  To alexjones.xyz  It probably makes a pretty little penny now buzzfeed went to his house  With a camera crew two men were on the front porch of the home when we arrived when they saw us approaching with camera  In hand they went inside we called out to say we wanted to talk to justin  One of the men yelled from a window. There wasn't anyone here by that name  He threatened to break our camera. So we left  Uh, then they continue to email they have not been able to track him down they did get an email  Statement from smithson. I do not own those websites. You did not visit my house and I did not threaten to break your camera  I've never seen you at my house. I've never seen you anywhere your article is entirely defamatory  And i'm sending you this one request to immediately remove it  Well, they didn't obviously the adsense id is not mine. He says I use that idea on test websites  It was essentially a throwaway id I borrowed from someone else. You know, that may not be uh, completely impossible  I wouldn't be surprised if ids float around and read it in other places  Just you know, because you don't want to do something that gets you in trouble and that gets your account banned  Uh, he says I do not have access to that idea  I've not for some time and i'm not responsible for what someone else has used it for so it may well be that he didn't do it  To be completely fair to him

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  but uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's really interesting  Um  That there I mean it's it shows you the fake news is a deeper story than just uh political

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

That would be is she hiding behind me dressed as santa  All right, all right, what else uh, the new york times  I enjoyed that was fun  The great ai awakening really really really good. Have you read it?  Not yet. Give me a louis crass how you google used artificial intelligence to transform google translate and how machine learning so it's just phenomenal

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's about it's about a couple things one is  the notion of ai and learning systems and neural networks  having been basically in a in a  Clubhouse for wackos and wackos too strong clubhouse for strange believers for years and years and years  And finally it starts to come out and here's their chance  Yeah  And how the all the pieces came together and how they decided at one point that the thing to really tackle was translation  Nice and and the most amazing thing to me corporately is that you you hit this point where  They start working on translation and by the way, interestingly the chips they use are purposely  approximate  You don't want the answer probably thank you there. You don't want the answer is seven point one five six  You want the answer is seven we used to call it fuzzy logic  Exactly, so they had to build new chips for it  They had to do all kinds of stuff for it  Then they test it out and they find wow the improvement  In we can make right now in translation is better than the improvement has been in the entire 10 years of google translate  And then they go to the head of translate they they're at an event and they corner them and say hey  You know, we got some cool code here. You want it?  And the amazing thing to me is you would think that the reflex would be that's not gonna that's awful  Clearly it doesn't work. We know what we're doing. We're doing it for years. Get out it get off my lawn, right?  But no, not the google way is oh, well you can demonstrate to me. That's better. Okay  We're just gonna throw out 10 years code  And and they and they and so on when they when they happen happens to be the 10th year  Anniversary of translate so they're all wearing the hoodies and there's kind of a solemn moment  But what are we going to erase the code we work over 20 for 10 years?  Wow  But but it explains in good layman's terms  Which may mean it's bs, but I can understand it  Uh, you know how this works and how language is is analyzed differently and how fuzzy logic and neural networks work?  uh  In just different ways and how what we know the rule of google all along has been rule sets don't work  Understanding data works, right if you look at that at that the the argument made long ago  By one of the original google employees that if you're going to solve misspelling  The standard answer is a dictionary but the right answer is how we all misspell words  And if you're going to solve translation you're going to solve it through  Other structures, but the trans the improvement in translation was amazing was phenomenal  And it tells that story. I'm sure this is going to be a book because it's it's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We could this would be a good segment to do  Your read of the week  It means actually to read things  Well, I think just in the course of uh, uh, research  Yeah, you're gonna come across stuff like this. Well, we can all we all nominate them. Yeah

Transcript:  I like the graphics a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what I do hardly recommend to everyone in this audience, I think you'll appreciate it is  And it also got me to thinking more about ai, you know if I think about ai and journalism  Stupid stuff like well, we'd be better at personalizing to you, you know see earlier discussion about how you're manipulated  But but this notion of  Taking all the comments and all the discussions and mapping where the controversy and where the heat and where the the anger is  Is finding the patterns and discussion of where they come from. That's something that that was a huge  Um corpus of data  And and with this kind of learning system  You could do amazing things and see what the world is talking about. You probably would have predicted donald trump  You would have predicted things if you had a better sense of the conversation  Uh, that's that's rethinking ai. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so that's that's the promise and that's what people think but  These models are built by people with inherent biases. So we have to keep that in mind when we're talking about like  the promise of ai because  that  You can throw a lot of data, but the models aren't neutral  So just just I have to put that in because everyone's like yes, it's indeed stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm arguing exactly that in fact  What we have to do is to recognize is to choose and be transparent about some level of the biases  so in the in the in the  Climate change argument, right?  um  You I would argue that you want to give a bias to scientists and academics  Maybe journalists  Not so much but scientists right?  Uh, but the argument being made on the other side is you know, these institutions are all bad  So so what is your institutional bias?  Do you bias in favor of institutions or not is a key political issue right now?  but I have to believe that that  Again, i'll say what I said not what what the other side said but when I was talking to  um somebody at google I said  part of the problem is anticipating  the  um  The user's desire  Is kind of what google does and I said I think that that maybe you need to move past that now to think about anticipating  You're truer to the the knowledge and the facts and the truth  Than desire. There is no  I know there isn't but you're going to end up in some level  So so here's my point that that if you argue that oh so-and-so comes in looking for the conspiracy theory  Then they should find it  um  Okay  I'm not saying the conspiracy theory shouldn't be linked to but imagine that your user is always a third grader who's curious  Okay, how well are you informing that person and if you if you desire to inform that person well  Then I would argue that you will  Have to put in a bias  to  authoritarian  Authoritative  Uh sources to academics and scientists and encyclopedias and things like that  That's a bias, but I'd rather have that bias than the bias of volume which will take you to the crackpots

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, I will also no no, that's it's true. And I like I like that a third grader who's curious. I'm like mental model for the world  um, the other thing that people I think neglect to think about with ai is  The data they're using is your data  So evernote actually just got in trouble for wanting to apply ai to its stuff and it it didn't explain this well  Or maybe it maybe it did maybe it was more honest. I this is this is where people  I I think this is why we need better privacy  policies that are very transparent about what's happening because  All of like when google's listening to your voice for google home or the echo is  What it's doing is it's taking what you say and building better models from it  With evernote they said they wanted to use the information in your notes to build machine learning that could like  Take information from your notes and generate a task list from it  What people thought what people heard was you are going to have people reading my notes and  Is it different if there's a computer in a person?  Only if the computer is the only thing that sees it and right now we don't have policies that actually say things like that and  We don't have a way to enforce it even so because they can always give that data to the government  Anyway, this is why ai is such we never talk about this and it drives me nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a couple things there stacey on the data the story about cambridge analytica  And how it manipulated us?  voters for brexit and for trump and so on  Um, and and what i've a lot of people have talked to said, oh it was the story's been overblown  Hey, this has been happening for years. They're not so special but but it strikes me that there is a new right there  There's a difference for a right to privacy and there's a right to knowing what companies know about you  There's a right to a transparency from that other side and and and so you can know how to manipulate you so you can correct it  So you can just be creeped out whatever it is  um  Rather than forbidding people to know things about you  Which is another game of whack-a-mole, which I don't think will work, you know amazon knows what I bought  I can't take that knowledge away from them  But what else do they know about me? What does axiom know about me?  what does I mean, you know timing knows tons of crap about you because they they they  If you ever subscribe to a magazine for those of you who don't know what it is  It's a very nice slick paper thing that has staples in it. It's very nice. Um  then um  They tie that data with your name and address to this huge base of data  In a place like axiom. Well, I think you have you have a right to know that you're right stacey  It's your data at an individual level and it's your data at an aggregate level  And if it's if it's your data if it's our data rather at an aggregate level  Well, how much right do we have to the exhaust from its analysis because we are the ones who contributed value to that  These are yeah, I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well the mistake would be to assume that an ai is somehow any better than a human in that regard, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, yes, and this article makes that argument that that's that's a false goal

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we all understand not that every human has a bias and just you know, kind of understand that  but because of  You know kind of science fiction. We have this idea that shiny machines are perfect  And I think anybody who spends any time with shiny machines learns very quickly

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They are not perfect. They mess up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was the that was the trend in the obama administration was data-driven policy technocrats technocrats are dangerous, too  Well, and yeah in this case right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Technocrats we were talking in the chat room. One of the things I think would be really good beyond skeptical thinking or or critical thinking  And my daughter when she was a freshman at bard  This was a requirement in before you began the second semester the president of bard was adamant that everybody to be a  Citizen of this country to be a productive citizen should understand how scientific method works  And they had a requirement before you know, you'd come back from christmas vacation before classes started a two-week  Program in scientific method and was it bard? Yeah in which you would do the last place you'd expected to occur  I know because it's such a liberal arts hippie dip  But no, he's by the way the president of bard I wish I could remember his name is brilliant  And this was absolutely right on he said if you're going to be a good citizen in this modern day and age  You don't need to understand  You can't go around saying well, it's a theory. So, you know, it could be false. You need to understand how scientific method works  and uh and and you know, I hope that we celebrate here not just technology but science technology is science applied  And the scientific method and I think that is to some degree an antidote  To all of this smushy facts is fact facts is what is a fact post facts truthiness truthiness  Factiness. Yeah  factiness  um anyway  Let's let's wrap things up. I'm sure stacy. You've got a fabulous Christmas. Yeah  Let's wrap it up for christmas last show of the year

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm excited to see  Do you see christmas presents behind me? Oh, you can sort of see them behind my daughter's

Oh, that's a pretty good school too. I hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's it's one of i've got an actual bachelor's of journalism from ut. It's a good school

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, you know what? I love about this show and sometimes people say why you guys talk so much about you know the press and media and news  These are like two professional journalists. You're surrounded by it literally you're surrounded and I can't not  Take advantage of their wisdom and knowledge  honey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead you're talking to jeff, right? Yeah schmoopy. What's your pick?  Oh, are we doing our picks? Yeah, is it my pick or jeff's pick you start?  Oh, you start schmoops. All right  This week's pick is the canary flex

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know about the canary. Um, like it's a camera, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is so the canary all-in-one security device is an indoor camera that has sensors to track  uh temperature humidity and vocs  Flex is their brand new outdoor camera  which  All right. So here's what you need to know about this because it's this is a  Caveated review. So this is the flex. It's got it's like the arlo. It's got the magnet  It can be wired or wireless. So is it battery powered?  It's battery powered if you're running it obviously wirelessly  Um  Now the challenge I had because I played with this it is very much like the nescam. It's a rechargeable  It's rechargeable. Oh, yes  Sorry, so the battery is rechargeable  but  Right now it does not work with mesh wi-fi networks because and this is check this out you guys. I learned a lot  Um my ero routers apparently  All right  We're gonna get into some some tech talk that even i'm not basically it  Does the encryption key every 10 minutes on the ero routers?  Which I can't figure out if this is too many too often or not enough  For this camera because what happens is it falls offline and it thinks it's offline  So for me, it didn't work until I plugged it in so in battery mode

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It doesn't work if you have a mesh network. Yeah, it's saving battery, but it sounds like frankly a bug  I think that it is they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they're gonna fix it. They know they're like are you reading an ero by chance would I describe my issue to them?  So I thought it was kind of worth knowing one because it's always nice to have an if you're in the canary ecosystem already  This is a good camera for you because right now they don't actually pull in their camera data into anything except for wink  So if you want to like if you have a nest outdoor cam, it doesn't go into the same app  Which I don't know that may or may not be a thing you care about  Um, and also because it feels good in the hand  So the hardware is nice and once they work out this bug, I feel like it could be a really good camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So do you have to have the big canary to use the flex? You do not. Okay  And uh, how does it stick is it it looks like it's a magnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there is a man so I was playing with the magnet now  They have mounting hardware and on the back of the magnet just like the arlo. There's like a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Doohickey that you see you screw that into the wall or whatever and then it it hangs off that i'm tempted

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Was she was she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I would wait until they gotta fix the arrow. Yeah, they gotta fix it  I'll let you know when that happens because i'm keeping my camera until

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They issue a bug fix and we'll see if that works. That's the problem with these battery powered ones. They can't be on all the time  Uh, because obviously the battery would last a day  so, uh  You have to they have to turn on whenever you check it  And I bet you yeah, they feel like the wi-fi died

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah  and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then it's not just stacy's favorite thing. It's one of oprah's favorite things. Oh, well, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, she likes the so I and this is I was really disappointed because I actually love the canary  System. This is this is my sign for the canary system right here because it's got this kind of circular shape

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Swoopy doopy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um  I think it's  It's a nice product. I recommend it to people who are renting or like kids going to college  You want to give them a gift?  You know, this is a nice thing because there's no installation you just put it on a shelf. Yeah, just like  There it is and it's got you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's got motion detector. It's it has an alarm in it. It does makes it really loud. Yeah  Not by the way, not loud enough that a burglar wouldn't come over and unplug it but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well it does it does send you a message yeah  That is that is the exciting thing and on the app for the flex and I think for the canary  System they now have this thing where you can just hit emergency call and what it does  Is it actually goes to you can set where your canary is physically located?  So when you make the call it's calling the right area, which if you're familiar with like e911 and stuff that doesn't happen. Yep  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's very nice. Very nice canary flex  And the price is very depending on how many canaries you're buying and by the way, they've got a deal right now for uh,  You know their black friday specials  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a camera 250 or 200. I think if you buy two of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is look was 169? Yeah, it's pretty cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  199 for one, but if you buy two  It comes down to I think 150 or something like that. That's bad, but that's the canary itself. The flex is 199  Yeah  But they sell they sell multi packs of the flex as well. Ta-da the trio pack is  569 the twin pack is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  379 so it's like 180. So how do you where do you use these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would so  My test case is always my backyard because I have a dog who is this escape artist so I actually put it  If it's an indoor camera, I have it facing out because I don't like cameras in my house  but if it's outdoor I just stick it kind of on my backyard and then  If possible I trigger it to  I'll either trigger it. This has a motion sensor in it  So it triggers itself, but otherwise I trigger it with a motion sensor in front of the dog door  So when she goes outside, it's like recording and I can see how she escapes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then block that part of the fence. Oh, I see it's too. Okay  When she does escape how hard is it to get her back? Oh, she always comes home

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, it's just I would rather her not get hit by a car or something. Yeah. Amen. I used to freak out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where as a kid about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She hates the neighbor across the street from us. So I usually can tell  That she's escaped because I hear her barking and I go out and there's my neighbor who's like your dog hates me  And i'm like, i'm really sorry. Let me bring you some

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's embarrassing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff charvis your number of the week. So i'm very very excited about this. I saw it while we were on the show  Uh, new york tech community is going to get a 250 million dollar home base at union square new york new york  uh andrew rachet who runs, um,  Uh civic hall, which is about technology and also civic life and other things with our good friend mika syphrey  uh  I've been working on this for a while.

Where is it here?  um  Classrooms and meeting spaces on the lower floors flexible office space designed for early stage companies on a dozen higher floors  At street level will be a food hall for new york-based startup vendors  managed by urban space, uh, this is this is amazing I mean  I get a little um  Oh, I don't know a boosterish about new york versus you damn californians and new texans  uh, but but uh, you know, i've been talking to  Uh startups for dot nyc. It really is neat to see here how it's not just about software eating the world  it's about the confluence of technology and  And media and advertising and fashion and and education and all kinds of things  So andrew's long been a leader fighting for wi-fi in new york and other things. He's a very good guy  and uh, and this has been his dream to move civic hall and startups and classrooms, uh,  General assembly and others will be there. So I just want to give them a major congratulations. It'll be open in 2020  uh, but uh, it starts that's when self-driving cars are coming out. Yeah, so you just you don't need it. Yeah  I'll just get there on the no. I'm gonna get there on the subway. I'm a subway person

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's when kanya is going to become president. Oh, jeez. Oh, I thought he said he would wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh now he's gonna wait a little longer after meeting with donald. He said i'll give you eight years and i'll take over after

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought that was happening, but that could be fake news. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I I saw him say I saw him say on tv. He's running for president  I did see that in 2020 2020 but maybe he's decided to you know now that you know, he's got donald in there  He would wait to give him an extra four years

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought it was fake news that the daily mail reported this and it was a couple days before it came out that that  Trump was seriously trying to convince  Someone for the national endowment for the arts  rocky

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's just alone for uh, the national endowment for this. Hey  At least he wants to keep the nea going  Uh, it's been kind of republican canon for years to get rid of the nea. So no, it's a way to kill the nea  Well, if yeah, if you I don't know. It's still loans in art. Look, that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Rocky always wins. Come on be too elitist. Alone is an actor rambo is gonna shoot it apart. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think actually the most astute thing I read is that uh, uh, the president-elect likes to pick people because they look the part

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's my my friend peter bernhardt wrote that piece in the atlantic. I think it's very astute. It really really is and um  the line he didn't use in it because it's not an appointment made but but um,  larry cudlow  From cnbc for one of the top economic posts. He said he's not an economist. He plays one on tv said peter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But yes, he's casting a show. He's casting it. Yeah. Yeah, and you know to be honest, I don't think it'll be any worse than

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So-called experts. I'm not sure it'll be a lot worse. We'll see we'll find out. Hey, we're gonna find out  The clock is ticking  Uh my pick of the week I have by the way, we got through almost this entire show

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I threw that in it's my hardly  Eight. No, i'm just gonna I want credit with the audience here. We are hardly a political discussion people now  Give us some credit on twitter for that  Huh? Huh? You just complain

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can't you thank us now? I this is that my pet peeve is that companies and journalists and news channels and people like us?  Give any weight at all to complaints on twitter  Yes  That's the easiest thing to do is complain on twitter. It's what twitter was built to do  And so but I see it over and over again, you know, the the newest thing is  Oh the public, you know, the people are up in arms over xyz commercial  Because there were 10 tweets on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's how journalists who all live in new york or san francisco find out what the real people think  Yeah, because we can't leave our desks anymore because god help us if we don't turn out 12 stories a day. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey  Yeah, yeah  Twitter is not it's just twitter. It's what it is. It's not anything more or less

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How about that that's my new attitude that that's wonderful twitter is what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Neither more nor less  Uh, I have been trying every mesh product under the sun  As you know, I got the google. I got the ero  I got uh, you've been doing you've been doing this too stacey. Uh, you you had the plume plume

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Eero i've got the orbi and the almond three so you got the orbi your laptop is supposed to be so confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just got the orbi last night  Um, and i'm gonna make this my pick. This is I think not really mesh. I think is part of the thing  This is right. This is a much more traditional  ac3000 netgear router with lots of power and a satellite  Which uses a separate back channel so you don't have the problem that repeaters have  Of of sharing the bandwidth for inter satellite communication  So because it goes it goes around the band you use it's able to have high speed communication with a satellite  So in effect, it's a very powerful router with a very powerful  repeater  But at least I put it in last night and I have to say it's powerful  I get a very strong signal  and the reason I tried it is because I was having and I wonder if that the sonos aren't having the same problem that the  That the canaries are having the sonos does not like the ero

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My sonos does not dislike the ero at all. Oh, but maybe it's me then. I don't know. I i'm not  Networking issues. I mean every network is a special snowflake and has its own needs. That's really true

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I think our house is a hostile environment. I really do. Oh, it's gotta be the google thing didn't work right away  The euro didn't work right away, but these or be it kind of worked right away  I had I had to manually do the firmware update  It never did its firmware update properly and unlike the euro. It doesn't do automatic updates and things like that  So it's a very different product. It's much more to me much more like a traditional router  You don't use the app the app doesn't do anything you use the web  Interface to it and inside the web interface many of the same things like qos many of the same, you know  Port forwarding and stuff. It's very traditional kind of interface  But I have to say the power is really good and it is very very fast. I'm getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very how many how many units do you have to have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They sell you can get additional ones but two for a 4 000 square foot house they say  And that's about what we have and that's and it seems to be doing a pretty good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So well, I take it all back just as I say that one minute ago on twitter f you jeff jarvis trump has won so go  gtfo  Jeff kilary failure clinton. Oh, well, I guess we have made all the fans happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what don't post my twitter address anymore  I only get nice people. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Solid wow, this is the hashtag about that solid glass ceiling

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever. Let me say let me say this about that  um  jesus  We don't cover politics. We cover technology, but there is definitely an intersection of politics and technology  You know the fcc story for instance  Neutrality we will cover it then  There are some trump supporters who believe that anything at all critical of trump  Is uh in impugning them and their intelligence. I got an email that says we're not all stupid  I didn't say you were stupid. Nobody said you were stupid  um  But but just as we criticized just as I mean we talked a lot about edward snowden and critiques of the obama administration's  Uh lack of transparency and nsa snooping we talked about that almost incessantly for the last three or four years  You can expect us to talk maybe not always positively about the next administration  Particularly when in in in the you know realm of tech stories that's going to happen  Uh, and it happens more on this show and probably twit than the other shows where we're talking about  You know macintoshes or windows or whatever so  Uh, it's fine with me if you feel you don't want to listen to the show because you don't  You're you don't want to your ears to hear anything negative  Um, that would be fine  But we are going to cover it because we that's what we do. We cover these things  Uh, and uh, i'm not saying trump is stupid and I don't think you are saying trump supporters are stupid. Uh,  But we are going to cover those stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay  But put that on put that on on a loop and we'll play it anytime  I think that's I think that's put it on on youtube and I can just link anybody to it. I have respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Guess what trump won the election at fair and square i'm going to say fair and square and he's going to be president in less than  A month and we'll see what happens  And we will see what happens. Uh, it will be interesting  And somebody says the problem is the constant bashing. I don't think it's constant  But I think the problem is some people are very sensitive and any bashing sounds like constant bashing  so  There it is  Uh  One last story. Thank you mars worm. Uh, we I gotta I gotta finish up with this story from fan droid.com  uh somebody got on a  airplane  And named his wi-fi hotspot  galaxy note 7  Uh  Seven oh that was a that was a that was a nasty thing to do. I think serenity caldwell was on the flight, uh,  so  Uh, I guess that is kind of the equivalent of a bomb scare according to call. It is it's it's  Literally yelling fire in a theater. She arrived at her gate to learn that her flight had been delayed several times before actually being cancelled  Flight attendants spent the next few hours rescheduling itinerary  She overheard the crew talking about what the ground of the plan the first place  The flight attendant noticed a galaxy note 7 wi-fi hotspot mid-flight  Something that would have forced an emergency landing had personnel not been able to track down the perp who likely had a long  Talk with the tsa upon landing  so  I don't know that's a little oversensitive, but let's not do that. Shall we kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, all right, so if you got if you got two more minutes two more minutes  Sure little light notes  So I think if you you can go to the video I put up under the numbers of the most uncomfortable interview in tv history  Oh go anywhere in it anywhere in it, but I love this. This was the hollywood reporter

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought did a really great piece on a large surprisingly large number  Of celebrities in hollywood who are in their 90s and still working  Including, you know, uh don rickles bob newhart  uh cloris leachman  It was kind of cool. So they interviewed as part of this  uh  jerry lewis

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same exactly the same
