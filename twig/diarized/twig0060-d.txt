Transcript:  Indeed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're so cool.  Well, no, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way you're saved because isn't it going open source and people are going to need documentation  and the future is bright.  Yeah, the future is bright for that Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might be a Wave book in a box.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so.  With Wave.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis back home finally from his travels.  There I am.  Been all over the world.  Home sweet.  Author of What Would Google Do?  This fine book available everywhere in bookstores.  See, Jeff, if Google went out of business, this would be in the remainder, Ben, too.  But fortunately.  So would the economy of the internet.  Jeff made a better bet than I did.  You bet on the whole company, you see.  Yeah.  That's not always a good bet.  So with us today, we're glad to have him.  Kevin Purdy is back.  He is, of course, editor.  Are you editor in chief of Lifehacker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that is Adam Pash.  Oh, that's right.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a contributing editor over there.  Contributing editor and the author of a brand new book.  Did it come out today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An hour and a half ago, actually.  This is so exciting.  Yes, the complete Android guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're doing the same thing Gina did, which is online sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, a freely browsable website.  And beyond that, there's a DRM free PDF, EPUB and paper book if you want that to.  And there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1995 to buy the paperback, $9 for the ebook.  And of course, the website's here at completeandroidguide.com.  We're going to do an Android show, actually.  So I'm going to have to get this book and read it.  Not about programming, Andrew, but apps and tips and so forth.  I'm pleased to say before the show, I was able to show Kevin yet another tip.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I was on the phone before.  Which we'll get to later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there somebody in the room with you?  With me?  Yes, actually there is somebody in the room with me.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not alone.  I'll address that in a moment, Kevin.  Get out of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That phone call is coming from inside.  I know.  Sorry, lost my hits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have they already legalized marijuana in California?  Any minute now, Jeff.  You sound like it.  Any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, we were talking about that earlier in the day because in November, I guess it's  on the ballot and I'd say it's about even money that it might pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a suggestion in Twitter for this week in weed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody was arguing that you ought to start this week in weed.  This week in weed.  T'wu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we might.  Amen.  Amen.  You got anything to talk about?  We're going to do this week in bongs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be awesome.  Like Bob Marley and some bongs.  It'll be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bong talk.  Bong talk.  Bong talk today.  This week in hash.  There you go.  Every show will be exactly four minutes and 20 seconds long.  It'll be great.  At 420.  At 420.  We air it at 420.  Well, I do a little dance.  I'll do this a little later on.  When it's 1337, I do the little leet dance in here.  Just get up on the table.  I know I'm such a geek.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I shouldn't waste time because golly, there's a lot of news here.  First of all, Eric Schmidt has now confirmed that Google Me is coming soon to a computer  near you.  He says, sometime this fall, the Google Me service will introduce what Google calls a  social layer onto online search video Google Maps.  This is coming from Googling Google, the aptly named blog from Garrett Rogers and Christopher  Dawson on ZDNet.  But I guess it's both the Wall Street Journal and Reuters who are quoting Schmidt saying  it's coming.  In fact, if you are at the Intel Developers Forum today, apparently if you go up to the  Google booth, there's a guy there who's saying, yeah, it's going to be in October.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't get the memo, I guess.  The man manning the Google TV booth, this is from GearLog.com, at the Intel Developer  Forum is telling passersby that Google TV will launch in the October-November timeframe.  This one guy.  One guy.  And Gadget says October 15th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any further definition of what the heck it is?  Google TV or Google Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me first.  Me first.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing, right?  It kind of changed from what we thought, or at least what I thought.  We were thinking it was going to be this standalone product, sort of like Facebook.  But now it sounds like it's just going to be sort of this layer, this add-on, or an  update basically to Google social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which means practically nothing, right?  Because it's like kind of, isn't that what you have already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of.  I don't know.  I'm trying to imagine what this would look like.  Does it mean that if I search for Mad Men, I see the list of all my Facebook friends  that like or have mentioned Mad Men?  I imagine that's sort of what it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you kind of do already if you search on Google for Mad Men.  Don't they show you results in the Twitter feed from your friends?  Maybe not.  Maybe I have to click the social button.  Yeah, here it is.  Social results from my social circle.  So here's Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it sounds like it's going to be like this on crack.  What else could they do to make these results more meaningful or to inject social?  Is it about making search more social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've always said is they have all the pieces already.  They've got Buzz, for what it's worth.  They've got profiles, which are tightly integrated with Buzz.  What else would they add?  They've got social search.  What other pieces would you?  Oh, I know.  And this is actually something that there's been a lot of talk about.  They've got your contacts in Google Voice.  That's another circle.  In fact-  Yeah, I know.  But Nokia has been talking about this at the Nokia event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not social.  That was the fundamental mistake with Buzz, of course.  I often email people I wish I were antisocial with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not a vote for somebody because they're in your address or contact list.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  If I call someone a lot, that person, I mean, we all probably call maybe five people on  a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not familiar with my prostate surgeon.  Yeah, it's a superset of yours.  It's a superset.  And Gina, you're not even in my phone book or address book.  I've never, I don't know your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in fact, I was thinking today, I was driving home like a madman trying to make  sure I got here.  And if I got hit traffic, I have no way to call anyone from-  We don't have our phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't need them.  We have your email.  I have your email, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And we spend an hour together every week.  So I mean, I talk to you guys more than I do a lot of my closest friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, and I could tell you, if I were-  Gina, you are one of my closest friends.  You're my only friend.  I mean-  You and Jeff are it.  Yeah.  No, no, seriously, we feel very close to you.  And if I were going to follow anybody and I want suggestions for anybody, it would be  from you two, right?  But you don't show up in my contact list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only place we show up together is by every week at this time, tween our, which I forgot  to do right now, tween our names together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how smart will Google be?  It could deduce that from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter's done.  This new Twitter, I don't want to change subjects, but this new Twitter surfaces its Twitter  suggestions very, I guess it was always on the front page, which just seems more obvious  to me now.  I really like the new Twitter.  And those suggestions are very good.  I don't know.  But they're obviously doing some clever food.  They're doing very clever algorithmic work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's perhaps one of the best reasons to buy Twitter is not just, okay, so Twitter,  but there's something very smart going on there.  And it also proves a social graph link that's very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they only know tweeting, but maybe tweeting is better than your contact list.  In fact, I bet it is.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  Well, you know, Zuckerberg said when I talked to him that nobody wants to sit down and make  a list of friends, right?  It's tedious.  And they know that especially because when we got opportunities to segregate our friends  into groups, and I thought I wanted that, I don't.  It's a pain.  But your friends' contacts do come.  They are emergent from your actions, from what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It certainly would be useful.  I mean, I have found it very useful in Google Voice and now because of it in my contacts  to segregate people because I have different voicemail messages, handle phone calls differently.  If you guys call me, you would get through.  Whereas if somebody else that I don't know calls, they won't get through automatically.  There's just all sorts of stuff that you do want to do.  But I think that Twitter...  Could it be done automatically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that Twitter shows shared interests and shared friendships and other  things whereas simple communication, email, phone, doesn't.  I'm finding the Google Priority inbox is working pretty darn well for me.  It's pretty impressive what it can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have switched, as I mentioned last week, all my email to Google because of it.  How do you like it?  Fantastic.  Yeah.  It really works.  I've heard some people complain, but all you have to do is you kind of massage it a little  bit and it gets smarter and smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it works quite well.  So there's something there in email that I guess does have something that maybe...  But again, Google got in such trouble with Buzz and Buzz doesn't work as a predictor  of relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very disappointing.  Yeah, they should know better.  In fact, the Buzz recommendations is not nearly as good as Twitter's recommended.  Of course, they don't have as much data, do they?  This is where the network effect shows itself in some other unusually and maybe more subtle  ways when you have a lot of users or even something like a complete universe as Facebook  and Twitter almost have.  You can do so much of a better job with a lot of things.  You must see that in your application, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think Jeff's point is a good one in that you can't take a collection of communication  habits and then necessarily determine relationships from them, right?  Because we're a good example.  We talk every week, we're close, but you wouldn't be able to tell that from our email activity.  But in the context of Priority Inbox, it's making decisions based solely on your email  activity.  And I think at one point, it initially marked a message from Jeff as not important.  I marked it as important and now anytime I get a message from Jeff, it's important.  But like Jeff and Jeff, we don't email that much, mostly because we don't get too much  email, right?  So I email you guys as little as possible.  So you kind of do have to teach it.  So I think Twitter recommendations work really well because they have a lot of data and especially  if you interact a lot on Twitter, then it has a lot of data about you.  I think Facebook does a great job too, but those are closed contacts.  So I mean, I don't know, is Google going to be able to look at all those different contacts,  look at my Skype contacts, look at my Twitter, look at my Facebook, look at my phone call  log, look at my email and then determine groups based on that?  I'm not sure.  I mean, I think, I don't know, I don't think any company can ever come up with a satisfactory  list of labels that people would put their people in buckets.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a perfect person for this because Think Tank, your analytics program, does some of  this kind of stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it does do some of this kind of stuff.  It's called Think Up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Up, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And we are doing some social graph analysis, although honestly, I'm leaving that to, I'm  going to leave that to Twitter is doing that really well and Facebook does that really  well.  So we're not doing too much of that.  The point I think Think Up is more just surfacing really good ideas from conversations.  I mean, ideas start in conversations.  So I want Think Up to kind of archive conversations and surface the good ideas.  And sometimes your relationships have something to do with that.  Like, Leo, you're my friend.  So if you respond to a tweet of mine, it's going to show at the top of the list because  you're someone I trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's like a priority inbox.  That's the same kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the same kind of thing.  So I think it's, you know, it's a combination of a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What could Google know from the web about us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it knows a lot if it has, you know, and as in my case, four years or five years  of web search history.  What could you squeeze out of that, tease out of that to be valuable?  They certainly can, I mean, what they've been looking at it for is ads.  So they know what my interests are.  Why would it not work to use the same technology they use right now for AdSense to show you  relevant ads, to show me relevant tweets, comments, articles, and people?  Same thing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yeah, for gathering people around interests, that would work really well, even though it  would creep me out a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I've searched 100 times for athlete's foot, which I haven't, but if I had, and I  would get an ad for athlete's foot medicine in my, lots of my pages, am I then going to  get everybody who says tweets the word athlete's foot?  Am I going to see those tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be a privacy.  I'd hate that.  Bonanza for the enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's not going to work.  That's not going to work.  So you have to constrain the subject material.  If I on the other hand, tweet about the Boston Red Sox or search a lot on the Boston Red  It would be great if I would see stuff, content around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be great if you had a friend or if you knew someone or one of your friends  knew someone who was also a really big Sox fan and you didn't realize, you know, that's  someone who you're going to want to follow and, you know, talk, talk about the game when  it's on.  So it can do that kind of stuff.  Like here, meet this person that you didn't realize that you know.  So it could be about kind of extending your social graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wouldn't that, but if you're on the other end of that, wouldn't that be irritating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  It's obvious that some things athletes would, too personal or prostate cancer, but maybe  not for you.  Maybe you, if you're not, prostate cancer would be something you would like to know  about.  So I don't know how they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not context.  You know, when I go through, I've got a bug in Facebook and I've had it for quite a while,  but it's actually been kind of nice because it's quiet.  It says that I have too many friends when maybe it knows me better than I do, but I  don't have anywhere near 5,000.  I have about half that.  And so it won't let anyone ask to be my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook has become very nanny-ish lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a bug.  This is, Howard Kurtz said the same thing.  They say it's a bug and it goes, it went off recently and then it went back on.  So I thought I had to kill.  I also have about 2,500 un-responded friend requests because I just ignore them.  I mean, literally ignore them.  I don't do anything.  Right.  So I was going through a bunch trying to kill off enough that I could get to something because  I just befriended people I actually know, Howard and Matt.  And the ones who came from FriendFinder meant nothing to me.  Facebook was saying you should know this person.  It didn't mean anything.  Whereas when Twitter says that, it means something to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe Twitter's got some secret sauce that's going to be very hard.  Twitter keeps coming up the winner in this particular segment.  Better than Facebook.  Much better than I think Google's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what can Google do?  It's just hard to imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A social layer.  I mean, they've already done the one thing that it's obvious, which is adding social  to your search.  Kevin, come on.  You don't get to sit there quietly and avoid the answer.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking that it would be great if there was like, it would almost be like delicious.  The idea that you just have this bin that you throw things in for Google to look at.  Like you said, you don't want athlete's foot, but you do want Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that solves the privacy problem, doesn't it?  Because it's all volitional.  It's all opt in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But how do you get the user behavior such that it's not annoying for them to hit a button,  throw it?  Like even the Google search results experiment where you can move things up and down and  cross them out from your results and get personalized with search wiki, it was called, right?  Side wiki.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Ricky.  Well, and then also just the hitting up and down on the individual search results that  didn't work out that hot.  A lot of people didn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they still do that even?  No, no, the search, the changing the search results.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One button that you can hit to say, yes, no, good, bad.  I don't know if that gets that much use.  I don't see it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the lesson is that people don't want to have to curate.  They don't want to have to organize things.  I don't even have my iTunes library organized.  My house is a mess.  I don't want to have to organize all my information always and be like, oh, this goes in this  box, this goes in this box, whether it's my contacts or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  But priority inbox takes a stab at it and then you don't mind so much tweaking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  And it seems reporting span because I know that it's going to save me a moment in the  future.  It's worth it.  I know that Jeff's email is going to be marked as important in the future, so then it's worth  it for me to hit that button.  I guess that's the difference.  I never really curated or thumbs up my search results because I felt like, why am I ever  going to search for this again?  I just need this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like you're throwing a rocket kill at Jaro.  You're not really changing something that's going to have a long-term effect, it feels

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like.  Well, it wasn't immediately apparent that it was changing anything for the better either.  It was just changing it.  It made me nervous because I thought, well, I don't want to screw with my search results.  That's Google's job.  I don't want to bring something up and have it come up too high because I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the social buy-in is pretty low.  I really want to help people find Gillette razor blades later.  I got to make sure I mark this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's interesting.  So again, this comes back to something I said a few weeks ago, which is Google needs not  more computer scientists, but more social scientists.  Oh yeah, more anthropologists.  This is the whole problem.  And you get the feeling that everybody's doing it by instinct.  And it's whoever's instinct was best.  Somebody said, whenever I use Facebook, I saw this.  It was a great tweet.  I wish I could remember who said it.  I can do only exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has figured out I want to do or should do  and nothing more because it's so clearly a personal project.  It's not a platform in the same way.  It's not a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whereas you can use Craigslist to find family members after Katrina.  You can use it to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  And I think that's what Google's saying is we're going to build a platform.  But now to make a platform work, you need buy in from not just users, but more importantly,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that right?  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  You know, going back to the Facebook thing, Anil Das wrote this great post about Facebook,  but I guess there was in that New Yorker profile of Zuckerberg, I guess he said that he realized  that he's red, green colorblind.  So that's part of the reason why Facebook is blue.  Is because he can fully see blue.  That proves the point exactly.  So literally, Facebook is blue because it's limited by Zuckerberg's ability to see colors.  So that was amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't really I've only scanned that New Yorker profile.  By the way, it is online, so you don't have to be a New Yorker subscriber to read it.  But Mark also admitted, yeah, yeah, that email that was circulating a few months ago where  I said those dumb apps, they're giving me all the information.  Yeah, I said that.  It was pretty candid interview.  But, you know, it seems to be pretty clear that what's happening here is they're bringing  Mark around to buff up his image prior to the release of the social.  Whatever movie.  Yeah, because he's going to slaughter the poor kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peter Kafka at MediaMemo said that it wasn't an amazing movie, but he wouldn't want to  be Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't said I'm looking forward to seeing how they make programming interesting, like  if they'll do the hackers type thing where he's typing and he breaks the encryption in  one night, writes an entire code base overnight with just like Mountain Dew and Pringles or  something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dramatic typing, fencing.  Dramatic typing.  Yeah, forget the dramatic peri-dog.  We need a dramatic chipmunk.  We need dramatic typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all going to be montage, fast cut.  It's a lot of whiteboarding, I think.  Yeah, a lot of whiteboarding.  Yeah, whiteboarding.  There you go.  But you know Mark Zuckerberg did not whiteboard one damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, actually, he told me that he remembers the day when he whiteboarded the social graph  for the first time in his dorm room.  Really?  His dorm room, yeah.  That's the beautiful part, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I take it back.  I guess I mis-underestimated him.  No?  No?  So, well, we're going to have Google Me and Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just not going to know what...  It's going to be Google You.  Yeah, I don't know what it's going to be.  Google Me, Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Schmidt did say that he was hoping that Facebook would open up their contact  data, their social graph data to Google, which isn't going to happen.  But Twitter's social contact data is open to Google.  So it'd be interesting to see, right?  I mean, if Google's going to do sort of recommendations that Twitter's doing, who's going to do a  better job of that, Twitter or Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's part of the API and you can suck that stuff from Facebook?  Well, they have the firehose at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they have the Twitter firehose.  So the social graph data, yeah, is all available via the API.  And I assume that Google has super duper access to the social graph firehose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember what happened when Apple said, oh yeah, and by the way, you'll be able to use  Facebook Connect on ping.  And Facebook said, uh-uh.  Oh, no, you won't.  Wait, it was Facebook that said that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Has anyone here used ping at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it was Jobs?  I thought it was Jobs that said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Kara Swisher, Jobs told her that that day in the announcement of ping that  they had planned to have Facebook and he showed it.  They had Facebook Connect built into it.  But if you are, and that's part of the API, but if you're a big player, it might suck  a lot of bandwidth, they want you to negotiate a deal.  And Jobs told Kara, boy, Facebook's driving a hard bargain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The terms are too onerous.  So you think that was about price?  You don't think that was about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's money necessarily.  Who knows what the terms were?  They might want data back.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I thought.  That's what I assumed.  But it could be the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, who knows who pulled the plug.  But it's clear that if Facebook doesn't want to play along, Google doesn't necessarily  get that data.  And Facebook's going to act in its own best.  This is one thing very clear.  Facebook is going to act in its own best interest, not in the interest of the internet.  It would be in the interest of all, for all of this data to be unsiloed and available.  Then the network effect doesn't matter because everybody's got access to everything and you  can build this.  It's whoever's smartest about parsing the data.  And Facebook and Twitter, to a lesser degree, I guess, their attitude is, well, we got the  data.  So it's not about...  I guess Twitter's pretty open with the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be great if...  Sorry, it would be great with all the OAuth work that Google's doing.  There's so many apps now, web apps, that you can sign in with your Google credentials.  More and more I see every day.  It would be great if they would allow you to use your Google OAuth to let certain parts  of your data go, like you were just saying, like kind of peel your own onion out and say,  well, I'm going to let Google use this and this and this in my search results by signing  in and letting some of it go.  I mean, they kind of do that, but not really now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can also see why it's in Google's interest to promote the open web because they  got nothing.  So the open web benefits...  It's a one-way street from their point of view, with data flowing from Facebook and  Twitter to Google.  And you can see why Facebook and Twitter might say, well, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at it another way.  What could Google do that would disrupt the hell out of Facebook?  That's the question, isn't it?  Because you can't count on cooperation.  I go back to your idea that if I had basically my personality server, if my page, my identity  were on Google and I could serve up my data to other parties, that's still the wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that disrupt Facebook?  Well, that's what I thought profile was kind of about, Google profile, is you control your  information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we're not going to leave Facebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You learned that lesson, didn't you, sir?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sad, embarrassingly.  You will not leave.  You'll think you've left, but you have not left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've left Twitter a couple of times, too.  Yeah, you've got to be where the people are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the world's best, you get pissed at things and leave them, don't you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a short fuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  I'm kicking my ball and going home.  Well, look, in theory, and this is I think one of the promises of the internet era,  everything's friction free.  There doesn't need to be loyalty because there's a bunch of companies competing.  Bookmarking is a good example.  There's a bunch of companies with bookmarking services and it's friction free as long as  data moves freely.  If there aren't artificial constraints on data, it's friction free.  You just move around to where you want to live.  The problem is in practice, it isn't because data isn't friction free.  You can move friction free.  You can use different search engines because how much they know about you is irrelevant,  but you can't use different bookmark engines unless they let you export and import.  You certainly can't use different social networks unless your friends can somehow see you or  participate with you on that other network.  That's what I learned is that exactly the thing I didn't like about Facebook, which  is that it's a silo, is exactly the thing that protects it.  I can't leave it because that's where everybody is.  Twitter to pretty much the same degree, I have to say.  When I left Twitter in April 2007, very early, I had 5,000 followers and I think I was number  one or number two.  I said, this is it.  I can't use Twitter for a number of reasons.  When I came back, there was nowhere else.  It's like a charge over the hill.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did everybody go?  But Jaiku is so much better.  At first, I thought people can't see that it's better.  Now, I realize it has nothing to do with that.  It has to do with all this inertia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's critical mass.  When it's a silo, you're going to have critical mass.  It's in Google's interest that all this stuff be open and freely transported and given away  because Google has some data, but they don't have the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that there's two winners in the world going forward.  I was saying this to somebody in media the other day.  Those who have data and those who have relationships.  And the winner of winners is the ones who have relationships that produce data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Google have that kind of relationship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's the problem.  It doesn't.  Twitter does.  Facebook certainly does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I feel like Twitter is such a big winner right now.  Did you watch the video music awards?  They kept putting up a billboard of how many?  Eight million tweets an hour now.  And Lady Gaga is number one and number two is Justin Bieber.  I mean, Twitter was all over the VMA, which shows that it's a youth movement, which is very good.  It's what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which everyone says it wasn't.  Oh, the kids don't use Twitter.  It's just old farts like you, Leo, and you, Jarvis.  Yeah, no.  I'll leave you out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's numbers still don't come close to Facebook's though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're getting close.  Really?  Well, I think it was over 100 million.  It was 180 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what does Facebook have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Half a billion.  Yeah, 500.  Well, that's close enough.  Come on.  What's a few hundred million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just, I don't know.  Sometimes I think.  I agree.  Listen, I prefer Twitter over Facebook, but I've talked to people who are just like, Twitter  doesn't drive half the traffic.  It doesn't have half the users as Facebook does.  And I think the reason why we see it at the VMAs and things like that is because Twitter's  default is that that information is public.  So they can show all the tweets.  Facebook doesn't do that kind of stuff because the idea is that it's like come inside the  wall garden.  I mean, could Facebook technically show a list of status updates that mention the VMAs?  They couldn't, right?  Is there a way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, remember, remember with the Obama inauguration that you could sign in through Facebook and  you could leave things that your friends would see, but you could also make them public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember the election page, which was such a great page, was real time.  It was scrolling up.  It was great because it was your social graph plus.  You could just watch if they had tabs, right?  You could just watch your friends or you could watch everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then you found out how many of your friends can be online on Facebook at 11 a.m.  on a work day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right, Gina.  That goes back to the problems that Facebook has had before and my ridiculous screed about  understanding a public versus the public.  Facebook is designed for us to speak to our private public, not to the whole world.  Zuckerberg is clearly jealous of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, he must be watching the VMAs going, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think Twitter just has really good connections in Hollywood as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hollywood loves Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in a way that not so much as Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're Steve Martin, who just joined Twitter today and already has 50,000 followers, if  you're Steve Martin and you want to post funny, bonmos and here's where you can get my book,  where are you going to do that?  Not on Facebook.  You're going to have a Facebook page.  I'm sure he does.  You're going to have a like button on your on your blog, of course.  But where are you really?  Where's where's your big megaphone?  Where's your big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's different, too.  I learned talking to son Jake when we visited Zuckerberg that.  Jake's peers look at the wall as a place to have a conversation.  My peers look at it as a place to publish and broadcast.  Right. Right.  And and so I think that that's a functionally, they just don't operate the same.  And you've got to have the relationship or there's danger.  By the way, I'll report this.  I haven't seen this anywhere else.  So I contacted the the detective in the Nashville, New Hampshire, so-called Facebook  robberies. Yeah.  Where they had a string of robberies.  Right. They were supposedly that they'd done it on Facebook.  Yeah. It's like I asked Facebook and they said, well, it wasn't places.  And then they gave me the name of the detective.  I went to the detective and it's still an ongoing investigation.  But he said that in both cases, there were only two cases where Facebook was involved  in this robbery string.  And in both cases, the victims were friends with the robberies.  Oh, of course, because it's friends.  Exactly. So so, you know, the status updates could be public.  But but they in that case, it was only because they were stupid enough to befriend bad guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And almost burglaries all the time.  Any any police officer would tell you most burglaries are, you know, friends of friends  or someone, you know, was in your house at a certain point.  So it's just it's a new way for people to check in on your house.  If they know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good on you on doing that research.  I'm going to I got a blog that little later.  Yeah. Little actual reporting revealed here on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like everybody is so anxious to believe these stories that they don't really actually want to debunk it.  Yeah, we want it to be true.  So you must be interested in this story.  Google. I mean, sorry, Apple  working on a deal with newspapers to be cut to turn the iPad into the new platform.  Did you see this? Yeah, it's it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that Jeff is just a world weary about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've seen it all before, haven't you, Jarvis?  Am I allowed to say wet dream?  Yeah. Is it is it a wet dream?  Yeah, sure it is. It's it's it's the newspapers still believing like magazines.  Oh, it's not your it's not your wet dream. It's theirs.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, it's theirs.  It's it's their belief that the iPad is going to return control of the experience of the business model to them.  And we're all going to rush to subscribe now that we have the opportunity.  And the argument will be made that what you did for music you bought there.  But music is unique and news is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  San Jose Mercury News says Apple to announce subscription plan for newspaper.  This is John Boudreau writing yesterday and updating it this morning.  Roger Fiddler, head of the digital publishing at the Donald W.  Reynolds Journalism Institute in Columbia, Missouri.  Is that a well known? Yeah, it actually is.  Institution of God is says Apple will take a 30 percent cut of all subscriptions  sold through the app store and and as much as 40 percent of the ad revenue.  So, of course, it looks I mean, Apple's smart.  Play on these poor newspapers. Fears.  Yeah, we can save you and it will only cost you a little bit.  And whether it works or not, Apple doesn't care.  No, no.  Cupertino has agreed to provide an opt in function for subscribers.  This is interesting. It allows Apple to share with publishers their information.  Publishers want the data from their customers so they can integrate it  into their circulation database so they know who their customers are.  But you can turn that off of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's been a bone of contention with with newspapers, with publishers and Apple.  Right. That Apple, quote unquote, owns the relationship as if anyone can own us.  But well, Apple thinks it does. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Publishers wanted to pay a fee, but eventually,  because they have no choice, agreed to percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And they're and they're the same problem, the boat with with Amazon,  where more than half the revenue from Amazon subscriptions goes to Sprint.  And the majority of what's left goes to the publisher.  But it's so tiny as to not be at all worth it.  And it's also a crappy experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  So if I'm the New York Times and if I subscribe to the New York Times on Kindle,  which I did for a long time, most of that money goes to Sprint  and a little bit to Amazon and nothing to the Salzburger family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Half more than half, which I presume is 51 percent  of what's left over after Sprint goes to Salzburger.  But it amounts to bupkis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than half is bupkis  compared to what you would get if you got a weekly subscription. Yeah.  Now, the OK, so the Wall Street Journal, which I also subscribe to on here,  which is actually fairly expensive. Yes. On the iPad.  Does Apple take 30 percent?  I guess they do have the subscription fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They take whatever they negotiated in that case.  But yeah, they take that plus.  Now, what I don't understand, Leo, is the 40 percent of the ad revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if they're talking about IADS, the Apple ad platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they probably are.  But I wonder whether Apple is going to require, pardon me,  some use of IADS in the newspaper apps to get into the newspaper store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they did, they would just show how much they have the newspaper  publishers over a barrel if they dictate.  Oh, and by the way, we'll be selling those ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that would be insane.  That would be something.  You would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would not be appropriate for you to sell your own advertising  in this medium, would it?  Because something terrible could happen.  Geez, Louise.  But I guess when you got somebody like, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because they're trying to preserve that old business, it's going to work.  It's just not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like yesterday with the new Twitter, Twitter kind of landed  on the side of the web over apps.  I thought that was really kind of interesting.  Let's talk about that.  Google's position on things.  So we kind of have this divergence going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I were a third party Twitter developer, I'd be a little unhappy about this,  especially if I were someone like Brizly, which is a web based Twitter client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to you have to have some offer something that, you know,  the Twitter Twitter dot com doesn't have like something like Co tweet is great.  It offers this ability for a team to tweet from a single handle.  But to just be a Twitter client at this point,  you've got to offer something that Twitter dot com doesn't.  And the new Twitter does a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, even more interesting, Twitter is finally putting conversations in  because yes, mentioned in this tweet, retweeted by tweets mentioning this tweets.  This, you know, if you open up this sidebar on a tweet on a tweet, pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of metadata there.  The conversations are pretty limiting.  It's just you don't get the full reply and the one before and the one I replied to.  But you don't get the full thread if there's a long back and forth,  which that's a challenge.  I was trying to I'm trying to do that with ThinkUp and it's a little bit of a challenge.  But yeah, there's quite a bit of metadata there.  And if you if you have a tweet with location, it'll show a map.  Right. You can if you click on a location, you see a tweet to that location.  It really surfaces a lot of the data that Twitter has hidden because it really  it really does have a lot of metadata metadata hidden.  And it does a lot of things that your favorite apps do.  And it looks like an iPad app.  I mean, it is the iPad app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really interesting.  Now, are they taking a chance by doing this that it would make Twitter so complicated  that people will be scared off?  Twitter has traditionally been very simple, very straightforward.  Kevin, do you think this is too complicated for normal people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I what is the percentage of people who are using the website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said 71 percent of all tweets come from the Twitter web page.  No, really? Yeah, huge, huge majority.  Yes, I know I was shocked, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I I imagine then for the supposed 71 percent, this will be I don't think it's too  complicated. I mean, it's just it's the same old scroll on the left.  It's just that there's now some stuff on the right.  If you, you know, want to address it, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess if you don't look at what's on the right, it looks like if if it's just for you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a scan thing, if it's just, you know, checking in and checking out, then there's  there's really no difference. But I like it a lot.  I wish I had it in my own account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, the reason I ask is we're geeks. We like it.  We like complexity.  We like more features, not fewer.  We like more data, a lot less.  And I think that Twitter has really succeeded by appealing to the MTV crowd.  I don't want to be too disparaging, but it's it's appealed to a crowd that is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sophisticated. This I mean, this definitely feels like a little bit of a turn in the  different different direction.  This combined with the turning off basic authentication, which which caused a lot of  a lot of ruffles. People were saying, hey, you know, I built my Twitter app because it  was so easy to authenticate.  And now you have to figure out off, which which is involved, a chain of back and  forth. And there are a lot of one off Twitter apps that maybe would have never  happened if they had launched with just off.  You know, Twitter was just so simple and that's what it made it easy to develop on.  And so and I think this UI is also a little a little more complicated.  I don't know that it's too complicated, but it's definitely a little more  complicated. They're definitely taking taking a risk with their their their  cult, their, you know, the thing that made them famous, which was the total  simplicity. I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it a lot, though. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But we had this discussion around, pardon me for saying it again, but when  Google dropped wave, what did that do to developers?  And when Twitter started its own client, what did that do to developers?  You know, are we in the same boat here?  If you're a developer and you're choosing where to put your your effort.  And Twitter was made by developers, it was made by the fact that it was an API.  Yeah, Biz has said that often.  Are they now thinking, well, we're now too big for we don't need the developers  anymore or are there new opportunities because the API has more data?  Where what's the relationship to the developers that comes out of all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think Twitter desperately wants developers to build something anything  other than a client. Even when I went to Hack Day, I talked to Doug at Twitter and  he was just like, what can we do to get people to build developers to do something  that's just more than, oh, hey, look, here's the data.  You know, here's just another client.  So and I think that's, you know, as a developer, you go to where the people are,  you go to where you're interested and where the people are and you're interested  in places where you can interact with your friends.  And then, you know, after a while, I mean, I think there was this there was a golden  age for Twitter apps where the Twitter website just could barely stay up, forget  being functional. And that was the time when you wanted to make a really great,  rich client. But now it's, you know, it's a new time when you know, they just  raise the bar. They're asking you to do more interesting and clever things, things  that that the site itself doesn't do. So for me, I just I see it as kind of just,  you know, more of a challenge.  But but it is disheartening. I mean, I think it's disheartening for a site like  Brizly or TweetDeck or, you know, any any client developer who who's been, you  know, working on their Twitter client for a long time.  And it does all the things now that the Twitter website does.  And it gives gives you users less of a reason to download your app.  So it just forces developers to really market the thing that they do that  differentiates them from the core service.  I don't think that's a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for right now, it's not it's only on the Web, not mobile, right?  Right. Right. You get the old UI if you go mobile.  Mobile apps, unless you are in love with the Twitter app, which a lot of people  are, but there are still lots of mobile apps that will have a kind of unique  offering for for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I think other way, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Oh, your turn. Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stupid. I can't find in this the recommendations, the people  recommendations to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was trying to find who to follow, too, and I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought they were on my page and then I accepted everybody.  I said, oh, that's great, great, great, great, great.  And now it's gone. So maybe it was when I first got it, it was over here  in this empty space to the right of trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that I think that they pulled it.  Maybe they pulled it early because.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm not seeing it either.  You know, the who to follow was like it was one of those things where I just was  like, OK, don't show me.  I wanted to say don't show me this person again, which is something that Facebook  has that Twitter didn't have.  Like, yeah, I know this person, they're kind of annoying.  Don't show me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop. There's a reason I'm not following him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would imagine for a lot of the developers, it's kind of like the situation  that a lot of news is in now, where if you can get if the Twitter website  is good enough, as good as a standard, show me my friends, show me my replies,  a client, then they have to come up with something that is, you know, unique  and allow Twitter to do the basic stuff.  You know, like Gina's think up, which is really in depth reply and,  you know, use a response tracking tool.  And I'm sure that we'll probably find some differentiated stuff,  like maybe, you know, safe apps for kids, stuff like that.  I would think, I mean, now that Twitter is good enough for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really interesting because you saw this coming, you know,  they started making noise and they used Fred Wilson to say,  boy, if I were you, I wouldn't write any more third party Twitter.  Yeah, right. Right. Right.  It was really you could see this all coming.  Yeah. And and I, you know, I have to say, I think they handled this very well.  I think Twitter might end up being a very good case study for how to do it right.  They suffered badly with the fail well, but they hung in there.  They obviously fixed those issues  because they're handling huge amounts of traffic now.  They kept the site simple when there was a lot of pressure to do otherwise,  but they did add features as users kind of organically created them.  Like the ad symbol was not originally in Twitter.  That was added because users started using it.  And I think that they did.  I think that they've done everything very cleverly.  And I have to say, this is impressive what they've done here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. If you go back, I saw of when I was in San Francisco once more for the book  and not forgetting his heritage at Blogger.  He went through really desperate flip fail well times  then when the thing was just down all the time and I, yeah,  I joked that the server was in his kitchen.  Well, no, it wasn't. But, you know, everything else was.  And he had an incredible determination to show everybody and make it work.  And, you know, if you think about it, he shares that with Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he had a lot of experience with Blogger, right?  I mean, this was his experience with Blogger back in the day, too.  I mean, there was some story he was he said, I was sitting on my kitchen floor.  Like I'd lost my whole company.  I couldn't pay anyone.  But I believed in this thing that I built, you know, and it turned out to be a huge deal.  Now, it was fantastic.  And he has good ideas. And it's it's he did hang in there.  And I was going to say earlier, one one one good thing,  the other great thing that Twitter does is their developer relations are very good.  Their developer support is very good.  And they keep upgrading the API like they just they've just released the user streams API,  which is push versus pull.  So as a developer, you don't have to keep polling.  It will notify you.  So so that's, you know, that's an exciting thing for a developer.  You know, that's the kind of thing that you're like, oh, OK, this gives me more possibilities  for what I can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they are kind of trying to deprecate PubSub Hubbub, aren't they?  Yeah, there is an interesting word.  I bookmarked the article if I can find it.  That's yeah, that is a little anti PubSub Hubbub Fubb Fud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had, you know, I hadn't really thought about that, but that is that is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They they implied that better to use our  notification system than PubSub Hubbub, which is open.  And they said something about it's not being deep.  I put I thought I put a link in here and I don't see it, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, it's like breaking up with somebody.  Yeah. PubSub Hubbub Fud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I have a show title.  Let's see what else is going on.  Well, Google kind of a little egg on the face here  with its employee who was spying on.  Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.  This is from Gawker, but Google has confirmed that they have fired the fellow.  Google engineers spied on four underage teens for months  before the company was notified of the abuse.  David Barksdale, a 27 year old former Google engineer,  repeatedly took advantage of his position as a member of an elite  technical group at the company to access users accounts,  violating the privacy of at least four minors during his employment.  He met the kids through a technology group in the Seattle area  while working as an SRE, a site reliability engineer  in the Kirkland, Washington office of Google.  He was fired, according to Google, in July after his actions were reported to the company.  Google says, look, SREs have to be,  we have to have some engineers that can access data.  It's just a requirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a dirty little secret of every single big web company.  The fact is that there are engineers who can access the production database,  and sometimes they're going to do it for not good enough reasons.  I think that this happens a lot, a lot, a lot of times it never gets caught.  I think that, you know, Google handled it the way they needed to handle it.  But I mean, it does definitely emphasize the requirement that you've got to have these people have.  They have to be highly trusted.  They have to earn credentials in order to have access to this data.  But I think it happens a lot.  I mean, wasn't there a story about Facebook where an engineer was quoted as saying, like, hey,  what do you want to know about who?  I'll just look them up in the production database right now.  And, you know, the fact is that when you're developing a web application,  you know, at least back in the day when I had my kind of full time programming job,  we pull down data from the production database into the stadium database just to test things.  And you see things that, you know, private messages or whatever that, you know,  and you're like, oh, yeah, I mean, there's got to be really strong procedures in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any way to track that or any way to team up or what?  If you were going to try, if you're Google now and say we've got to do something to not let this happen again,  what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've just got you just got to have really robust procedures in place, like any time an SRE or site  reliable person, somebody with the right credentials does access the production database,  live database of, you know, sensitive data.  They've got to log that. They've got to justify it.  They've got to have a reason.  I mean, but the reality is an operation like Google with so many engineers and so many servers and  dealing with problems, that's a big it's a lot of hoops to have to have an engineer jump through just to check on  whether or not someone's Google chat is working or why a group of users, you know, the service is down.  But I think I mean, I do think it's possible.  And I think the stories like this are definitely a reason why a reason to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The raw who done it is involves looking up a call on Google Voice, looking up an IM on Google Talk, going  through a Gmail contact list.  It's pretty much the tinfoil hat brigades worst nightmare.  And it's only one engineer out of twenty thousand employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, still, Google's response from Bill Cogren, who is a senior vice  president, engineering Google, quote, We dismissed David Barksdale for breaking Google's strict  and strict internal privacy policies.  We carefully control the number of employees who have access to our systems and we regularly upgrade our  security controls. For example, we are significantly increasing the amount of time we spend auditing our logs  to ensure those controls are effective.  That said, a limited number of people will always need to access these systems if we are to operate them  properly, which is why we take any breach so seriously.  I mean, there's nothing they can do about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These things almost need you to need a team that you need two people on a buddy system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you have to use systems that check to see is there an employee who's regularly accessing that basically  analyze the activity and see if there's anything improper going on.  If this one engineer was accessing these four teens data for over the course of four months, like that seems  like unusual behavior to me.  Listen, if any company is going to do it, Google is going to do it.  And they've got incredible systems set up for developers to work on projects.  And I imagine that their security has to be super, super high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's torture for me.  Kevin, you're right. I just got back from Berlin where they're nutty about about Street View and they still  bring up the data collection on the Wi-Fi, which of course is absolutely stupid.  And they effed up and allowed somebody to do that.  And they should have done it.  And but it had no commercial value.  That's just paranoia talking.  This is the real fear.  This is that we all trust our stuff there.  And Google could lose business this way.  Companies could say, you know, somebody could find sensitive financial information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, Kevin Mitnick, the famous hacker, always said that the weakest element in any security  system is always the human one.  So if you've got, you know, with those good filters that Gina mentioned in place, yeah, you can you can  notice that someone's doing something, but it's the people you hire that have to be, you know, caliber  enough not to do it.  But the other you're always chasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like spam, isn't it, Kevin?  You're always chasing the bad guys that they will outsmart the filter you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The other amazing thing is that a 15 year old uses Google Voice.  I mean, can you imagine the raw volume of data you create if you're a Google Voice user and you're like  15 or 16 and you have a social life?  I don't use Google Voice, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What amazes me is my kids don't talk on the phone.  They never talk. They hate talking on the phone.  Or all their friends hate talking on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you're using the SMS service through Google Voice?  I mean, my God.  Free texts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are obviously sophisticated teens because my kids haven't figured that out.  But somebody sophisticated knows that.  Oh, yeah, we just use the Google Voice.  Wow. All right.  Let's say let's get to our tools and our tips and our numbers of the week.  But before that, we got to figure out a way that we can all, even though we're in New York,  San Francisco, San Diego, go see the Facebook movie on October 1st.  We've got to figure out some way we could all see this together.  What are we going to do?  Should we create a Google Wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, can you stream a screening just to us, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's got to be some way we could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wave will still be around on October 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's true.  Or we could just have our chat room.  Everybody bring your chat to the theater.  There you go.  And we'll have a and we'll just broadcast the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we could just we just make fun of it, like just the whole thing.  Just mock it the whole time.  It'll be a lot of live blogging, but live chatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you do that?  I think I know in my theater you have to turn everything off.  But but I guess we could chat.  Could we look at typing dramatically?  We could have so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to a screening of Catfish tonight, which I hadn't heard about,  but apparently it's a documentary about an online relationship gone awry.  I will let you know how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That never happens. Yeah.  All right, Eileen, our new producer is your I am charging you  with figuring out a way that every single person who watches this show  and listens to this show can join me, Jeff, Gina, Kevin,  and anybody else who wants to watching October 1st.  We all have to go to the first screening.  We could just well download the torrents and we'll broadcast it on Twitter.  That's what we'll do. It'll solve the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to the job, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what Gary Delabatte feels like.  Poor Gary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Baba boy to you all.  Gina, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, do you have something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the complete Android guide,  which you should be following, and I'll tell you why in just a little bit.  The I have a section in the tutorials with annoyance fixes.  And one of the annoyances that I've always heard from people is this one  application crashes every single time.  And so I came up with what is the  I guess it's the Holy Trinity plus an atomic fourth option for fixing  fixing apps that are crashing on you all the time without,  you know, without using a third party app or anything.  So in the Leo has his phone there, if you want to follow along.  Oh, OK, OK, OK.  So on the Joydex menu,  if it's if it's up to Froyo, but I guess it wouldn't be maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I have to put up my my put my thing on the screen.  OK, let me log in.  OK, so you go to menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Menu and then settings, settings.  OK, following along at home under applications.  Yeah, which I use a lot.  OK, and then manage applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. You know, I use that so much.  I actually have a shortcut on the desktop that brings me right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Which you can do by holding down on the home screen and choosing shortcuts.  That's what you have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really nice feature that Android has over the iPhone.  You go to any page in the settings right from the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I'm not sure how it looks different on your screen than mine, but under the.  Yeah, this is the Moto Blur Crip crap.  Yeah. Well, under a phone running Froyo, you should have an all section  and you can click on an app, any app like.  Let me open the menu because I think the menu.  Google Voice, in my case, which is I sometimes have some problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have sort by size or filter and I should just not filter.  I should say all. OK, now I have all.  There's everything. Now, what do I want to do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's pick it. Pick an app that's wonky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like for me, it's like crash a lot.  I'll just say it's a. Yeah, there you go.  Just just click it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then so it's laid out differently, but there are three options  that you want to go through. Usually the first one is for stop.  And that usually if an app is crashing on you right now, that's that's the first step.  And that'll kill it.  And cause it, at least rejigger itself.  And sometimes that works.  The next step is to clear the cache of the app.  If you if it's there, if it's available, that clears out the temporary data  that an app might be holding.  And sometimes if bad data gets in there, the Twitter app for me,  that happens all the time.  You know, it might be causing you not to be able to sync or go on.  The third option is clear data.  That's about and that that actually wipes out your  all the data that's stored on your phone.  So you might have to re log in to certain apps like Twitter clients  or the voice.  And that usually by that time, if you relaunch the app,  everything's going to be working.  And then I guess the atomic fourth option is uninstall. Right.  And you usually don't want to have to do that.  That often doesn't fix things.  You might just have to wait for the developer to update the app.  But that's the that's the Holy Trinity plus the atomic fourth for  diagnosing problems with apps on Android for stop, clear cache,  clear data or uninstall. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, I'm finding apps now.  It's like the old abandoned  ghost town of websites.  I'm now finding ghost town apps. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a couple released and not updated. Yep.  Yeah. So, for example, the path train in New Jersey,  I was looking at the schedule today to make sure I got here on time.  And I have an app and it hasn't been filled in.  And God knows how long.  And there's no way that there's no way to kind of check activity.  When was the app last touched?  What's the current status or anything like that?  I would I would love to have some structure to be able to  look at the currency of an app.  And all the more irritating is if I pay for an app and then they go ghost town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's as you as Jean and I can tell you, it's really frustrating  with, like, say, Firefox add ons when someone has a brilliant overnight app  and then they never touch it again. Right.  Like a brilliant Firefox add on that just doesn't get touched again,  doesn't get updated.  And you're like, oh, come on, this was so great.  And you just don't have the long term love like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying something about my Firefox?  No, not your your extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I'm saying you would see it.  We post to an app on Lifehacker and it would look great.  And the comments start off with everyone saying, this is amazing.  And then you look at the post three months later and the comments have turned into.  This is total crap. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Total hater fest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Reminds me. I got to update my Firefox extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better Gmail, better, better, everything, better life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll mention them when they're up when they're actually up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I shouldn't have said the name. Forget I mentioned it.  No, but you know, there is the maybe a disadvantage  to having a low bar to entry is that anybody can write an app  and put it in the marketplace.  And so a lot of a lot of I write I used to write apps all the time  that I would just write as a one off and I'm not going I don't want to maintain it.  But if it's easy to put in the marketplace, of course,  it's going to get there very quickly if you didn't pay ninety nine dollars  and have to go through Apple's draconian approval process.  Very good. So, Gina, are you off the hook now?  I guess you are. I'm letting myself off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a tip that fell through.  Oh, yeah. Before the break, you were saying before the show started,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're saying, oh, well, that's too bad.  I got a little something, but it's not working quite the way I expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm not going to say that. OK. Well, in that case,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we go to Jeffrey Jarvis and his number of the week.  I just found a new one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone from Twitter sent in one that was very nice that  and I can't find their name right now.  And I apologize, whoever you are, thank you.  I apologize, whoever you are.  Thank you very much that on the Google voice.  I'm sorry, Google mobile blog.  They said that they're up to on Android one quarter  of the searches on Android are voice.  Wow. Nice. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Is that now I guess you don't have to have Froyo to do voice search.  No, no, not at all. Yeah.  No. The basic the basic Google search. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whenever I  do think to use it, it's incredible.  I forget once in a while.  Oh, yeah. When I do, it really does work amazing.  Well, I don't care if people look at me like I'm a nut.  That's the sign it works.  And then I just saw another one, Chris Hughes, of course, ex  Facebook just put up a story from CNN saying that candidates  with more Facebook fans won big on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh? Which is coming.  Is Facebook the way to predict election results?  How many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knows the now I'm going to I'm going to embarrass myself terribly.  I'm going to fail the current events quiz.  A former head of Pakistan who is  exiled to London right now.  I'm a sharaf, a sharaf.  Sure. My colleague, Sundeep Jodharkar at CUNY, just told me today  that that he announced that he's going to plan to come back to Pakistan  and his justification for doing so was because the people want it  and how does he know that? Because of all of his Facebook friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is why I'm back on Facebook, ladies and gentlemen,  because I would like to return from exile as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what he has he done any as Nate done any sort of Facebook friend  to election? He should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This would be a meat for the grist for the mill at five thirty eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really would be. It's it's it's really quite great.  So the story on CNN, which I'll put up on the on the  the delicious feed momentarily.  It's kind of interesting that you can it gives you a new data point to check on.  And, you know, during during the last presidential election,  it was true that those who were more involved on the Internet  made more money on the Internet.  It was straightforward as could be.  Rudy Giuliani, my favorite thing about the campaign last time was Rudy Giuliani's  MySpace page until the very end of the campaign was private.  Well, now that's just moronic, isn't it?  Isn't it magnificently, but I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I wouldn't vote for him just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, seriously.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Geez. Oh, I don't want anybody to see anything about me.  That would be terrible.  So my tip is something that I also found on probably on Twitter or somewhere,  probably Lifehacker. I don't know.  I steal stuff right and left.  It's a website called Unsubscribe.  Have you guys seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this sounds like heaven to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is heaven. I'm in heaven.  So I don't know about you, but my and I tell you what,  moving to Gmail and seeing the priority inbox really brought this home.  More than three quarters, probably 80 percent of all my mail is bacon.  That is not exactly spam, but informational email,  usually lists I subscribe to and things like that.  So I got to switch over here.  Unsubscribe.com is a free service that you also have a paid version  that will unsubscribe you from any mailing list.  And they have plug ins for Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, and URL Mail.  So and now you get five unsubscribes a month for free.  I immediately paid the 19 dollars.  I'm paying for that because watch this.  There's a now is a button.  When you install the plug in right there on your Gmail right next to.  So and if you look at, you know, if you look at my mail,  a lot of it is like this.  You know, at some point I went to this website, I bought something.  And now I just press the unsubscribe button  and they're going to unsubscribe me.  And they they put it at the top of the window that you're unsubscribed.  And then you can move on.  Let's see. I.T. World wrap up.  Yeah, there's another one.  I've just been filling up my inbox unsubscribing and unsubscribed.  And then if you go back to unsubscribe.com, I'll log in here.  And it shows you all of the unsubscriptions attempts it's made.  It gives you also a regular email digest.  And you can see how effective it has been.  And it's it's quite effective.  I mean, it really works, I have to say.  I don't know what kind of, you know, a lot of times  there's an unsubscribe link at the bottom and you could do this by hand.  They're obviously doing more than just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's safe. Unsubscribe has a fair number of them.  But the service that I obviously want from them is tell me all that you have  yours of your customers who have me subscribe and let me get the hell off of them.  But of course, they don't do that because their customer is the spammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that would be too user friendly, Jeff. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the nice spammer.  These aren't spammer spammers, the people who who put me on a list,  which in some cases might almost be relevant, but it isn't.  I didn't ask for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  A lot of times I feel bad because I kind of well, yeah, at some point  I probably said, OK, but well, you're nicer than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never did. But even so, I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can't I'm trying to find it.  I guess I might have deleted the the digest I got, but it was great.  It said we've unsubscribed you.  It's like 30 or 40 things now.  Here's three more pending.  And here's a couple that need action on your part.  And so it's been very effective and it really has made a big difference.  Actually, I was really tempted last night to just get rid of it all.  But I thought, no, I have to save some for this week in Google.  So I'll have something to show them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something that you guys also end up as I do from your  lifehacker days and Leo from your worldwide fame  that you end up on a one of those horrible PR lists.  Lots of PR lists.  And that is the worst of the world.  This works with them, Jeff. It works with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so happy it works with PR lists.  So I want to subscribe from about 30 of those, Jeff.  That's exactly right. I am on a million of them.  Interesting. So it's not just mailing lists.  It's not just I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you just get a PR press release from like some BS PR firm,  you can hit unsubscribe and it's because most of them are using

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  constant contact or some other standardized list system. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it detects that from the headers and then I guess it must.  I guess it must.  If it's just like some dumb guy at PR firm, like does it  does it send an email to some dumb guy, some dumb guy at PR firm dot com?  Does it still issue an email or like, what does it tell you at that point?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So far, I haven't had that happen.  That it probably does.  I find all the time.  The problem is that I'll get some dumb guy at the PR firm  and I get my 20th email and I finally just get pissed off  and I just send an unsubscribe notice.  Now, if they were smart, they just do it.  And of course, then they send me email back.  Oh, I'm sorry. Right.  And then another one confirming that I'm off and I just want it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure if they're not using some special software to do this,  that it's not, you know, it's not right.  You just have to set a personal thing.  But I have to say, almost all my bacon is using some sort of system.  Right. Right.  Because they're not going to do individual emails they're going to use.  So I don't want to focus on any one person, but here's one  for immediate release.  See, when I see that right at the top there.  Yeah. I say, yeah, OK.  I'm sure that'll be interesting.  But why don't I just press this unsubscribe button right here?  So cathartic. It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exciting. That's all.  That's as good as not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you map, if you do this and then keep your fingers  on the left bracket and right bracket, you can just scroll through all your mail.  Unsubscribe, unsubscribe and unsubscribe.  And, you know, no, no insult here, man.  But unsubscribe and archive all the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you mark the little left boxes and do it and batch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Well, maybe. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't tried that. It's kind of they're afraid.  They're afraid of the power that would unleash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of fun to hear as a gift for Leo unsubscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, you're right.  It's tempting to go ahead and unsubscribe to my entire world and see who comes back.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a human, you can come back if you're if you if this worked.  And so I just they say in some cases it may take a while and so forth.  But I I love the report.  I can't pull it up. I would love to pull it up for you.  But it's really it's a nice little nice little feature.  Good tip, Leo.  Unsubscribe.com. Well, and I wish I could remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are they charged for the?  It's $19 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine. And if you do it right, you probably don't need to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, we're a Murdoch.  That's worth paying for. Yeah.  Yeah. Repeated news is not worth paying.  Oh, that's worth paying for.  Getting rid of people who irritate me, that's worth paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell that we're all just like just been hammered with all this crap  for so long that we're just bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this is a little meta, but unsubscribe.com.  Does have a unsubscribe.  Nice.  I don't know what it means.  I don't even know if it works.  But there there you go.  And they are on Twitter as unsubscribe.  Unsubscribe me at unsubscribe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Leo, I figured out the other tweet you were in recently that you responded to.  And I wanted to mention that I forget the guy's name because it was wonderful.  When I was in Chipotle, which I go to very often.  Little bit of rice, a lot of black beans.  And I'm saying that in the line.  And the guy in front of me looks around quizzically.  And from the voice alone, he said, you're on Twig.  Oh, wow. Wow.  Those moments. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  That is cool.  Great to have you all. Kevin Purdy, thank you for being here.  We really appreciate it.  Kevin's book, The Complete Guide to Android to stop me from before I said, wave  the complete guy.  It just built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just have to mention real quick that if you're if you follow us on Twitter  at a complete Android, all one word this week, we're giving away a 20 percent  discount to the book and you get that by DEMing us from, you know, we have an  auto follow just for this week and you DEM us and we will send you a coupon code.  And we are doing that until Friday at midnight.  I think the coupon code changes every day.  But that way you get 20 percent off the book.  And what's the complete guide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know it's a complete Android, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Twitter dot com slash complete Android.  OK, I mistyped it. Complete Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me try that again. There we go.  There we go. I'm already following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally rip off tips from this Twitter stream to feature here on Twig.  So you should follow Complete Android anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just me at three in the morning in my phone.  And so we send out tips and tricks on that feed pretty often.  And like I said, this week, if you're following it and you DEM us,  we'll send you back a coupon code to get 20 percent off the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. And you can read it online at complete Android guide dot com as well.  And that's correct. For the paperback.  The book is out now on the ebook as well at nine dollars.  Like them on Facebook. Follow them on Twitter.  DEM them for 20, 20 percent off, 10 percent off, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and it's all done.  And we're going to be updating it, though, as you know, new things roll into Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be remiss if I did not ask you.  Which phone is your fave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Having written a book where I want to get new features early, it's the the Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, still still the purest, truest Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. It's really the it's the only pure.  Sounds terrible. It's the only Android experience where you're not getting,  you know, what a carrier wants you to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as you said, as I walked through those screens,  oh, that looks a little that looks a little different  because that Motorola stuff on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Motorola is not as bad as HTC, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on the other hand, I like the HTC widgets.  So what's your second choice?  Second choice. Second choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, the G2 looks really good from a brand new one.  Yeah, it's brand new.  Just out on T-Mobile, I think, for preorder.  But that also has the pretty much the stock Android interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really, they don't put sense on it.
