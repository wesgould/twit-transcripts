Mostly because I've got the smartest people in the world on this show.  And if they want to talk about, I don't know, Microsoft Surface?  Or if they want to talk about Samsung TechTile? I don't care. Whatever you want to talk about.  Nominally it's about Google, the cloud, Facebook, that kind of thing.  We're going to start with Gina Trapani.  Founding editor of Lifehacker.  She now has her own blog at Smarterware.org.  And works for Expert Labs where she develops ThinkUp app.  Or ThinkUp, which is an app that synthesizes social media information into...  You're big data now, baby. You're in the big data realm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I just dropped a 10 million row table this morning and then realized my backups were bad.  Oh!  Hurt. It hurt.  Ow!  Luckily my app can recapture the data.  But yeah, it was one of those things.  Check your backups. TSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy moly. I'm sorry to hear that.  I'm surprised you're not bawling your eyes out. I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was one of those mornings. It's not a critical table.  It could have been a worse table. It was a secondary.  If you didn't really need it, 10 million rows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always think of it as cost cutting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm trying to be real zen about it.  Nothing is really ours. It's just a theme roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. You're right sizing.  In 100 years, no one will know.  Yeah.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, the author of Public Parts.  He's back home finally. You've been traveling everywhere in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Subjecting you to bad bandwidth the world around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now we've got a new bad bandwidth king.  So Jeff joined us via all sorts of strange devices from all around the world.  Now it's Kevin Mark's turn. Kevin Marks, who is at Salesforce.  You're at Salesforce, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course hosts the great Tummelvision at tummelvision.tv.  He's outside Salesforce today at the beautiful Ferry Plaza in San Francisco via 4G.  Look at that. It's gorgeous.  Don't move the camera too much, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The picture will then break up.  I think the problem is this is, whereas in 4G it used to be really good,  then everyone got iPads that connect to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything's good when no one uses it, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. There's probably too many iPads in this building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The dirty little secret of bandwidth. As long as no one's using it, it's great.  So I got to start because we, boy, there really is a lot to talk about today.  Microsoft had two big announcements this week. Google I.O. is next week.  And a week ago Apple had WWDC. This is like the season of announcements.  And it's really fascinating stuff. I almost don't know what to make of it.  That's why I've got the big brains here.  But let's start. This is kind of a funny little video that was created by, was it ReadWrite?  ReadWrite Web.  ReadWrite Web.  It's really hard to say.  I can never pronounce Re-Wri-Web.  Consonants.  Yeah, consonants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Leo, I was in a restaurant in Boston the other night and a Mexican restaurant  and I had a margarita, which I rarely do. And so I know this is the power of Leo Laporte.  As I was about to leave, another drink arrived with a note saying,  we like your work. So it's your, the hangover the next morning was your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, don't blame me. They didn't mention me by name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I do Twig. This is the free drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do not blame me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wherever you are out there, I couldn't read the headwritings.  Wherever you are, thank you, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they could, they could be a fan of your, maybe they were former students.  They could be a fan of your buzz machine. They could be a fan of the public parts.  What would Google do? You've got a lot of work. I'm not responsible for your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After that moment, everything I said sounded like Re-Wri-Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We won't, we won't, we won't. Yeah, don't, don't say that drunk.  All right, here we go. This is from Read Write Web. A mashup, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I certainly want to thank everybody for coming today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've reimagined, redefining the reimagination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Reimagined for reimagining the tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the new Microsoft Surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We call it the iPad. That's what it looks like.  Surface is super thin. iPad is really thin.  It's 10.6 inch, 9.7 inch, optically bonded, IPS display, at under 1.5 pounds, just one and a half pounds, dual two by two MIMO antennas, the latest in wireless networking.  It's got a 30 pin connector, full size USB port, the keyboard dock, the full multi-touch keyboard, browsing the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can browse smoothly. And I'm just going to go to Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oops. Oh yeah, by the way, Steven had a little trouble. He crashed it.  He had to bring that one back to the table and get a new one.  Excuse me just a second. Hey, sorry. You never saw Jobs do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He does look like it. Surface works great for entertainment as well. Video, music, games, gaming.  Lay back and watch a movie. A great way to watch movies.  And that's really what entertainment should be about. It feels natural in your hands.  It's phenomenal to hold the internet in your hand. It actually sits perfectly comfortable in your hands.  It feels great in your hand. It's really great. Great. This is a great choice for you.  It's so much more intimate. It just fits there. Tremendous breath. Click. Magical. Click. Revolutionary. One of a kind.  We had a very aggressive price goal. $499.  And we'll have a retail price comparable with competitive ultrabook class PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unbelievable. We believe that any intersection between human and machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The intersection of technology and liberal arts. And you know, we're just getting started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we hope you love the iPad as much as we do. You'll never want to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the complete Surface family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. Now, I don't think they were intending that to be humorous.  But they were comparing. This was the original iPad launch in 2010, 28 months ago.  With the launch of the Surface, which is still not available.  It's unclear when it will be available, but probably sometime around Windows 8.  They said when Windows 8 goes RTM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's going to be available only in their three stores, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure you'll be able to get it. You won't be able to get it from Dell or Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one in my, there's a Microsoft store in my mall around here, Bridgewater.  And it's sad. You remember the Seinfeld episode, Bizarro episode?  Yes, it is Bizarro Apple Store.  It's Bizarro Apple. Yeah, it's so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't want to be an Apple, the traditional Apple bigot and say, oh, we were there first.  We did it first. Oh, look, they've got a magnet. Isn't that clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That keyboard looks really cool, though. I think there's stuff to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an interesting take on a laptop, right? Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not a laptop because you can't put it on your line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're good point. It isn't actually a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all floppy. So it has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the keyboard is a it's a touch keyboard. There are two keyboards.  There's one that's. It's noon in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whereas one thirty p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's very much like that, which is an iPad with the Logitech Ultrathin.  That's a cover. It becomes a stand.  And I think that one thing Microsoft learned is, look, people do want keyboards on their tablets.  They're also, though, and the reason I say it's a laptop is there's really two of these surfaces.  There's a Windows R T arm based one, which is essentially a real tablet,  much like the iPad, and only runs Metro applications, does not run Windows applications per se.  And then there's a win. They called the Windows 8 Pro surface, which is running Windows 8,  the actual operating system and will run Windows apps.  And that's a very big difference. One is going to cost more like a laptop.  That's the one that's comparable to an ultra book.  One is comparable, supposedly competitive is what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lower end will not run native apps, not native Windows apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. So one of the one of the things Microsoft has said about Windows R T is you will have to be a Metro app.  Now, as a developer, you can write a Metro app for Windows and have press a button and say that's also going to be available on the tablet.  But as it stands right now, this is another tablet with no apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, right. So so so it was before I knew that I thought the only reason for me to look lustily at the at the surface  was if I could run store and then share through Dropbox real Microsoft Word documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you probably can, because it will ship with not a full version, but a trial version of Office for Windows R T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both versions of the tablet. Yes. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. Do you think that the integration with the Microsoft sort of ecosystem alone, just the office apps and SharePoint and SkyDrive,  like just that alone will be compelling enough for people to buy it?  I know some people who work at huge organizations and live with Office and do all their work through Office and having a tablet that instantly connects to Exchange  and has all the sort of rich features that the Microsoft suite offers would be good enough alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's always been how Microsoft sold non PCs. That's how they sold Windows Phone.  It's still how they would sell Windows Phone.  And it's not compelling enough for Windows Phone to be even close to competitive with Android and iPhone.  Right. But it is how they it is their set.  It's their lock in. You know, Apple has a lock into. Let's not ignore it.  But their lock in in business is works in a Windows environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft is not is not motivated to make finally make Word operate on the iPad.  But now Apple is oddly motivated to make Word documents smoother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google to remember Google bought QuickOffice. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So Google Docs can work with. Yeah.  Microsoft has that weird problem where it's like on one side, Enterprise on the other side, Xbox, you know, and they're wildly successful on both ends.  They're so different. But then all the stuff in the middle kind of isn't there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the real challenge for Windows in general is going to be business.  I think business is going to stay with Windows 7.  And I think that that is underlying why Microsoft can do this, because, you know, one of the challenges of this is if Microsoft this is a huge change in Microsoft's business model.  They've never made PCs. They've always licensed an operating system to PC makers.  The only hardware they made was Xbox and, you know, mice and keyboards, but Xbox.  So now they're competing with all of their they're competing with the channel.  And now there's two reasons they can do that.  I think one is that they recognize business is going to stay with Windows 7.  So the channel will continue. You know, Lenovo and Dell and everybody else will continue to say, I think Windows 7 is going to last a lot longer than, let's say, XP or really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Michael Dell, don't you say, OK, you just left me in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what is Michael Dell going to do? What can Michael Dell do? Where does he go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he hopes that his operating system doesn't compete with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has to. Is he going to? He can't. Was he going to become a Linux house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like what's he going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the other part of that. There's two pieces. And that's the second piece is Microsoft's basically saying, what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he could become a Chrome house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No Chrome house, Chrome OS.  Yes, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dell could sell servers. Dell could could could go, you know, maybe high end.  Lenovo. What does Lenovo do? What does Acer do?  What is all what are all these companies that are living in the Microsoft ecosystem do?  They can't give up. They have to continue to sell Windows, right?  And there's those who say, and I think this might also be true, that as in fact, one of the guys who said this was the CEO was it of Acer or Asus?  I think it was the CEO of Asus said, Oh, don't worry.  We're not worried. As soon as we start shipping our tablets, Microsoft will step back.  This is just to kind of prime the pump.  I thought that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is, do we wish that Google will do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cage about the price because they want to set this set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll interpret, Kevin.  He said, maybe this is why they're being cagey about the price.  Because they don't want is because they don't want to hurt the channel, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It may be that they're saying we're doing the example and compete for the low end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's almost a reference platform.  And they had some success with Windows Phone by being very specific about what the hardware should be.  There isn't any variety among Windows Phones.  Very impressive, Leo, that you speak 4G.  I'm learning. It started with you. You gave me my first training.  Gina, you raise a very interesting point.  Next week we're going to see Google and some of the rumors are that Google will do the same thing.  We'll say we're going to make an Android tablet because none of you seem to have a clue about what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am dying for Google to do this.  I want Google to do this.  I want Google to issue the ultimate best reference Nexus tablet that acts as sort of instructive to the rest of the manufacturers.  This is what the tablet experience should be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've already done that with Android phones with Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So I want a Nexus tablet. That's what I'm hoping for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you I would be willing to bet 5 to 1. That's what they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You think we're going to get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You are because I'm going to be here anchoring.  Stop grinning, Gina.  Jeff and I, are you going to be able to join us for our Google I.O. keynote?  I won't know until I get the schedule.  Well, Kevin, I'm sure you will. So we'll do breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can give me Jeff's ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. We're going to send you there, actually. We have to talk to Google and see if we can do a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to grow a beard and go to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I talk about Gutenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just Gutenberg and Habermas it all the way. You'll be safe.  But Gina will be there and then we'll do what we normally do.  And in this case, Google makes it easy because they provide a stream of the keynote.  Last year there were two keynotes, two successive days with lots of information in both.  I'm not sure how we'll handle that if they're going to do that.  But they haven't said, have they, Gina? We don't even really know what's going to happen at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't. Well, the session schedule for developers is up on the site.  But those sessions start at 11.45 on both Wednesday and Thursday.  And there's nothing in the time slot from 9 or 10 till 11.45.  So I think we will presume that there will be a day one keynote and a day two keynote from 9 or 10 till 11.45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think we're going to see at Google I.O.? A reference tablet?  Because Android tablets are just stalled.  The only one we know as a success is the Kindle Fire, which in no way mentions Android or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, the reference tablet.  I mean, I'm hoping to see... If they don't hand out the glasses,  I would like to at least see a demo or an announcement about glasses, about Project Glass during the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure that they will. They've been wearing them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, sure they have. They have. And so Glass Tablet and Google TV, I think we're going to we're going to hear about as well.  I bet they're going to release a new or announce a new Google TV set-top box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of rumors about that. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they may do... Anything else we're hoping for?  I mean, as a developer, I'm hoping that they're going to announce that Google Plus has a real API.  Oh, huge. Huge.  With a lot more methods that are currently available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's almost too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, really? Interesting. Do you think it's too late for Google Plus in general?  Or do you think it's too late for Google Plus to hook developers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As far as I can tell, the only reason Google Plus is even still around is because you just get it automatically.  Yeah. And they're insistent about it.  Flipboard isn't asked that they're going to put Google Plus in Flipboard.  Whoo. Yeah, I was not overwhelmed by that.  Flipboard right now is driven by Twitter.  So basically what happens with Flipboard is it turns your Twitter stream, all the links in your Twitter stream or others Twitter streams or whatever, into a magazine.  And it's a beautiful way to do it. It's actually brilliant.  And, you know, it will work well with Google Plus, especially if you follow photographers.  There'll be a great, you know, a lot of photographers use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know. I'll be honest. I forget about Google Plus a lot.  But when I do go there, I see a lot of content, mostly from people in our tribe, so mostly from journalists and tech writers and developers.  Well, that's who you follow, though.  That's who I follow and that's who follows me.  And, you know, and I get that it hasn't penetrated beyond that community as much, although photographers are taking advantage of it and stuff.  But I don't know. It's hard to hear people say that, you know, it's dead or no one's putting content there when I see, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, there's a lot of content, although every time I look at it, I go, who are these people?  I circled these people. Who are they? But it's good content.  I just think it's a much smaller group than anybody wants to acknowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's starting to feel more and more like Buzz. I hate to say it.  It's busier than Buzz.  And it's beautiful. I mean, I love the G Plus app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the G Plus mobile app is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're in charge of Google Plus. What the hell do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's really I think what you have to say is really telling is that Google has had three shots at social networks.  One that predates Facebook or could another buzz that was just an abomination.  It was born stillborn partly because of the privacy, whether spurious or not, the privacy concerns with its launch.  And a third now that they have thrown the entire might of Google behind.  I mean, in a way, you know, many companies never do behind a single product they've made.  So your bonuses are based on the word social at Google this year.  And despite all of that, they don't have the traction Facebook has out of the box nowhere.  Do you disagree, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I know they don't have the trust in Facebook.  I think that they are playing a longer game and they're trying to fit a lot of things together.  And what we see is G plus is one aspect of this.  I suspect a chunk of what we see at I.O. is this idea of integrating these pieces together across much more of Google and that making more sense so that it shows up in other parts where at the moment it's sort of they've got little bits around the edges, but they haven't integrated many products.  I suspect we'll see a tighter integration with Android.  We'll see some better integration with with Docs and with YouTube and with the other major properties.  And that will be part of what they do.  And if they that is if they launch an API for this, they've been they've been sort of hedging on that for far too long and they're talking about pollution and so on.  But they've said they're going to bet that they're going to bet this strategy on integrating this stuff across the company and joining different products up.  So I expect we'll see some of that at I.O. next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The more that they do that, the more it feels forced to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing is, the thing is, like, Google's had so many products for so long that weren't focused on community, but that community that communities had built up around them.  Right. So like YouTube, you know, you connect with your friends, reader, logger, Gmail.  I mean, a lot of big not search.  Right. But most of their flagship products had some sort of social element.  They were all just disconnected.  So maybe Google Plus is just about connecting those.  And that's that's what that's what we saw with the privacy policy consolidation.  That's what we see with the plus mechanism sort of propagating throughout these other products.  It's true that they failed with every product that they've tried to make solely about social.  Here's Google's social product.  But every single one of Google's products has some element of social to it, except for search.  It's a good until search plus your world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have. I mean, YouTube is a really good example of a big social network thriving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Crazy community going on on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you have a huge risk, too, because if you start and I think they feel this way because they've been very slow to integrate YouTube into Google Plus.  And in fact, you don't see a Google Plus.  You know, you don't see the plus bar on YouTube.  And I and I think there's some real nervousness in both directions.  I want to bringing all those YouTubers who are somewhat less mature, perhaps, into Google Plus.  And then there's this also this thing that you could kill YouTube, the vibrant YouTube community.  It's like mixing a saltwater in a freshwater aquarium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. Yes.  Well, the challenge YouTube has always had is that it hasn't had good tools for growing community on it.  So it ends up being like the world's worst chat room.  And they've been getting gradually better at that, but it's still not great.  And that's that that's the piece that they need to fix because the YouTube community is is very messy.  Now, the bridge they've got there is hangouts and the hangouts have fairly good moderation controls.  You can create the live streams and then part this YouTube later.  So they do have some gateway going that way.  And you can share YouTube videos on class.  But you're right. It still feels a bit arm's length.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I'm going to go the other way. I'm actually using Facebook less and less and less and less.  Why? And I end up because I just don't find conversations there.  It's repetitive to Twitter, which I used to do, too.  So I see the same people who I'm interested in here.  I'm interested in there.  It it kind of gives me just a small smattering of what's going on.  I think seems a little slow.  Whereas Google Plus, maybe it's just because it's the home of geeks.  But I see more there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do think that that's you know, that's always the issue with a social network.  As soon as it's up to the public, people like us go, oh, I wouldn't.  Nobody nobody goes there.  And one of the reasons people like us like Google Plus is because it is geeks.  It's Google engineers, pretty much for the most part.  And so the quality level is I'll grant you very high Google Plus.  But I don't think it's a real social network.  I mean, I think Twitter is showing some really kind of surprising legs in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a there was an interesting presentation from the web this morning,  California time, late afternoon London time from Josh Elman talking about how  they changed the onboarding process at Twitter to encourage you to follow people.  And that I complained about it.  You have to say no to Lady Gaga four times before you can type into Twitter anymore.  But that's by design.  They want you to follow 20 public figures and 10 friends.  If you do that, you're like to stay on Twitter.  So they built the whole onboarding process to do that, which means it's changed  from being a group discussion network, which is how we all started it.  We joined in when it was like texting to your friends to do a text and is now this  information network where the bulk of your traffic is coming from people who aren't  following you for the most users.  So it's becoming more of a broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's becoming more of a broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it does still have the ability to have two way conversations that don't get  polluted, which was always the problem with any kind of public commenting system.  If they still have that ability to for two famous people to have a conversation on  it without all the out replies drowning everyone else.  So that piece, they've still got that still works.  And they just announced something this week where by default they will hide any  posts from a verified account to start with that.  So when you go to the account, you don't see all the fan shout outs.  You just see the thing that was public anyway.  So they're converging more towards that worldview where there are special people and  normal people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for explaining that because I read this blog post yesterday and I didn't  understand what they were talking about.  When you visit a Twitter user's profile, you may want to see his or her original  tweets rather than their conversations.  Then again, you may enjoy seeing the back and forth exchanges they have with other  Twitter users.  Now you can have it both ways.  When you visit the profiles of verified accounts, as you said, Kevin, like NASCAR,  Pepsi, by default, you won't see any out replies.  So that's me, by the way.  So that's interesting.  All if you follow me now on Twitter, you know, and by the way, most of the content  I put on Twitter is now at replies because what I'll do and I did this a couple of days  ago is I pose a question and then have a bunch of conversations around that.  You would only see the posed question.  You wouldn't see anything else unless you say I want to see everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But becoming a verified, getting to be a verified account is still, is not an open,  you can't apply to do that.  It's not open to the public, right?  You have to purchase Twitter ads or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they just did it for, well, maybe because I was grandfathered in or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they had an open program early on and then they closed that and now you have to  know somebody and, you know, it's done through agents basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here if you look at Leo Laporte on Twitter, I don't know why you would.  There's two links now here, all or no replies.  And the default, which means that's what most people will see if they're not, you know,  regular Twitter user, has no replies.  It's just, it's just my tweets without my conversation.  And it took out, by doing so, it took out, I don't know, date, tons of posts.  Because a lot of what I say on Twitter is at replies.  Now I've had people complain about that and maybe this is what the response is.  People bitch because I'm at replying publicly.  They say, you know, if you just, if you don't start it with a word, but you start it with  the at reply, we won't have to see that crap.  But I, and I said, I know how to use Twitter.  I'm doing that because I think my response is of a more general interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you put the dot when you want everyone to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or I try to do it a little more elegantly.  Like I'm responding to Oum Malik who's saying something about how Twitter for the,  for the Mac is crap.  And he's saying, and I say, ha, Oum, instead of just saying, ohm, I say ha.  I kind of like the elegant inference of Twitter for the Mac though.  And I make a point when I do that of putting context so that you can read that.  And it's not just yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but sometimes it's not a reply.  Sometimes I'm asking somebody a question or something like that.  And so that's gone.  But it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't matter?  Well, if you're verified, you're not, so you don't have to worry about it.  But if you're verified, dot doesn't make any difference.  If it has an add in it, let me look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it has an add in it at all.  Yes.  It's all the stuff with adds is gone.  It was an initial add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No.  Well, not in my, not in my, in my case, it took all of this stuff out.  Like where I said ha at Oum, gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Because you clicked on reply.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So it's just it's a becomes a PR mechanism.  It's just the messages you want to send out.  Well, here's an interesting one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I backed a God, I hope this doesn't get funded on Kickstarter.  A couple of people want to do a folk album on the moon and they're trying to raise 21 million dollars.  And I pledged a thousand because I thought they'll never make it.  So Kickstarter tweets it.  Yeah, I could be in trouble.  Right.  You know what?  If they can raise 21 million, then I'll be happy, glad to give them a thousand.  So it tweets that and it did put at Kickstarter in that tweet.  So you're right, Gina.  It's probably because I've been pressing reply, but I don't know when you press reply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a field that gets attached to your tweet in a high to post ID.  And that's how Twitter recognizes and an API developer recognizes that it is a reply.  So if you click reply and then even edit the tweet so that it doesn't start with the username,  it still it still looks like a reply and that's why I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is good.  So this is a little work around.  Don't you could just edit it without the reply thing.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like don't click reply.  Just type, just start a new tweet and say hi at home.  Have you guys seen branch?  Speaking of curated conversations with the special people and let's take a break and we'll talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to ask you something else about Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We come back to Twitter, NASCAR page and NASCAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NASCAR.  This is a huge, by the way, little blog post of Twitter, kind of some coverage.  No, this is a massive change in Twitter.  And I think there's a lot that's this.  It's people will notice if Twitter looks very different all of a sudden if you follow a lot of authorized accounts.  Including me, I think it's becoming more of an advertising medium.  It's become a broadcast medium.  But first, first you need to do your ad.  But first, a word from stamps.com.  Speaking of broadcast mediums, I got to pay the bills here.  And the way we pay the bills is with our fine sponsors.  And we pick them very carefully.  We hand select our sponsors because we want to make sure that we are talking about a product that you are, A, going to be interested in and B, that we have used and like.  We don't do advertisements for anything that we don't use and like.  And stamps.com is a really good example.  I've been using stamps.com for years, long before we did the ads for them because it's so cool.  It lets you print U.S. postage from your computer.  You don't go to the post office anymore.  The post office comes to you.  Stamps.com lets you print postage the minute you need it.  It's always the right postage because you use those USB scales they give you.  And I'll tell you how you get that scale.  Plug it in the computer.  Plop the letter on there.  It'll even print it on the envelope, which is very looks very nice.  Better than a post.  You know, post.  What do they call it?  Postal meter mark.  In fact, you don't need a postage meter.  You don't need special links or anything.  You're just printing with your printer right on the envelope.  Or for a package.  You can even buy sticky labels that it'll print onto if you want like traditional stamps.  And it's all through stamps.com.  We've got a special trial for you.  Go to stamps.com and you see in the upper right hand corner there is a microphone.  I want you to click that because the offer is going to be better than the one on the front page.  And use the offer code TWIG.  And this is a no risk trial.  It's a $110 bonus offer.  You get the digital scale.  You get $55 in postage coupons.  You get the month trial.  All you do is pay shipping and handling for this guy.  I think that's five bucks.  It is a really great deal and scales yours to keep forever.  You can cancel anytime.  Scales are yours to keep forever.  Stamps.com.  Never go to the post office again.  Get discounts you can't get at the post office.  The mail carrier comes and gets the mail.  You don't have to get up from your seat.  Or maybe you do to open the door.  Stamps.com.  Give it a try today.  Alright, who's first?  Jeff, you wanted to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just say one more bit on Twitter, Gina, then I absolutely want to hear that conversation.  But we were going to discuss this last week.  The NASCAR page.  NASCAR now basically owns the hashtag.  And I wondered about that online and I said is there anything wrong with that?  And people said, well, no, not as long as everything makes it through.  I saw some reference that it's a curated page.  So if I say NASCAR is awful for making near death into a spectator sport.  That ain't going to happen.  And that doesn't end up on that page.  Then have they now restricted, have they now turned hashtags, the platform of the people, into something that a brand can buy and control?  That's a question.  I don't know the answer.  That's what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this search results for hashtag NASCAR?  Yes.  So if you search hashtag NASCAR, you get this branded.  You get a branded page.  It's a very branded page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a search result anymore.  By the way, you can also go directly by Twitter.com and hashtag NASCAR instead of at NASCAR.  I have a serious problem with this if it is curated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If your tweet got pulled out of that, then yeah, I think that's it.  Let me tweet something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm just doing to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we're doing this live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are live.  We are slamming NASCAR live.  Not that we'd really slam them.  We're just curious what will happen.  I have to say in every case these are, love Dale Jr.  Love Danica.  In fact, Danica is tweeting.  Love Jeff Gordon's tweeting.  Darrell Waltrip's tweeting.  These are curated.  This is clearly curated.  As it goes back, because I could guarantee.  Well, no, you don't even have to.  I'll tell you this right now.  It starts.  So what that means.  It goes back to the 17th of June in like four clicks.  Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I don't like this at all because the hashtag is what enables things like Occupy  Wall Street to exist and FU Washington to exist.  And if someone can buy that and then control it.  So you get to the point of, you know, Romney hashtag.  Right.  It's not going to show up on a search for Romney.  And you can pay for that.  I wonder.  I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it looks like there's a button to click to view search, the actual search results,  not the sponsored page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  View search results.  I see it.  You're right.  Right there next to tweets.  There's view search results.  And then is it different?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then you get top and then you have to go all again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you get top.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then you have to click all again.  Now I see Kevin's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so wait, so let's break this down.  You type NASCAR into the search into the search box and you don't get search results.  You get NASCAR sponsored page, which then says view all search results.  So you click on that and then you get top tweets.  No, which are very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you search for NASCAR, you get the NASCAR search results.  If you click hashtag NASCAR, you get the now.  Now it's now it's giving me the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I, when I went to Google and search, no, they all when I do hashtag NASCAR in the search,  I get the NASCAR NASCAR page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.  Maybe I've indicated that something.  You know what?  I clicked the thing that says show search.  I apparently have switched something off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I, you know, when I did it the first time, I went to the sponsored page.  And now that I've done it again, I went straight to the search results and I had clicked view search results.  So maybe you turn it off.  That's a whole different UI issue.  Yeah, that's yeah, that's a different UI issue.  But telling someone they're searching for a word and sending them to a sponsored page is a very strange UI decision.  That is control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, even if it were just sponsored, when I first asked the question, if they just had an ad on that page, I wouldn't object.  Right. You're interested in NASCAR.  Here's a NASCAR ad.  We want to get a message across to you.  You know, go watch people try to kill themselves.  OK. But the fact that they have control over what we say about that topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really interesting.  Now, if I go to Twitter dot com hashtag twit, not at twit, but hashtag twit, it takes me to the twit canonical page, which is not, by the way, authorized.  I mean, it is our page, but it's not like officially approved.  So. But if I but if I search for twit, then I get a search result.  So I guess they've changed what Twitter dot com hashtag means.  And if I do hashtag OWS.  Yeah, I get us. I get a page is OWS.  So they so. So they're confused.  They're muddling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not clear what you're going to talk to the show in the past about.  And I don't go quite this far.  But but but the sanctity of search that was people search.  This is what they expect to get.  Yeah, yeah.  And so I thought there'd be more of a hubbub.  And I thought, well, I'm wrong.  People on Twitter just said, no, no, not the company, but just users said, no, no, no, it's just an animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what it's doing is reflecting Twitter culture.  All of these changes are now reflecting how people are using Twitter, which is as a brand.  It's a, you know, it's a stream.  It's not about us users.  It's about the brands and, you know, Twitter is saying you're saying.  But I think the reason there's done it up or is because people go, yeah, that's what Twitter is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A place to follow brands.  I was going to say this sounds seems more like what how Twitter wants people to use Twitter.  I don't. That's not why I use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yes, I know you're an old fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know this is the thing that Josh was saying at the web was this is this is how they conceive of Twitter.  Now they conceive of it as this place where you follow people who don't follow you back.  You follow famous people, you follow famous things.  Exactly. They ask you to search for NASCAR and Lady Gaga and football and whatever the hell else as part of the sign up process.  So before they even ask you to connect to your friends.  So they want you to understand it in that mode before that you understand it as a communications tool to your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's that's that's I mean, listen, nice people on Twitter, but that's not a platform for the people.  That's not a platform that enables revolutions.  No, that's that's a wholly different thing.  Now tie it to the previous functionality you mentioned.  Right. So now you're Lady Gaga.  Now on your page, not the search for you, but the but the user page.  Now you can get rid of all that riffraff conversation and just give your message out.  Your NASCAR, your Nestle.  Thank God. Just get your advertising message out.  Clue train manifesto, folks.  We sent him a few copies.  Markets are conversations.  They're not messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, thank you.  And by the way, now that Twitter is doing it, how long before Facebook and everybody and all the other social networks start doing it?  Because it is a it is a business model.  It's a good business model.  Yeah, it is.  Twitter going IPO any day now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what the challenge is.  And Facebook has done.  And Facebook has had this very distinction between personal pages and what are they other called brand pages.  Right.  So you end up with two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they recently blurred that a bit by letting people follow you on your personal page as well.  So you can follow people without them having to friend you.  So they're converging a bit more.  And I think they learn a lot from Twitter where Twitter had didn't make this thing.  You have to be a person.  You could be an entity or a joke and you can still create this this thing that's there.  I think Twitter's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not a genius point.  So, Gina, you're going to curate the conversations.  And I want to mention that after you do that, there's a new service from an MP in the UK that's trying to do the same thing.  So why don't you do first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, this is what we were going to talk about.  What is it, Blaze?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's branch.  So beta branch.com.  It's actually it's it's invite only right now.  But one of the ones I was involved in actually got to the front page of all things.  So if you go to all things, D.com under must reads, there's a link that says owning your own words.  Is it important?  That's a link to a branch conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Is this an all things D?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go under must reads and then I'm confused.  The red that red label right down there on the on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, is owning your words important?  Owning our words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a link to a branch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not an article on all things D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is now this is just a link.  So so branch is the food camp of of Twitter conversations.  You actually you get invited.  So somebody starts a conversation and then invites a couple of people to participate and they can respond and then they can invite other people.  So Josh, Josh Miller started this conversation, invited a Neil who invited me and M.G.  Seigler and Paul Ford and a few people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is a very clever way to spread a beta.  Yeah, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So only the people who are invited to the conversation or the people they've invited can participate can post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Gina does the so the person who starts the branch is the one who has control over exactly the person who starts the branch is doing.  Nick Denton is doing where in any comment thread post there.  Right.  When you start a comment, you control the rest of the thread based on your comment.  So this is a similar way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the idea is to make a really high quality conversation with people you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of Quora ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Quora ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What it reminds me of is the group blogs we used to use back in 2001 when we were talking about ClueTrain where we just used Blogger and gave six people contribution rights and then you would write posts to each other.  So for me it's like a trip back in time 10 years when that was the tool we had.  And it's you know it is one that the reason we did it then was that you know that was before we built Technoride there wasn't a notification mechanism.  So you have to go back to the same place to check it.  And the secondary reason was that you can control who can respond to it.  But it was also because at that time blogs didn't have comments by default.  That was the tip.  They were independent mechanisms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina what do you think about this?  This is cool.  It's cool but it's also a closed room.  It says the conversation is concluded.  Nobody else can comment.  Yeah you get rid of the riff raff but you also talk about echo chambers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the key is not to invite Scobel at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that's the thing.  I really mixed feelings about it.  I have the same mixed feelings about this as I have about Foo.  Like Foo was a fantastic experience.  This is a great conversation.  I've been in two branch conversations and both of them have been very high quality with people who I admire and who I you know if I sent them an email I probably wouldn't get a response because they're just really busy.  Right.  So the exclusivity kind of brings out folks who maybe wouldn't respond otherwise if it was open to everyone.  At the same time I had a bunch of people on Twitter saying please please please invite me to branch.  Why can't I participate.  So it gives you that experience of like oh well no just the cool kids.  You didn't make it past the development rope.  So it's hard.  I mean interestingly Dave Weiner was invited.  So he basically said I'm not going to write for free on someone else's site.  I'm going to write on my own blog.  You can link to it from there.  They won't do interviews.  And I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If a reporter calls Dave, this is not always the case, but a reporter calls Dave and says I want to ask you something.  He says if I care about the topic I'll write that on my blog and everybody can see it.  And if I don't care I won't.  And that's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you can apply for an invitation.  This is now currently a closed beta.  But you can put your email in there and it says well you know.  So it may at some point become well I guess no each conversation will be invite only though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each conversation is invite only.  So you could start a conversation.  So Leah it was interesting.  Like this weekend you asked a question which I saw and you were getting a bunch of replies.  And I went to your profile and wanted to see how you responded to everyone.  To the people who replied to that original question.  That's interesting to me.  I wanted to see your conversation with everyone.  And so this to get back to what we started with originally this change to verified profiles.  Where by default you don't see the person's replies.  That's I don't like that.  I mean I want to see people with tons millions of followers like you.  With a conversation.  You know engaging with the riff raff.  I mean you know that's like it's like the best part of Twitter is seeing your heroes interact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a place in the world for authoritative people to have a private.  Oh authoritative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that's just so.  I'm an elitist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm a per elitist idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would imagine you using this let's say to do your debate about cyber hawkism.  Right.  Hockery.  Right.  And we did you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love it if there were if there were like the you know what I'd love to see is kind of this is the main channel invite only and then there's a side channel of comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like it but it's like the economist debates which is what you're talking about.  But the problem is.  It's like Twitter.  Look at this is what broadcasting is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you can't.  So it's exactly like Twitter.  Right now you're on the three of you are on the show by invitation only.  But we do have a chat room and you can respond and we respond back.  So it's I think this is a balanced way of doing it.  I'm an elitist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go left out.  Well I think they often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let the chat room eat cake.  They often want to be on the show and I won't let them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of people really want to be on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  I would love for them all to be on it.  We need new we need we need new new blood of course.  It's a scale.  It's a scaling issue.  And then in broadcast it is totally a scaling issue.  And I would submit that it just because it's the Internet doesn't mean that you can't you shouldn't be able to have a kind of limited conversation.  I know but I know you would say the conversation anyway.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a difference between here's a limited conversation and here's the piece of the conversation you can see.  Right.  True.  All that true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All that true.  And I could just say I could just do a blog and allow no comments.  So that's that I can absolutely do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we can do a Google Hangout.  You know when we had the WWDC announcement I did a Google Hangout in which I only invited people in my tech journalist circle.  Now it was open to those hundred people and eight of them joined us.  Those people got a say.  So it's a little more democratic but not it's not fully democratic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No that's that's all true.  But I just if I were to use branch I think people would say oh so you're scared of talking to the public.  Mr. Public there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I would use all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah.  Right.  There's another service just out called Mention M E N S H N M E N S H N dot com.  Not to be confused started by an MP in the UK named Louise Mention.  This is interesting.  Her argument here is that she wants to have that it's hard to have a conversation around a topic that on Twitter it just is everything flowing at the same time.  And I complain on Twitter the problem that this makes a media mistake of saying well we will tell you what you're going to discuss.  It was a very bad accent.  Well could you create a topic.  She came back and said people can suggest topics.  Louise me and Twitter.  Louise Mention is a conservative MP Tory MP and she was part of the hearings with Murdoch and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting because it's mainly about the US election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She did.  No no she did it start off with just US market.  That's the way the brits got it right Kevin.  That's why you're here.  I'm going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to mention that we are going to do a triangulation this afternoon with Doc Searles one of the authors of the Clotrain Manifesto.  So since we were talking clutrain let's have Doc on and he's got a new book actually called The Attention is the intention economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The intention economy about the vendor relationship as opposed to customer relationship management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this conversation will continue.  But see maybe I am a Meletus because I come from media mainstream media which has this limit this tech technical limit of you know you can't have a conversation with a thousand people.  Because it's you know it's live.  It did have that limit.  Yeah but we don't have it anymore.  That's right.  And I do a radio show where any idiot can call and often does.  And God bless them every month.  No even there you have call screening which which allows you to control how how you can actually and in many many I would say in many in many mainstream radio shows you actually want the idiots you you actually tune out the smart people you don't call.  This is not a joke.  The call screen if you're too verbal and intelligent say you know call call call Rush Limbaugh because we don't want to talk.  And then and and so what you want is idiots because it makes a much more interesting radio show frankly.  Or miss you see smarter what really idiots talk.  Well that's another interpretation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean these are idiots asking for tech help right is like no there's no any key like a cup holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do filter those out.  It's a CD tray.  If I get to the point where I need to look smarter I'll start getting those calls more.  You control it.  But it does feel more democratic I have to say.  This is interesting that it made it to must reads and all things D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that you've been invited into a conversation.  Do you have the power to start a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh I'm telling you do not invite Scobel.  By the way I wanted to mention Kevin is one of the reasons Kevin Marx is here is this is the seventh anniversary of micro formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoo.  It is.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoo.  What is micro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are micro formats.  Micro formats are ways of adding extra meaning to your HTML so that they can make more sense for computers as well as for humans.  Things like XFN.  XFN is the X station more friends network that lets you link to other other people and say whether they are your friends or your followers or whether you.  Red equals me is a really important one.  So this is this site is also me.  It's also things like H card which lets you create a business card on the page that can be pulled out again straightforwardly.  And the series of other models like that for embedding structured meaning in the page.  What's different about it is that there is never an alternative version of this that embed an entirely parallel set of data in the page.  If you look at Facebook's OTP it gives you a bunch of stuff at the top of the page that is independent of what the content is.  Part of the point of micro formats is that it's using the actual text of the page just giving some extra hints to the computers reading it as to which piece is which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's open.  It's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Our standards organization is a wiki.  That's how open it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way I had really high hopes that this would become the social network because basically your everybody's page becomes part of a larger social network.  And it just it's it was it was the right way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But unfortunately it's still there.  I mean the XFN stuff is still there.  WordPress publishes it.  Blogger publishes it.  Twitter used to publish it.  I haven't actually looked since their last redesign.  I need to double check that.  Facebook publishes it but they made it harder to crawl because they don't serve pages to you unless you say you're a browser.  Google class profiles still publish XFN.  So a bunch of this stuff exists on the web.  But what we've seen is sites instead building closed social networks rather than crawlable ones which is been really tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well there's still a party tonight.  Six thirty at Mozilla in San Francisco.  Is it open?  Do you have to get an invitation to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah there's an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh I see you invited me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure it's public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Well I have been invited and I invite you.  This is a standards body that has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It takes a radical openness principle that says anyone can have the standard and will defend it as a wiki would.  Yes and I defend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's great.  And I don't think it's at all weird that you used Facebook to invite people to your party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do that too.  We also have a page marked up on the side and we have a blank cast link.  We used to use upcoming when that existed but it didn't exist.  I've actually looked at that page for a few years.  That's what he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin is having a party already at Ferry Plaza apparently.  LinkedIn is being sued by an Illinois woman that's just in over the password breach.  She's suing them for five million dollars brought in federal court in San Jose.  It seeks class action status.  So this would be a bad precedent if every site that had a breach of passwords got sued.  The whole Internet will collapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any reference to actual damages in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that's why you don't really have a.  Katie Ziprica user of the website from Illinois used a Illinois based law firm Edelson-Maguire.  She said LinkedIn had deceived customers by having a security policy and clear contradiction of accepted industry standards for database security.  LinkedIn says the lawsuit is without merit that no member no member count has been breached as a result of the incident.  And there's no reason to believe that any LinkedIn member has been injured.  In other words you got to show you are harmed if nothing happened.  Sorry.  Well we'll see.  This sounds like one of those cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if we're going to get to a point to where sites say as part of their TOS you may not use a password you use for another site and if you do it's your own damn fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that would be one source of harm wouldn't it?  Oh I just gave lawyers an idea.  That's all right they have plenty of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have plenty of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey good news Google offers is now available on the iPhone.  This is something they added didn't they add it to a maps or is it oh no it's a standalone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Standalone app I just downloaded it for a show started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is their Groupon.  Google offers for the iPhone.  Is it office?  No yeah Google offers for the iPhone now that's what we need.  This is like Groupon you get you know coupons off and all of that.  Which is an old model I think.  It does feel dated.  Now when SNH Greenstamps does an app then I'm going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You remember those Leo did you have to lick those too?  Oh yeah mom would make me.  Wait wait wait test here.  Gina do you know what an SNH Greenstamp is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No idea.  What?  No idea.  SNH Greenstamps?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait wait wait what do you think it is?  Gina what do you think that stands for?  Chat room what do you think it means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then there was blue wasn't it like blue some other stamp there was?  Gold.  Statism and?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gold stamps?  Yeah that was the worst stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know was it like a Willy Wonka chocolate bar thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably don't remember the days when gas stations would give you plates for filling up either.  Plates?  Like eating plates?  Like dinnerware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I've suddenly entered some like weird place.  Like my entire reference to reality is off.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No a guy it's kind of weird you'd pull up in the gas station a guy had come up to you in a nice white suit with a little hat and say fill her up today sir.  Can I check your oil?  You'd pop the hoodie check the oil it filled you up and then he'd give you a plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay really?  Am I Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I making this up Jeff?  Am I making this up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was premium marketing and actually there's a magnificent wonderful book about the history of the great A&P.  Which was really the first chain store and now we live in the era of chain stores dying.  And the way they competed with each other was not necessarily on price because the law little tiny mom and pop grocery stores banded together to fight the chain stores as if they were evil.  Gee it's just like today people against Google.  Nothing changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing ever changes.  Nothing ever changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they would try to get government regulation to stop it so the government regulation against consumers interest would freeze prices high wouldn't lighter lower prices.  So what they would do is they would instead give you these stamps.  You put these stamps in these books poor Leo and I would have to lick these stamps.  You have to lick them.  Then your mother would take in 10 of these books and you know get a beach ball or something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now Kevin Creewell in the chat room is reminding me that grocery stores used to sell encyclopedias one letter a month.  Yeah.  So you get the funk.  It was Funkin Wagnalls and you'd get the encyclopedia.  Was it Funkin Wagnalls?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was Sesame Street.  This month is brought to you by Elle.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And get ready for this.  Microsoft bought that encyclopedia and it was the foundation for Encarta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh Encarta.  Who remembers Encarta?  I remember that.  Was it Collier's?  Premium marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So actually one of the great moments of premium marketing was Sports Illustrated coming up with the sneaker phone.  It was a phone in a sneaker and the problem was that people started buying they wanted the phone they didn't want the damn magazine.  And so they subscribe just long enough to get the damn phone and then they'd cancel the magazine and there were warehouses filled with sneaker phones.  And so Time Inc. found itself in the sneaker phone business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always wanted a football phone from ESPN but that's another story for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How the heck did we get on the SNH Green Stamps?  How did we get on the SNH Stamps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blue Chip Stamps.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have 3370 in the chat room.  Blue Chip Stamps, SNH Green Stamps and Gold Bond Stamps.  It came up with the Google offers.  Oh that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's also Randy P. drinking glasses in laundry detergent.  Yes.  Well it's like this Cracker Jacks.  Wait, wait, wait.  Gina, you do know Cracker Jacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do know Cracker Jacks.  I know a lot of Cracker Jacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you young lady.  Apparently these SNH Stamps.  Let me tell you young lady.  The toys today are nothing like the toys we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you used to get actual toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We used to get cell phones in our Cracker Jacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you get like a piece of paper that says this is a toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, like here's a joke on a piece of paper.  Yeah, there's your toy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got your surprise.  I got your surprise right here.  Next time I fill up I'm going to be disappointed when the guy in the white hat doesn't show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  up with a plate.  I still don't get the plate thing.  I don't get the plate thing.  Well because it was incentive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to the, because this was in the days I guess when there was profit in selling gasoline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean incentive to stock up your kitchen cabinet?  I don't understand.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you'd end up with a whole set of plates.  You'd end up with the S&O plates.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Were they the same plates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were they different?  No, they were just plates.  It was a sack.  This month we're giving away the daisy sack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had to keep going.  It was a loyalty program.  Right, one plate, what's the big deal?  But if you want to get the whole thing, you got to come every...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a Pawn Stars episode about this, isn't there?  Oh, I'm sure there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  American Pickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why Jeff and I feel so disoriented in the modern world.  We, this is, I mean this is just beginning.  Gina, you're going to see this in 20, 30 years, I don't know, 50 years.  You're going to see this because what's happening is it's accelerating.  So the disorientation that Jeff and I feel is minor compared to what you're going to  feel like when you're our age.  You're going to say, I remember when there was a Google.  And they'll go, come on, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember when there were things called stores you used to go to to get things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember those flip phones and you pressed numbers on them to tell...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, see, you remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You remember that.  I remember a phone.  Grandma, what's a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's hard to imagine even what it will be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says 12, I don't know, is this a number I should check first?  No, but I'm glad you're bringing us back to home.  Google says 12 to 14 million searches per day returned hacked sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But 12 to 14 million searches, searches relative to what?  I mean how many searches are there per day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  12 to 14 million times a day they protect you by warning you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, our site has, as in the past from time to time, been that.  But this is year to year.  Infected sites discovered monthly.  It actually peaked in 2009 and it's been going somewhat down since then.  Attack sites discovered monthly, on the other hand, is going up.  So infected sites versus attack sites.  Attack sites are sites specifically built to distribute malware.  More of those discovered.  Legitimate sites compromised.  Apparently people are getting smarter about locking their sites down.  Yeah, that's, you know, because I think isn't this the anniversary of when Google started?  It was how many years ago?  Like say it's been a while that Google started warning people about infected sites.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five years.  Five years.  Five years since we officially announced malware and phishing protection via our safe browsing efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you Google.  Now everybody does it.  But thank you Google.  You started it.  Venice Beach bodybuilders fear Google is kicking sand at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just a funny quote.  Google is buying a whole bunch of Venice stuff and that's where Schwarzenegger, you know, built his body.  And it's filled with all these gyms.  Gold's gym, yeah.  And there's a great quote and they're not going to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google moved an army of sales and technology employees into 100,000 square feet in two Venice buildings.  I love Venice.  It's kind of down market.  But if you ever want to get a marijuana club card, 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just in case you're curious.  Leo, can you do a show of Hyne?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to, you know, when I was a younger, much younger, younger than Gina even.  Man, I think at one time I might have done a radio show somewhat out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Calling the FCC.  So the story, Nathaniel Moon bulging with muscles called this quote, the ultimate revenge of the nerds, the greatest way of getting back at all the guys that stuffed people from Google into lockers from high school and stole all their prom dates.  I'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to buy your gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can't fight against Google because they've got billions of dollars.  But he added, I love their search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, Google is not the only culprit here.  The old world gym at the top of Abbott Kenny, the place that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's gym has also been sold is no longer a gym.  It's a high end shops and offices.  And guess who bought it?  And will be a future tenant.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to buy you and then I will shred you.  Google is responding to the new British investigation of Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that's I don't chat.  Just put that in there just to get to me.  It's just for you.  When is Google going to say this was all stuff that was just I mean, we don't like it.  It was stupid.  It was wrong.  But it was all broadcast publicly on the airwaves.  What's illegal about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google says we're surprised to find ourselves confronting yet another investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the next story is that now we have U.S.  government officials going after Google and Apple because they're freaked that they're both flying planes with cameras over us.  I was a little freaked.  Don't you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I you know, it's not so much I'm worried about the pictures.  I just feel like we have air forces, private air forces above us taking swarming over us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  swarming pins above our.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I don't think it's like that.  I think it's probably the same point as same contractors working for both probably.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're probably doing these for government.  I was at MIT Media Lab night thing the last two days and a lot of talk about journalistic use of camera drones to cover things like  demonstrations.  And there were there were examples of you put a camera into a drone and you can fly over a demonstration to get to stuff that you know, beyond the police barricades.  Right.  There was one example of it being that with helicopters or balloons, or I think there was one story that I saw this on Twitter when I was out of the room.  But somebody did it to try to get hunters and the hunter shot it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's probably a good idea not to fly planes over people with weapons.  Yeah, just a hint.  At least not if they don't like you.  Now Facebook has acquired face.com.  So they're going to get even better facial recognition built into Facebook.  Apparently, Facebook can do it pretty well on desktop at the mobile is not so good face.com has got a good mobile app.  According to Mike Isaac on all things D, the deal was about much less than it was originally reported, reported.  But somewhere in the 50 to $60 million range face.com is very happy.  I mean, I don't have any problem with face recognition.  Now, if you if you do if you use Apple to the iPhone to turn on face.  No, I guess the aperture or iPhone to turn on face recognition, it just it goes right up to Facebook ads it to the Facebook.  We're all working together now.  It's OK.  We all know who you are.  Facebook says we are going to sell ads based on your web browsing.  A new Facebook system will use your activity on other websites.  Must be the like button, right?  To send you to send you what Facebook thinks are more than like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were near a purchase opportunity, you'll remember that this has been done for quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's the last time we have to click it because they can tell what page you're on because they loaded an eye frame with the like button in it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the like button sees where you're going.  But here's the here's the example from Doug Gross writing on CNN.com.  Say a Facebook user visits a travel website, clicks on a page about a vacation package package to Vegas.  If an advertiser has a bid on that kind of search, that user could then see ads for discounted trips to Vegas the next time they visit Facebook.  So but I guess but how is Facebook getting that information?  So in other words, Facebook's saying to its advertisers, this is not this is not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not new. There was a company called Dakota started by a friend of mine that was bought by AOL and then ruined and shut down where the deal was.  And the New York Times did this.  You went to the New York Times, you went to a travel page about Vegas.  You left and you went to weather.com to check the weather there.  But New York Times still had another travel ad they wanted to give you.  They couldn't.  Dakota would show you a weather.com and this that weather.com would get 40 percent of the ad for delivering the media, delivering you.  New York Times got 20 percent of the deal for delivering the data point about you and to code it.  We get 20 percent of the deal for making them come together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not a third party cookie. It's not a Facebook cookie.  It's the site you went to saying quick, buy an ad on Facebook in case they go back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think kind of. Yeah.  I mean, everything is a third party.  We're back to that.  But this is not this is not a new model.  I'm sure we'll hear horrors and hubbub coming up very soon.  But it's a model that's been in for a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But both the sites have to have this code embedded on them somehow.  I think I just assumed it was the like button that was sending information back like, oh, this IP visited here.  Right.  So you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The question is, if you're the site that created the data point because of the interest point, right.  The Dakota model, you get a share of that of that deal and the Facebook model.  I'm not sure you do, but you have willingly put the like button up on your site.  So I'm sure somewhere you sign something and say that would be OK.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying no big deal.  S.O.P. Well, that will be the reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reaction will be right for the Wall Street Journal will be opening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's just it's just to give you.  So what's different is that Facebook is now selling these ads offering Facebook's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what they've added to it is that it's a live bidding structure.  Right. So if you really want to get somebody you can bid against someone else.  So it brings that Google view of the auction into this and say, hey, we just found somebody who wants to go to Vegas.  Who wants them? What are they worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or or like if your Zappos and somebody has gone to the checkout page but canceled.  Right. Now you see they show this person's apples ads when they're on Facebook to remind them that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or somebody else.  Somebody else can come in and say if a frustrated Zappos buyer comes in, send them to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Shoes.com or whatever.  Yeah.  You can't apparently turn this off. Good luck finding this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think that's something that I did already.  So if you go to a certain site and do something then they will show you a panel of ads that relate to that or the rest of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. This is called this is a tracking cookie. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I went to Facebook privacy settings ads apps and websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It keeps. It's I look through it. I don't see it.  I'm looking at this article again which supposedly tells us how.  But I it's anyway we leave this as an exercise for the reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally seven clicks and ads shown by third parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well while you're in there turn everything off.  Yeah. Turn it all off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know if you're Jeff don't.  Yeah Jeff you leave it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I've been seeing complaints lately.  I've seen this like three or four times.  It's become a kind of a meme where people do screenshots of the ads that Facebook has for them and mocks them for being so untargeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  More information that you share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We more often mock Facebook for the crappy ads than we do for the right.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by the way I just went to Facebook and what is it.  What is it giving me. It's giving me the Galaxy S3 smart of you Facebook.  Good ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah me too. I'm getting that same ad as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really. I wonder what I'm getting.  So here's the question. Do they know that I have a Galaxy S3 already and are they going to advertise something else.  Yes they are.  They're advertising HP something.  It's not clear.  Code write code for Matlab play Marvel game.  A kiss and Motley Crue concert coming up on the 15th at Shoreline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also do you want to do any of the other.  You got three numbers Jeff.  You got a ton of them.  No they were crappy numbers.  Crappy numbers.  Let's not do them.  I like nine point nine million.  That's a good number.  Yep.  It's a beautiful house but you're right.  They took the pictures.  This is this is from the Sotheby's listing.  The house was actually I got to say Jack got a deal.  It was listed four years ago for twice as much.  So and these pictures were obviously taken on the one sunny day.  I do hope I do hope Jack checked.

Transcript:  For those of you who aren't in San Francisco when you go out that far you got the sunset district out that far.  It is just pure fog.  Cat feet hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well you're out you're actually outside the Golden Gate there right.  It's freezing cold and windy but if you really.  I still I'll cut Jack invite me I'll go I'll wear a windbreaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is that fog has a weird edge to it so it may be that he's got a house in the bit that's actually sunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that fog is stable.  It's this same place every day.  There's this really bizarre time lapse that people shoot of it where it just comes and it appears and looks around the same place and goes away again.  Then when he comes back in the evening.  So he may be thinking on a bit that isn't that foggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to live out there it's foggy.  I did not live in that house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus here if you go to work you're at work when the sun's out.  Right.  Whenever you're home it's cold and foggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jack Dorsey is not confirming that he's the new owner because of course he wants privacy but it is a beautiful house.  These are the pictures that were taken for the real estate brochure.  So Jack will have better I think a better furnishings than that.  Yes.  I certainly hope so.  Nice.  My tool of the week is I was looking for a good launcher for the Galaxy S3.  I don't mind touch with Samsung's default interface.  It's fine.  But it was taking up more space on the screen than I wanted.  I wanted something that would let me get more icons on here.  Eliminate the silly row of buttons that show you what page you're on and the home page.  And I asked the chat room and they gave me two very good recommendations.  One is called Apex and one is called Nova.  This is Nova.  I chose Nova because it was a little bit for this screen resolution was a little bit better at the layout.  I have six rows from top to bottom five across.  I'm able to turn off labels on the icons which saves me space.  It's got a really nice dock that you can make as big as you want and put some special icons in there.  I use direct dial and direct text icons so I can quickly reach people.  Then really nice Nova it's called.  There's a free version and then for extra features you can pay a couple of bucks.  And I think it's worth it.  There are some really great launcher replacements.  There are a dozen of them or more.  A lot of people like Go Launcher which is free.  There's Nova and Apex are specifically for ice cream sandwich and add some really, really nice features.  This is a good partner for a Samsung Galaxy S3 which is now available as of today I think for most of the carriers in the U.S.  And a phone I once again highly recommend.  I just loves it.  Hey thank you for being here.  We appreciate it.  Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine.com.  His book Public Parts is a must read.  Get it soon.  And it's so good to see you back home in Oyster Bay or wherever the hell it is you live.  I don't know.  Kevin Marks apparently lives at the Ferry Building and I think that's a good place.

Transcript:  Poor Kevin is homeless.  We need to do a Kickstarter to get Kevin a home.  Look for his box right next to Justin Herman Plaza.
