Transcript:  This will be what I hit the same thing. Yep. You know, I just recently  I realized I have been using the guardian so much. I said, you know, I really ought to kick in  Yeah, good. I don't need to give the business insider diddly. No, it's owned by a sprayer  I am not a fan, but the guardian it's a british paper, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's based in london, but it's but it's worldwide it has major offices in new york and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Australia and i'll tell you why I gave money to the guardian because they don't have a paywall  But every time you go there  They uh, well they say not big but there's a pop-up and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I I full disclosure. I worked with them on the on the membership program  Good. Oh, well, you'll be glad but you know, we thought it was membership and we've been pretty quickly and they said you know  What it's not membership. We're not really offering we're not giving people tote bags or anything. So it's really it is that it's a donation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's charity. Yeah. Yeah. No, I learned that also. Yeah, you can't call it a membership if you don't give them anything  Really? Yeah  Well, I don't know about the uk but in the united states you have to be careful about the language you use. Yeah  This is why I don't charge people money. Yeah, it's just too complicated. Yeah, the the taxes you know tax laws get involved in things like that  Let me log in the guardian though since I did actually pay for them. I should  I should probably log in so that they know i'm here your newest  Guy, I didn't get that jeff. Did tell me what do they what they give you your choice of payments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They will give you all kinds of things. So a brilliant brilliant woman named amanda mickle is  Is the genius behind most of what they did and we brought her in new york right before the shutdown to talk to other audience people  Other publications and there's just great detail about how they do this  They've learned through the data because manda's an old campaign organizer. So she understands how to work people that way  And so they found that some people say yeah, I want to give you once a year. That's it. I'm done. Thank you very much  Okay. Goodbye, but other people say no, no, no, no  I want it feels good to reward you and I want to do it every time I see a story I like  I'll give you a little more money a little more money  And so they need options for both  They propose amounts but people will give whatever they want to give and more than a million people have given not a more than a million  Contributions, I think it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll tell you what i'm never gonna give the financial times any money because I can't I can't tell what i'm not getting  But with the guardian I was reading it. I what I realized was I was reading it every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. That's what then so so they they also found this. I love this  it was a uh  I forget the exact number of zeros here, but they they started by having kind of an ad unit saying hey give us money  and then they experimented and got rid of that and then uh,  Kath Feiner the the editor in chief did a you know a few paragraphs of  You schmuck you just read this story. Don't you feel guilty?  In the end, it was half the page  The that was a 90x

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Improvement. Oh wow in contribution. Yeah, I think people appreciate being  It's it was actually well done and saying look you appreciate what you you clearly appreciate what we do you're reading it  This is why we would love you to give us some money. This isn't free  We need to pay for it somehow and and journalism is dying everywhere and I do want to reward good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did research with readers who found what they found was readers said  No, we we we want to give you money so that it is free for the world because we think what you do is important for the world  Okay, whereas so journalists will often value themselves about saying well  What I do is valuable. You should pay me for it  No people value that in an entirely different way now, of course in the u.s  We have the the tradition of public radio  ntv to a large extent  But it works even in the uk and in australia. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anyway, yeah, I I like how they did it and it it didn't guilt me so much as inform me and then  I just used my brain  To say, you know, I have been using this a lot  They deserve they deserve and I didn't give them the biggest amount of money I could I gave them what I felt was a reasonable  Amount of money for how much I read so so today I did an interview

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which we're gonna put the video up in a couple days with a game rafat ali. Did you ever run into rafat?  rafat  Rafi, yeah, so it's actually rafat. There's no accent. I asked him day. Is it is it rafat or rafat?  He says neither. It's rafat rafat. Um, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, but he'd start paid content.org. Remember that? Yeah giga own bought it. I don't think a lot of him

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Well, he's a um,  Uh a unique character, but he started skiffed. I like rafat. He started skiffed which is which covers the travel industry  And so a he covers the travel industry b his primary 40 percent of his revenue was events  Uh-oh  So he got hit in both so we had a very frank discussion about what he's gone through and keeping he's keeping the business afloat  and um, sorry, we'll have that video up soon  Yeah, I think stacey we might have had this conversation. I think we might have had this conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna start all the sentences for the rest of the show with the word google  So that okay that way people will think that the show's about google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let's let's talk about google. Google did not demonetize zero hedge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NBC got it wrong  I thought they did zero. They didn't do federalist. No both the national review fox news and nbc which  broke the story  Uh, the issue was that uh, there was content. They're both uh zero hedge and the federalist are  uh  strongly conservative  That's and i'm saying that actually very generously because really they're cuckoo  um, and uh  The story that nbc broke was that google was going to demonetize them. They would no longer be able to run google ads  fortunately  Mike masnick as usual on tech dirt. Uh, good for you mike  No, google did not demonetize the federalist and it is not an example of any conservative bias  In fact, they did the same thing  to the federalist  And zero hedge that they had done to tech dirt  google  Uh when the case of tech dirt because of certain comments people put on tech dirt stories  They were pulling google ads from that page  And that's in fact what happened  is  Uh, it's not how nbc presented it mike says nbc's coverage is weird in its own way  It took an operation it took a report from a uk-based operation that put together a black list of websites  it said should be defunded for racist fake news  and  NBC reporters took this report reached out to google to ask about these pages  that set off google's review process  and  The recognition that some of the comments on the pages violated google's ad policies on dangerous and derogatory content  Those pages so as it does google alerted the federalist and warned if it wasn't corrected ads were removed from that page  Google says zero hedges page is already gone through this process  so, uh  It was reviewed for dangerous and derogatory content  And google worked with them  And it was never more than a page. It was never the entire site. The federalist was never demonetized

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh after google but now we've got a um  Culture war occurring around the platforms and it's gonna get worse and worse. We've already had that forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The national review is an example. It's worse cook wrote is google stupid  And this comes down to a debate that really more important debate  So this is a story that got misreported and then became part of a larger war  About you know, is silicon valley anti-conservative, but that's so we have the big debate the real big debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's related to that is the section 230 issue. So under government we've got you know, we've got we've got a three-prong attack  On 230 and the platforms the white house with his executive order now bar is going to go after them directly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then investigate white house asked fcc also to weigh in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That holly has a bill  Saying that they could be sued for quote unquote censoring political speech  Which I just tweeted. Can you read the first amendment? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So how far off are we from a like sedition act do you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a case in yeah, good question stacy. There's a case in italy that I fear  Um, did we talk about this before the italian case? I don't think we did

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, go ahead. I was in here last week. So I don't know. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't the week before last so so and you're younger and have more memory than we have so I trust you  So there was a case where there was a fascist italian fascist site and they got a lot of experience with that there that facebook took down  And courts at two levels have now ordered facebook to put it back  Which is compelled to speech which is another form of  lack of freedom of expression  to to imagine compelling the guardian  To run a brexit piece compelling facebook to have to put back up  A fascist page which they took down because it violated their for once they took something down  um  their their standards of community standards  And that's where I think we go stacy  Then we had the rather ludicrous response of zuckerberg to biden. Is that in the rundown? I think it is  Yeah, we're gonna put that in there. We're gonna get to that. Okay  But but so I think what you get is you get the chill you get the law  um in this country  Well, you know if holly manages to pass a bill, which I don't think he will pass. That's just that won't that won't happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's just grandstanding  It is but  And it wouldn't survive in court anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because they just don't  The uh, the name of the act which is hysterical is limiting section 230 immunity to good samaritans  Act I do hope that in the actual bill good samaritans is not apostrophized  but uh  If it is it gives a whole new meaning to the the name of the bill. So who knows now that was just uh,  One honest man one good. Yeah cnbc's typo  It would allow americans to sue tech companies that censor political speech or hide content from competitors  And really the upshot of this would be just mad. It's basically  It's so funny because republicans have for years have invaded against the trial lawyers  And uh and have really wanted to limit these kinds of lawsuits and this would be a bill that would basically turn on the tap  for for a million lawsuits, uh,  And it you know for anything you just didn't like it's like, okay  Um, so yeah, this is I think a non-starter is co-sponsored by marco rubio  Uh of florida mike braun of indiana and our favorite tom cotton of arkansas  You have to promise in your terms of service to operate in good faith  I promise  I just get on a record here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I promise to operate in good faith from now on but leo it's it's like the the law that is being contemplated in the uk  out of the harms report where you to operate uh with a duty of care  And no definition of what that is and no definition of what the harm is you just will know when you see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you have to operate with duty of care anybody who thinks I am not operating in good faith can now sue me for not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Operating in good faith. Yes. Well the reason so there's a couple reasons for that sort of vague language  One is it's very hard to articulate and write a law that's flexible around these things, right?  And we've decided that we really value super flexibility  um because and and  rightly or wrongly  When you put things as specifics you do tend to miss edge cases and have other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consequences that then have to be worked out but vague laws stacey, right aren't aren't vague laws are vaguerie in a law is a  Is a is is is is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to say constitutional but not good law, right? Right. So what happens it can be good law. So so that's  Usually what you have when you when you include those phrases you include things  like that is not limited to or  Constrained by and then a list and what happens is outliers and the edge cases then go to the courts  When you don't have any sort of guidance as part of the law though, it then becomes much more difficult  It's either the courts or the regulatory agencies  so having seen this and  Both of those things are a problem because one it makes it take a long time  You know a regulatory fight is going to last for two to three years  And then then there are inevitable lawsuits after that or a lawsuit can take just as long or longer  And so really we're just kind of hosed in terms of trying to get things  It's hard to pass good laws and it's become much more difficult in the last probably 30 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've also as we've also pointed out that uh, a vague law like that  That tech companies are going to err on the side of censoring everything  So yes, what?  Two unintended consequences more lawsuits and more censorship  So I don't think this is really what this is supposed to accomplish, but that's what it's going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a big tech company would actually come out and find a case and fight it with that case  That's usually how these things go. They don't self-censor  They're big enough industries you see this happen in telcoms all the time. They get a law they don't like  They instantly break it so they can test it in the courts  so  Now it will hurt smaller businesses in the meantime, but well remember it's not our publishers remember it's a three-pronged attack

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's this this bill which won't pass but that's one there's the doj  Mark lemley tweets  The doj net censorship proposal quote and this is a joke  You are both required to take down bad stuff on your sites and forbidden to take down bad stuff on your sites  This is this is this came out right after holly's bill

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Incentivizing online platforms to address illicit content  and uh  I mean i'm not gonna I don't want to read there's also by the way a bad samaritan carve out in this  There's something about the samaritans. What is a bad samaritan? It's the opposite of a good samaritan  the  first of all the doj proposes denying section 230 immunity to truly bad actors  Uh the title of section 230's immunity provision protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material makes clear  Section 230 immunity is meant to incentivize and protect responsible online platforms  It makes little sense to immunize from civil liability an online platform that purposely  Facilitates or solicits third-party content or activity that would violate federal criminal law

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now i'm starting to sound like so there's there's a twitter account which I recommend you go to now called bad 230 takes  oh boy  And it's nothing but I mean jeff kosseth who wrote the magnificent book the 26 words that created the internet  Which is a wonderful book about 230. It's the definitive book. He tears his hair out  With people getting these things wrong all the time and then today in a discussion  um  Somebody said oh, did you know there's this account?  uh, and it's uh  it's um  It's a little detailed to get into it's not kind of  Knee slappers, but for people who are section 230 geeks  It is it is a collection of stupidity

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if anybody and it looks like it comes from the eff because they're using the eff's graphic  on uh cda 230 the communications decency act section  230 so um  Yeah, the doj says the entire setup of 230 should be changed third the department  Supports reforms that make clear that section 230 immunity does not apply  In a specific case where a platform had actual knowledge or notice that the third party issue violated criminal law federal criminal law  You know and actually if it if it can be proven to violate criminal law well, okay  Or where the platform was provided with a court judgment that that content is unlawful in any respect  Why is it bad that the site should not be able to leave?  content uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Content up that violates criminal federal law. No, they don't right now. They don't that's already the law  It's it's they leave you you don't leave up if it's child pornography if it's terrorism  That's already taken care of and the platforms don't want it there and they do take it down and it is a law to take  It down because it is illegal. We have very few things that are legal in this country  But in in france and in germany, you can't leave up nazi stuff. Right that is against the law and they take it down  They follow local laws. There's nothing new in that  That's just as you say grandstanding to say, ah, they leave up illegal stuff. No, they don't  But but back to the discussion with stacey  One I think need be really careful about the notion of illegal speech  And and and and I would say that one should uh err on the side of making very little speech illegal  Uh, and but if you do you've got to be explicit in definition

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and they  I mean these are platforms. So as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's my biggest concern is that you get the same situation  With this that you have with the dmca  And that's the chilling effect of this, you know, we get stuff taken down all the time, which we can quite reasonably defend  Under fair use and other things  But it but because youtube is so nervous about the dmca they just take it down take it down take it down  And that's exactly what would happen here  I mean nobody's going to argue that  You know, you shouldn't allow illegal  You know things on twitter  But what will happen is the minute anybody complains about anything  You'll have a you know section 230 takedown rule and you'll start getting these automated content takedowns on on facebook and twitter as well  Um, and if I were them, I wouldn't like this because they just don't want to risk the liability of getting sued  But then I mean that means anybody doesn't like anything they're going to ask you to take it down. They say I think this violates  You know the good samaritans act

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's happened in germany with netstake a the hate speech law is that is that there's been overage of taking of takedowns  This is a very good analysis of this again, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From mike masnick, uh on the tech dirt  On the justice departments. He calls them preposterous recommendations on 230  The the problem is and mike has been so good on section 230  I would suggest reading everything he's ever written on it  And the problem is that we and every it's very difficult  To really understand what 230 does and doesn't do and it's even more difficult to understand why these proposals  Are problematic. I mean on the surface of it sounds like well what yeah the doj is saying you're not allowed to have illegal federal  Federally illegal stuff on content on your site. Well, that seems like that's all right  But it's kind of more subtle and than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's always more subtle than that  Yeah, you should have mike masnick come on and talk about this. I should I I think we have we tried carson

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get mike masnick on I would love to get him on he has his own podcast as well  Um, I he's very smart. Yeah, he's really really good  Um, if I could give him money, I would give him money

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, I I gave him money when he was fighting his lawsuit. Oh, yes, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yes, that was a good cause and he won. Thank god. It was indeed  He was getting sued by somebody who claimed he had invented email and masnick  Quite accurately said you invented email. It completely predates  Uh, oh, sorry is the mail carrier gonna sue the dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, I don't know what just happened there. No, I don't mind. I like it a little barking. I do  My uh, my heart just stopped. Yeah, but that's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The dog's right next to you  From a distance it was amusing  um  so, uh  Yeah, I mean I  What's really ironic is all of this all of this?  stems from  The president's fit of peak that twitter would dare suggest anything. He said wasn't accurate  Meanwhile every other journal in the world is publishing the story 16 000 lies and counting and things like that  Uh, which he you know can manage to ignore but as soon as twitter said you might want to think about you know  Whether email voting is dangerous he went ballistic  You know and when the shoot when the looting starts the shooting  starts  He went ballistic and now that's why we have all of this. This is all at the president's best

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and he also I mean twitter is his platform. I'm sure he's offended in part because  You know, it's like someone coming into your house and saying you lying person

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a little problem right there, right twitter is the president's house, man  Well, don't you be messing with the president in the president's house?  Not my house. No, I agree with you 100  Uh, it's fascinating. Josh holly, uh the doj  And uh, the fcc are really all doing his bidding. That's  Clear whether this will amount to anything. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but no it has an  effect  Because the left scream take down this bad stuff and then they say okay  They take down some bad stuff and then the right says that was my stuff  Right and and that's where we are  And so and so, you know, i'm surprised they're not going to pass a law requiring facebook to say merry christmas at christmas time  Yeah, well that's coming. It's it's that kind of absurdity of the war on christmas time stuff. Yeah  But it's going to have an impact. You know again, you don't want to get ahead of it quite yet  But I think the biden's the facebook and i'm you know, i'll defend  Facebook and its rights and so on but I think they're they're i've been very critical of them lately  Because they're they don't have a north star and their response to biden was  ludicrous  Ludicrous on the other hand do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook has done two good things. I think so. Let's take a break and I will come back and tell you  What facebook has done that i'm happy about how about so you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You listen to this jeff's critical of facebook leo is praising facebook  What could this be  The word stacey's just shaking her head. What stacey's just saying what happened while I was gone  What the heck is going on last week stacey?  We said that we'd solved the same facebook problem and so we wanted to alert you that we had in fact we had we had agreement  last week  Yeah, that's just after the break. You can't disagree. Yeah. No, it's when anstea is the great the great peacemaker  Yes, he is he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I think we're gonna have ant back on the show on a regular basis  I haven't figured quite out all the details of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I he was so good right now and i'll go take a nap  No, because we're talking we're talking about things that i'm like, oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you want to argue about this today? No, no, we're done. Let's talk about little chips  I will I do have to say okay. I'll say one more thing then we're done  Just to annoy stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We know it's not annoying i'm just like oh I have so little to contribute here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't know. I don't either I feel like this is but this is that's why this is the perfect issue  For a certain type of politician which is an issue that is fairly nuanced and complicated  But can be easily misrepresented with something everybody understands  So yes, you see what i'm saying? So it's it's really perfect because you can say something like well  All we want to do is ban illegal speech  And all of the nuances get buried because everybody you want to say something everybody can understand  That that everybody who's watching tv?  Can get in a little sound bite and go yeah  Well, i'm for it and you see this all the time and the problem is that a lot of the problems in this modern  Complicated world are very nuanced and complicated and it related and frankly i'm i'm stymied  By the screw nuance. Let's go with the commercial. It's a lot easier  Honestly, and I know this because as a broadcast as a mainstream broadcaster for 40 years, there's intense pressure  If you're going if you want to be successful the the best way to be successful is to misrepresent complex subjects as simple ones  So that simple tins can understand it and agree with you  That's or so you can get them riled up or get them riled up and that's really what happened to radio  That's all you hear now on me forget radio on tv and radio on mainstream broadcasting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think people actually want the nuanced stuff explained to them, but it takes so much effort  and I think journalism today does not allow you to build up that expertise and the time to do that because I  I was tempted to agree with you because sometimes I wrote these like really esoteric stories like when I would  talk about like  Devil in details post is what I call them and those  Actually unless if if people actually cared about the issue because you know  I care about things a lot of people don't care about but if people cared about the issues  They really appreciated the fact that I explained the nuanced cases on both sides  They also though wanted me to tell them where they should stand. Right? So like with net neutrality, I would be like  This is why the carriers are arguing with it. This is  Why  The current rules of the fcc aren't really awesome for people who create content on the internet, but they are good for google  And carriers are like sort of hating parts of it  But you know at the end I had to say something like but carriers are evil and they want to shut down the internet  But if you explained everything they did that but they also wanted your perspective and that's really hard to do when you could just  Say screw it carriers are evil and enough people would click on that. It'd be fine  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They they don't want you to make them think  They want you right they tell them the answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For them, but they're they're smarted at most not everyone but  People do want to understand the issues and so you can report and do nuanced stuff  You just have to tell people how to think afterwards and it's hard some people are are are going to be like I disagree with you  And that'll be fine, too. As long as you represent the other side accurately. Yeah, that's really that's the truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is it's exhausting  Especially in our area. It's very exhausting because a you have to have the expertise or gain it  You have to learn all about it and know it in and out to even explain it in a in a simple way  And then b it's a lot of work and every it feels like it's a slog with every single story  Because you have to well, but wait a minute. It's not that simple  And that's the kiss and then you and then of course in your back of your mind, you know  Well there I just lost 90 of the audience. It's like there. Goodbye. Wait, could you make it simple, please?  It's not that simple. No, but I don't care. It's what's the bottom line, please bottom line it for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's not that simple. Give it to me in a card

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's human and I don't you know, i'm I don't want to I don't want to know the ins and outs of boxite mining either  I mean, it's just you know, there's certain there's certain things  That uh you and I and uh, and anybody listens to network are willing to kind of  Delve into and then there's some things that you know, I don't have the patience to learn the rules of cricket. I just got the two volume

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Typography here. There's your problem. I can tell you anything you want to know about gatenberg  Now is that about typography or about printing? This is this is well about printing. It's the entirety of 1825  Oh lord two volume 1 000 pages about printing. I just spent the day  Writing about yes, I spent the day trying to understand exactly how pages were imposed on the forms  I can go into that boy. I can beat you stacy in terms of doing things that are boring. I can I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is interesting you win jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You win. I do I do I had to take a piece of paper and put numbers on it and then cut it up  To understand where the pages went when you print the form I could I could go into  detail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From 1690 you wouldn't believe it's were they paid by the world word in the 18th and 19th centuries  Is that what I know it seems like because they can't was dickens's stuff  Yeah, dickens was they were he was serialized but even people's letters and things you you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The amount of effort it took to type set and they they were verbose you think of it the opposite  Yeah, whereas we now have all the space in the world and we have twitter. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's no sense value to brevity  Succinct being the soul of wit. Yeah, maybe actually that's true the longer the joke the worse the punch line  I think that is true  I actually you know what you said something though jeff that does  That made me think I do enjoy and I will go deep on stuff  That explains things we take for granted and why they are the way they are like pagination. I think that's interesting  Like we just we enjoy the hell out of that we walk around we sleep walk through life  Because you know doing things because that's how you do them and that's how they were always done and I love finding out  well, actually  They weren't always done the way the reason you do it this way is because and it's usually something dopey  But we just we're not used to examining  You know why there's limited brain cycles and in order to avoid getting eaten by a tiger  We've really got to focus our attention on stuff that keeps us from being eaten by a tiger  That's that's really fundamental otherwise you're not going to survive if you look at the dust what makes all that dust

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of tigers. Yes, let's go to a break so we can learn about the two things that facebook did  Right actually that has nothing to do with tigers. No, that's good, but it's long and right  Let's pay attention to what's happening. You've learned by the way another vital

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  vital skill in journalism that  Professor Jarvis will never teach you  One is non sequiturs are fine never explain just keep going speaking of tigers  Let's hear about that facebook thing is a perfectly good. Yes  If you didn't if you hadn't said anything everybody would go yes  Let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so. I think our audience is a little smarter than that. I'm giving y'all credit  No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I live in non sequitur world. I'm in non sequitur land  And I like it our show today brought nothing worse. Oh, sorry, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's nothing worse than having an editor say bad transition. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Made sense to me. It's horrible. Yeah  That means I gotta go back to the typewriter  Our show today brought to you by world wide technology. This is an example of some somebody who  If you're in business if you're an enterprise and you're dealing with enterprise technology, I guarantee you  The boss and probably a good few levels below the boss  Does not want to hear the ins and outs the pros the cons the pluses and the minuses  They're very bottom line it for me  What technology and here's my priorities? It's got to work. It's got to work with our existing stuff  It's got to be affordable. It's got to help us make money. It's got to be help us be successful. It's very straightforward  Worldwide technology is there  To do all the nitty gritty and to cut through to the stuff that's going to make you more successful  And that's why worldwide technologies partners  And and clients love them and have loved them for years. In fact, I know  Once you're a worldwide technology customer, you never  Leave we talk a lot about all the different things worldwide tech does but one of the things we learned when we went out to st  Louis a couple of months ago  Was they do? They do apps?  This is a portion of the show brought to you by worldwide technology and app dynamics  Together they deliver the application experience  Your customers your users want  But that will transform your business great software can do that, you know, it can change lives and wwt is driven  as and  This is like what you do that too as a custom application and development company. They design with you  Actually, that's one of the things they do best  Because they do best the best developers start really early talking to you about your specific business needs  Thinking about how to approach the problems you face in new ways and then create software solutions that make an impact  You want a company that doesn't mind getting deep going to the nitty gritty but helps you hit the bottom line  You want a company that focuses on exactly what you want in your app the specifications you must have  And then makes it happen  Their team has the resources the platforms the skills the systems by the way  If anything, I would say wwt is a great systems company. They really make an effort from top to bottom in understanding  How systems work and what makes them work better?  And with two decades of experience, they have a proven track record that can really help you succeed  for instance  And we actually saw this app I don't think I have I can tell you the company but it was a health care organization  And uh, they now that's a problem, right?  That's hard for a lot of companies because there's all sorts of legal requirements hIPAA and so forth  The health care organization wanted to connect medical teams from their care center  to patients at home  And they explained exactly what they were trying to do wwt created a custom software app where the care teams  Could interface directly with the patients and the results are mind-blowing  50 reduction in preventable readmissions for their engagement at home patients 50 percent  35 fewer days spent in the hospital  With virtual care they could stay at home and you know what your patients really want to stay at home. I know I do  60 fewer septic shock deaths occurred in patients being treated remotely all because of this app  Uh, there is a rental car company they worked with again  No names, but it'll they produced a mobile app to provide an improved customer car rental experience  The app let customers make reservations perform check-ins and returns without waiting in line just boom  And you can see how much of a difference that would make  They worked with a grocery retailer to improve their customer experience  And it starts at the beginning through ideation and then innovation and creative work wwt  Improved this retailer's customer experience  They hit their two and three year goals in less than a year and boy, you know what when covet hit they were really glad  They had this app  You want your customers to use your app you want them to love your app  Put something in their hands that exceeds their expectations and that's how wwt does it and they do it with systems  They're brilliant in this way. They have their agile software development, which really works from planning to ideation delivery  Because it's a it's a feedback loop with the customer  And so you get closer and closer and closer and closer and closer until you reach perfection  Agile is brilliant. They do the devops model. They understand it  That they drive business outcomes by evaluating designing implementing and operating with tools to enhance your operational efficiency  They also, uh, you know the latest hottest thing we're going to actually talk about this in a little bit containers  They rapidly create services that can scale and perform by designing architecting and implementing  Cloud native apps in agile fashion in the cloud in containers  Among other things they really I tell you what  You got to check them out  WWT.com slash twit one  And you can also learn about the advanced technology center, which is mind-boggling this  This is a company if actually now that I think about it from top to bottom  They do executive training. They really are thinking about the systems that lead to success and I've they think very deeply about this stuff  WWT.com slash twit one. Let those systems help your business  Worldwide technology delivering business outcomes and modernizing it infrastructure all over the world. So I will tell you  about  the tiger  in your tank  The two things facebook did  Number one they announced today they're going to let and remember we we said if you had mark zuckerberger at a dinner party  And you could say and he would do it one thing you would say to fix facebook and I said yes  Stop taking political ads and jeff you raised a reasonable issue, which is well, that's one way that  You know unknown candidates get a chance to be heard  Facebook and instagram have announced they're going to let us users block political ads  You just I presume just flip a switch he wrote I don't know did you read the editorial in the usa today?  It'll roll out to some users now all users in the next few weeks  And by the way, it's not just politicians  but packs as well  And at the same time as they're doing that they are going to launch  And we know this from the last election facebook had a huge impact on voting registration  They are going to launch a big voter information center  That they say and i'll have to see what they do but they say we'll give millions of people accurate information about voting  Tell them where their ballot box is and help them register their goal is to register  Four million voters using facebook instagram and messenger and then help them get to the polls. This could make a huge difference  Tell me why i'm wrong jeff charvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um depends on well  It bothers me  That we think that  And this is this is a commentary not on facebook or but but if we think that that pulling away from  The civic dialogue is is is is something desirable  That's a larger  problem  with society  Second what's the political ad?  Uh, that's i'm guaranteed there's gonna be knickers and knots over that  because if I put up an ad saying, you know come to my  Uh pro environment rally is that going to be taken down?  Um, you know how how chicken just to be clear you can post that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but if everybody says no to say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like it can't buy the ad but you can turn it off you leo laporte

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slug no i'm just saying um that face this is advertising not content. So you understood  Right understood

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And people already have the ability to turn off ads like I buy  I buy the more expensive hulu so I don't have to sit through ads some people buy youtube to avoid it  So I don't see why political ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um all ads but especially political ads, but i'm saying to to separate political ads from other ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't we had the fairness doctrine forever, which recognized that politics and not just that wasn't advertising but  politics are a different  Politics are not a product or they shouldn't be a product and we've turned them into a product and that's a problem  so I would say politics can be a separate category and I am fine with that because we should not be  You should not make as casual a decision about the people who run your country as you do about what brand of toilet paper  You want to buy but that's that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think that it it says something bad about our nation that  To be engaged in the political debate is now seen as a bad thing and that's that's the reality that's where we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not saying it's a bad thing  It's just saying that there is the reality is there's so much overt manipulation  tied to these platforms and these platforms do distort the political process  And we have to solve that  Is it sad that we have to do this?  Sure, but we can't just be like I wish I lived in a world where everything was rainbows and sunshine  But we don't so we're just gonna have to deal with it. Oh that felt really bitchy. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't that was right on  Um, I I think that  I understand and it is in a way it's throwing up in your hands and saying yeah  Well, we can't fix it. So we're just gonna block it. You still have you still have speech  You still can post what you want as an individual. You just can't buy an ad  And I you can buy it you can buy it but some people can block it  Can block it. Yeah, and and what what remains to be seen is how difficult that is  And of course everybody knows the tyranny of the default and no no one more than mark zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That the 99 percent of facebook users won't flip that switch and the amount of money that they lose from it is is de minimus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's I think it's  So to me, this is an acknowledgement that yes these these these ads are a problem  Uh, and he's getting hit on both sides. I mean joe biden's buying ads saying facebook. You're stupid and and you know  I mean it's going it's getting hit from both sides. So  Just no no political ads. I think I continue to stay say they should just  Blend them all but at least giving users the right to turn it off  And then I think the next step is for everybody to remind everybody how to do that  Um, I think there's a lot of people i'm not on facebook. I don't want to see anything on facebook my way of  Of getting rid of all the ads on facebook and also all the background noise on facebook is not by being a member  And I tried I really did I I stuck it out for three months  Um  I mean i'm not there. So yeah, i'm fine with that. I tried I thought I came back when the virus hit I thought well  I'm going to use facebook as it was intended to stay in touch with family and friends see see that they're all doing well  And so forth. Uh, it did not help me with that. It just made me it just made me upset every single time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you have you I I still don't understand how that works just because I don't follow a-holes. I don't follow a-holes. I only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only added people as friends  I only added people as friends that I know in real life  A lot of listeners and fans and other people when even people I haven't seen in 20 years when they saw me back on facebook  Tried to friend me and I apologize to all of you  But I said no only the people I have that I wanted to keep in touch with to find out how they were doing  Didn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I have bad friends. Yeah, you must because I really honestly  I'm in by the ball of people who are controversial

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe you have normal friends. I mean I have normal friends  I have friends who I added from back in high school and some of them, you know, they're  crazy and  I quickly realized that and was like oh well, I don't need this person in my life anymore  Also people can be kind of nostalgic about their friends. I don't know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do uh, do we agree that the voter information center is a good thing? We must agree on that. Sure. Sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sure, but the problem there, you know, what's gonna happen there?  They're gonna push you being able to vote by mail and then guess who's gonna say that that's awful  And then there's gonna be a fight over that and we're gonna be back in another cultural war over postage stamps  And voting by mail. Well, and I should point out we're at a we're in a culture war about masks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know what? We are at the most ridiculous point. We are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and by the way, that's exactly donald trump donald j trump. That's where he wants strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And media is such an idiot to play along

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's it's just natural and you know what if you're a reality show  I wasn't watching a reality show. I've never seen a reality show before including the apprentice  But i'm watching a really dumb one called below deck. That's about  Yachting and the service personnel on big charter yachts  And it's actually I can't stop watching lisa and I like binging them  But I so I understand the whole idea channel is that on it's bravo the whole thing  The whole thing about reality shows is strife is good conflict is good  That's what gets your attention your keeps you watching. I gotta see what happens next  and  Boy, did donald trump learn that from mark bernett when he did the apprentice  That's you want to you want to own the news cycle keep people fighting  And and every time the fire starts to die down  Throw in another another piece of kindling and he's masterfully  Adepted that we all get suckered into it  And that's what's brought us to exact I mean we are so polarized and and you know people say oh we're polarized  We got to stop that  And but I don't think it's it's the natural state. I think it's we were been we've been fed that and not just from  President trump, but everybody's fed into that now and twitter hasn't helped and facebook hasn't helped

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, i'm gonna remind you i'm gonna remind you without social media. We wouldn't have black lives matter  We wouldn't have had the 17 year old girl who shot the video of george floyd  Let us remember that these are voices who were not heard in mainstream mass media run by old white guys like me  And and walking away from social media means you're walking away from voices who have not been heard  In big old mass media and I say that as three white people sitting here. Well, and the good news is mass media is over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can still find those voices and absolutely. I mean people will still be on twitter  On facebook, we're not saying these things go away  We're just saying that you don't have to talk about politics or you don't have to actually and there's podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

All right now can I criticize facebook?  Yes, please the biden story pissed me off  so  a lot of us have been trying to push facebook to take some kind of action around the trump stuff and to  Find its north star  and then facebook biden  Goes after them which biden's also going after section 230. So there's a problem right there  I do have my joe hat, but i'm i'm pissed at him about that  but then  No, I don't want to subscribe now  and then  So facebook's response was oh we can't do that because the president issued an executive order  That's bs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always said they're not immoral  They are amoral amoral  They don't have a guiding  Principle or north star other than maximizing engagement

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And ultimately maximizing rebel and staying out of trouble in this case the real the real context here is staying out of political trouble  Right staying out of the inconvenience of that. That's what they're trying to do and in doing so  They only dig themselves deeper. So anyway, I just wanted to you know be on the record there  And by the way full disclosure is that facebook don't anybody my school  Uh to do projects on disinformation mainly outside the school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  What's herbal 20?  Elite cia unit that developed hacking tools  Oh failed to secure its own systems allowing massive leak. This is this is according to a in an internal report  prepared for mike pompeo back when he was a  Director cia and gina haspel who is now the director  um  They the elite computer hackers at the cia prioritized building cyber weapons at the expense of securing  their own systems, this is the  This is the stuff that got leaked to wiki leaks the vault 7 release  US officials called it the biggest unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the cia's history  And  Important point had the data been stolen for the benefit of a state adversary and not a publisher  We might still be unaware of the loss  Of  So nice really nice by the way, that's uh, that's julian assange's father there  In front of really? Yeah looks looks there's julian  He's letting his dad do the talking  Yeah, um  Cia moved too slowly to put in place the safeguards. We knew were necessary  Given successive breaches to other u.s  Government agencies the report said finding most of our sensitive cyber weapons were not compartmented  users shared systems administrator level passwords folks  If people in your company were sharing  Systems administrative level passwords amongst each other. Wouldn't you worry?  They all had the same password. Wouldn't you worry there were no  Effective thumb effective thumb drive controls anybody could stick one in  And historical data and did historical data was available to users indefinitely  Any sensible  Company would have you know even this is this is like the half-assed stuff  You'd think the cia had even like really super secret stuff  The hacking tools were developed by the cia's center for cyber intelligence, but they were too busy working on that  I guess they didn't think they I don't know they were under attack. I don't know  So there you go  You go  Part of the problem was that the leak actually we believe happened  because a guy who was I think a contractor  Took the hacking tools home with him  You know put a usb drive put copying him over he has pleaded not guilty so it's alleged all alleged  But  The the thinking had been that he took them home and then he was running kaspersky antivirus  On the system that he put them on the system  the kaspersky  Correctly noted that there were it is a bunch of exploits in there and exfilter them to  Russia kaspersky's home country where the russian secret service got access to them  um, oh wow, wait wait wait  Is that that puts the nail in the coffin of  Well, no one knows if kaspersky did it on purpose but one of the features kaspersky like a lot of  Antiviruses if it detects a virus it quarantines it and then sends it to their servers  For research because if it's a new virus they want to be able to say  Well, it is a bad thing if at the same time as you're doing that  you are either  Under the auspices of a secret service or compliant with a secret service. It's unclear  I mean for kaspersky kaspersky has some people who are former russian military officers working there  And of course for the way the russian state works much like the chinese state. It's very impossible  They just said hey, what do you got?  They have to give it to them. So it's not sure  it's not clear whether they  You know  Intentionally did this or did it but it that's and it's not even for sure. That's what happened. But that's  when this actually happened that was the  the conventional wisdom  Nevertheless, you shouldn't as a contractor be able and this is what snowden did too, by the way  You shouldn't and you would think after snowden who was doing it for the nsa not the cia  But the cia would have looked over there and said  Let's make sure that doesn't happen here. Not on our watch. That would be a bad thing  And uh, but no now you bring in a usb drive copy everything over take it home. No problem  You'd think  You'd think let's see. Let me quote this person accurately here. I want to get this person's name  You'd think these incidents would be a major wake-up call for the intelligence community and the entire  american security establishment  But it appears the most powerful and best-funded intelligence agencies on the planet are unable to stop the bleeding  Of their own data. That's thomas rid. He is an information security professor at johns hopkins  School of advanced i'm sorry at johns hopkins craig newmark school of advanced international studies

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently wiki leaks did not obtain even more sensitive information contained in a gold folder  That included the final version of the hacking tools as well as as well as source code the gold folder  stayed secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it an actually we'll get to this in the rundown in the uh, and the watchman call it  But they could have had one of those special google folders where it's all encrypted. They don't be okay  They needed the special google gold folder. Yeah, but we'll get to that in a few minutes

There may be a google has not announced this yet, but they saw it in the ui  A safe folder to its file manager and even had a little helpful  informational  Thought bubble hovering over it move any files you want to keep protected by a pin to this folder now  this is not unusual in fact, I use a  Cloud drive storage that does that I think it's a really good idea a pin maybe i'd love more than a four digit pin  But see that's that's pretty cool. So that is in the  1.0.315 version of files by google, but it's not apparently yet turned on  But maybe it'll be rolling out soon

It's been more reliable. I made fun of you. It's been better  It's what it's been good  scrolling the other one was bad  Yeah, I was having trouble as usual with android after a while. It kind of  Seems like it degrades a little bit in performance. You just complain about everything. Why?  No, that's not an unusual experience with android but 11 on here seems to do a very good job. And  What's cool is the android developers have been putting out  daily  like videos  They call it unwrapping android 11 in which they talk about features. So there there are more we're learning more and more about features  In that's what they would have done at io. Yeah, i'm guessing that's kind of like what they would have done  But they're they're dribbling and drabbing it out  So I there's so many new features here and I know most of you are probably not using 11 yet because it's a public beta  but  Uh, this is something you might want to look at  If you if you are using android 11 because there's a ton of stuff  For instance, there is now an on-device visual cortex  that understands  what  Oh, yeah, they got a brain in this thing. It's in the voice access for people who control their phone entirely by voice  the on-device visual cortex understands screen content and context  And generates labels and access points for accessibility commands  So instead of just reading what's printed on the screen it can actually understand what you're what you're looking at  We're gonna have bubbles in messaging. Okay, the new bubbles api  whoo  We're gonna I mean i'm just i'm just scratching the surface here  There's a lot of stuff  You like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it. I would there any particular feature that just makes you say  Oh screw ios, um, no

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially now that I got that twitter record feature  No, siri, uh, yeah, you know, you know actually  Uh, I had stopped using the pixel fork because it seemed a little unreliable and it would it would like for once in a while  Just freeze for a few seconds or even longer that seems to have gone away  So that's good news. That's good news  And the other thing they're doing it's interesting. They're releasing  More either not only more information but more features it seems over time there are they're getting turned on or

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

I would say they're also doing  Distancing social distancing online meetups  So that you can go and this is actually good apple's going to do this too at wwdc  But the big things you get at a developer's conference is the ability to sit down  With the devs and say hey this feature is not working or how do I use this and they're going to do that  with online meetups as apple is as well  To help people and better yet you'll be able to earn a badge  so  If you view the pathway  You will earn a badge by completing a quiz  I don't know what you could do with the badge  but but

So there were other things initially the down detectors reporting outages on at&t verizon and sprint  But apparently that was not the case on the other hand if you were calling a t-mobile number  From verizon then you might have said oh, right. Yeah, but if you're calling it if you if there was no t-mobile in your gun  I don't know. I don't know it maybe  Maybe that when the fiber went out there was some speculation and it's still not clear whether this was a third party  Uh backbone that they were on or if it was a t-mobile backbone  According to a tech crunch  Um, although they had heard it was a level three outage  Tech crunch said no, they told us it wasn't so it's unclear but it was down  It was down and and you know who's  miffed about it  Mr. Ajit pi  Even ajit pi was was angry  He tweeted the t-mobile network outage is unacceptable  The fcc is launching an investigation.

We talked about the publishers were suing them over  um  and  Uh, somebody is outraged that the internet archive bruce. Tercale is buying a seattle record store that's going out of business  Why are they outraged because they're worried they're going to digitize all the records  So they bought this record store. It's actually an interesting story  Which one is it? It's it's going to be their great  78 prod product project  Uh, they bought I want to say bobs. I can't remember the name i'll have to get the name  But this was this is the great 78 project to preserve  these kind of weird  Recordings many of them on 78 rpm  Vinyl or even harder things like shellac  Uh, so that they you know, this is our  Cultural heritage it gets preserved. Let me see if I can find though  The name of the store. I think it was in seattle  Senator tom tillis seems really pissed off that the internet archive bought a record store  Or it was bob street records not bobs bob street. That's it bob street in seattle  They were going out of business. They had  Uh a huge collection 500 000  Uh sound recordings 100 albums by fatz waller  uh classical music rock rmb jazz country  and um  They were they were going out of business anyway  Anyway  so, um the internet archive  Picked it up and they're going to go through those  Records and see what should be the half million recordings and see what should be saved if you uh, I put in the in the rundown chat  senator tillis  Because he says he's sending him a letter, you know, one of those famous letters from a senator  As I understand  Top five record shop in the country focuses collectible vinyl  Uh, anyway, yes, I he doesn't he doesn't like them digitized copyright doesn't want him to digitize stuff  even though  You're really saving it  Your sound recording projects do not appear to comply with the relevant provisions of the oren hatch bob good latte music modernization act  which deals  Yeah oren hatch a major music modernizer deals only with pre 1972 sound recordings would not allow for streaming or downloading  I think this actually was  Who was it there was a there was a group who was pissed off that because their records came out a long time ago  Spotify could just play them without ever paying them royalties, even though they were still under copyright  Anyway, this is a letter to brister kale

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From senate so I put in the in the in the rundown chat a story from the seattle times with us a picture of bop street records  I don't know about you probably stacey's too too young for this  But I can't look at the picture I can just smell the place

Obviously  It outpaced his ability to keep track track of all the stuff he had  But uh, yeah, no a record store is a wonderful thing and browsing through a record store is a wonderful thing  And I agree with brister kale and leaning an archive. These are recordings that would be lost forever

Transcript:  Uh  Y'all want a book or do y'all want an app? Oh, I like books  All right  I just finished reading laurence wright's the end of october  Which is about a pandemic?  um  But it also tied to some of the things we talked about on this show is it was a good book  I felt like the ending was a little rushed. It felt like kind of like the last season of game of thrones  You know where you're like what just happened how that what but that's okay  So it talks about a pandemic and it's remarkably accurate and  it  He he must have written it after trump was elected because there's definitely the president  There is trump and the vice president is probably pence. Um  He also talks about a novel though, or is it it is a novel?  So he's he's usually writing non-fiction. I read mostly like I read a scientology thing. That was just freaking awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I did. I read that also. That's where I knew I knew the name  So the name of this book is what's again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The end of october the end of october  Did I get that right? What if I got that wrong?  anyway, but he also talks about russian interference with the elections and because of his  Research and his his knowledge of national security  He's actually it's a very factual book and it it did a really good job creating a narrative around  cyber war and how  Probably like what a big problem it is and how we pretty much ignore the influence  I can't wait to read this. This sounds so good  It's pretty good again the ending kind of jumped there real fast, but sure  But I I enjoyed it and it was it was a good read and not  While it is a pandemic book

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So did he write this after the pandemic had already hit or was he?  So he was kind of he was just super prescient. Wow  Wow, that's really interesting a devastating virus that begins in asia before going global

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an influenza not a coronavirus  but I mean  Everything about mask policy just a lot of the stuff that like i'm like, oh well, he called that real well  Go him. Wow interesting

Transcript:  I  Have a actually a pic that came from alex lindsey  On mac break weekly yesterday  As you know, i'm all over making face masks alex has recommended  a uh a free program ios only  um  That is called bellis 3d and i'll show you  It lets you like in literally 30 seconds scan your head to make a perfect 3d  Uh  File of it, which I guess you could use to 3d print your head if you really wanted to  But they've now added a new thing called a mask fitter  Which means you can take your head  And make a frame that goes over the fabric to make a perfect seal in your mask and you see this is i've ordered
