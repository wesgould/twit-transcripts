This is the first time anybody has done any show on the network from a moving vehicle.  Jeff Jarvis, you are a man of many talents.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's a trailblazer.  A trailblazer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We thought Jeff wasn't going to be on the show because he's just getting back from South Africa.  I'm really pleased we can get you on, Jeff.  We also have Gina Trapani from Her Lair in San Diego.  Hello.  The bicycle shop.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The bicycle shop, right? I got my bikes on the wall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina is the blogger at originally Lifehacker now, smarterware.org, and joins us every week.  And two special guests just for this occasion, Giga Om Malik.  Hey, Giga.  What's called your gig?  Hey, Ohm.  Hey, gig. What's happening?  Your friends call you gig?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  No, my enemies do.  We're great to have you, Ohm, on the show.  Especially on live TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't believe, you know, I thought we'd had you on This Week in Google before,  but you've been on Twitter, but not This Week in Google.  So it's perfect timing to have you on.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  You can only have two bloggers at a time on a show, to be very honest.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, Gina and Jeff.  Everybody else has to take a back seat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all bloggers all the time.  In fact, even though Brad Stone is a reporter for the New York Times,  he's also a blogger at their Bits blog, and we're glad to have you on, Brad.  You just wrote the story, a very interesting story about Apple's rejection of Pulse,  which I'm still using on my iPad, at the behest of the New York Times.  Now, we should say you're not speaking for the Times.  Oh, I'm back.  Yep, he's back.  For some reason, we have trouble with the firewall in the Times building, I think.  Are you there?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  I'm trying to keep you guys out.  I am here.  I can hear you now, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, I was just saying, you're not speaking for the New York Times.  You're a reporter for the New York Times.  You wrote the story on Apple and Pulse.  What happened there?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  That's right. Oh, it was sort of peculiar.  About a week ago, I spotted this application in the iTunes store, in the app store for the iPad,  and it's a pretty good news aggregator, and of course I wrote it up,  and I talked to the Stanford Institute of Design students who had created it,  and I got some indication from some of my colleagues that the Times actually frowned on these kinds of apps.  And, I mean, look, I don't speak for the New York Times.  I'll get in trouble if I try to speak for the New York Times.  I tried to cover that story yesterday like everybody else.  You know, my perception is that the main objection is, you know,  an news organization like the Times is trying to have a website on one hand and an app on the other,  and we're trying to do different things,  and we might ultimately try to do different things economically with those properties.  And Pulse just goes and, you know, very creatively links the two.  It's taking our website, it's presenting it within its app,  and it's bracketing our website with its own content, its own application,  and I think that's where some of the discomfort was created, and you know, you guys know the rest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually think the New York Times, Editor's Choice, is actually a very nice way to read the New York Times.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  But it's limited. It's a very first step in there.  It's subset.  Yeah, it's not all the content, and I think it's because we're waiting for the paywall  and for, you know, for the rest of the strategy to kind of come along.  I'm curious, like everybody else.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry that Jeff is just going in from the car to his house right now,  because I would love to get his...

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  The person who you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, at least we got him on for a little bit.  We'll get him back once he gets inside the house.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  I'm sure Jeff will have an opinion on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, he's against these paywalls, and he thinks it's crazy to do this.  And it was Virginia Heffernan, I thought, who kind of astutely, we talked about this last week,  and you wrote in the Times, Sunday Times a couple of weeks ago,  about how these apps are really the suburbs compared to the inner city of the World Wide Web  with all of its rough-and-tumble elements.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, sorry to interrupt there.  You know, I just...  This whole episode reminds me of this quote by Mahatma Gandhi,  which he somewhat like,  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win.  And I think that's exactly what is going on.  I think, you know, I'm not talking about Brad here,  but I think the New York Times can seem to,  like many of the large institutions in this world,  can seem to understand that we live in a society  where things are going around the people who are creating blocks in whatever they do,  whether they are the big banks, the government, the media, whatever it is,  there is a route around mentality which has become pervasive  in a whole generation of people who have been empowered with the internet.  And I think what you're seeing is this fighting the news aggregators.  I mean, really, can you really fight that?  Like, you know, can you...  It's like saying some kids basically clip Times and create a short version of it,  and Z-Docs it and give it to their friends.  I mean, how is that different?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure how Pulse is different from a ton of other news aggregators, which I use.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I mean, I think this is...  And you know, the fact is that the world is very different, right?  I think... And the bigger issue, which I think, you know, Jeff can address,  given that he spent a lot of his time in the media world,  in the new post-internet media world,  I think we don't seem to quite understand the harsh reality of our businesses,  the media industry, is that we are looking to redefine the future with the rules of yesterday,  with ideas from yesterday.  That's not going to happen.  You know, there are some truisms, right, like as Clay Shirky and Jay Rosen say,  that the value of content isn't going to go away.  A New York Times story is not going to go away.  But one needs to think differently about what is information and what is insight  and what is a newspaper and how it needs to be delivered.  I think looking at ideas which are from yesterday and saying,  I am going to deliver it to the world in that manner, it's not going to work.  It just is not...

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Well, can I... Let me raise one. I agree with you, Om, but...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, it's not just the newspaper industry, it's the music industry,  the music industry, the television industry.  I mean, it's every content company right now.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  It seems to me that there's a sort of simple issue here.  Apple itself has created or really nurtured this distinction of applications.  And applications are not the wide world of the web.  They're a curated entertainment or content experience.  And it seems like what the New York Times is trying to do here is to preserve that possibility  that it can have, that it can create a differentiated experience on its own.  And then possibly that experience might be worth something to some of our fans.  I mean, what Pulse was doing was sort of blending the two categories,  was taking the wide world of the web and bringing it into their own app experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it because Pulse was not free? Was that some of the issue?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  You know, I mean, as I said before, I felt part of the company's response to it was muddled.  So I'm not sure how much that made a difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, what's your take on this?  I mean, unfortunately, we lost Jeff right in the middle of this conversation.  We're talking about the iPad application Pulse News,  which was written by a group of Stanford students,  was in fact shown by Steve Jobs on the stage at the WWDC on Monday.  And on Tuesday, pulled by Apple from the App Store because of complaints from the New York Times.  And I should underscore again that Brad works for the New York Times,  is not speaking for the New York Times, he's speaking as a reporter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I did ping Martin Disson-Holt from the Times,  but I was about to get on a plane from South Africa, so I couldn't go any farther with him.  I just don't see how you cannot want to be part of something like Pulse that's good, that's going to send readers.  I had this discussion with a reporter at the LA Times who just put up a story about the Las Vegas Sun  suing people like a cat blogger for putting up a whole story.  People shouldn't put up whole stories, but there's a poor cat blogger put up one story once,  and now they're selling the copyright to someone else to sue.  The point is that I don't think we've studied yet the real value of the different kinds of links that we have.  I know that I put up my entire column in my entire blog rather, listen to me, in RSS.  I've had it up on Business Insider, and I've had it up elsewhere, and I get more traffic and more results as it is.  I think that it was in the New York Times two years ago that a college student said,  if the news is that important, it will find me.  We cannot be so hubristic to think that people will always come to us as if our brands are magnetic.  And so I think the Times has to figure out how to be part of this distributed world.  It has an RSS feed, it has an API, it needs to be part of experiences all over.  And Brad, I think you're right that editors want to create this experience,  but I think the problem there is it's not the experience, it's the ego of control.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Actually, can I interrupt you, Jeff, for one minute here?  A couple of points if you really think about it.  So about 26% of NewYorkTimes.com traffic comes from sources not New York Times, okay?  Google, Facebook, Grudge Report, things like that.  So it behooves them to actually encourage people to actually link to them  and take their information in many different places.  So Pulse is a good example of that.  And the second example of it is that if you really think about it, is it New York Times' fault?  Perhaps not. I will step back and take whose fault is it that this kind of thinking has become all pervasive.  And I think a lot of it is the fault of Madison Avenue,  because they don't innovate around the idea of advertising.  And basically they have imposed this idea that everything has to be page view or eyeball driven.  And those eyeballs have to have the metrics which they have used traditionally.  And I think this is why companies like New York Times are also reacting towards, you know, the guys like Pulse  and saying, okay, you know, we don't need to help these guys out.  And I think a lot of it is the fault of the business model.  And the business model, I would say we need to take it all the way back to Madison Avenue.  I think it's a whole cause and effect. It's not just New York Times banning the Pulse.  I mean, the whole ecosystem has to kind of, it needs a futuristic, forward-looking, brand new thinking.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to newsinnovation.com, Omen. We did a lot of work on this.  Acuni, I agree that we need new models.  I think this response here, rather than taking down the app, I wish that Apple had notified Pulse  and Pulse had pulled down the New York Times.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That may be, by the way, what has happened because it's still on the app store,  went kind of, went down and went back up. It's kind of, nobody knows why it's back up if that's an error.  Well, one change that they made, they were...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I also wish that New York Times players, they've done this before, had contact, right,  did they contact the application at all first before sending the cease and desist letter?  Was there any contact from the New York Times to Pulse?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  I don't know. My understanding was we sent a lawyer to Apple, sent a letter to Apple.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Letter to Apple, yeah.  See, that's a shame too. I think, and the Times has done this in the past where the executives at the Times  are forward thinking. I know a lot of them. But a lawyer gets in the way and it hurts the brand.  It hurts the Times.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's the question. Om, do you do a full text feed of Giga Om in your RSS?  Absolutely. Yes, I do.  You do?  As do I.  Gina, and you do a full text feed, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do a full text feed of my personal site. Lifehacker stopped doing a full text feed,  which was something that I thought was a terrible, terrible idea.  And I was pretty vocal about it, as was Adam Tash, who's the current lead editor.  That was a change.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So most forward thinking modern properties do full text feeds in their RSS.  You can subscribe to it in something like Net News Wire, Google Reader, and see the entire content.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, this is the thing. I guess the developer...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hold on a second. Jeff, Guardian did it and the traffic went up?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Guardian put up full text about a year ago and found their traffic never went down as a result.  Traffic went down?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It did not go down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or didn't go down?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It did not go down.  Go ahead, Gina. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  As a developer, I may be getting hung up on an irrelevant technical detail,  but what Pulse does is just embeds the WebKit engine into a new window.  It is essentially another browser.  So it would be as if Opera charged 399 to download and install just a web browser.  And the Times was saying, you can't look at our content in a web browser.  I mean, I don't understand...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.  It doesn't make sense.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, technically the Pulse window...  Pulse isn't wrapping it in...  It's a web browser.  It's just a window that runs WebKit just the same way that mobile Safari does.  The reason why they do it that way is that they don't want the user to have to launch Safari and leave Pulse, right?  Because the iPhone didn't...  Or the iPad doesn't really do...  Well, it didn't do multitasking really at the time.  So I don't understand what the argument could be against selling what's essentially a web browser.  I mean, it sounds like the Times problem was that it was using the Times brand to sell Pulse, the app, but I'm not sure.  And I won't put that on the screen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then maybe that's all it was.  They did in the app store have a screen cap of the Times.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  And it was one of the default...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the default feeds and that's what's in here along with Delicious and...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know a lot of sites.  That would be thrilled.  A lot of sites would be thrilled to have that kind of placement.  I say it simple.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Pulse should drop the Times.  Period.  Don't want to play?  Fine.  Don't play and let's see who wishes for it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, now, by the way, Pulse is a newsreader.  It'll sync with my Google reader.  So if I have the New York Times as I do, I have all of your feeds in here, all of the New York Times feeds in here.  It'll just show up right again.  I mean, I guess they could block it.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's...  And maybe if you pose that question to the Times, well, would you like us to block it?  I wonder what their answer would be.  The Times can block it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Times and their robots.txt can block it if they don't like the client.  That's true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's an RSS feed though, Gina, isn't it?  So isn't that different?  Does RSS have a robots.txt?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can use robots.txt to block access to any type of file.  So an RSS file is just an XML file.  And you can say the Pulse client don't deliver this XML file to the Pulse client.  As long as Pulse honors it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  As long as Pulse is sending its user agent, being honest about who it is, saying, I'm  the Pulse agent, which I'm sure that it is, any well-behaved client does that, then the  Times can say, don't serve these feeds to this agent.  That seems really weird though.  I mean, that would be like the Times saying, no newsreader should be able to grab our RSS  feed and use it.  It's just that it would be bizarre.  It's a stupid season in newspapers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The panic is leading to efforts to circle the wagons, the phrase I use for the Federal  Trade Commission, and it's really too bad.  And again, I'm not sure this happens in every quarter of every company, but I think somewhere  in some quarter somebody says, get the bastards, and doesn't realize that they're not thieving,  they're giving a great gift of audience.  I think panic is a good word.  But I'm happy to read the BBC and the Guardian and the Telegraph and the Washington Post  and other things in Pulse, if I only had to write that.  Panic is a good word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Panic is a good word.  It seems like scared a little bit, right?  No, I don't.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Again, I don't want to be put in the position of defending my employer.  You're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Brad is not speaking for the New York Times, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  No, but I feel like there was something that was carefully considered here.  And this may be futile, but the Times, like a lot of other news organizations, is developing  along two tracks.  There's the website, and then there's the more curated, more media-rich, more user-friendly  app experience.  And it's trying to control that distinction.  And Pulse really muddies it.  And that bottom line is what Gina put her finger on.  It's either it's opening up the web browser within the app, or it's doing what every other  app does, what every Twitter app does, which is generating that Safari window outside so  that the user is not confused.  They are going to the web.  The user is not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Brad, I understand your position here, and it's a delicate one, and I really appreciate  you being here, because I know how difficult it is.  So I'm not trying to argue with you.  But the users aren't dumb.  And the problem is that I've worked with designers for years and editors who want to control  this experience, and that's part of the problem.  I just had a back and forth with Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired, let's repeat, Wired  magazine, who bragged on Twitter, and I quote, about a third of Wired content is now iPad  and print only, not web.  And I responded, and you're bragging about this, why?  This is Wired, Wired.  They're saying that the web is passe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're saying that this is kind of swimming upstream, that everybody can use a browser  now to do it, and nobody would, in their right mind, well, I guess Rupert Murdoch would,  put up a paywall against a browser.  I think the Times is doing some interesting things.  You have now, I was taking an interactive test on the Times webpage yesterday.  There's some stuff going on.  You've resurrected, you've got a new tech section.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the most important thing the Times has done, and I'm not saying this to suck  up to you, Brad, and say what you weren't here, is in fact bits and blogs like it.  I love bits.  That has brought an entirely new voice to even the print, New York Times, that I never  thought would happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this the inside technology?  Is that the new thing that you're doing?  Isn't there a new section, Brad, in the Times now?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure what you're talking about.  We do a podcast every week, and no, I mean, as Ohm knows, we're multi-platform now, and  we're doing the blog, and the blog gets, we do a roundup for the paper, we do stories  for the web that make it into the paper, and then vice versa, and the distinctions  are all blurred.  What you're showing now is just our tech vertical page, and so that's where we kind  of aggregate all the content.  Right, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you've got personal tech, you've got inside technology, you've got videos, you've  got interactive tests and things.  I took a test yesterday on my attention span in the Times site.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That wasn't bad, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bad.  Well, actually, you know what?  I didn't finish it.  I got distracted.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It got through a couple of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are your results.  It was too much work.  Yeah, it was too much work.  But I think that's very interesting, and what I really think is interesting is that you  canned the circuit section in the print newspaper, and I think it's reasonable because people  like me who want tech information are much more likely to go to a website like this and  read this on the web than we are on...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That goes to Ohm's point, though.  That was killed not for editorial reasons or audience reasons, but advertising reasons.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I think the interesting conversation...  First of all, I can understand two things about New York Times.  First of all, it is not for only us or the adopters, so we have to be careful as to just  tarrying them entirely.  So they have a big platform which caters to a lot of different markets, so they have their  own issues.  Secondly, I think there are many people in their management are quite aware of the severity  of the situation as far as the news industry is concerned and how they need to reinvent  it.  With that said, I think the biggest problem I see not just with them, but with most media  companies is that they keep looking backwards to go forward, and that's not how you walk.  You look backwards, you're going to run into a fall.  That just is common sense.  And the second thing you really have to realize...  There is a lot of talk about building paid products and putting firewalls.  We have a paid product.  It's called GigaOhm Research.  It's not a product which we've been giving away for free for so many years.  You can't get up one day and say, I'm going to charge for this product which I've been  giving away for so many decades because people are not going to deal with that.  Instead, you figure out new things people will pay for.  It will be a smaller business.  It will be a subset of your audience.  You need to be very, very creative how you make money.  I think that's the big difference people are not coming to terms with.  And I think it is just amazing to see everybody.  These are the guys I look up to when I think about building a company, a media company,  is traditional media giants.  And they're still not embracing today's reality.  People will only pay for new things or different things.  Things they think have value.  They can put an actual return on investment value on some kind of content they will pay for.  I think that's the big difference.  I don't know, I'm ranting a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no.  And this is a conversation we love to talk about.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  Brad did write an article about Antitrust and Google.  We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  Of course, Apple had its WWDC and Steve did use the G word.  In fact, surprisingly responded a little bit to Google's attacks at Google I.O.  We'll talk about that in iPhone 4 versus Android.  And I'll be interested to see how many of the panelists who are currently using Android phones  may be thinking of an iPhone.  But before we do that, I'd like to welcome a new sponsor to the show, Slingbox.  We're very glad to have Slingbox here.  In fact, I've been using Slingbox for ages.  It's a great way to watch your favorite TV shows when you're away from home.  Slingbox is very simple to set up.  In fact, if you go right now to Best Buy or slingbox.com slash twit,  you could pick up a Slingbox, bring it home, attach it to your TV system,  and that includes your DVR, your DVD, your cable, your satellite, whatever it is.  All this stuff, in fact, not just one, but it's got many connections that you use.  Connect that Slingbox to the Internet and done.  You're ready to go.  You're ready to, I mean, literally leave the house.  Because Slingbox lets you now watch your local television anywhere you can get online,  with a Mac, with a PC, with an iPod Touch, connected via Wi-Fi,  with an iPhone, soon with other devices which shall remain nameless.  But you can imagine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Leo, I have a question about the Slingbox.  Yeah.  If I set up a Slingbox in my New York apartment with my sister,  I could watch shows three hours early on the West Coast?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could watch the Robin Bird show anytime you wanted.  I know that's what you want.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've been thinking about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could see Glee at 6 p.m. San Diego time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Glee at 6 p.m. Glee at dinner.  That's what I want. That's what I want. I need a Slingbox.  I've been thinking about it for a long time. I want to set it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely. You know, here's a crazy use.  You can watch TV in your own house as you wander around  through the Internet in your house.  I can't wait. I believe there's an iPad version in beta.  And this will be so cool to be able to say,  this is my TV.  Anywhere I go, I can watch my Slingbox.  I can already do that on my iPhone and my iPod Touch.  I mean, it really is very, very cool.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Of course, if you're doing that over 3G, the new AT&T data limits.  Oh, we'll get to that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wah, wah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just annoying as heck.  Well, but then just go out and get a MiFi or something.  Use Verizon. There's ways. There's ways and ways.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was thinking about that today.  I think that becomes, if you can get an unlimited MiFi,  then you just go pure data and get rid of everything else, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Why not?  In fact, right now...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can watch your Slingbox on your iPhone or on your iPad or anything you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The three of us, Gina, Jeff, and I, can use Android 2.2  and use T-Mobile unlimited.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Just to be clear, Leo, there is no such thing as unlimited.  I know. It's 5GB.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  5GB and...  Sprint had real unlimited for a while.  Like unlimited, unlimited.  And then somebody yelled at them.  Anyway, that's neither here nor there.  Slingbox.com, believe me, 5GB is plenty.  And if you're worried about missing the finals as you hit the road,  or if, you know, great use for this would be in the ballpark or in the stadium.  And get their instant replay.  You're watching and everybody goes, what happened? What happened?  Because you know.  Slingbox.com slash twit.  It is, you know, this is the modern way to watch TV.  Thank you, Slingbox, for your support of this week.  And Google.  Boy, what should we talk about? There's a lot to talk about.  Do you want to talk about AT&T and bandwidth?  Oh Malik.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Oh, no, not that. I just want to know from you guys,  what do you make of the caffeine upgrade from Google?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, the new search.  Now, Gina, I'm going to ask Gina this because I think of all, you know,  Jeff, you've been in South Africa. I'm an idiot.  Gina, can you tell that the search...  Gina to the rescue.  Gina to the rescue. Is there a difference?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've been trying to figure out like what's different.  I'm not really sure what the details are, what the technical details are.  The result is that it's just a lot faster and stuff shows up a lot faster.  So search results picked up quickly and get shown faster.  I think they're throwing around big numbers like 50 percent.  I honestly didn't do a whole lot of tests on my own.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They don't say faster. They say 50 percent fresher.  Oh, fresher.  What does that? What the hell does that mean?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I guess that just means that, you know, pages that go up,  a blog post that goes up shows up, you know, in search results for,  you know, in Google search results a lot faster, you know, culture to publish time.  So new content that gets picked up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is, in a way, they're moved towards real time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. That's what it seems like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With caffeine, according to Information Week, Google crawls the web in smaller portions.  That's what I've been trying to do in my diet and updates the index on a continuous basis.  So instead of like churning, churning, churning, indexing, indexing, indexing,  okay, now you have the results. It's doing it.  It's turning it over faster and faster.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Isn't like there's a, I think the underlying reality of this update is places like Twitter, right?  Like they've actually changed how quickly information is consumed and disseminated.  And I think Google is trying to keep up with this new, more current, you know, web.  And secondly, it also speaks to their single biggest strength, which is, I guess, my angle on this story is the infrastructure they have.  This big giant network they own, you know, millions of, you know, servers they have and how they use all that to their advantage.  And I think this is a sign by being able to crawl the web, index it, and, you know, spew it out for all of us to use in a more real time fashion is that guys are being, they don't have a freaking hope.  I'm sorry. I mean, they just don't.  They will, they are catching, trying to catch up with the car, which is going at 300 miles an hour.  And they just started driving.  And I think that's the big story here. It's like how they can do all this at such rapid speed is just amazing.  It is, it is the miracle of technology if you come to think of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the, now I am seeing, when you see latest results for caffeine for a long time, that was Twitter and maybe Facebook.  And now I see newspapers, Acura Daily News is in this real time feed.  So clearly they see real time as more than just social media.  They see real time as, as even news results.  That is, that seems to me to be quite a bit of a change.  And also I like this. They also recommend, maybe you were looking for nicotine, quinine, capsaicin, or theophylline.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, it seems like instead of, I mean, this really is the miracle of having so many terabytes of storage and CPU cycles behind them.  I mean, so it seems like before the old index was just kind of like this stack, you know,  these layers that would move up the stack over a course of like two weeks, a layer of the stack wouldn't get updated.  But with caffeine, it's a constant cycle of iterative things get pushed through the cycle of index to results a lot faster and a lot more iteratively and, you know, short little bits.  It's kind of like the difference between, you know, back in the days of box software where updates would come out, you know,  a big update will come out and they'd ship the box out and go on the shelves of your, you know, of your store, you know, local store.  But now with web apps, small changes iteratively pushed, you know, weekly a couple of times a week.  That's generally, you know, most active websites get updated very, very quickly, iteratively and in small bites.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's buzzmachine.com updated nine hours ago.  Let's see what smarterware.org updated one minute ago, Gina.  Will you win?  Oh, nice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was on a plate.  Hey, let's see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, let's see how fast giga ohm cached.  Hmm.  Doesn't say.  Let me see.  New York Times.  Let's see how fast three minutes ago.  Gina, you win.  Wow.  I'm not going to put Leoville is going to be because I haven't updated in six months.  There's no reason for them to update it.  That's for sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there's something wrong with their algorithm then because I don't post as often as buzz machine and giga ohm.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was on a plane for 18 hours.  So it's just chance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We just hit it at the right time.  I'm sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Work on your exponential back off Google.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  And here I was saying nice things about them.  Let me ask you on the flip side of the equation enough of being nice to Google.  Right.  That's it.  Done.  I want to ask Brad this question if possible.  Brad, you've written a lot about how Twitter is changing people's search habits.  Do you feel that we are actually at that point where Google is beginning to worry about this whole real time data, you know, real time information, how we as a society are beginning to consume it through Facebook and Twitter.  You think they're increasingly worried and that's why they're increasing the speed of their index and the call and everything else.  You know what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's interesting.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  You should ask that.  I have found that the you know Google has integrated the content from Twitter into search results being has taken a slightly different approach and still keeps it siloed.  And I've actually been struck by how awkward the real time results can look in a Google search results page.  You know, you're getting kind of the raw, you know, the raw thoughts of people on Twitter on, you know, whatever you're searching on.  You know, ideally, Google's like looking at some of the more credible people and algorithmically, you know, routing their thoughts in.  But it's still kind of it's still kind of off.  And I wonder if, you know, if it's if it's and you guys can disagree with this, but if it might be sort of a failed experiment and that the richness of the real time web is more is more to be found in like the links people are sharing.  The Google can sort of mine that information for for you know, to to refine search results, but that the actual real time content, you know, maybe with with, you know, examples like, you know, like news events, you know, put those aside.  But for most searches were real times not really quite making a difference in speed, although on things like, you know, the speed of an update of a web results.  Great thing to have.  And you can see why caffeine will be very valuable there.  The actual real time content sort of isn't a great fit.  What do you guys think about that?  I think you're you're honest something there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's I wouldn't call it a failed experiment.  I think that's going way too far.  I think that there is a difference in expectation of what we see there.  And Google needs to refine this.  Can I use my numbers a week now?  Sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why not?  All right.  Just spit it out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Four point seven billion, which is the latest number for bit.ly links.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seven billion a day.  Is it a day?  How about a month?  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Four point seven billion clicks a month.  It late.  Google to publishers, not to all sites, but the publishers four billion a month.  Google News, one billion a month.  Again, mid apples and com quads.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But still, and most of those links are through Twitter probably.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  There's a Twitter.  The point is that doesn't include Facebook and anything else.  I think, Brad, you're way right is what we're seeing is the power of the human links and the human recommendations.  I think could well I'll say it could eclipse the power of Google at some point.  And so Google sees that and Google's trying to figure out how to integrate that.  I think the only thing is they haven't figured out how to integrate it yet.  So I think you're right.  There's a there's a slight disconnect of experiences because we're used to Google being more long term definitive relevant.  And here comes this live stuff.  But I think it's just the beginning of figuring that out.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I think the other issue, which we never talk about mostly because we always focus on technology.  But if you really look at Twitter and Facebook, what they're doing is they're essentially changing user behavior.  Right.  Our expectations of interacting with the web have gone from a single box to a very different kind of an Internet.  Right.  That's one of the reasons Google became so successful.  Well, it changed our behavior from your portals and in a pretty marginal search experience to a very simple, highly effective search experience.  So we became addicted to the idea of searching constantly.  And now we are slowly and slowly getting addicted to the idea of information being surfaced by people who are in our friends or in the social circle or whatever you want to call them.  People we loosely know.  Right. And I think that's a big that has to be a big issue for Google.  I mean, they have to be worried about that.  But I think that is a much more profound shift in our in in the web right now.  The how people interact with information, not just the technology aspect of it.  I don't think from a technology aspect, Google has to worry anything.  The only big worry, in my opinion, is how people are beginning to find and consume information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's say we're going to move on.  Apple's big worldwide developers conference was this week.  Steve Jobs took the stage on Monday, did take a few potshots at Google.  But the real pot shot at Google might have happened in the changed terms of the developer agreement on the iPhone.  Apple is now prohibiting prohibiting developers from using advertising in their application that shares analytic data with an advertising service provider other than Apple.  In effect, saying you can use ads, but you better not use ad mob.  Big shot against Google, you think?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'd say it's a call to the FTC.  It's kind of shocking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I think that's what Google is already looking at.  I think it's Google. Yeah.  What's the line?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  What's the let me play the devil's advocate in call to the FTC for a company which has two point two percent of the overall mobile market.  I don't buy that.  I'm sorry.  That's not what you call the FTC when you're dealing with Microsoft.  Right.  I'm sorry.  Microsoft.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You Microsoft.  A threat.  Microsoft.  I mean, I agree.  In principle, I agree with you.  No, no, no.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Back in the day when Microsoft was a monopoly, that's when you wouldn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They had 90 percent of the market or 95 percent.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  It's not like they're saying they own the.  You know, very soon.  They might, though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, you could you could be proactive on this.  They're in their positioning themselves to own the mobile ad market.  Yeah.  I don't disagree with you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I want I'm telling the FTC to stay the hell out of newspapers and the FCC likewise.  So I don't disagree with you.  What I'm saying is that I think it's a it's a funny PR move at this stage in an early market to try.  You know, Steve's just gone so wacky in control control freakishness.  What is the is there a justification for that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there a justification at all for this?  Besides the obvious business justification?  I mean, usually Apple has this nice consumer spin.  Well, it's it's in your interest.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, what they said that was that was Steve at D8 or D10 or whatever the hell it is.  D was talking about how what Flutter had sent data back.  And this was a matter of principle because Flutter was was because they were funny and finding out what places.  Flurry. Flurry. Flurry. Flurry. Flurry.  So I don't know if they if they.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Brad, has Google gone to the or AdMob gone to the FTC?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we found out a couple of weeks ago that the FTC was looking at Apple's behavior not only in the mobile phone market, but but the music market, the digital music market.  You know, I don't I don't know.  We sort of never know who's complained.  I mean, my feeling is they all sort of complain about each other.  But, you know, yeah, the FTC, it seems to me, is looking at it and, you know, almost point about market share is a good one.  But it's always about how you how you kind of define the market.  And obviously, the slicer you cut the pie, the more powerful Apple seems.  Right.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Right. Here is the thing, guys.  Has anybody even asked the big question?  Like, how much money do you really make from these mobile ads?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, interestingly, Apple says they've already before I add launches have 60 million dollars with the buys.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, we see it and we believe it.  I mean, we have a mobile application to get a mobile app.  And, you know, I bet you we the amount of money we've made from AdMob so far, maybe less than fifty dollars.  And we've had it out for about a month.  This, you know, this mobile advertising model, I think people take the attention to the fact that mobile is very different than than the web.  All right.  The web advertising model is entirely different.  It is actually pretty inefficient on the mobile advertising will have to be very efficient, will have to be generating very high CPM in order for application providers and website developers to actually make decent money.  And I think if Apple says you use our our application, you know, our ad system and you make more money.  Well, I'll see if I make more money.  I'll use their if not, I might just say, you know, to help it.  We don't need to put any ads in this thing because after one month, if I make fifty dollars, it's like why ruin the experience.  So I don't think AdMob is very effective right now.  And, you know, I'm sure there are other people who will disagree with me, but I don't buy that.  That, you know, you know, that any of these guys have the right answer on mobile advertising.  I know it's the wrong curmudgeonly, you know, backward looking view to take on things, but I am taking that view.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and Gina, doesn't it just push developers to Android?  I mean, in the long run, it could be a negative for Apple.  It makes developers say, well, if I can't use any ad platform I choose, maybe I should choose another platform to write for.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think developers who are focused, like who have dollar signs in their eyes are probably going to develop for the iPhone anyway.  Anyway, yeah. So I don't I don't think it's that big a deal.  I don't think that developers are going to feel some sort of allegiance to to AdMob to Google.  You know, if you're an developer, I phone because you want to make a heck of a lot of money then I don't think it would be a big deal to you.  But I don't know because I'm not an iPhone developer and like, I don't you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to move on and talk about, in fact, antitrust against Google in general.  I guess everybody's being investigated these days. It's just part of the way business works.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  We also have a. Yeah, because government doesn't have time to investigate the bank.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. They would prefer you pay no attention to the financial issue.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  And those guys are doing such a great job.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In your pocket. Don't look at the BP oil spilled.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Oh, look at Goldman Sachs. Let's go after people who actually make things which people want to buy.  People who are actually making US in competitive in the world market.  Let's not do that. Let's just support all the idiots who are looting us blind.  OK, that's the way it's supposed to go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You may. I know, Brad, you've got to go in about five minutes.  So we're going to we're going to do a quick ad and we're going to let you go.  But I do want to get your reaction. And actually, you wrote the story.  So I'd like to get your thoughts on this. But very quickly, let me just mention our friends at GoToMeeting, the folks at Citrix do the best.  The one the only online meeting software out there.  It's the one you should be using if you in fact you can be using absolutely free if you go to go to meeting dot com slash twig twig.  You could try this absolutely free for 30 days. It'll install in seconds.  Now, the next time you're on a conference call, you just tell your conferees, hey, go to go to meeting dot com.  Here's the meeting ID or you can even email them ahead of time an invitation.  Give them a link. Seconds later, they're seeing your computer on their screen.  You see your PowerPoint or your keynote presentation, the slides, the spreadsheets, whatever it is that you're trying to work together on for collaboration, for training, for sales, of course, you close more deals to get more done.  You'll be more efficient with GoToMeeting.  We use it so often here. We actually had to get a couple extra accounts because there were simultaneous meetings going on.  It's really a great tool. I highly recommend it.  You may have tried the rest. You may have seen how difficult it is to configure or install.  You're going to love it. Citrix knows how to do this stuff. Go to meeting dot com slash twig.  Just remember that you could try it free for 30 days.  So, Brad, you wrote about this a couple of weeks ago.  What is the status of the monopoly investigation against Google?

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Oh, I think, you know, it's it's it's quiet now.  You know, the big the main course there for a while was AdMob.  And, you know, the FTC, I think, wanted to do something there if just to challenge Google.  But ultimately, the market, the shifting market realities and an Apple strength and its own IAD,  the system and acquisition of Quattro Wireless kind of forced its hand.  It dropped it. You know, my impression is the Justice Department, you know, is always, you know, taking every meeting it can,  trying to learn more about, you know, unified search and the way in which Google, you know,  leverages its strength and search to go into other markets.  You know, probably now the focus of attention is the is the Wi-Fi, you know, Street View data collection.  I mean, Google just stepped in it big time and we're going to find out, you know, soon what kind of data it collected.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google says it was a rogue hacker employee that did it.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  Hopefully we'll find out more about that and what they were up to.  But, you know, my sense in researching that Washington story is that you have antitrust enforcers  like Christine Varney at the Justice Department and John Leibowitz at the FTC that, you know, I mean, you know, right.  To Ohm's point, like, you know, Google is creating great products, you know, creating jobs.  But what, you know, I think the antitrust regulators have seen again and again in all these markets is that,  you know, you've got to stop this behavior in its incipiency or you can't do anything about it down the road.  I mean, certainly that was, you know, that's that's been the lesson in a lot of these markets.  So, I mean, it looks at things like mobile advertising, which is nothing, you know, but it's looking for evidence of  anti-competitive behavior to try to stop it before, you know, any one company, you know, gets a stranglehold by behaving anti-competitively.  You know, I don't know if we'll see any kind of Microsoft style investigation.  I mean, the thing about Google is one, it's got the lesson of Microsoft.  So, you know, nobody's sending the kinds of emails that Bill Gates was sending in the 90s.  And then it's just a different company with a different culture.  But, you know, I mean, I think I think regular, you know, and then there's just the personal aspect, which is like, you know,  if you're an antitrust regulator in Washington, if you're not looking at Google right now, you know, are you relevant?  I mean, this is like the big fish and everybody wants to fry it.  So it's got a lot of momentum and I think we'll continue to hear about it for the next couple of years.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't that attitude kind of kind of scary a little bit?  I know I'm a known Google fanboy, but just this attitude that says that when things get too big, I talk about this with Europeans.  Where is the law that tells me the definition of too big?  Google didn't get there, I don't think, by doing anything evil.  Newspapers messed up and Google offers a better ad deal and and Ultimista was crappy next to Google and so on.  They just did things better.  And at some point, isn't that dangerous for our economy to to you're always going to worry that, oh, I can't be too successful.  Right. That's the one.

Speaker: Brad Stone
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, I think the ad mob example is a great one.  The FTC looked at the deal they spent.  OK, they spent a lot of time looking at it and probably devoted a lot of resources, but they approved it, you know, and maybe that was the right call.  And so, you know, that they're that they're checking, you know, the corporate power, I think, has to be a good thing.  And then, you know, and then hopefully, you know, they'll continue to sort of behave and act with, you know, all due consideration.  But, you know, it doesn't worry me that that this is a company that obviously has a lot of power, a lot of market power control over the information that we see online and that someone's watching.  I can't.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  So newspapers.  I think there is one point to make in this, which is if you really think about it, we as a society have come to a point where being successful, you get penalized.  Doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a sports star, you're a film actor, you're a big company.  You are going to get torn down at some point or the other because that has become the favorite spectator sport of the times.  I think that is just universal.  And the second part of it, if FTC and people in the Congress and other government institutions are going to look into technology industry, well, they need to get educated about technology industry.  They cannot be watchdogs by being marginally, you know, intelligent about these things.  If we want people to be smart about these things and make smart decisions to regulate the technology industry or whatsoever, we need people who actually get it.  People who are smart about it, people who are from the industry or actually are educated in things which are actually relevant to the industry.  I think this is where the big issues are not talked about is that we always are dealing with situations in a reactive manner, whether it's the FTC investigation of AdMob or whatever.  Instead of taking three months or four months or five months, that should have taken exactly two weeks if we had the right people in place.  Right? Right people in place would have meant they would be aware of the industry dynamics.  And I think it shouldn't take five months. It shouldn't cost taxpayers that much money.  I think this is where I think the system is not working properly, in my opinion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do. Okay, I think we can move on. Do you? There goes Brad. Boom.  He took off. So but I think you said it. And I think that's absolutely accurate. And an investigation does not a indictment make or or court case make.  Let's see real quickly. You were going to ask, are you buying? I guess you're buying everything. I guess we should. I guess we should talk about the iPhone.  Switch. Yeah, I might really. You know, the real what happened was I had the EVO, as you know, for a while. I really love it. And Gina, you still have your EVO, right?  Because you got it. I was just a review copy. I just sent it back. And I was trying to decide whether there she is. She's fondling it.  I was trying to decide whether to get it. And my experience was that the battery life is probably just not good enough to keep.  I like the screen a lot, but it's just it. I need to keep pumping it up. I love my Nexus one.  And I really that was the other problem was I really like to to I want have I want fro yo. Yep. So GSM, fro yo and the battery life.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Those are the three problems with the EVO for sure. I saw battery life with the Nexus one, but it's not as bad. It's not as bad. Right. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think I'll keep the Nexus one. But gosh, darn it. That screen on the iPhone. Jeff, that's got to make you kind of drooly. Really? Yeah.  The display looks amazing. Yeah, that's that's to me. The only thing I don't care about the front facing camera. We had that on the EVO. Who are you going to call?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think the front facing camera is going to make chat roulette all the easier. It's for sex. Let's face it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And and besides, you have to you have to be in. OK, you could disavow all knowledge of my actions. You have to be in Wi-Fi, which, you know, as.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a that's a really problematic limitation right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My greatest disappointment. I was counting on, you know, Steve saying, and now we're opening it up to all carriers.  One more thing you can get on any carrier, anything intelligent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I haven't. So the screen is your killer reason to drop Android and go back to iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you want OS four, you got it on three GS. So, you know, you got multitasking. You've got folders.  Front facing camera doesn't wow me. I'm confused, Leo. I'm here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought you said that you were going to go back to the iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm thinking about it because of the screen. Just the screen. Just the screen is the only thing that wows me enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I see you nodding your head, Juno. No, I mean, I can understand the logic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The retina display looks really beautiful. I have to buy it. I have to buy it. I mean, anyway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'll buy it, review it. The question is, what will I carry in my pocket? Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious to know what that is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. You are fickle as can be when it comes to devices.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's a BlackBerry man. BlackBerry. You know, let's talk about the BlackBerry a little bit.  And let's talk about the WWDC keynote because Jobs, you know, the BlackBerry is the device that's ahead of the iPhone.  Right. But Jobs didn't really talk about RAM. Right. He talked about Android specifically.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He didn't talk about Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 either. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it was like he mentioned Android by name twice, even though Android is not the iPhone's biggest competition.  Right. RIM is ahead of the iPhone. And then there's the iPhone. And then there's Android. Right.  Android is only behind the iPhone in browser usage. But I thought it was really interesting.  I found him kind of defensive and I thought it was interesting that he pointed out Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so interesting because we, of course, you know, Google took a little a few hits, took a few hits for slamming Apple.  And like that shows weakness. And why are you mentioning competitor in your keynote?  And then Steve does the same thing back. Yeah. They're clearly in this headbutting war. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there is. They are. And if you look at the numbers, Jobs has no reason to discuss Android.  I mean, I think that he was like looking at a crowd of developers, a crowd of early adopters, a crowd of people who are going to be...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's who he's talking to. He's talking to... Yeah, Gina, I think your rep, there's also, they're not in the phone business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're in the ad business. Well, they showed that, didn't they?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Apple is still the device business, but where the money is, is going to be the advertising.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  And that's what Google is... I don't buy that for a minute. I think there is a couple of things. Right.  First of all, I don't think anyone should discount RIM at any point in time.  And I think Apple isn't discounting them because if you really look at their sales, they keep going.  At least for near foreseeable future, RIM will keep gaining market share or start selling, you know, keep selling their devices because they are selling cheaper smartphones and the rest of the world.  Secondly, I think the big issue with Apple and Android is two different ideologies.  I think if you really think about it, one ideology is Apple's ideology, which is a device, a very curated, controlled experience, which is proven to be moneymaker for developers.  And then there is the Google experience, which is a little bit, you know, more freeform all over the place, advertising centric revenue model.  So the developers will soon enough make a choice which way they want to go because there will be more Android devices on the planet.  Just a sheer number of people making handshakes using Android will make sure that there is more Android phones on the planet.  As a developer, you will have to make a choice whether you want to go where the revenues are, which is by selling apps and, you know, people are used to paying for certain things.  And then the ad business, which is where Google is focusing on and trying to make money that way.  I think we are going to see the schism develop over the next couple of years.  And I agree with you. I think this whole Apple versus Android is a bit of a fight which shouldn't exist because the two of them are trying to eat Nokia for lunch.  Essentially, I mean, if there is anybody they should be taking digs at, it is at Nokia, not at each other, because the two of them are too small to be taking digs at each other, in my opinion.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think Nokia is in such a bad shape. I've said this to people there and said it again today to somebody.  I think they should come out with Android phones.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe not. I think, you know, I'm pretty happy with my Blackberry. I have to be very honest with you.  It doesn't run out of battery in the middle of a conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of an issue. You know, and Joshua Topolsky from Engadget said an interesting thing on Twitter this week.  Which network are you on, Om? Are you on AT&T with your Blackberry?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  No, I use T-Mobile and they have this thing called UMA, which basically, if you're on Wi-Fi anywhere on the planet, it seems like you're making local phone calls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, boy, I found that quality is terrible though on that. You're okay with that?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Yeah, it works for me. I've been using it for almost a year now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, I had the UMA for a while too.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I would love to own an iPhone on a permanent basis, but you know, there is one A-letter word, I mean, three-letter word, which starts with an A, which completely drives me insane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Three-letter word. This is like crossword puzzles. A three-letter word.  AT&T, AT&T.  Oh, them.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw my post about a year and a half ago. I was the first one to break up with the iPhone because of AT&T.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you were probably right, AT&T. But Joshua was saying, and this is what I'm curious about, is do you get dropped calls on anything but the iPhone?  Maybe it's the iPhone, in which case maybe this new design, which puts the antenna on the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, my 3G AT&T card right before I came on the air and after I came on the air, it was dropping like crazy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you're driving. You were driving.  That's what it's meant for.  Not while you're driving 60 miles an hour.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sure, it's meant to be able to work for me in my ass and sell a train driving at 120 miles an hour.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  This is really fun. The funny part of this whole conversation is that AT&T data network is the one which is choked, right?  Right, because of the iPhone.  Which is like a data chain. A voice channel shouldn't be dropping calls. So, you know, there's clearly some issues there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question. If you created a data only network, no voice, would it be more efficient?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  No. Basically, it all depends on two things, Jeff.  To have a really strong data network which AT&T can support, which can support millions of iPhone users,  you need to have a lot of spectrum. You need to have a lot of backhaul bandwidth.  And you need to have a lot of radios in a lot of places, power radios in a lot of places in the city.  You cannot just expect to have a great network which is not fully architected for an iPhone user, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm asking the next question. So, if you were going to build a network now, if you're a Sprint, building its network,  wouldn't it be better off building a pure data network and going ahead and declaring defeat and making voice VoIP?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what AT&T is supposed to do and that's exactly what Vimax is supposed to do.  If you really look at the Vimax networks we have right now, they're a little slow, but they are built for an IP world.  And same is with LTE. When that happens, then it will become the question of how the carriers want to charge you.  I think that's the reason why they all went from flat rate to the smaller tiers, because as LTE comes out,  it would become less profitable for them to offer you flat rate data. So they will offer you data, but the more calls you make,  the more video calls you make, the more voice calls you make, you will still have to pay for them.  So there will be a way of continuing the phone companies or a way for them to keep making money.  I think that's fine. If you really think about it, that's the only way they can put money into the network,  is just getting some kind of data revenue. So you will see that. That would be fun.  But it's still a little bit ways off, another two years before we see some of that stuff happen.  But what phones do you guys use?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're all Nexus One users because we really strong-armed Jeff to give up his iPhone,  and now he's going to gloat when I switch back to the iPhone, or maybe fry, I don't know.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Jeff, you have an iPhone?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have both, but I'm using the Nexus One, except when I was in Europe, when I was in South Africa, it wasn't worth it to get a SIM down there.  However, I pay $100 a month to use AT&T outside the US so I can have 100 megs and be safe.  Right.  I hit South Africa, sorry, not involved, $10 a meg.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there's some Asian nations too where that international data plan doesn't work. It's a little frustrating.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  What about Gina? What phone do you use on a daily basis?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I use the Nexus One, which I bought myself. I got an Evo at Google I.O., but I am trying not to get too hooked on it  because I'm going to have an early termination fee with my T-Mobile contract, because I have a T-Mobile contract.  You get 30 days of use of the Evo, so you have a decision to make in a couple of weeks.  Right. Do I switch to Sprint or not? Which I probably won't. If 4G was here in San Diego and the Evo was Android 2.2, I would switch, but not quite yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it might be Android 2.2 by then. We don't know. They keep making sounds like they're going to do this.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I think actually you do have 4G in San Diego, Gina, because Qualcomm has their headquarters.  That's true. Qualcomm is here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you're next to Qualcomm, it works great.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  If you're in two-mile radius from their office, you can actually get 4G. You can pick it up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's funny. There's some places in Silicon Valley, too, where 4G works.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  4G works perfectly. Google campus, ASI, Cisco.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to park my RV down there, and I'm going to just hook up all my computers. It's going to be my internet access. That's it. I'm going to do Twitter from the RV by Qualcomm next time.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  I'm sure they will find a way to get you the bandwidth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This world is going to change though. Next year with LTE and wider sprint clear wire, everything changes quite a bit, doesn't it?  But maybe not if we're only getting 2 gigabytes a month.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  We have to pay for more bandwidth. That's all.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My issue remains that we're just going to be nervous.  It's going to put a stranglehold on use, which is going to put a stranglehold on development.  We're just going to put a stranglehold on the business model of mobile, just as its right to take off.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what we've been writing about. I hope people do pay attention to this whole issue more seriously.  I think this is a really, really serious issue for our industry. This whole bandwidth catch.  I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say I'm a little sympathetic because the infrastructure for mobile data is very different than the infrastructure for your internet service provider, for your house and business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's why I'm asking about voice versus data.  That's interesting. Yeah.  They're trying to protect the old models. And if you disrupt it entirely, the problem is it takes too much capital to disrupt this industry.  But if you did, if white spaces really existed with Wi-Fi on steroids, you'd build it around data purely.  And I wonder whether the whole voice structure and the whole effort to maintain that business model causes problems.  I'd be a lot more willing to pay more for data every month if I didn't have to pay for the voice.  And there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, if you're paying through the nose for data, how long before you put ad blockers on all these iAds and ad mobs and all that stuff?  Because that's just using up more data.  That's true too.  You know? I mean, this is kind of against their business model in some ways.  According to a Mashable Mobile, there's a hack that allows 720p video recording on the Nexus One.  So maybe maybe Gina and I don't have to move.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I haven't tried this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to try it. You've rooted your your handset, I'm sure.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I have rooted past handsets.  I decided to try and go non-root with the Nexus One because that's how most normal people don't use their phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to use a Cyanogen ROM to do this and Froyo is not supported.  So I don't know if it's really a real, but it's interesting.  The point is that there's a lot of hardware that is not currently taken advantage of by the operating system.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I apologize. I've got to dash.  Jeff, thank you.  I'm glad I could make it on even from a moving car.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We are thrilled to have you as always.  Jeff Jarvis, the blogger at buzzmachine.com, the author of What Would Google Do? Professor of Journalism at CUNY.  Good to see you and Gina and oh, pleasure to see you, my friend.  Great to have you, Jeff. Take care.  And we already got your number, so goodbye.  Thank you.  Ohm, if you want to take off too, we're just going to wrap this thing up.  So go ahead. Just everybody else is left.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know where they're dropping like flies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just going to be me and Gina.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  That's fine with me.  I don't want to be rude. I just want to make sure I do my job and then go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My secret plan is coming true. I just go ahead. Leave. No, no.  Gina, it's time for your tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a good one. I like this one.  New Gmail Labs feature, Google Maps previews.  So if you go into your Gmail Labs settings and you enable this, it's just called Google Maps previews.  Someone emails you an address.  It embeds a Google Map right inside the message.  You can expand it. You can open a new window. Super, super handy.  Gmail is really, really getting really good at this now, like the embedding content.  Someone sends you a YouTube video. You can see that you can get the embed with the play button flicker pictures.  It does the same thing, which is nice because Yahoo is their competitor.  So now we have maps and this is pretty sweet.  And actually, I think this works in Buzz as well.  Well, I haven't tried it. Leo, you probably know if you buzz an address, I think you get automatically a Google Map embedded.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do I have to turn it on in the in the in the lab setting for Gmail to get that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, and then click enable and then scroll down and hit the save changes button.  And then if you search for a mail or an email, if you get an email with an address in it, it'll just automatically embed a map.  So, you know, it's one of these little things that you're going to turn on and forget about it.  And then you're going to get an email with an address and you're in instead of having to flip to a new tab and look it up a Google Maps, it'll be right there for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that nice? That's awesome.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love Gmail Labs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do, too. You know, it's good to thank you for letting us know because they change the ad stuff all the time.  They do. I'm stealing one that really by all rights should have been yours.  And not only am I stealing it from you, but I'm stealing it from from Giga Ohm.  Matthew Ingram writing yesterday on Giga Ohm, Google tries to get some buzz for wave with wave this.  Did you know about this, Gina? Yes, I did. It's a bookmark.  It's a bookmark. How cool.  So if if you go to the Google blog and I'm just going to click the link here, you can create a new wave from any web page, which is very cool.  And there's a wave this API.  So you can also put a wave this button on your web page.  So now that everybody is actually it's just it's actually pretty easy.  It's a just good. It's just add this link and anything could be a wave.  So now that everybody can use wave because the invitations are open, maybe we'll see more waves.  Do you see more interest in wave now? I mean, Google, you wrote them in Google.  Gina, you wrote the book. I'm calling on Google from now on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am more interested. Our sales went up, which was nice.  And definitely, but still getting that feeling that you really have to kind of bring somebody in and show them.  And then I like this is cool. So wave still kind of has that little bit of a learning curve problem.  But the people who I have used it with really like it.  And we did see a little spike in sales after after they opened it up, which I was pleased about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And thank you to everyone. Are you using wave at all home in your business?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  No, I'm not. The rest of my team does. They do.  Yeah, I like I like Twitter. So unfortunately, I spend most of my time on Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twitter. Isn't it funny? Twitter is now the old fart thing.  Oh, you're so old. You use Twitter. Oh, man.  You're old, man. I'm not. Oh, I use buzz. It's modern.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Yeah. If you use the reverse psychology, only only the old people use the latest technology.  I like Facebook like that. No, but I have one tip for you guys.  Both you and Gina. Love it.  So you like Android. So soon Samsung is going to introduce a new phone called Samsung Galaxy.  Galaxy. I can't wait to see it. Have you seen it?  You will be so pleasantly surprised.  And it will be like your Nexus One will look like the Hugo compared to that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's a huge screen. It's an AMOLED screen. Right.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Beautiful. I just saw it like in Europe before coming. It is unbelievably beautiful.  And it doesn't look like an Android phone. It is as close to an iPhone as any Android device has come.  It's pretty amazing. And I think you guys want to buy that whenever you have an opportunity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The current rumors are that T-Mobile will have it in July. I hope that's the case.  I hope so. See now we got a tough decision.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Every month there's a new phone. It's tough being an Android user.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  Exactly. No point buying shoes now just buy the phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a new phone every three months whether you want one or not.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  What do you mean every three months? It should be every 15 days.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It really feels like every six weeks. I feel like someone needs to chart this on a timeline.

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  It's ridiculous. I'll do it for you, Gina. But guys, I really do have to bail out. Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're done. Om Malik, thanks so much for joining us.  Gigaom.com is the place to go to read Om and his incredible staff.  You did a show on Rev3. Are you going to go back to that at any point?

Speaker: Om Malik
Transcript:  We're doing some stuff on our own site. We're not going back to Rev3.  You can always have me back whenever. I love you.  I want you back Om Malik.  I love what you do and it's an honor to be in the presence of you and Gina.  Both of you I admire a lot. Thank you for having me in your company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you Om. Really appreciate it. Good to talk to you again.  Take care guys.  Gina Tripani, of course, she is the blogger at SmarterWear.org and her book,  The Complete Guide to Google Wave is at CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, it is. If you buy a copy, put in the discount code TWIG and you'll get a little surprise.  For Twig listeners. Just for you. Because I love you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that sweet? Well, everybody loves Gina. Thank you Gina for being here.  It's great to see you again and thank you everybody for joining us.
