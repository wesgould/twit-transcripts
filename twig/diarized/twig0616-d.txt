Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. I was doing Tabata's this morning. I practically killed me. Is that what you eat?  No, it's a high intensity interval training  Like to kill me  Jeff Jarvis is on the road on the road again, I'm in the dog house

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For those of you watching live, it's my fault. We're late. I'm in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No such thing as late  What are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you in Boston? Where are you? I'm in the Boston vicinity with my son Jake. Oh, are you visiting Jake?  Well, yes, and also movies moving to New Hampshire. So nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been so long since you've actually gone anywhere. It's really nice. It's absolutely true

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very wacky. I had to pull the suitcase out. It was like doing archaeology  Dust dust it off. I found all these old headsets and wires and things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you like do you are you gonna be going back to class in September? Yep. Yep. Wow, that's exciting  New York is open  California opened yesterday. It's very exciting  Stacey has the day off, but I am thrilled we had a little opening because very thrilled  We are very lucky to get the research director at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on media politics and public policy  She is an expert in media manipulation  Disinformation and adversarial media movements the great Joan Donovan. Dr. Donovan  Party party Jones house. She's just down the road  She actually invited Jeff to come over for pizza

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About ten minutes from each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She actually invited him over for tech support

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you need it last time we talked to you, Jim, we were talking about Russian influence on the elections and  and  Disinformation that hasn't gone away apparently  Yesterday President Putin said oh, we've got taking we're not taking you you're hacking us  That's that is one of the tools of the of the big lie is it's funny because it happens over and over again and yet  Nobody seems to notice is just accusing the person. Oh  What happened? I didn't do it. I swear I didn't Jeff we went black. There we go. I didn't do a thing  Is to accuse the person your opponent of doing the thing you're doing and  And it's an amazing rhetorical trick because it gets them to get all twisted and knots defending themselves and all of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a combination of projection and what about ism in the same in the same thing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, projection is a big one like well everybody, you know, we're hacking you so you must be hacking us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, we're not just talking about your sort of garden variety, you know  trolls and botnets online, I mean  Hack in the power grid here hacking infrastructure hacking  Critical infrastructure, I mean, yeah, so it's a little bit different the stakes are obviously enormous  but at the same time, I  you know  Putin's always going to pretend he doesn't know what's happening  But he he himself is uh, you know very fascinated by technology and knows a lot  And so we should always be wary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also had an interesting justification for poisoning the Volney  I mean, it's just fascinating to watch this guy and I hate to say it but it has it brought back a little  Ye like this is where we were for the last four years  Like with a guy who just says anything he wants and well, but a guy who's really effing smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, maybe that's the difference. I was I was in the room with him once in Davos  Joe now goes there instead of me. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Haven't been I haven't I heard the hotels rent too high  You can keep your world power if I you know if I save a few thousand bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Saw a male journalist wearing a  What do you call what do you call that that that that greenish ring from like, Arizona?  Jade Jade no, not Jade  The baby  Turquoise. Thank you Turquoise. So we're in a big turquoise ring and he he focused on it. He said to men where those  And he wouldn't let go he kept going back on it again and the guy's wife had given it to him and  And we all try to get the guy to give give Putin make him to put it on  but he just he just he finds a you know, an odd little thing about somebody and he just focuses in and  And  He's scary some people call that trolling though. Yeah. Oh, well he tro yeah his whole nation trolls us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Putin's response to ABC's questioning him about Navalny was well black lives matter  It's like a boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's just  anyway  It's not it's not really on our our beat but I but I think it's great to have Joan on because  What is on our beat is the use of technology?  particularly the internet these days to spread lies misinformation to  mobilize to  radicalize there's all sorts of  malign uses now Jeff is the big defender of big tech and I don't I  Don't disagree with him big tech. We'd fake Joan of the internet. I'm defending the internet  But Joan was saying this you were you were not here at the moment  But Joan was saying this before the show began where would we have been in the last year and a half?  without zoom and tech and all that amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I wrote a thank-you note to the internet on medium two weeks ago and I mean it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we would have been worked without it, but this is our constant  Battle on on this show, but also just in general  There's good in tech and there's bad in tech. Mm-hmm  You wrote a piece Joan for Harvard magazine  Saying disinformation ain't going away, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can it be stopped? Oh, that was that was a piece that I was profiled in and okay  Yeah, there's a couple other researchers in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That headline on that piece  Can disinformation be stopped? Oh, what's your answer for that Joan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it  As with everything it depends  You know one of the things that I think the internet has been fantastic at is helping us  Route information around the planet lowering the cost of it  I was just thinking about high fidelity video and how different it is to  Be isolated but not necessarily alone in the same way and you know  I'm wearing my phone phone losers of America t-shirt here today because I do you know  I'd still like romanticize the phone and voice and you know  Just the way in which people come to hear and learn from one another but there is something different about  Video and when it comes to disinformation, I think we're dealing with again a distribution issue  We're dealing with a content issue. We're dealing with you know people who are  Motivated either through money or clout to  You know push disinformation around obviously it's politically rewarding to be able to do that  and so I  Wish I could say in this moment that disinformation can be stopped  I think one thing we have to focus on is figuring out, you know  What should these what should these distribution channels look like and how should they be run and who should oversee them and?  And we got to go from there like we need serious standards and protocols to get at  What I've been calling a public interest internet or an internet that serves the broadest public good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the fact I don't know so naive but I  Don't think this information will ever be stopped as long as there's some form of profit involved with its money where this political power

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or power well, and as Jeff has pointed out it predates the internet by a long shot  Since witchcrafts is print. Yeah  It's part of it. Maybe it is a little bit more. I mean look we've always had I'm sure in the pre-print  There were middle ages there were conspiracy theories that made the rest just very very slowly  But but as soon as there were newspapers, you know  There's the press wars of the eight what is 1820s in the United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to balance  Printed ballads and people going through and and that was the source of a lot of the witchcraft conspiracy theories

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there is a cynicism that's a little different  in fact, it's interesting you invoked the phone losers of America John because I  Think there's they're they're harmless  but they also deal in a form of disinformation and  There's a certain amount of  Almost cynicism like a  mocking  Like we can fool these people because they're stupid. I guess I think it's not stupid. I think it's trusting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, which is even worse. You're mocking people because they're trusting that's terrible  And I mean, but that's that's what's so interesting here is we we have to change  how  Information is shared and what kind of labels are put on and and how it arrives at our door and and what we call news  And what we don't call news, I've been a big  Pusher of trying to get us to think about well, we have distribution pathways social media really favors things that are  popular and  Novel and so what if we were to also make sure that social media served things that are timely  Accurate local knowledge, but nobody what is the right? I mean that's is no  I mean, we know you don't have to want everybody wants to sir. Nobody wants the vegetables. Nobody wants water  It's necessary but like if you have a choice between water and and wine or water in a martini or water and  You know an ice-cold seltzer like I have  Jones  But part of it is is really trying to figure out what in what proportions do we need this  You know and I think too, you know  so like if you think about broad stakes of different conspiracy theories like  probably the the most broad stakes that most people are familiar with is  You know this notion of Holocaust denialism and you know a couple years ago  Zuckerberg came out and said that well  he's not going to remove Holocaust denial on his platform because people have the right to be wrong about things and  later as we realize how big you know anti-semitic movements get organized and how big they become when  They are allowed to exchange information unfettered and reach audiences of people that  Do not necessarily understand the stakes of what they're reading and it's you know, just kind of laced in with  You know missives from your aunt and your you know, your cousin's graduation pictures and your your friends your best friend's cat and  Holocaust denialism is just right there in the same mix. It's different  And so we do we do need to think about ranking sorting  Labeling, you know, I I think we need more librarians at the helm of the internet  I like that, you know, I don't think it's insurmountable  I just think that there's a there's different ways of thinking about what the solution it's a big hill to climb

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so Joan do me a favor and and you know, I think that so Leo accuses me of being an apologist for the platforms  I defend the internet and they happen to be the current proprietors, but they're not the forever proprietors  These are early days so so the discussion that I want to change is rather than part of the problem is we talk about how Facebook's  Broken or Twitter's broken that puts a ceiling on the discussion that we just try to fix  Incrementally then if you break out of the current proprietors of the net, how would you describe in larger more universal terms?  The internet you want  It's a good question. I want um, I want things that are more universal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want things mostly that are reflective of  The values that we would instill in what we might call a library right like obviously the public library is something that I I  value and so when we have  search I want search results that are indicative of  The questions that I'm asking and have been vetted in such a way that are  Mostly accurate the tension here is obviously about timeliness  Which is to say that the thing that gets weaponized often by disinformation  Operatives is breaking news events. You have something into the world that people want to know about and they don't know  enough about it  To not assume that what comes up first isn't accurate and we have people weaponizing that we have people that are  Jumping into that and so I think that Twitter is actually moving in the right direction. They now have curators for their trends  so it's not as easy to  Trigger a trending topic as it has been in the past  And so I do think that platforms are learning that when you're in the information business that quality matters  But you know when it comes to an internet, I think the other piece of this is really about  Making sure that people have access and then also making sure that there's digital literacy taught in  high schools and colleges so that you understand more about  What the information commons is and how it can be manipulated

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do we do about digital literacy for grandpa though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In 20 he'll be dead soon. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Screwing up the world more than

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the grandpa that I think is a legacy of like believe what you read, right?  someone took the effort to write it down and other people are sharing it and  Must be true. I see the one thing that's really interesting about my latest research is the notion of the rabbit hole  So everybody says it but nobody's really defined it  so I said to myself here's an opportunity for an academic to really mess things up and  So I've started to think about this and for me a rabbit hole is you see the same information and it's really repetitive  And you see it on the same platform over and over then you see the same information and it's redundant  That is you see the same information across different web spaces  So you go from YouTube over to Twitter you see the same thing you assume. Oh, well must be true  The other thing the social media provides is responsiveness that is  if you ask a question on your social media people are likely to  post a link or give you a response or  If you ask a question in a search engine, it's gonna give you a response no matter what it is that you put in there  It's very rare that you get zero responses from a place like Google or Bing  And then the last thing that is the troublesome part of the rabbit hole is reinforcement  So if I go on YouTube and I'm like, what is this stupid QAnon thing? I don't know right and so I'd type it in and  The algorithm the reinforcement algorithm will remember that so say I watch two or three videos and I think to myself  Not for me. The algorithm is actually going to try to get me to reengage with that  Yeah, like and so and that's not bad if you're watching, you know, you know greatest home runs or you know  slam dunk contests or  Genres of bands. It's really bad when you're like looking at network conspiracies and you're trying to finger figure out who killed  GIFK right if you're just trying to figure that out  I can tell you you're gonna get Oswald but I can also tell you're gonna get a lot of other stuff  right and so if you think about repetition redundancy responsiveness and then the  Reinforcement that's what we're up against here. What are the what about expertise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and  In an age way, I dream of a web that's more based on expert networks  But this is also a time when experts are considered elites and for that reason not trusted  Is there any hope?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes experts are not necessarily experts either. They just tend to brand themselves as such  You see it all the time on our news coverage  We'd brought on experts so-and-so to talk about this and that and when you dig further into them  They they really don't know what they're talking about either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a fault off of the Booker. This comes down to this comes down to really what the fundamental problem is, which is  unfortunately  Kellyanne Conway was right when she said we live in a post fact society  If we can't hurt it if alternative fact if we can't  agree on  What's true and experts disagree and others who say I don't want what you say to be true to be true  So I'm gonna give you a different point of view. It's very hard  That's I guess that's the difference you say should a librarian be the arbiter of truth  Which life they have been for centuries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, well not one but also, you know, let's let's lower the temperature and just think about accuracy like  We're up against the speed of truth, which is to say that knowledge is really expensive to produce  I know this because I run a research team and it is really hard to get at facts  If they are they have to go through a whole vetting process and so this is why  social media has  fundamentally broken breaking news because of the way in which  Facts just take a long time to get established  and so that was one of the very first things that trolls figured out how to  Metal with and then became almost an entire disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Industry and part of the problem is that on the internet especially in that that sped up internet all facts are equal or all  statements are equal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's because everything has you know, depending upon the SEO and the keyword structure  Not equal in terms of its ability to be discovered, but you have certain people who know how to make things  Discoverable and therefore their stuff tends to come up  That's really well, yeah, and that's because of the design itself and that's why Ant's point is so is so crucial here, which is  Self-definition on the internet and I am an expert. Trust me  I've got you know  57 articles on  You know this  Scientific archive but then you find out that there's no gates on the archive and anybody can upload  Articles and you realize well that doesn't mean anything. It's like going and hiding going and hanging your own painting  In a museum and declaring yourself like a world-renowned artist with a show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got our self into this because we wanted to democratize this we wanted to get rid of gatekeepers  We you know the the Academy which decides what's great art  We decided that's just a bunch of old white men from Europe forget that and so we've we've kind of  Broken it all apart. That was kind of the benefit of the internet was this intermediation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so did print and it took a while together again because we needed to invent institutions

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but but okay, so Joan because you're from Harvard and I could say she's at Harvard's Kennedy School and that gives you  expertise in the eyes of some and  Then in the eyes of others that would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eyes of eyes of me is I've spent the last decade studying something as a job and a profession and a labor of  Love but that's the way in which we communicate. I mean look I look I totally knowledge I read too many books  I completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Completely knowledge expertise, but you understand that's kind of what we're going into is this  This is very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Process by which other people who are considered experts consider me an expert  That's what that's what getting your PhD means right is that other people have decided you can join this but we rejecting the Academy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just more of the Academy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe we are but I don't know people are still going to college and you know when I show up the class they listen  It's not a pretty quiet, but in some ways it's a self-perpetuating  No, because you can't come teach at Harvard  It's so closed that even if I wanted you to come teach at Harvard if I was like Leo is the smartest guy  I know on that good. I know you should be teaching here the whole institution would be like that's not how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if I'm Ben Shapiro, I'm saying that's a good thing. I can't teach at Harvard  I wouldn't trust those guys as far as I could throw them. You should listen to me. Well, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the one thing about the internet where we start to  We it's not that someone just declares themselves an expert on the internet  There's something else happening here, which has to do with engagement metrics and the amount of something  The you know the flow across platforms the amount of resources that they put into  making sure that their  Their point of view is is well circulated and so it's not the case that you know any old person  Through their own grit and knowledge  Rise to the top online. That's that's what I'm talking about here is the stakes are different because you can engineer it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can circumvent it. Those people have as big a voice. It may be that maybe even bigger  That's what we've given them with the internet. We've given them a big megaphone. So so Leo you're gonna hate me for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's I'm gonna say some years ago something happened, but  I'm gonna go back to the very first  For censorship in printing and it came from someone who demanded that the Pope  Censored books but not because there was anything evil or wrong or anti-religious in it because they were low quality and the Latin  Translation was bad and what he was asking for was the institution of the editor and the publishing house and eventually we created that  And yes, it was gatekeepers, but things got published had more value, right?  So maybe it was kind of too far the pendulum is swung so far  Okay, but we need new kinds of  Institutions, right? We need John Jones. Absolutely right. The one institution that I think is most  Transferable is librarians because they understand the structure in the system  But the system we had of newspapers and editor is there doesn't work so well the system of book editors when there's  We went from hundreds of books to thousands of books to 400,000 books a year  And we have imprints that now come out only to publish the stuff  No one else will publish because it's full of lies and crap. So that institution isn't working so well  So do you update the current institutions? Do you invent new institutions? That's what we're about right now. That's that's the internet  We're trying to create is an internet based on new institutions given a new reality to perform the functions  We've always needed but now  They wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, these algorithms were supposed to be doing that but instead of them being you know, the kinds of  Gatekeepers that would bring  Expertise and accurate stuff to the top  We have a system by which lots of people have figured out how to engineer that and so when you know  Davey Alba over the New York Times is writing an article about  Coordinated inauthentic behavior which she's really looking at is the  Networks that are using let's say it's happening on Facebook the networks of pages and accounts that are using  Facebook as it is built to promote a  Disinformation campaign and so it's it's it's not easy anymore  But it used to be very easy to spin up a couple hundred fake Facebook pages and accounts and juice that  Algorithm so that there was a lot of engagement on a certain  Article which then would make it more likely to appear in someone's newsfeed  And so there's an entire shadow industry of folks that have figured out how these platforms work and they know  That this is a main vector of attack  That has serious implications, especially for our democracy  and I've been thinking a lot about the role of information in a democracy and  It's not just that the information should be accurate, but it's also about the distribution of that information and who  controls those access points and and how  information is spread and in what proportions and if you can manipulate these algorithms by  making up a fake network  and  Carrying out a disinformation campaign then that that it's it's not just a design flaw  I mean, it's something that we see governments now putting  Major money and effort into into doing right ahead of elections. Is there a history of gaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  networks  That's really what's happened is that people figure out how to game  Expertise had a game. I mean it I remember it started with my friend Kevin Rose when he started dig  Which was a great idea would let people vote on which news stories are important news stories  But it didn't take long for  Others to figure out how to game it  so that their stories would go up on top and and I  Everything we've just described sounds to me like people have figured out how to game the system  It is unintended consequences. Well, it's an intended consequence of the people were gaming  For the people who wish it weren't happening it's on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Didn't hire Joan Donovan years ago to say guys this could go wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask you many years ago was this many years ago Jeff. He's the he's the expert in that  What where is this a his I wonder if there's a history of is this like a human?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure, every system that can be gamed will be will be gamed  It was only I read this this week only because of the line of type do we get the Daily Mail?  Because there wasn't enough type to be made before right?  So when you get that point then that's that's a that's a new entry point for a virus  So and the problem with the internet was we were too trusting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but but that was the basic problem. So is that really is that the solution? Just don't trust anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't hire Joan Donovan to warn you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But one of the things that  the research that I'm doing now around meme wars and our book starts with  Occupy and I had always heard the lore about  Occupy really being started as this like, you know rag tag group of  anarcho punks and leftists and liberals and all kinds of folks show up to Zuccotti Park and they're mad about  Inequalities and they've seen what happened in Spain recently where people occupied the squares and they were just gonna have this  Occupation and it was gonna happen and we'll see what goes on  But actually when you dig into it, it was a hoax that really got occupy off the ground  They tweeted out based upon a made-up rumor that someone had made the occupy social media  Administrators believe that Radiohead was gonna play at 4 p.m  But that afternoon and Radiohead was in New York to play like at Madison Square Garden or something  And so  Radiohead is then forced to respond and they put out on Facebook saying hey, we support these protesters  But we are absolutely not playing in the park at 4 and then of course all these Radiohead fans are like, of course  They would lie to us  And that's really what kick starts the movements in the  Conversation and the and people start those kinds of people that were, you know  Millennials interested in the the politics and the spectacle and then we're like, yeah that you know  Student loans are really dragging me down. Maybe I should come back, right?  And so then you start to see occupy ripple in other  Areas and you see lots of other occupations and and then of course, there's police brutality which then becomes a very  Motivating force for people to say okay  I'm not gonna sit by and watch these people get pepper sprayed  We're gonna do an occupy in my town as well  And so it just starts to take on a life of its own  So but when I was looking at the history of this I started I watched this documentary called occupy unmasked  Now if I tell you who made it I you know, I didn't even realize it at the time  But it was Steve Bannon and and oh my god, and they were students of occupy  Figured out is that you can hoax using social media and you can game these  Algorithms and that it wasn't just about putting out your blog and getting zero comments  but that social media contained something special and  different and  The networks themselves were really important to game  And if we even think back before we called it social media, we called it social networking  Social media is just what happens when you need to make money  You know like they're like well, we got to put some kind of content here. And so  So it's really important that we think historically but maybe we don't always have to go back as far as  You know the the reformation but it does help but this is why I think hoaxing the media  Is such an important aspect of what's going on here, which is why and Jeff knows this I've spent the last several years really  I was just gonna say in the in the muck  With journalists really trying to figure out what what is the new journalism we need as well  That aren't susceptible to this kind of of hoaxing when it looks like a crowd is up to something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels to me like there are two kinds of people there are people who are trusting and honest  and then there are people who are willing to take any system and  Game it to their advantage. And of course it takes advantage of the people who are trusting who say well  I read it. It must be true  true  And maybe is that the biggest lesson that people should learn is a certain amount of cynicism to understand  That no matter what the system is there's somebody out there who's aiming to game it to their advantage

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that and I think this is this goes this goes back to the history of computer programming and hacking  You know, this is something that a Dana Boyd talks a lot about but this kind of hacker mindset  Which is this thing this designer this person puts this software into the world and they think it works this way, right?  We can show that it works differently  Now what's you very unique about social media is for a long time like during occupy you actually did need a crowd  To move the algorithms you needed a bunch of people that were coordinated  Or at least somehow  Interacting with the system in the same way so that they were all like able to use the same key words  That practice just like a game of basketball  Basketball people practiced it over time and now they're they're just like people are a lot better at it and  And then there's also software marketers figured out early on that, you know, if I could have one account  I could have ten thousand accounts. And so, you know early botnets and  Marketing software was the tool of the trade for some of these media manipulators and disinformers around 2016  Of course  The platform companies have become hip to that now  But there is something about the way tech is built and how it's all brick-a-lodge and you know  People can build these different components and make things do different stuff  But there's really no great  You know test for scale right it just you kind of have to deploy the technology to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Important point so you can't you can't predict you're saying you have to you have to yeah, no you can't predict too late  That's really really interesting  Can I take a little break?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold that thought professor Donovan  Joan Donovan is here. It's great to have  Your intelligence on this because it's such a challenging topic for all of us  and it's one of the topics we did I asked to have you on because we we are  Constantly going around and around and around about this stuff and I thought well, maybe Joan can help us cut the Gordian knot  Joan is of course the research director. I want to get the whole title in here because we can't get it on the lower third  It's too long  research director at Harvard Kennedy's  school  Shorenstein go ahead. Why don't you tell me what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Shorenstein Center on media politics and public policy  It's a bit of a tongue-twister and you and you get to teach to what what classes do you teach? I'm very curious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd love to I teach media manipulation and disinformation

So  Basically bad  Joan also edits meme war weekly on medium from the wilds of the internet, which is I think fantastic  Just really and it's it's it's not just a bunch of memes for no good reason. It's fascinating  It's a you know what you want a little Harvard education  Meme war weekly Jeff Jarvis is also here his son Jake helping him out  Goodness rescued me  And it's great to have you buzz machine calm. I didn't do the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He tweeted it or something. I saw the picture to three very nice kitchen. Very nice. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I should say that I am also very thankful for  Craig's, you know contribution to the research that we do  I don't think we would have survived the pandemic over the Schoenstein Center without  There's true so many  Quietly rescue. Yeah, not just us. There's a lot of us out there that benefit from him. I really love his networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really fantastic. Craig Craig has a

Transcript:  Udacity and in fact that the next room is my son Jake who's buffing up his skills right now in  Submitting and security nice Udacity you're kidding. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there you go  There you have positive unsolicited  Recommendation good for Jake. He's a smart guy. He was he was writing Facebook apps in high school  very smart guy  Yep, so this is related to this because it looks like the Biden administration  This is I think of all the things Congress and the president agree on  They agree on it for different reasons. But one of the only things they agree on is big techs got to be taken down a notch  Today Linda con Lena con who is the youngest ever  FTC come a chair  She she got approved by the Senate. I don't think the Senate's had a 69 to 28 vote on anything yet  It was a cross party lines, but obviously some people broke with the party  32 years old that she was sworn in yesterday making her the youngest chair in the FTC's  history  But one of the reasons the Senate could agree she's highly critical of  Big-tech filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook last year  You know, this is this is a clear shot  Across the bow the FTC is going to be taking a big tech very seriously  She will probably be a regulator when it comes to Amazon Facebook Google and Apple  She told the Senate Committee during her hearings in April that she was worried about the way tech companies could use their power to dominate new  markets  Anyway  That's that's this is what scares me a little bit  Because while it's hard to think of how you solve the problem  Of amplification on Facebook and Twitter and social media. It's also clear that that the government wants  For very different reasons would like to like to spank these guys big-time  This what did do you think government has a role Joan in in in solving these problems? I know you think librarians do how about government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I say it out loud Jeff is literally gonna drive to my house and set it on fire  Oh, no, I will tread lightly here  Cats  Very good  Yeah, so I do and  and I say that with a smirk in the sense that  I think there's things that  Government could encourage and so there's a few things that I think we actually need some rules about like  harassment and incitements  Online where we're kind of in this moment right now where we're trying to learn about  January 6 we're trying to understand the degree to which what happened online  Was a big motivator that you know really encouraged and incited  massive coordinated violence  Which you know was about overthrowing the government and so that's one thing and then we also have a  serious problem with harassment, especially if  of journalists who if you are a  journalist that covers women's rights for instance  Especially in the healthcare realm you have a whole squad of trolls that will spend  The every waking hour trying to get you to shut your account down  Myself included, you know when I talk about white supremacy online. There's a bunch of  White  Identitarian white supremacist white nationalists, whatever you want to call them that will attack me and it doesn't stop at  I'm gonna send her some gross pictures. It really it really gets  creepy when they're posting your  Address or they're trying to dig and find information about you when they're doxxing you and so  there's there's things that we need some pretty clear rules about and  That I think government can help with that at least in figuring out like where the bright lines are the difficult thing  I think is that  Social media has been built in a certain way. We're used to it  any kind of  Policy that's going to be  Coming out of government's gonna be almost impossible to implement because we don't have any transparency or  rules about  What it means to do oversight of social media platforms  But there's some really great research and attention to this by Spencer Overton to suggest that  There are serious civil rights implications for the way that advertising online is designed  Especially when it comes to the way in which you're allowed to select audiences on social media  Facebook in particular  Where if it comes down to it and you're not shown specific kinds of ads that have to do with housing jobs and and  credit or or finance finance financial  Opportunities then those are actually considered civil rights violations. So I think we do need some laws that open up transparency around that  And then you know to get back to this this internet that we want  I do think the government could also encourage like they did with radio a kind of public interest obligation that wouldn't  ensure that when platform companies are serving information to let's say, you know  Ten million people. Let's let's make it a pretty high bar there  When you have ten million users that every once in a while you got to sprinkle in  information about the weather local news  No council meetings  Just because that's what we expect of of radio and and the pandemic really taught me a lot about that and about the need for  timely accurate local knowledge to be circulated on these platforms because nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's gonna do it FCC regulates that because the spectrum that's used by broadcasters is public property  But I think you're right. I think it's high time we realize the internet is public property

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they see I was fine. There's no scarcity. There's a scarcity of spectrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, there's no scarcity of bits, but I think you could say that there's a public interest in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In something like that. Yes, but but I'm not sure that's the right way to attack. I mean, Joe Joe Jones cats are safe  Believe me, they're safe  Was in the Wizard of Oz  The  The transatlantic high-level working group a content moderation freedom of expression organized by Susan Ness that Joan knows because she spoke with us  Basically endorses that view and it comes in two parts, right?  First we need the data to have the research to know what the impact is to design the inner the interventions  Appropriate to what's actually going on rather than what's being assumed which is too often the case  And the second part of that is  That the companies need to make I this is my word a covenant with the public to which they are held to account  And rather than the government saying you should all do this  It's not appropriate to different platforms in different ways, but they should have and I argued with this with the platform directly  I've said that they need constitutions. They need covenants. They need some statement that says why are we here?  Why is the world better with us? What do you hold us to account for then?  federal Trade Commission  Structure comes right into place because the Federal Trade Commission doesn't tell you exactly how to make this phone  But if you lie about this phone and say that it can cure cancer  Then they're gonna come after you if you lie and say it's 5g where there's no such thing as 5g  They're gonna come after you because you didn't hold up to the standard that you set for yourself  You understand that that's not what we're gonna get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the the Republicans are upset because President Trump was banned and so that's what they're going down  The concert anti-conservative bias of these and David Cicilline of the House Antitrust Committee  Says Apple should not be allowed to preload its apps on the iPhone that and so that's really that's  unfortunately, that's the level of  That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  being proposed now to forbid all M&A which is  Just yeah, that doesn't make sense or break them up for the sake of breaking them up. What does that actually accomplish?  What's the goal? What are we trying to design here? There's no design in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the break them up world  You know, I think from from my experience when you think about you know, Glass-Steagall for instance  Which was a law in the 30s where you broke up banks so that investment banking and people's everyday money were separate and  I think there is a way to  In a need for us to really look at the tech stack when it comes to  the internet and start to devise very  important  conflicts of interest so that we understand that if you're in data harvesting and in advertising  You can really participate in price fixing right? And so we don't want that  We don't want companies to be able to do price fixing and but because we lack any kind of oversight  You know and I've heard people  Flout, you know an internet protection agency or some kind of agency that would help us devise these rules  like there's something you know about the business model here that's that is  Really hard to get at especially when you look at internet advertising and you realize  What a tangled mess it is and how much fraud there is and how much money is lost every year  And so I think it doesn't necessarily address the disinformation problem, but I do think there are other problems  Related to money market share and data capture  That we do need to interrogate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very seriously. I don't think anybody who disagrees that Glass-Steagall should be reinstated  of course, it was thrown out in 1999 under the Clinton administration and  Lo and behold nine years later  banks that had invested in  Crappy real estate  almost collapsed  However notice we don't really have it so I  I don't know. I despair. Maybe I shouldn't I feel like a lot of what you're proposing was great and is nuanced  Beyond the ability of our car of the leaders. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I learn I listen I learn from from you know that you know  You know who's the smartest people in government are these state legislative directors and the people that are you know?  They're really just on it the people who scare me the most in government though are the federal elections folks that know all the rules  about what you can and can't say and how you know how  Warm the polling place needs to be and how far away your dog needs to be from the entrance  those people scare me, but I really I learn a lot from state legislative directors because  They're the ones that have to write the bills and figure out how they would be implemented and narrow cast them in ways  But I'll tell you you know like the last Senate hearing that I was on was really about looking at  The way in which people become  They were using a framework of addicted to the internet or they become addicted to the technology and social media  And I think that that is something we cannot legislate. I don't know there's any  There there right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know it's like that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well  Actually, it's funny you should say I got shut down by  Representative Kennedy who just was like vote for my bill. I was like I don't vote on bills like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you change the orbit of the either the earth or the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you do that I will read your bill  Main point that I really wanted to get across in that Senate hearing was that  Disinformation is now a feature of our political environment when I say disinformation  I'm saying something very specific about the actors behavior content in design of the social media ecosystem and  It's because my team you know when we write up our research, which it's all open access on media manipulation org  We just see patterns what we talk about our patterns. We look at you know, where the  technical vulnerabilities are where the social vulnerabilities are and and we just write them up and I  Don't want to do this forever  I don't want to be able to write about the same thing over and over even with the journalists on this beat  They were like we are so tired of writing the same story that a bunch of people that shouldn't be influencing  x y & z social issue  Manipulated social media and now they're the talk of the town and so  you know, there's a whole like  way in which we can learn from this field, but by and large  Government has got to act as a pressure lever on to get these technocompanies to build their their  technologies differently and to safeguard them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But one of my favorite stories that we can and I can make it up because it's in German  And I actually put it on the rundown is that no great. Thanks a lot  Germany  Worked with Google to put up health information, right and we think oh, that's a good thing  But the media regulator said no, no, no, you're hurting the newspapers. You can't do that. Oh, man  So they got it taken down. So all of our discussion earlier about about about  Expertise and valuable information and serving people in the public interest and here was an effort to do it  But the economic back to Ants point the money came in serving people in the interest of profit  Right in there in league with government the media regulator sided with media against the public

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's too bad, but the other Joan Joan I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So presumes this I think I think one of the most important things  Things that she's I'm sure quite tired of banging this drum  But it's the most important drum of all is that we can't get enough data from the platform  So that the Joan Donovan's of their precious few of them can research and tell us what actually goes on  You know, I've talked about the book our filter bubbles real by Axel Bruns on this show before where we presume something  We then you know  Beat the walls and say we must change this this is horrible  Without the data and without the research that enables us to know what's actually truly happening and  And we need to have more discussion about what do we actually know?  What do we need to know and how do we get the data to know it and that's where I trust  Joan and and and and the people she trusts in turn that network of researchers. That's the essence of  Understanding what we need to do about the Internet

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a little break from this powerful  Conversation great to have Joan Donovan  Join join us Stacey. You'll be back. I think next week  She's a research director at Harvard Kennedy School and an expert on disinformation and media  Jeff Jarvis  Who is of course sank Frank Sinatra called him a bum  He's a female former to me guy and the director of the townite Center for entrepreneurial journalism at CUNY's Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism  CUNY's Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism at Pruitt from hands-on photography  I think we should now Burke Burke's filling in for John. So I want to give you plenty of time  I think we should play the drums and  announce that it's time for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bravo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Golf claps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we do this every episode Joan just some new stuff from Google and actually it's a very interesting  Change log this week because Google has decided to let Google workspace  Which is their form, you know used to be G suite  It's their name for their business paid business product now should be open to everyone and they're gonna start with Google chat  This is a big deal  We talked about it on Windows weekly even because it's a shot across the bow for Microsoft and Microsoft's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mean for free I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what this means. I think you had to have a business didn't you?  I don't know exactly how it's different officially available to everyone. I  Didn't understand that at all. Yeah availability to anybody who has a Google account  I  guess  You know, that's a good question. Yeah  I thought it was available all the time as long as you not Google Docs, but workspace which is different workspace includes and you do have to pay  I don't know workspace used to be known as ten bucks a month  So they have announced so there's a new Google. No, it's not free. It's launching a new tier called Google workspace  Individual ten dollars a month. Oh, okay. You don't I guess the difference is you don't have to set up a domain like we use  workspace that twit TV, right and  Because it's a business that we pay per seat now. You can just use your regular, you know, Jeff Jarvis at gmail.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, my head's exploding Leo my head's exploding because the only reason I'm on workspace is because I use my own address and  Because I'm there. It's all the things I scream about in this show. Yes the other week  Congratulations, so stay away people stay away. I know you but wait a minute, but you use workspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under your a different what address you don't use your regular gmail address for that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I use my my my domain my blog domain. Yeah, that's the only that's why that's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you can do it under your gmail address

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no now it says you don't need to have the address to get all these features that you without requiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You set up your own domain or a custom email address. That's right. You can be screwed at your own address

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, that's what I'm saying. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I guess that is a sound bite for the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the announcement they also which is I think interesting are gonna finally offer a progressive web app for Google workspace in September  You're gonna like this on your Chromebook. It's  You can have these now the gmail and the docs and all that will look like an actual desktop app  Yes, just not just top tabs in a browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We see that that too. I'm so happy in my browser land in the nice aisle of browser  But I don't care about these apps you discuss

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are these apps of which you speak Google is adding end-to-end encryption to its messages  If of course, that's the RCS platform. Google is now saying is the official messaging platform  You'll also get suggestions for emoji mashups off to ask Jim what that is  And there's some other features, but they end to end encryption is Oh Android earthquake alerts coming to more countries  If you're in this list of countries, I guess you have earthquakes Turkey the Philippines Kazakhstan the Kyrgyz Republic Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan all the stands are getting it you get you now can  Can have starred messages if you get sent a text with important info you can favorite it  Which will put it in a category called starred so you can find it faster and the emoji kitchen is gonna  Let you mash up your emojis  I don't know how that works, but I guess did you know that I invented an emoji

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What there were a couple of us I?  Well funny you should ask the beaver emoji  Yes, I am a nice beaver  Yeah, nice beaver  I just got it stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait a minute. What are you a fan of the beaver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well what happened was and Jeff knows Jenny ate very well, so there's a  culture maker, you know and  We were having dinner and she was talking about being on the emoji standards council, and I just was like wait  How do you do it?  And she was just like there's an application and you just got to pick something  This was the hard part is you got to find something that doesn't have an emoji  Means the same thing in different places that is if people saw it. They'd know what it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beavers are the same all over the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, but it can't be duplicative of anything else out there  And so, you know there was some question as to whether they needed a beaver if there's already an otter and I said  Yes, there's a big difference. Yeah what to do here. And so we wrote up the  Application and we submitted it and it was it was quite a fun experience me and my spouse  Teamed up on it and it was just fun.

There's a lot of  Friviage in that URL you might miss the fact that it's you know, wikipedia.hacker.org  Yeah, but what didn't you two like about it? Well, I like the idea security experts and end users alike complained about it  You know, I guess it's because of what we're used to  Simply hating Chrome's new URL bar that hides a full URL  I used to use it to orient myself on the site. That's true  Yeah, now I feel like I'm on the home page all the time  If you have a directory tree that makes sense  Yeah, so it's now it's gone from all versions of the Chrome browser.

Transcript:  Good news and bad news. The good news is the New York State Senate has passed an electronics right to repair legislation  The bad news is it's highly unlikely to pass the assembly  So which is ironic, you know right to repair doesn't work in the assembly get it  51 senators voting for only 12 against  But they they have to the New York State Legislative Session ends tomorrow  So they have to work first. It'd be the first of its kind in the United States the digital fair repair act  It's very simple  It makes it requires OEMs like Apple or John Deere to make available for purposes of diagnosis maintenance or repair to any  independent repair provider or to the owner of digital electronic equipment  Manufactured by our on behalf of or sold by the OEM on fair and reasonable terms  documentation parts and tools  Inclusive of any updates to information or embedded software. That's pretty straightforward  Gotta do it gotta get past the assembly  It's it's it's nip and tuck right now  Could gonna be close, but we'll watch that right because we think it's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Podcasts a research story here. They'll be interesting. Oh, let's do that. Yes, please pick something because I want to make sure John

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taking advantage of Joan this week. It was a hell. No, I can't find

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another is line 61 61. I love that line. That's one of my favorite lines using Facebook  Actually reduces ethnic tension. Of course, Jeff would find this  People fret about online  But offline echo chambers can be just as strong or stronger  The study is published by the National Academy of Sciences. Okay, that's respectable  It's kind of interesting was conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July  We have issues. Well, it was during their week of public remembrance for the genocide of Bosniak Muslims that occurred in the 90s  Bosniak Serbian who are largely Slavic and largely Eastern Orthodox in Croatian who are largely Roman Catholic  participants agreed not to use Facebook  Which accounts for roughly 99% of the social media market in the country  They you know after the week was over  researchers surveyed participants about their attitudes towards those other guys and  Compared it with a control group that remained active on Facebook during the period  The offline group had a greater dislike of other ethnicities than the group that remained online  It's hard  This is interesting. I mean it is hard to measure and the other thing is is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Politics are so different in different places, you know when it comes to how people perceive each other and what really?  Are the big bright lines, you know in the especially in the US of course, like we're in the midst of some  Very big, you know back and forth about  Education and race and so it's like, you know, there's a lot of other in going on and a lot of demonization  I mean like look at QAnon. They literally think  Democrats are demons. Yeah  That's why we drink baby's blood  Well, it does  Bodyguards are demons. Yeah  So that's why we drink baby's blood  Well, it does  do a body good  stop it  I could have had a V8

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just to clarify  I thought you looked particularly vital today, Joe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, oh my goodness  But yeah, that's what's interesting here is that I don't know if the political polarization holds in other countries  and that's just me kind of showing my  Edges here, which is I don't know enough about the social media  I'm glad they picked a place where they've actually had a genocide over that because at least you know  There used to be some animosity a few years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The results they say were most pronounced when participants lived in homogeneous neighborhoods where there was just one ethnicity  Facebook was essentially the only place these people were likely to encounter someone who belonged to a different ethnicity  That kind of makes sense  But I think it's interesting that the social media is a place where you can see the difference  That's what our hope was for the internet that would you know, bring people together that it's hard to hate somebody when you know them  Well, I mean that's you know, there was a I mean there was a horrible hope study about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know when you think back to what made  LGBT issues prime for a very revolutionary change in marriage law  Were that people had gay family members and gay colleagues and that it had become normal to know gay people and it wasn't such a scary proposition  There was a hoax study that was done where this grad student lied about all his data  But it's there's other studies out there, but if people were to look up, you know  The research on this they were definitely run into this scam study  Unfortunately, because they really over exaggerated what it means to know the know someone else  But that's that's from my own background  You know when it comes to studies, it's like, you know, you always remember the anomaly that doesn't prove the rule  I did I did find it interesting because I grew up in an era where people weren't even out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I think that's the reason why I think it's interesting that there's a lot of people who are not even out  Right. And and then there was a stonewall and people started to say, you know, we're here. We're queer  You know, it's good and because because we've always been surrounded by gay people  But the problem was you didn't know that uncle John and his long pal that they've been living together for years  We're actually married basically and you but once you kind of started to know that I think you're right  I think that did change

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The courage of people who but it took coming out of the closets to in which they were coming out  I think so and and it was that courage that made it happen. That's what I think but there's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think also de medicalization right the idea that it's not  Some kind of medical disorder really played another important role here, which is to say that  You could be gay and not be somehow, you know, considered mentally ill  And so I think that the activists that really pushed for that, you know, will forever be indebted to  But I do think that there's you know, when it comes to fear of the other  The Internet is so potent when it comes to really like trafficking and stereotypes  Right. Like with the loss of nuance is sort of one of the things that social media has wrought  And and there's also something on social media that I you know, someone should study this but that kind of moves  The fringe into the mainstream. So things that 10 years ago would have taken a lot longer to become part of the  Conversation are so now and I worry, you know, when people start doing the other ring around trans people right now  In particular because you know the the public discourse is about trans athletes  But within trans communities, the fight is really about access to medical care access to job protections and access to the same  Economic opportunities as other people. So it's it's a civil rights struggle from the perspective of trans people  But the national discourse is about these culture war issues  And so it's really, you know, it's a it's a hard thing because the social media shapes so much about our political discourse  And then if you don't get a fair representation of the other, you are inclined to fear them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's yeah, that's right. So it's not it's not it's not one thing or the other. There are definitely negatives as well  I think that's a good example of how one side in this is smart enough to game the situation  To change the dialogue and to say well, it's really about somebody putting on a wig and competing in women's sports  It has which it has nothing to do with  But by by successfully changing the the conversation to that  You you really shut down the conversation about really the real very much real issues  I think entertainment and there are cynical people on the right who do that all the time  They're very good at manipulating that  They're gaming it  You know, I think I often think that the phrase climate change is a huge mistake  If you ask somebody if they're in favor of pollution, they go no, I hate pollution  But but if you call pollution climate change, it's a lot easier. Right?  The reframing is very powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Acid rain acid rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, let's stop that  Climate change

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Prince song now acid rain

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't play it. You know, it'll get you banned. Right. But the lyrics in that in that  Cut start off very politically, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that which what's the first cut that they released? What's the name of it? Well, it's on that story. I think  Yeah  Welcome to America. I think it's a America's name of the album. One of the one of the songs includes  Is called Running Game son of a slave master  Born to die and one day we will all be free very interesting on the title track Prince Prince sings distracted by the features of the iPhone  Got an application to fix your situation.

Transcript:  Good. I will be listening to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's back during the heyday of Blackberry in 2011  The number one ranked app was the flashlight app. Like you were like my phone can be a flashlight  Can be a flashlight  You know Facebook and Twitter were not in the top I don't even think they were in the top 10 at that probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talk a lot about NFTs now  The founder of the World Wide Web is creating an NFT Tim Berners-Lee is going to auction off the source code  For the World Wide Web the first source code he wrote for the World Wide Web  It includes original time stamped files containing the source code and animated visualization of the code a letter written by TBL on the code  And its creation and a digital poster of the full code all digitally signed by Tim Berners-Lee and you know  Normally I would say oh this is ridiculous  But I think TBL deserves he's never been able to in any way  Make the invention of the web make any money on it so  Most people have no idea who he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He deserves it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what he's not trying to make a killing they say the proceeds of the auction will benefit initiatives that he and his wife support  And and it will be starting bid will be a mere thousand dollars so they're not trying to cash in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you know how these NFT things work?  I haven't like I've tried to figure it out. I've gone down the rabbit hole on it. It seems pretty complicated  It's very complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Celebrities know how to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once you have it minted that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Ant Bruin has an NFT  So tell us  You do you have one out there if you have one out there that's that's it  It's just like putting up art anywhere else  But the problem is just  Can you help me figure out how to how to sell the beaver emoji just to make it look like a real one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beaver emoji just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should definitely NFT  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well somebody help me  I don't know what I'm doing over here  I'll solve your disinformation problem  You started with a piece of art right Ant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A photo  Then you go somewhere to turn it into an NFT right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's correct you turn it you turn it into an NFT  But you have to have a Ethereum in most cases  A crypto wallet with Ethereum because you got to pay for it to be published

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way that's who's making money on NFTs  Are the people who mint them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right but once you have that  It's pretty much just like putting your art up anywhere else digitally  The big problem is just people getting crypto wallets and  Understanding hey I need to create this wallet  And I need to remember the passwords  Write the password down or what have you  But after that yeah it's just like putting up art anywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically there's a URL associated with the NFT  And that is the  By the way not a traditional web URL  I think now they're doing IPFS  So that it kind of persists in case that whatever the site or the address goes down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then the person owns the URL

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes in effect  They own that piece of art from a digital standpoint  Like if you were to post it somewhere else online  Like in a tweet or something like that  You can't do that  Who did you make your NFT with  Mine was with OpenSea

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OpenSea there's OpenSea there's Rarible  There's Mintable  So this is OpenSea  OpenSea.io  The problem right now though

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the gas fees are really really really high  Because crypto is  Sort of down

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a lot of energy yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you set up a wallet  Create your collection

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alright I'll hold off then  It's not because I'm lazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You shouldn't wait too long  Because basically NFTs are like egg salad sitting in the sun  They're not going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah it's going to go bad eventually  It doesn't get more delicious than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  It never gets more delicious than that  First day  Actually speaking of cryptocurrency  Bitcoin is actually getting its first upgrade in four years  They call it Taproot  It will mean greater transaction privacy  And efficiency  And it will unlock the potential for smart contracts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who has the right to update Bitcoin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there used to be a Bitcoin association  Or a Bitcoin  There used to be a group  But basically what you have to do is get the miners to agree  And there have been attempts to create new Bitcoin code  Which have ended up getting forked and ignored  Because the miners have to go along  But apparently the miners have agreed  Okay  We can do this  It really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aren't there unlimited numbers of miners  Including a billion machines in China  Yeah potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bitcoin's makeover has to do with digital signatures  This is from CNBC  The cryptocurrency uses an elliptic curve algorithm  Taproot is going to switch over to something  Known as the Schnorr signatures  Which essentially makes multi-signature transactions unreadable  In other words greater privacy  Your keys won't be exposed on the chain  So this is good for  Good for  Not anonymity exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's complicated  It's complicated  I don't understand it at all  It all is  It's all complicated anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not for you and me  It's for the youngs  Ask Jake  Right  Twitter  I think this might be the single best  Suggestion Twitter has made to get rid of abuse  I'm curious what Joan thinks of it  The unmention  Have you heard about this yet Joan  This is  They're trying this right now  So when you're getting harassed on Twitter  People will use your handle  In the harassment right  If you can say  In response to that tweet  Take me out  It kind of defangs it  They have to just put your name  Not your handle  Not your Twitter  Handle

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean it definitely would  Get rid of the meme RIP my mentions  Which is like when somebody starts  Having a conversation in your  Underneath one of a thread where you're mentioned in  And there had become this  These very almost like chain mail  Type threads where you would be within  Sometimes it's colleagues and it's great  Other times you're just in this mismatch of people  And you don't even know what the conversation is really  But you're in there  But add Paustin Jones in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the problem is you can't avoid it  It's flooding your Twitter  I don't understand  There's no way to undo  I've done the mute conversation a gazillion times

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I've gotten  Poured into these little things  And when I do that mute conversation  I don't hear anymore from it  My notifications go back to normal  Is that something most people can't seem to do anymore  This goes  You can do that  But I think it might also affect search

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This to me feels like it would also mean that  If someone were to look up your name  You would have unlinked your name in the metadata  From that  Okay  Which could be good if like the most  If there's another Aunt Pruitt who  Is a serial killer  You might want to be able to unmention here and there  Take your name out of it  Completely  You'd be like wrong Aunt Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One time I'm happy to have a blue check now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter and this is another one I think might work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, none of this is official

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just trying  They're early concepts  Twitter says  And they're asking for users feedback  They're also considering adding settings  Which would let you add a new name  They're also considering adding settings  Which would let users restrict certain accounts  From mentioning them entirely  So if you're getting harassed by a particular troll  You could just say hey you can't use my name  And they won't be able to mention you anymore  Which I think is a pretty good idea  Yeah, that's pretty cool  Yeah, why should somebody be able to at mention me  Yeah  Twitter says it's looking  Wait, wait, wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stay there for a second  Because it's this discussion I had long ago  With somebody who used to be at Google at the time  Who argued that email was ruined  We had this discussion around Google Plus  Email was ruined when it became sender control  Rather than recipient controlled  Yes  Right  And so what we're saying there basically  Is that makes tweets in that form recipient controlled  A little more  Yes  I don't want to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to be there  That's very interesting  You can in fact turn on what TechCrunch calls  A peace and quiet mode  Where you can  They're looking at this  A switch that could be flipped  That says no one can at mention me  For a period of one day, three days or seven days  So if you are really getting mobbed  Which is not at all unusual  You can just say  Hey, no one can mention me  I think all of this is smart  Twitter is finally starting to look at  The actual mechanism of abuse on Twitter  You know  That's Twitter's answer to all this stuff  Is well just mute them  Just ignore them  Just ignore them  Yeah, but everybody else is seeing  You know that just makes my life a little easier  It doesn't solve the problem  So I think this is  These are all good things  I hope Twitter sounds like it  I guess I'm guilty of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I'm one that says just mute them  But that doesn't really solve the root cause  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more of a problem for people like Joan  People in the public eye  Where you've got a mob going after you  Ignoring the mob doesn't mean the mob goes away  Right  Right  And other people are seeing this  So  I think Twitter is finally kind of taking abuse  A little bit more seriously  I don't feel like they've really taken it seriously  Until the last say six months  So  Good  Yeah  I'll give you feedback  Do it  Do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do it  Do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's find out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon says  You know the problem with fake reviews  You know who's doing that  Social media  Because apparently fake reviews are solicited on social media platforms  It's a big problem on Amazon  These fake reviews  They are  Facebook has been repeatedly  Amazon did not name anybody  But Facebook has been repeatedly criticized  For not clamping down  It's another form of what is it inauthentic  What is that phrase that they use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh they use the phrase coordinated inauthentic behavior  But it's  I mean it's as authentic as you know  As everything else  You know  The one thing that's interesting about it is  Is how you know  Amazon doesn't allow you to coordinate  Or talk to other people  Except for maybe in comments  But here over on Facebook  There are entire groups  Where you can get free products  You can  You can sign up to  You know  Essentially  It's a different kind of advertising  Right  It's dark  Dark market advertising  Where  You know if you're going to buy  A  Let's say you want to buy a new  Broom and dust pant  You know  They're all kind of the same  But are you going to buy the one  That has a thousand five star reviews  Yes  Or the one who has eight reviews  Because who reviews a broom and dust pan  Right  And so  They give away free products  And in exchange  They ask for a review  Sometimes they'll give away actual cash  And so there's a whole market for this  There's a whole genre  Of manipulation around Amazon  And you know we've also seen it around  You know especially around books  And things like that  Where  You know  It's just kind of hard to get noticed  And so if you have a lot of reviews  You get  Top  Or higher billing  Which is why I think  You know maybe Amazon should also reveal  How many of a certain product have been sold  Might be a better measure of  Quality  Than  Than the reviews  They definitely have that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they tend to put out beside the reviews  A verified purchase  I think that's how they say it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah that was their first order of trying to figure that out  But  We've known about this for  Years  It's just because it doesn't really have  You know  I mean maybe there's  You know financial implications of it  But because it doesn't have broad  You know societal implications  We don't really tend to cover it  As a field  As much as probably we should  But it is a form of  Of algorithmic manipulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every time I see  These  Interesting DMs or  Emails  I tend to think about our producer and co-host  Mr.  Jason Howell  And Micah Sargent  Because if I'm getting a ton of them  I can only imagine  The amount of  Pitches that they're getting  To say hey can you go give me a review  And check out this  Toaster  We got offered

Transcript:  You can even put on there  That's fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good grief man  No it's Auntie Bev  And she just basically gives you a breakdown  Of a word of the day that's being misused  I believe she's got a different handle  Your time  Your shine  Your time, your shine  And it's Bev Speaks  And she's just such a nice little lady  And she's grown  She's got a gazillion followers  And I really enjoy seeing some of the words that she shares  Stuff like axe and ask  Because people screw that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't ever say Eenie Meenie Minie Moe  Okay I've learned that lesson  Next what else you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next is a series I'm watching on Netflix  Lupin I believe is how you say it in French  Based on a book  I believe it's Lupin  Lupin  But it's been a pretty cool series  The actor, never heard of him  And it's all in French  So you need to turn on your subtitles  But it's really really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will watch this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or get Pimsleur on Audible and learn French  This is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And guess what time of year it is  And lastly I want to give a shout out and recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For June 19th  Also known as Juneteenth  Again this is something that's  The more I think about it  It sort of bugs me more and more  Because this is something that I personally  As a black man  Didn't know anything about until I was an adult  This wasn't taught in schools where I grew up in the south  It's just a bit of an ather thought  But I want to again just bring more recognition to this holiday  Which may now end up potentially being a federal holiday  Because a center with his name Ron Johnson  Ron Johnson is blocking it for a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now he's back down

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we may now have this  As a federal holiday  I think we will  The senate passed it unanimously on Tuesday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the house passed it today  Which would make June 19th  Was Johnson off that day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He finally gave up for some reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He had other fish to fry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he wanted to give a group a tour of the capital building  As a matter of fact  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the house voted yes  So I think all that's left is the president's signature  And it will be at June  It will be called Juneteenth National Independence Day  It commemorates not the end of slavery  Because the Emancipation Proclamation  Proclamation was a couple years earlier  But the final black people in America finding out about it  On June 19th

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In Texas, Galveston  Yeah  Had no idea that they were free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't know  It's amazing  Let me see if I can find this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which goes to your point earlier  That was in Brattle Books today in Boston  A book I should have actually bought  Went through how long it took for the Declaration of Independence  To be printed across the country  And of course there was something else going on here  People trying to keep enslaved people from knowing they were free  But it took time for knowledge to pass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this would be a good time for Jeff to give us a number  Certainly  Certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think Mackenzie Scott  Has given away another 2.7 billion dollars in grants  And what I quite liked about her theme this time  286 teams empowering voices the world needs to hear  I rant on all the time that mass media run by people who look like me  Old white men  Too often do not value the voices and stories  And viewpoints and perspectives  Of people who do not share our experience in the mass  And so for me the reason I defend the internet all the time is because  It doesn't give voice to people  People have always had their voices  But it gives the opportunity for voices who previously were not heard  Through the gatekeepers to be heard  And so she has 286 teams that are doing amazing work here  Links to every one of them  And salute to Mackenzie Scott

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a huge amount of money to give away  2.7 billion dollars  Billion  Wow  So we have a couple of people who are going to be the next Jeff Bezos  Who's flaunting his wealth by going into space  Space yacht  In a battle to see who can be first with Virgin's Richard Branson  Apparently there is somebody in the chat room was saying there's a petition  To let Jeff Bezos go into space but don't let him back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like 11,000 signatures  There's a lot of signatures on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then put Senator Johnson in the other seat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's hysterical  2.7 billion  Really nice  Joan I've given you all the time I can  Time for your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My pick of the week  I just got this book  If Then by Jill Lepore  How the Simu-matics Corporation Invented the Future  I haven't read it yet  It's really interesting  It's really about the genesis of early data science  I read a sample chapter online and I'm not going to lie  It was very compelling  But the idea here is looking at the early development of artificial intelligence  And what election companies were excited about in terms of gathering data  And how to deploy it  I'm really looking forward to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what Simu-matics did?  They were a vote counting machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were trying to predict people's what kind of behaviors would lead to what kind of voting outcomes  Voter data analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a very good writer  I read her in the New Yorker all the time  I'm going to add this to my audio book list

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Then

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Selling books  Selling the books

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How the Simu-matics Corporation Invented the Future  Jill Lepore  L-e-p-o-r  Yeah, no relation  No relation  I don't know her

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no  So yeah, that's my big one  I'm excited to read this book  And then I don't really have anything else I've been doing or seeing or watching  I've been in a bit of a deep dark well of writing trying to get this book done for July 1st  Wait a minute, tell us this, what's this book you're writing?  Well, I'm writing a book with co-authors Brian Friedberg  Who's sort of been with me for the last several years as sort of my meme historian  And Emily Dreyfus who used to be a senior editor at Wired and now is working with us on our team  And we're writing about meme wars  And we're trying to understand how memes became political communication  And so now that quantitatively disinformation has slowed down because Trump isn't on so many platforms  And his blog was a big fail  We have some time to do some other kinds of thinking and writing  And so I've been deep in looking at conspiracy theories and just the memetic cultures online  And what does Shia LaBeouf have to do with anything  It's been fun  A question I ask all the time  Right on inauguration day, funny you should ask  In 2016 he launched this very strange art project called He Will Not Divide Us  And it became one of the worst places on earth to be online and IRL  There were just all of these crazy fights and all of these weird memes  And it was a whole thing  And so I've been living in the last, you know, my time in the past week has been spent in 2016, 2017 really heavily when the meme war heats up  And so it's been fun  It's been fun  It's been interesting to tell the history of the internet through this lens  And I'm really excited for it to be done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's done at the end of the month and then when will we see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hopefully in a year  Can you believe that?  I know, but it's the way of the world  It will not stop being relevant though, I can promise you that  Because it's, you know, just that kind of, that memes are here to stay  And our politics are becoming much more troll-y  And so we're hoping that it helps people see what's happening in this moment differently than the stodgy  It's going to be with Bloomsbury  Oh, very good  Yeah, we wanted to go with an academic press and we couldn't get anybody to agree to full color  And I just, it irked me  Oh, it has to be color, memes are in color  It has to be, yeah, exactly  Seriously?  I mean if you get the Pepe Green wrong, yeah, it's very expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is going to be a coffee table book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we'll see  I kind of want to get some better development around the art so that we're not just  Send in your screenshots

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait  It's going to be a weird one  Yes, so good to have you here  This is such a great subject

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it was fun  When you knocked on the door, I said, please let them in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the medium Me More Weekly has many, it's not the same content as in the book or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's different content but similar themes  We had to put the emergency break on Me More Weekly because it was getting really dark during the pandemic  So we're going to hopefully be spinning things back up again soon  A year of creepy memes  It got, you know, the pandemic, protests, politics, it got super dark times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's a professor at Cal named Dundas who writes about sick joke cycles  And of course this is out of date now, but, you know, 20 or 30 years ago, Alan Dundas  It was his position, I think he was absolutely right, that the sick joke cycles reflected the things that, you know,  the deep psychological things people were worried about  His book was called Cracking Jokes  And here's the book  For instance, during the civil rights movement, elephant jokes were really popular  And his contention is that that represented to the white psyche black people  And they were appearing in your refrigerator and all over it  Then during the abortion crisis, when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land and the big fights over abortion  You saw a lot of dead baby jokes  So it's his opinion  And I think these memes actually are the modern, in my opinion, the modern version of these sick jokes  They reflect the psyche of what's going on  During a very dark period in our time, I can imagine the memes were really, really dark

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It got really traumatizing at points  And so I was like, I couldn't put my team through it  But nevertheless, me, Brian and Emily couldn't resist  And so we're going to be writing, well, we're in the midst of writing that and wrapping that up  But it is, yeah, the humor, you know, things start as a prank  And then they turn into real life in a very serious way  And so we're trying to track that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People aren't necessarily going to be honest and forthright if you ask them  But if you see, if their humor reflects what's really, they're really thinking what's really going on in their mind  And their memes absolutely do that  I live on Reddit, which is meme central  Is that, you think, the best place to see what's going on in the world of memes?  Where do you go to do your research?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, Reddit's a great place to go  Because we're doing it historically, of course, we go all the way back to Tumblr  Tumblr for sure  And just throw the different memetic communities over time  But 4chan is really where memes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where Pepe lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were happening  And then, and you know, and over the years, yeah, Reddit has taken up quite a bit of memetic real estate, I should say  And, you know, Facebook in 2016 became a really hot place to share memes and to work on them with other people  Because I don't think most people understand how collaborative memes are  But it's not the case that, you know, a meme gets out in the world and nothing happens  The thing about them that's really interesting is how quickly people remix them  And if you think very, you know, back to the, I think the only thing people might remember about the inauguration this year was Bernie's mittens  I mean, if you were, I would ask you, you know, what else happens, you might not know  And so, yeah, so that, you know, memes become sticky in a way  And they become very memorable markers of moments  And yeah, and so we're just, we're exploring that and then thinking a bit more in terms of like right-wing politics  And how memes have come to define politics  This is the follow-up of Bernie's mittens

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The second grade teacher who sent him the mittens has now made a deal with the Vermont teddy bear factory to sell Bernie's mittens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, they looked cozy  They were warm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You live in California, you don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I grew up with mittens  I don't understand really why people would wear mittens instead of gloves, but I'm sure you can explain that  That's another show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I will say on a positive note, the thing that we're concluding on, and this goes along with the conversation a little bit earlier about Juneteenth, is we really mark Black Lives Matter as the meme of the decade  It is the most resilient meme going  And it's really hard to pin down, it's really hard to associate with certain kinds of leaders  It's been very, very resilient even in the face of immense attacks  And there was a moment where people were really trying to make All Lives Matter a thing  And it just didn't work because Black Lives Matter was so much more compelling and remixable and stood for so much more  And so, not to blow the ending of the book, but we do look at this meme in particular as something that is very culturally resonant, very important to American politics  But hasn't gone away in the same way that many memes just kind of come and go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting  So you're using the word meme, I always think of memes as the image with the text and stuff like that, the boyfriend looking over his shoulder

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the slogan, the idea is it's a unit of culture  Something that spreads virally  A lot of them are three word phrases, there's something in at least the English language that lends to this  When it comes to a viral slogan
