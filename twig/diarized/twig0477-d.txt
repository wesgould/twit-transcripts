Transcript:  This Week in Google, episode 477.  Recorded Wednesday, October 10th, 2018.  Roadie-matic.  This Week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans.  Introducing rate shield approval.  If you're in the market to buy a home, rate shield approval locks up your rate for up  to 90 days while you're in the market.  It's a real game changer.  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Could he do that?  Could he poke me if he weren't here?  Stacey, he's going to be your  your automaton puncher by proxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need a proxy puncher.  Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com, professor of journalism.  We'll find out why he's here in just a bit.  Also Stacey Higginbotham.  But Stacey's at the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yes, sorry for the glow and the weird sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You sound great.  Which airport are you at and why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm at SeaTac.  I, this week, was at something called the Smart Kitchen Summit.  Are you also house hunting?  I was not house hunting yet.  No, I was just at the Smart Kitchen Summit doing robots in the kitchen, screens in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kitchen, so many things in the kitchen.  I bought something in the kitchen I want to show you.  I thought, finally, I'll have something Stacey doesn't have.  But I don't have it yet.  But I'll show it to you.  What is it?  I'll tell you in a second.  But first, let's introduce Kevin Toffle.  He's also here.  He's co-host on the IoT podcast, but also the MatreD at AboutChromebooks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm everything at AboutChromebooks.com.  I'm the MatreD, the waiter, the busboy, you name it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chief cook and bottle washer, we used to say, as we used to say.  And we, of course, it's great to have Kevin here because he was at the Google event.  You weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was not.  I was jealous as hell.  If I were in New York, I would have been there, but I wasn't.  I was here.  Why are you here?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We didn't ask yet.  Why are you here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not allowed to say.  Watch next week.  I'll make some announcements on stuff, but I'm working on things.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a huge deal.  It's just work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's work.  It's his job.  And he does it well.  So Google had an event, I thought, given all the leaks, that there would be nothing to  say and there wasn't.  There wasn't, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the way they started it.  They just went ahead and admitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They played a video of YouTube.  Yeah.  No, not that one.  Not that one.  Let me get you the video.  I have it on my Twitter.  Not that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is why they were asking YouTubers for any video content.  Did they ask for it?  There's IAS Actar.  Yeah.  We had a pretty good idea they were going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have a very clear image now of this Pixel 3.  You know pretty much everything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No matter how hard you try, you literally can't get anything past the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and then they tweeted, tune in tomorrow.  See for yourself.  And I thought that meant, oh, because there was a theory that they were punking everybody.  I thought that meant, oh, this is hysterical.  None of it's true.  No, it was all the same.  There was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were poking fun at themselves and it went over pretty well, I thought, from, you  know, they got a good laugh out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing that you could say that was differing from all the leaks was there were  no new Pixel Buds.  There was no Pixel Book 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No watch, though we knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We knew there would be no watch.  They already said that.  So there were some things that maybe they were going to announce they didn't.  They basically announced the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL.  They announced the Pixel, actually you nailed the name.  What did they call it?  The Pixel Slate?  Pixel Slate.  Kevin got that right.  They announced even the wireless charging stand that we thought they would.  And a seven inch Google Home Hub, which is, the only thing that surprised me there is  that it's only seven inches.  They didn't do a seven and a ten like other companies have done.  It's really small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin has some insights about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  After every one of these events, back in the day, back in the good old days, we'd do a  race to see who gets in the order first, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ordered before the event was over.  I haven't ordered.  I ordered the Pixel 3 XL.  I was very impressed.  But you know who has, I think, everything?  Because he brought it home from the event, Kevin Toffle.  Did you get everything, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I didn't get everything.  I got a Pixel 3 XL.  There it is.  Let's see the notch.  You can't even see the notch.  Well, yeah, that's because, oh, that's because it's an iPhone.  Hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That has a notch too, by the way.  There is the notch.  That's not that big.  That's obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awful.  It's double the height.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It brings the status bar almost like double the height.  And that's what people are going off about.  And I get it.  It's not ideal.  But I don't think it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $799 for a 64-gig version, $100 more for a double the memory 128-gig storage version  for the XL, and $100 less in each category for the smaller Pixel 3.  $799 or $899?  Was it $799?  Oh, that's what it was.  $799 for the Pixel 3, $899 for the XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $899 and $999 for the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I end up spending $999.  Of course you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not going to buy.  I've been a Pixel or Google hardware person forever.  That's too much money.  And I would get the smaller version because tiny hands and pockets and all that nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no notch in the smaller version, right, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Correct.  It's just a small chin and forehead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So chin and forehead?  That's what we call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chin and forehead?  Like the old Pixel 2 XL.  Right.  A top and bottom bezel.  There's a chin.  What the kids used to say.  And a forehead.  No, it's a chin.  And a forehead.  Oh, that's new.  Which everybody wonders because the new XL has a chin but no forehead.  Instead it has a lobotomy.  It's like my first girlfriend.  So, I'm sorry, Cathy, that was not a good thing to say.  You had a little bit of a forehead.  But she didn't have a notch.  I'm pretty sure.  So, why...  I'm doing it for you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Did you see me just open my mouth in horror there?  No, it's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a joke.  Yeah, so I'm going to come in a year to Kevin and be like, yo, Kevin, give me a cheap phone  or give me a good recommendation for...  Because with Android, what does Google Call be now everyone gets Android at the same time  kind of effort?  Android One.  Android One.  I was going to say Android first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Treble makes that possible.  It's the code name.  And Treble.  So, I still would get a Google phone.  I don't trust anybody else with Android.  Why did you order?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What impressed you before it was over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Note 9 in the other room and I don't trust Samsung with Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you said before it was over you ordered it.  What impressed you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think the camera and I'm sure Kevin will have something to say about that.  So far I've heard and seen from a number of people who were at the event and handled it  that it's everything that last year's was not.  That the screen this time is very good.  That the feel in the hand is very good.  I like it that it has wireless charging because every other phone I use has wireless charging.  That's a real convenience for me.  I bought the stand just to try it because it sounded like it had special features.  It somehow recognized...  Actually that's another question which is yet unanswered.  Does it automatically turn on the screensaver, the daydream photo album and the larger clock  if it's not on its Pixel stand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we going to see an unboxing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We could do that.  I haven't opened it yet only because I have a wireless charger already.  And those special features either are not enabled yet on the review model because there  are a few software bits not here yet.  Or it's smart enough to know, hey this isn't a Pixel stand.  It's not going to do the special stuff.  But you're right that when on that stand it kind of turns the phone into a limited mini  Google Home Hub in a sense because it can show you your photos.  It has your routine buttons for the Google Assistant.  And it'll even show your Nest camera doorbell or doorbell camera rather if somebody rings  the doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Kevin would you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know Jeff, I'm in a different position at this point because I'm kind of like trying  to budget things for the first time in my life.  And I literally just bought two months ago a $325 Nokia 7 Plus which lasts for two days.  It's speedy enough for me.  The camera is decent enough.  So given that I'd probably say no.  If I had the money to burn, yeah I probably would just because the camera features alone  and it blown me away in the past just 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does highlight Google's problem though.  If people have enough money they'll probably buy an iPhone because people who buy Android  phones tend to be budget consumers.  I don't know about that.  I think so.  I think that's the real problem.  And if they're not budget consumers they're probably buying Samsung.  We know that Google only sold 10 million Pixel 2s in a year.  Go ahead Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think you're partly right and partly wrong.  And I say that because the difference is there really isn't many cheap iPhone options unless  you want something that's two or three years old.  So if you're going to have iOS you've got to pay X on the dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you've got a lot of money you're going to get an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  Well, you know Samsung does sell a lot of galaxies.  It's not their biggest moneymaker in terms of overall volume times profit.  So that's why they have the low and mid range phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's problem number two for Google is if you've got a small I think there's a smaller  number of Android people are willing to spend money if you've got but those people are buying  Samsung's.  So problem number two at the very best Google's dividing the high end of the Android market  with Samsung at the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's their business goal?  Is it is it to be a highly profitable item or is it still to set the bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure looked like it.  They watching the event it looked like that they think they're a player.  They want to be a player.  It's not a reference product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would agree with that.  They must have some and this probably comes into their CFO who's been there what to at  least two years now.  They probably have some hard targets on that hardware division now because things have  changed ever since Ruth Porat came on.  They want to make serious money out of that hardware division.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have my year old Pixel 2.  Oh by the way before I forget these which call it.  Do you still get the always on notification screen thing like this?  Yes.  I love that.  I do love that.  I do love that a lot.  So this is a year old phone.  It's perfectly good.  It's wonderful.  Kevin your advice to me not that I'm rich I'm not but is it worth is the camera alone  worth upgrading put it that way from what do you have now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you have now Jeff?  The Pixel 2.  You know I don't have one of those anymore but I have a first gen Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's part of the question mark and maybe Kevin can help us with this.  It wasn't completely clear about which of the camera features are migrating to the Pixel  2 and which are right.  Both of them are using that same chip the image engine and it sounded like they now  and the announcement that some of these features if not all of these features are going to  be available at least on the Pixel 2 if not other Android phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I'm not.  The night thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suspect the night site is not going to be pushed down and that is just an opinion I  don't have hard information on that.  I also believe and I've been trying to research this afternoon I'm kind of coming up short  if they upgraded that visual core chip in this model.  I know they put the Titan security chip in here but obviously has nothing to do with  photos.  I seem to believe they have updated the visual core chip in which case some things may not  come all the way down the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a life hacker article on how to get some of the features or what features and  This is the problem is Google wasn't clear in the announcement but what features will  migrate down.  No I don't want that.  Thank you.  According to Google nights here you go.  According to Google night site will be rolling out to previously released pixel smartphones  in the coming weeks.  Oh OK.  Duplex.  Duplex is getting a full release on the Pixel 3 devices and will be coming to other pixel  phones in November.  That is what duplex is.  That's that assistant that talks to you.  Ah.  Ah.  And adds ahs.  And so this is this is.  So they announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy was that your imitation of a computer?  No no that was just ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah that was an ah.  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The call screening which I think everybody in the room Kevin enjoyed a lot the idea that  the call screening driven by Google assistant on phone call screening will also be on all  Pixel phones.  I think they stole that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They stole it from them from themselves with Google Voice.  Ah yes Google Voice does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Google Voice it's not quite the same because with Google Voice you have to have a preset  in the Google Voice settings where you say hey if they're not on my like as for instance  if they're not on my contact list screen or if they're an unknown caller screen.  This one as a call comes in you can press a button that says screen that one.  In real time Google Voice does not do that.  That is awesome.  Cool.  So because I'm getting calls all the time from like Apple.  And I love just press instead of just hang up on them screen it or something.  Playground and improved AR will launch first in the Pixel 3 but roll out to other Pixel  phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So.  We're not there yet.  I know and I don't want to get ahead.  But I'm what I'm most looking forward to is Kevin's view of the Pixel Book.  OK we'll get there.  We'll get there.  I know we're out there yet.  That's my if I'm going to spend a thousand bucks or more where's it going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's continue on with the phone because Kevin you said something that I think intrigues  everybody listening.  You were very excited about the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So I've been playing with the camera again it does not have the night sight yet.  I did just get the playground feature this morning so I was having Iron Man on my house  a virtual AR type kind of thing.  The front facing selfie mode portrait mode rather and selfie I thought is amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  I don't know if we can share a picture that I took but I took one in.  It's on the run down.  I tried to share it through Google Photos.  That's the way it is shareable or viewable I should say.  All right.  Where did you put it in the.  It's a line 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh line 20.  Oh self portrait.  Here it is.  I've got it.  Yep.  Can you see it?  I'm not sure.  So one of the things Marques Brownlee did is took a picture of himself in his car and  he said sure isn't softened like the iPhone XS.  Yeah look at that.  Whoa.  Look at the detail.  Wow stubble.  We can see we can count his stubble.  Now we're blowing this up a lot but actually that looks and look at the the book.  Yeah.  This looks good.  This looks really good.  Yeah I'm very impressed with that.  The way the iPhone is doing it is actually kind of weird.  It's softening a lot of it.  It's over over processing it and a lot of people complain about that.  That's really the competition of course is a new iPhone XS.  The iPhone is now doing what Google did last time with the Pixel 2 which is taking multiple  images.  Did you say they don't yet have the best shot feature?  Is that not there or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes so they have you have to turn the motion on.  There's a setting in the phone to do that and you can turn the motion on but it's not  yet showing you which is the recommended photos nor is it letting you choose a photo.  However that picture I just took or just showed was actually at the Google because I went  there after lunch to hang with some of my old teammates and I did see that feature and  got to use it.  They're dog fooding it right now so it's probably going to show up like any day on the Pixel  3 XL.  It was very very cool in the demo and then I got to use it and it worked really really  well like we were being goofballs like blinking and sticking our tongues out you know and  it was able still to capture a decent photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was actually my favorite moment in the event.  It's worth probably showing it again.  This is Google explaining why they did top shot.  Do you hear the audio?  You don't hear the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a great video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a lot of pictures of just the wrong moment.  Guys jump off the cliff but you don't get it.  Lots of people with terrible faces.  She's blown out the candles but they only get it afterwards.  Ty is in the face of the bride.  Guys walking through the picture.  Nobody has taken these pictures.  Where you just miss the shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what Google lets you do is if so this interesting you have to have live picture turned on is  go back.  It will make a recommended based on they said AI recommended top shot but you could also  choose from other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't store every one of those.  I guess it's free storage anyway so what does it matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to defer to Kevin because he's the only one who owns one.  Mine will come a week from tomorrow.  Yours too probably.  I have an order one.  Yes it will.  Just order it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the devil.  He's waiting for to hear about the Pixelbook.  Let's wait.  Let's help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have the suspense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not order the slate so this will be an interesting.  So you said the top shot is not enabled.  I wonder though on the iPhone if live photos turned on and actually degrades the quality  a little bit.  The other images are not as good quality as the one you took.  I'm sure Google is not doing it that way.  They have enough horsepower in this thing and especially with the image, especially  image chip, that they could have full quality images I hope.  But that's a problem with live photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a combination of something that Google I think is better at than Apple.  It's a combination of like a burst mode camera type implementation as well as a processing  software side and AI to kind of choose the best image for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it must start capturing the minute you go to the camera or the minute you raise  the phone.  Certainly it starts capturing before you press the button because that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know exactly when it starts to capture.  It might be always capturing and then just saving a few seconds before and after.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I await the privacy police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it doesn't take it if your camera is not open presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think even the privacy police can't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just wait every niggas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you put Childish Gambino in with Norm because that would have been cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't do that yet.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the augmented reality.  So again we saw that.  This is not actually new.  We just saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they offer a compelling use case yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For augmented reality.  Well, serious.  I'm like, are we still just…  Has anyone?  I actually see it in industrial IoT and some other things but no, I haven't seen anything  for it to be on my actual phone.  So I was just curious.  Someone might come up with something, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy, how long will you be in Seattle before you stop saying y'all?  How does it wear off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, they love it in Seattle.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, they just think that's so cute.  It is cute.  Another interesting point from the Google Keyword Blog, product blog.  It does notice where you're taking a picture and then suggests an appropriate overlay.  This is like Snapchat Lite kind of.  So he's doing some gardening and it suggested that she put a little green thumb thought  bubble above it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So does it know the place and it kind of knows the activity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I expect more of this from Google because this is the kind of thing Google Photos is  already doing.  It kind of understands what it's seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's almost like bringing Google Lens and Google Assistant together into your compositions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But again, you can't judge this stuff by demos, by blog posts.  You got to get the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to wait till you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't have it next week but I'll have it the week after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't be getting it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Stacey, which one are you carrying now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the Pixel 2.  The 2?  Okay, so yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's fine.  I might agree.  I might be there too.  I might stick with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm good with it until I drop it or do something horrible and then poof.  That's me.  Okay.  What did you say Kevin?  I should get the Nokia something something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The new Nokia 7.  It's kind of technically called the 7.1 but it's basically what I just bought, upgraded,  slightly smaller and better screen.  And unlike mine, which is an international version, it has the US band support so that  would work here and it's $350.  But I think your issue is going to be Verizon.  Or the Pixel 3 will be available on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want you to know.  We're going to get you a Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They gave us a Verizon SIM card with us to test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Follow the light Stacey.  Follow the light.  You could spend $800 on the Heston cooking system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, did you get the Heston queue?  I did.  Oh, Leo, that's so crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says the woman who talked me into a $1,500 toaster oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, this is a good product.  This looks really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like the BuzzFeed thing but fancier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It includes an inductive burner and then the pan has Bluetooth, can talk to the burner  plus it has a thermometer in it so it automatically knows what temperature, it modifies the temperature  according to a recipe.  You can actually look at the app and see the recipe.  So if you wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Tasty's is $149.  How much did you spend, Leo?  Tasty has one?  They stopped making that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did?  I believe so, yes.  Do you have one?  So this is, no, I haven't, I'm not a sauteer type person.  I don't need help there.  I don't really need help there either, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not an area that is that complicated.  Well, so in this, this gets to some things we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went out to dinner with a bunch of tech and gadget reviewers from a bunch of different  sites at this event and we were like, recipes aren't written for this.  Like, you don't know if your pan is at 200 degrees.  You don't care if your pan is 200 degrees.  So, so yes, but it is neat.  And actually GE is building that functionality into its new range tops.  Is it range?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to get an inductive stove top.  We love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait, because I saw with the wireless power consortium at this event, what they  were doing, that I was at, and I'll get you back to Google in a minute.  But they're standardizing on a high, higher voltage.  It's not really high voltage, but greater wattage inductive power that they put underneath  the counter.  And then you could actually, with the right pan, cook directly on the countertop.  Otherwise, you'd have like little coaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Wait a minute.  So you probably don't want a Formica countertop.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you have a Formica countertop, they make a coaster that kind of goes over to protect  your countertop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I have granite countertops.  It would work with that.  It would not work there.  It wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  But you could put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What material does your countertop have to be made of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Concrete?  I don't know.  Not metal.  No, not metal.  Because then the whole thing would heat up.  But, I mean, the little coaster thing is not crazy either.  It's basically like a little burner that you stick on it.  Anyway.  How much do you spend, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait.  But this, no, but it's for research purposes.  I don't need it.  Like Stacey, I know how to saute.  I know how to do that.  It's $500 for the pan and the burner.  Another $300 if you want the chef's pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $300 for one pot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a Bluetooth module in it.  I spent $300 on a pot that doesn't have Bluetooth in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  This will actually be part of the test is, are these actually, is it actually decent cookware?  It kind of looks like it might be.  You are IO-tested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's nice cookware.  It looks a little like All-Clad or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use MasterChef, but it looks a little bit like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see they don't have the Bluetooth.  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a low-cost Tupperware version?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have brought this up.  But since Stacey was at the cooking event, I thought I'd mention it.  Stacey, did you see anything better than this at the event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you guys, I can't show it to you because it's for my newsletter this week, but next  week ask me about the Rotimatic because I did see that in Eat the Rotis.  It's a robot that makes flatbreads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You talked about the Rotimatic before.  So you actually sampled the Rotimatic.  I sampled the Rotimatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, I'm the one who brought this up and you made fun of it.  This is a thousand dollar bread maker basically.  I brought this up on the show and you just poo-pooed this, Ms. IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she now has a different opinion.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't actually have a different opinion.  I would never buy this, but you know what?  40,000 people have.  They have sold 40,000 of these.  A thousand dollars each?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  The only reason I wouldn't buy this is because the last thing I need to do is eat a lot of  roti.  Roti is like a, well, there's naan, there's masala, these are those flatbreads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes tortillas too, right?  It makes any flatbread, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes tortillas, it makes personal pizzas.  This is the last thing I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pop-tarts.  Follow the light, Leo.  Although I admit I came this close to spending a thousand dollars on a leg of ham yesterday.  So that's not including the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, talk him into it.  Let's make this a challenge.  Before the other show, he's got a Rotimatic coming here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's somebody from Barcelona in the studio audience, and I can ask this, or near Barcelona,  I can ask this question.  Have you ever had a jamon iberico in your house?  Do you have to refrigerate it?  Of course.  You don't refrigerate it?  Does it grow mold or something on it?  No?  You just shave it off and keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Leo, Leo, you want this.  The Rotimatic?  You can make pizza, roti, tortillas, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I do want this, and I love this stuff.  And the problem is, this is why I stopped baking in general.  You make it, you eat it.  I don't eat it.  It's like saying, here, here's a thousand dollar cookie making machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, yeah, basically it just pops right off.  It comes out like it's like a printer tray and like this hot, warm bread pops right off.  It's a bread printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just what I need.  Karsten, we need to find Stacey's ruling on this prior though.  I just want to, I just want on the record.  First of all, look at the size of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would take over your kitchen.  Out of ink.  It's like an all-in-one printer.  It's like a business printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Jetsons.  Hey, I'll fax you a roti.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This kid really is getting into this.  So they've sold, say that again, 40,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not even for sale in India yet.  It's only in the US, Europe, and Singapore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want it.  I would have my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God.  You might as well have a butter maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long does it take?  Oh, you didn't want to talk about it yet.  You want to talk about it next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Oh, well, it takes, well, I just have a video that I took.  It takes about 90 seconds to warm up and then it's about a minute for each roti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, instant gratification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In five minutes, you're five minutes away from a roti.  Oh, oh, oh.  And this kid, this kid, 10 years from now, that kid is going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a real food expert in the audience here as a friend of mine.  Jesse, would you buy one?  No.  Because you'd eat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually have made none.  Because the roti's not good enough for you?  I've made none myself.  It's hard to make.  You've got to make the dough.  You've got to let it rise.  You've got to flatten it just so.  You cook in the skillet.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and this actually, it hasn't puffed up perfectly.  You can see it.  See, that was the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wasn't getting puffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it puffs.  It's pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the front page of the Rotimatic website, it says they've made 29,605,810 rotis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And counting.  It's like the old McDonald's, right?  Yeah.  How many rotis served?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does look like a printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of, I mean, there's a little, yeah, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have to get it for home.  You could get it for the office.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a benefit every office should have.  Because you could just keep it running, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they wouldn't waste a lot of time on lunch, Leo.  One minute, you got a roti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think how much you'd save in employee hours.  Now I'm a little intrigued.  Lisa, can he buy a Rotimatic?  So what do you do?  You keep, it has a canister of flour in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has flour, oil, and water.  So you mix it.  You put those in the top and you can put different types of flour in there.  There's software updates.  I'm sure he's hyperventilating right now.  And then it makes about 12 to 14 rotis before you need to refill the top.  So.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we need to get canisters of flour as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it roti or rotay?  Roti.  Roti.  I call them naan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How are they going to double-side it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Naan is a different type of bread.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they printed double-sided, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that.  The United States Treasury does mandate that there's a hidden code in every roti.  Wow, that is wild.  Did the count go up while we were here?  Yeah, the count is going up.  Look at that.  No, Carson really wants me to buy one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty awesome.  And you clean, you only have to clean, you clean like most of it once a week.  And then every, every time you use it or every day, you clean these two little canisters where the dough has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carson, if I bought one, you would have to say I'll be in charge of cleaning it and maintaining it.  I'm not going anywhere near it.  Absolutely.  He's on the record.  Burke is already weighing in.  We've gone from no way to if I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they're just about to do an upgrade for millet flour, which, you know, people love for vegan.  I'm going to wait on the millet upgrade.  Well, no, no, no, it's just a software update.  It's like, you know, your June.  By now, by now, just see what options are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This costs as much as a Pixel 3 phone and a lot more useful.  It feeds you.  It feeds you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like it's got a real time roadie counter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can buy them in bulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google gets in trouble because it's taking a lot of pictures, but privacy advocates don't care if you count the roadies.  Wait a minute.  If I get five units, I can get them down to eight ninety nine each.  We could do a we could do a roadie club.  He wants to join my roadie club.  You could give it to people as like a good holiday gift.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's a 30 day full refund guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  There is limited stock.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to buy that.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love costing you money.  I have some money.  I have some money.  There are I have some.  I love costing you money.  I have some limits.  So let's get back to Google.  What do you say?  You rarely hear me say that, kids.  But in this case.  So you've taken you.  Is there anywhere else you've put pictures, Kevin?  Because I'd love to see some images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually have one more to share on this show, but I saved it for the very end.  Just to make sure it stays.  Save it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know the notch doesn't bother me.  I do see it's kind of big.  But I think people get used to notches.  I you know, when I first got the iPhone 10, I thought, oh, I don't want to.  It's just it's just aesthetically used to it.  No, no, it's not.  It's nothing.  It's a kludge.  It's like kludges.  It's not a kludge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not ideal.  I mean, I won't lie.  But you know, when I got over it with my iPhone pretty quick, I mean, I think the worst thing  is when you're, say, watching a video or something.  Let's mute this.  But, you know, it didn't hurt the iPhone 10 sales when they came out with their notch.  Granted, it's thinner.  It's longer, but it's thinner.  I think it'll be fine.  I think the people who want the pixel are going to get the pixel and you don't see it  when you're watching video.  That's a point.  Yeah.  Unless you do the zoom in.  I don't know if it did it or not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See?  Right. And now you can see.  Yep.  Yep.  So just don't do that and it'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also has a thing I'm most interested in.  So there are a couple of things that make camera phones less than suitable as your main  camera.  One is it's got a single fixed angle and digital zoom sucks.  They have this capability, they say, of zooming better.  Super res zoom.  And they do it with multiple images.  You said that's not yet in your camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's not here.  That's not here.  And they said they kind of I don't know if they borrowed the idea or leverage technology.  They said this is how we like when we take photos of Mars, we clean them up.  Right.  You know, it's it's algorithms and interpolation and all that.  So the demos look fine, but that is not here yet on my unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's one issue that, you know, because I mean, the resolution, the quality of the  image is really very good.  So if you had zoom, because that's a big problem, you know, that's something I can do with a  real camera, even a point and shoot that I can't do with a camera phone.  What was the what's the other issue?  The selfie zoom, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I'm thinking of no, I'm thinking of the shutter lag.  So this has always been a problem is the time to picture.  And they're sort of solving that with the top shot.  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Correct.  That's that's not going to be an issue.  I don't think at least I've not seen that issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the selfie camera a wide angle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they two lenses, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do have two lenses for the portrait mode.  I don't know if I can do this or not.  I kind of put you in selfie mode.  It's kind of hard to see, I suppose.  But there's a there's a zoom feature down at the bottom where you can zoom in and zoom out.  See if I can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it combines two images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it actually it's it's like a well, it's not switching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's something in between.  There's two lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, there are two lenses.  I don't think it switches for that.  That's more for portrait mode.  So that's zoomed out.  That's more wide angle.  And then if I slide over, I can go in for like close up selfie.  I think it's nice.  Again, the question will be, is that digital?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it optical?  Is it how good is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what I'm asking is when you hold it out, you get more people in the selfie.  Yeah, that's the idea.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, OK, but do they have the fish eye effect?  They do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I know I do not edit myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the big nose, giant nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this actually does switch between the two cameras.  Now that you mentioned, and the only reason I say that, not that they told me this, but on the zoom level, when I switch across the very center of it, meaning not zoom, so zoom in or zoom out, it kind of jumps a little bit like it is switching cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you just put your thumb over the camera over one of the cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then I wouldn't get to see anything.  Oh, yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you could tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And good call, Jeff, because here you go.  Let's see.  I'll zoom over and it disappears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty, that's all processing.  Yeah.  Combine two images on two cameras seamlessly.  That's very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Qualcomm 845 chip.  That's a nice fast chip.  Although, according to recent benchmarks on the iPhone XS, it really doesn't hold a candle to the iPhone XS.  On the other hand, how much speed do you need in a smartphone?  And I think there's a big difference by adding that DSP chip for image processing.  Then you don't, you're not relying on the 845 for all the work you're doing in the camera.  I think this is a promising phone.  How about the screen?  Remember the, it's funny, this was when the Pixel 2 came out, everybody was bitching about the screen and burning.  Yeah, and the blue and this and the blue.  And you don't hear much about that.  I don't know if it's because people stopped buying it or because it really wasn't as big a problem.  How do you feel about the screen on the Pixel 3, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I remember that issue.  They had some, I would call it bad product, bad screens probably.  I think they were using LG at the time.  I suspect that they have switched over to a different partner and that is very likely Samsung for this display because it's at least as good as the say that the Galaxy 9s and whatnot.  I think it looks fantastic.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know what, Kevin?  I have the original first screen and I think Leo's point is whatever it was that was a problem, I'm completely used to it and don't notice the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and not everybody had the problem.  So it could have been different production runs and so on.  And it's hard to say, Jeff, to be honest, because when you mass produce these things, you're dealing with supply chain issues and whatnot.  If you're used to it, then you're going to be thrilled when you see this because you're not going to, it's going to look fantastic to you, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but Jeff may not be getting it because he's saving his money.  It's going to be in Kevin's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A roadie maker.  If nothing else, they promoted the use of roadie as a word in America and that I commend them for.  Let's take a break and then we'll finally, I've been very good.  You've been very good holding off deferred satisfaction.  We'll talk about the Pixelbook slate.  Is there, oh, and the home, you have a home as well, right?  And the Pixelbook.  The home.  No, there isn't a new Pixelbook.  There's just a new slate.  Yeah, just a new Pixelbook.  Oh, they do a new version.  Oh.  Yeah, that was one of the rumors was there'll be a Pixelbook 2, but that did not materialize.  And then there is this Google Home Hub, which I'm sure you and Stacey talked about this morning.  For hours.  So long.  We'll get the boiled down version of that in just a bit.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage and Quicken Loans, the best lender in the country,  number one in customer satisfaction.  Eight years in a row now, according to JD Power, Rocket Mortgage is actually a creation of Quicken Loans.  When you're customer centric, when you're, and any company that says customers first,  and a service company, that's really important.  I just love it.  It just makes me happy because I'm a customer.  Right.  And so Quicken Loans, one of the ways they become the biggest lender in the nation is by really thinking about the customer experience.  That's why they created Rocket Mortgage.  Instead of going to a bank and filling out a long application, doing a lot of research, going to the adit to get old bank statements or calling your former employers to get old pay stubs,  they do all that work for you.  And Rocket Mortgage is entirely online.  So you don't even have to, you don't have to leave your armchair or your open house.  You just go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig and the whole process happens there and it happens fast.  Actually, it's a three step process.  They, Quicken Loans calls Rocket Mortgage's process the power buying process.  So step one, we've talked about this before, you go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig, create an account, answer a few simple questions.  They'll check your credit and you get pre-qualified approval.  And you get to, at that point, pick the term, the rate, the down payment, everything.  And within, and this is 10 minutes.  So this is already way ahead of anything any bank can do.  But then step two, over the next 24 hours, they will verify your income, your assets and your credit.  And they will give you verified approval.  Now that's huge because that's basically saying you got the loan.  You get a letter that says, you know, this is, they have verified approval.  That means you're basically a cash buyer.  When you go to make an offer on a house, the seller says, oh, well, you know,  you go right to the front of the line because unlike the other bidder or two or three these days, it's very competitive.  You don't, it's not a contingency. You don't have to get a loan.  You've got a loan. You're verified.  So that's fantastic. And let's add step three, which is unique to Rocket Mortgage.  It's all new and I love it. It's called, they call it rate shield approval.  And this wasn't an issue in years, in the last few years, because the interest rates were very stable.  They're going up now. You probably noticed that.  The feds raising rates, home loan rates are going up.  As a result, there's some uncertainty when you're out there home hunting.  You're saying, oh, we better buy quick because what if the rates go up?  And, you know, a quarter interest point on a 30 year loan might mean tens of thousands of dollars.  So that's a big deal. That kind of, and that's pressure.  That means there's some anxiety. That means you feel like I got to buy, I got to buy now.  You don't want that.  So what they've done once you get verified approval is they lock in the rate.  This is rate shield approval for up to 90 days.  So you have up to three months to shop and the rate can't go up.  Even if, even if the fed raises it, even if the LIBOR goes up or whatever the loans based on goes up, your rate is locked.  It's guaranteed.  Here's another nice feature. If the rates go down, your rate goes down.  So it just can't go up. I love that.  Either way you win this because that's customer centric, right?  That's thinking about, ah, you know, there's some anxiety here about rates.  Let's fix that. Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Rate shield approvals only valid on certain 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions might apply.  It's based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.  Of course, they're equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org.  Number 3030. You have to remember all that.  Just remember rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Twig. Take advantage of the power buying process entirely online.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You know, when you go to the bank to get that loan, we went to the big bank when we bought our house five years ago, Lisa and I, and you have to kind of get all cleaned up.  Banks don't lend money to people who need the money.  This is what you learn. They only see you have to look prosperous.  I don't need your money. I'm just here to inquire about a loan.  I'm ready for my own rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You can do it in your jammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Now, let's break your headline, the verge.  Google failed to justify the pixel three XL's massive notch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is such bogosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, did they talk about the massive price increase?  Let's have them justify that massive price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? I thought I spent about that much on mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The two. I think it's like 100 bucks more, at least.  I don't think so.  I mean, mine was, I feel like mine was 700.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So right now you get a pixel two for 745 bucks.  That's I think 50 bucks off.  Yeah, that's a little price that it was.  So, but I don't, maybe that's the, is that the pixel two XL in which case it would be a hundred bucks less than the pixel three XL.  But I think this, I don't know if it's a, would you go to the massive?  I don't think it's a massive price increase.  And part of the problem is that I buy iPhones.  Yeah. So I paid for the last iPhone, 1250 bucks.  And that's not even the most expensive one you can get, I don't think.  So did you just say chump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking for my, my receipt from the Google store from last November.  Actually, I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because.  Well, it's a virtual receipt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  How much did it cost last time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that was my life case.  Not helpful.  That was 40 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I bought a pixel two XL for $949.  Ended up with tax to be a thousand twenty six dollars, October 4th, 2017.  So that's a hundred twenty eight gigs.  So it's 50 bucks.  It's 50 bucks less than what I paid this time for the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the pixel two, 64 gigabytes for $649.  So I paid 702.54.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that would be $749 now.  So it is a hundred bucks more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  All right. Well, those are the points, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess they figured Apple, you know, has shown that you can get that kind of money for a high end flagship.  And let's do it.  I mean, Samsung's getting up there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't as well sell price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the stand is $80, which is way overpriced too.  I mean, yeah, that's Apple.  That's Apple accessory land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did give us a USB-C headphones.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And an adapter, which Apple has now left out of the box, which is ridiculous.  I mean, talk about cheap because Apple knows you pay 20 bucks for that adapter if you really want to use it.  Apple's excuse on that was, oh, we found out nobody uses wired headphones anymore.  Not on our.  I love one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We asked three people and none of them.  Nobody.  None of them use headphones.  Nobody on the Apple campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Let's talk about the slate because poor Jeff is just ready to write a check.  The Pixel Slate.  Now, pricing is confusing on this because this keyboard and the pen are separate.  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you have an old pen, it will work with the slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the pen that came with the Pixel Book 2.  But to come with, I had to buy it.  Oh, you bought that one.  That was a hundred bucks.  What do you think of the keyboard?  This is the Bridge BRY DGE keyboard.  I know Jeff hates bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's actually that's actually the Google keyboard for one ninety nine.  And that is an amazing keyboard.  But I talked to the head of product management here at Google and said, look, you know, I'm obviously going to buy this and I will buy the keyboard as well as the slate.  But people are going to balk at a two hundred dollar keyboard when Microsoft sells theirs for ninety nine to like one twenty nine.  And Apple sells there for one fifty nine, I believe.  And the response was, look, here's the deal.  If people want a keyboard, they'll have choice of keyboards.  And the bridge model actually is one fifty nine.  OK, so there's there's that.  And that's more of a traditional laptop type keyboard experience.  They said to kind of justify this price, they said, look, we're giving you a large glass trackpad that works with the mouse.  IOS doesn't have that at all.  So you're not even getting that with an Apple keyboard.  And we have adjustable angles, infinite adjustable, which this I thought from an engineering standpoint was brilliant.  You can take that back cover and there are magnets in the rails of the pixel slate in the back of it and you can adjust it to any angle you would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fantastic. It's kind of smooth to it looks like.  Right. Yes, that is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's what you know, the response I gave you is telling to me, because as we're looking at this and as we're looking at pricing, I'm wondering there's two ways you could go.  Is this to compete with a Surface Pro, the Windows tablet, which also has a separate keyboard and pen, or is this to compete with the iPad Pro?  And it sounded like they were referring to the iPad.  So they they see this as the iPad is the natural competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess that's what they see it as.  I was going to say the answer to your question is yes.  This is a true competitor to both in my opinion.  Yes, granted.  Granted. And that's because you're getting a desktop browser.  So you get the desktop feel of Microsoft, obviously not the legacy apps, although they did say this will support the Linux apps as well.  And then you get the mobile experience of the touch screen and Android apps.  So it's kind of attacking both in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point. If you run it with Android apps, then it's an iPad replacement.  If you run it with a Chrome browser, it's more like Windows, although there aren't Windows apps.  Although there's a pretty good there's a pretty good set of apps available for the Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, you and I have talked about this before.  I'm I'm still concerned on my on my beautiful pixel.  The Android apps just aren't great.  Anything that has DRM is a pain in the butt and doesn't work very well.  And trying to go back and forth with apps not built for the larger screen.  A Chrome tablet, just full stop Chrome tablet versus Android tablet.  I'm I'm I'm still concerned about how mature Chrome is for this use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's your thought? Well, it's a totally fair point.  I tend to use the browser when I can instead of apps because say for Netflix, as I know you've had issues with Netflix, the Android app version.  Yes, you might want to download Netflix videos and watch them.  And you can do that with the Android version if it's working well for you.  I go with the browser because you get higher resolution partially because of the DRM.  And I don't have to worry about an app.  You can't download for the plane. No, you can't.  You're correct. International lands where I am that.  And that's totally valid. You're absolutely right. That's a limitation for sure.  Google has really put the framework out there for app developers and these large companies such as Netflix, for example, to make it work.  And they just have it for some reason. I'm not sure why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the market is tiny, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I guess, yeah, if you're going to invest the time and effort resources to developing mobile apps, you're going to go where mobile app engagement is the highest.  And people are doing things on iPads and iPhones.  And that's where a lot of folks focus their efforts when it comes to third party stuff.  So I don't know what Google can really do unless they say, look, we'll help you.  We'll put some engineering time behind it and just make it better.  I kind of wish they would do that and, you know, put some resources behind helping these guys, because other than that, I don't know what they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I talk to a product head from Chrome OS at I.O.  And he was arguing surprise at the problem with Netflix.  But it's it's obviously there. It's difficult. It crashes a lot. It doesn't come on. It doesn't remember things.  And then the further problem I have is guess what? I'm going to complain about being a G Suite user trying to install new apps into Chrome is just  torture. It's 87 steps. It's easier to become a citizen these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's that's a problem. And I think I go back to Google on that one.  They never really thought that out well to have that like they didn't.  I don't think they figured mere mortals and consumers would get G Suite accounts that was really geared towards, say, enterprise and small business.  But now that's created a whole problem.  And I know they're working on it because I've seen code changes about adding certain flags and features to control in the Google Chrome admin stuff.  So, you know, it's one of the questions I get all the time on about Chromebooks is, you know, hey, how do I get Google Assistant on my Pixelbook?  You know, the first question I ask is, well, do you have a G Suite account?  You know, here are the steps you have to do. Here's the support page. It is. You've got to jump through a lot of hoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So so so that's so so Chrome as tablet app and Chrome OS G Suite Android not working well together.  My two concerns. So the other question I'll ask is just simply if today you didn't have a Pixelbook, you didn't have a slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which would you buy? So I personally and granted, the pricing is high on the slate.  In my opinion, we'll get to pricing in a bit, I'm sure I personally would go with a Pixel slate.  And that is because even with the Pixelbook and I have a Surface Pro as well for class, I use those in tablet mode at least 50 percent of the time.  Because when I'm not working, writing, coding, whatever, I'm watching Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube TV, et cetera.  And I prefer to have just a portable screen that I can hold or put stand up next to me wherever I am.  The other reason again for me and maybe for everybody else, in fact, the Pixelbook did not get a refresh.  As we said earlier on the show, it is running the seventh gen Intel processors, whereas the Pixel slate has the eighth gen Intel processors.  So and it has a range of processors from Celeron to M3 to I5 to I7.  So you're getting better performance and probably better power efficiency as well.  Google said 12 hours of mixed use on the slate, which is amazing because that's seven millimeters thin that that slate.  Yeah. So it's crammed with battery.  In fact, the battery is all around the corners of the device.  The boards are in the very middle.  So that way it is completely balanced.  However you hold it. Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah, very well designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And does the keyboard constantly trickle charge the way the old Pixel tablet keyboard did?  Nope. You got to charge the keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it gets its power from the oh, it gets powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like an iPad.  This is not Bluetooth. Right. It's connected.  It's got these Pogo. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Google's uses the Pogo pins.  There's no battery or anything needed.  It gets all this data and power from the slate itself.  Bridge is offering their G type keyboard and that is Bluetooth.  So it's not using the Pogo pins.  You do have to charge that.  They say every I think three to six months.  But I mean, if you're using that thing full time, I don't know about that.  My issue with the Bluetooth is I have seen I've used Bluetooth keyboards with with my Pixelbook in tablet mode, for example, just for testing.  And sometimes the onscreen keyboard pops up while it's trying to get reestablished a connection to the hardware keyboard.  So it's just not cohesive as one unit, whereas the Google keyboard is.  And it's not a knock on bridge.  They've always used Bluetooth.  So maybe they will change now and in the future and go with Pogo pins for their iPad Pro keyboards and the and the Pixel slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. So I use I obviously write a lot.  Some would say too much writing on the slate versus the Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it I would just give you first impressions because any time I use a different keyboard, I usually give myself a couple of days to get used to it.  Saying that I spent about an hour, maybe an hour and a half with the two different keyboards.  The bridge keyboard is very much like the actual keyboard of the Pixelbook.  The Google keyboard is quite good.  Also, it took me a little bit of time to kind of get the feel of those circular keys.  But Google said and we asked about this, Google said, you know, when we we did some research and we found that people are actually more accurate with the circular keys because they're less likely to hit other keys because of the of the spacing.  Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.  I haven't done any tests on my own, but it does make sense.  I'm very interested.  You won't hear the keys either, Jeff, at all.  They're very quiet.  Hush keys.  Hush keys.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's decent travel.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Yeah, because that's what I I like the clickety clickety of my keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to know your accomplishing something, right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Plus, it like helps me get my emotion out in my writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure there's a Chrome extension, Stacey.  You could install it just makes a noise every time you hit the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the it's a really interesting product idea because it does.  They mentioned they mentioned Crostini, but they did say it'll run Linux apps.  So Crostini is enabled on this.  So you can run if you're a high end user, you can run high end command line based apps from the GNU Linux world.  You can run Android and it is a powerful device.  This is this is the but the problem is power comes at a great great with great power comes great price.  Yes.  So the seller or the base unit, the one they quote the five ninety nine unit, which is a cellar on four gigs of RAM, which I think is ample and 32 gig storage or or six gigs of RAM and 64 gig storage starts at five ninety nine.  Although I think you'll pay more for the eight gig version.  Then there is a M3.  That's the mobile kind of crappy mobile Intel processor better than a seller on seven ninety nine.  You can't get an I-5.  That's probably what's in your pixel book, Jeff.  But the thousand dollar pixel book.  That's the same price.  Correct.  Spec wise, this eighth generation I-5 processor is the same price minus the keyboard and pen as your pixel book.  This costs more.  In other words.  And you may want to go.  But what's nice is it the I-7 processor includes 16 gigs of RAM, 250 gig storage.  But I can't remember.  I think that was that a thirteen hundred dollar skew for the pixel book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think it's it's fourteen ninety nine at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is this one is fifteen ninety nine for the slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus plus that also had five twelve gig of.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It had more storage.  Although I don't know why anybody wants a lot of storage.  Well, unless you store in a hell of a lot of Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But maybe.  So you know why I can't get this?  Why?  The show.  Why?  Skype.  Oh, you don't have.  I got it.  I'm in the frigging hotel.  Carson's going to kill me.  So I'm in the frigging hotel room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The really use Skype on these can Skype on this doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I take my my Android tablet and Skype is better on that.  Right.  But Skype on a Chrome device won't work with the darn.  We should figure out while you're here, in fact, before you leave,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we should figure out some alternative that you can use on your Chromebook,  like Hangouts or something.  Oh, oh, oh.  Can't we do that, Carson and John?  What about Zoom?  You know, Zoom works well.  Does Zoom work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blue jeans works well.  All right.  We can use Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never tried Zoom.  We should.  Zoom or blue jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'd have to do we have to on our machines.  Carson put us.  No, Zoom is you know, you need a Zoom client, but it's in the browser.  Right.  I think so.  On both ends, I think.  I think it's on the browser.  I don't want to derail us there.  I've never used it before.  So we should we should try a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing I'm thinking about doing is buying the cheapest Microsoft tablet  so I can get Skype.  Yeah, but you don't want to carry it.  I don't want to carry it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't want to carry more than one.  All right. Enough of Jeff.  I actually think this is overpriced.  I have to say.  Right.  Or hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could use Skype for Linux once Google has the audio capabilities  in the project.  Christine added.  Yeah, they don't currently.  But you can't even get this yet.  You have some time.  They have some time, I guess, to get it in there maybe before the preorders all start.  So we'll have to see that once that's there, Jeff, because I'll run in the same problem  with the IOT podcast that Stacey and I do, for example.  Now, I do have the Surface Pro and that's what I use right now for podcasting.  But if I can do it on the slate with Linux.  Yeah, I'd be happier, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now it's waitlist and you can't buy it.  What did they say when it would be available later this month or in November?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I pushed really hard with the PR folks.  They were laughing at me, almost crying.  I was pushing so hard to get a release date.  And then I spoke to the product manager and he kind of gave me a murky little smile.  I just said, year end, by year end.  But I did find out today that Best Buy temporarily had a listing for all of these pixel  slates showing a release date of November 22nd.  That has been changed.  But I grabbed a screenshot before they changed it.  So I thought about it and I'm like, you know, why would that be?  Why is it not ready yet?  Well, the pixel slate that I used, all of them, actually, they were all running the  dev channel version 71.  And there were still some software glitches.  There's still some things in the commit log that they're working on, minor hardware  things. I suspect that when 71 rolls out, that's kind of what the holdup is here.  Some of my readers, yeah, some of my readers have said, well, you know, the FCC has not  approved this yet.  There's fine print underneath the Google Store listing for this.  And I get that.  But the iPhone XR also has that same listing.  Just because it hasn't been approved yet doesn't mean that's what the rating on.  How impressive is the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The screen specs are fantastic.  It's 3000 by 2000, which is almost 300 pixels per inch, 12.3 inches.  It does. I wish it didn't have such massive bezels.  But Google and bezels.  Google loves its bezels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But part of the argument on the bezels is handling.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've again I'm not I'm not anti-bezel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what does it look like, Kevin, because you're the one who's seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm kind of like a screen snob.  Like, you know, as soon as 4K TVs came out and HDR TVs, I'm upgrading, upgrading,  upgrading. I was blown away.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were going to be the biggest difference between this and a pixel book.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Because it's it's it seemed brighter to me.  I don't know the exact brightness on the specs.  But when we looked at some 4K videos, HDR videos, I mean, I'm like, wow, this  looks fantastic.  I can't find out for sure if it's a true HDR display, but it looked like it to  me. I mean, again, I was just blown away.  And they got some new technology in there, too.  They're calling it this molecular display where I'm certainly not a physicist or  a scientist.  But this sounded weird to me.  They make the electrons move 100 times faster than other LCD and other  hyper. And I'm like, how do you do that?  I mean, then you should be able to Mars in three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, so which one would which one would each of you buy if you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  buy one? Well, you're going to have to get at least the I-5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what I'm going to do.  I mean, I think I think mainstream people who want to spend a little more than  your average mid-range Chromebook would be fine with the Celeron or the M3.  I'd probably go M3 if I were them.  But I will go with the I-5 and the 8 gig of RAM and that storage because that's  what I have in my Pixelbook.  I run Linux apps.  I compile some code on it.  I do Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything you would use this instead of your Pixelbook would replace it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my Pixelbook.  I already have talked to two people who are interested in buying my Pixelbook.  Absolutely. It's going away.  You are heartless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I should point out it's a big jump in price from 999 to 1599.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're still you see you're 1299.  You're 1300 bucks.  Twelve hundred bucks here with the keyboard.  Oh, yeah. Don't forget keyboard.  Keyboard's 200 and the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You already have the ninety nine dollar pens.  You need to buy that.  But plus service and you're going to buy the service on.  Yeah. I mean, it's expensive.  There's no question it's expensive.  It's got to be your soul machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got to.  That's that price.  It ain't just some tablet thing.  It is your soul machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Well, the Pixelbook has been my soul machine except for podcasting.  Quite honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would not buy it be the first in line to buy it in general just because Google's had troubles in the past.  And I this you know, I just I would I would give it a month.  What's about the phone? See the reviews.  The phone we know what the phone is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me ask you this, Leo, because you use a Pixelbook today.  So what does your Pixelbook not do since you bought it?  I mean, it meets the other Pixelbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fine. I don't need this late at all.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But really, this is a Pixelbook.  The power of the Pixelbook, the same basic configuration.  Here's the three things you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't get a Pixelbook that we mentioned the screen battery life is a lot better.  It sounds like if you have you haven't had long enough to really know.  No.  But if it lives up to the spec and and you know, it sounds like they've really made an attempt to put all more than all day battery life in it.  And the third thing, I don't know how important this is.  Sounds like they got better cameras in it.  And there's front and back.  Which always worries me because I'm going to see I see people taking pictures with their tablets.  Those three things are improvements.  I don't think seventh to eighth generation Intel makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, what do you what's your computer on the road now?  Oh, I'm a MacBook Air on the road at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to update it.  Well, do you consider a tune probably update this year?  No, because I'm a content creator and I don't want to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's I mean, truthfully, I don't use a Pixelbook as my main computer.  I can't.  And I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I should say this because y'all are smart.  I don't like the MacBook Pro keyboard.  I don't like it.  So I'm going to very soon.  I'm going to have to I don't know what I'm going to do.  Yeah, I've got to find a new computer and a lot of Apple lovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm fine going back to like a light.  They see come to Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the creator problems are there, but I do believe the power of these machines,  they're going to solve that soon.  But I you know, I have to edit video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to edit a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I think you're going to be able to with as much memory as you get in this thing with the power of it.  You know, we've debated on the show before whether you could ever do that virtually.  I mean, I was to say over the network, but but I think we got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I might mention as long as we're talking about screens that display may tweeted.  We haven't seen the report yet.  It's coming out Monday that the Google Pixel 3 XL OLED display is the highest A plus rating in a display.  It best smartphone display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, take that Apple fanboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's good news.  I mean, even look, people like DSO market display may every time something new comes out seem to have.  Oh, this is the best we've ever seen.  But even if it's not the best screen ever, if it's better than the Pixel 2, I think that's really good news.  Because that was the one complaint people had about the Pixel 2 XL in particular that OLED screen.  Home Hub seven inch display.  Did they? Why did Google explain to you?  Why did they make it so small, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they kind of I don't know that they really explain that.  My take on on it is that they wanted to simplify the smart home and have a kind of very focused device just for that.  And that's different from the larger smart displays like I have the 10 inch Lenovo smart display.  And that is fantastic for content consumption as well.  And I don't think they really wanted to get into splitting the functionality of this too, too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, in fact, it has an analog clock on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be it's the only thing that mine does is clock is a very expensive frigging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also keeps the price down one hundred forty nine dollars.  So it's not much more than the famous seven inch Android tablet that we all loved so much that Google sold some years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a kind of akin to the Amazon Echo spot, only it's much more functional with a larger screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And the round screen in the spot kind of hinders it a little bit because nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was like a cool design, but yeah, so a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I would I would actually put this in in my closet where my spot is.  That would be reasonable.  My spot is basically my alarm clock with some voice additional stuff.  Yeah, I thought it was really interesting.  Google made a point of saying no camera.  Oh, that's the least of point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No camera on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And like Facebook's face.  By the way, I did order Facebook's portal.  Oh, why?  I had to act well because I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And your dear wife pointed out that this required you to reactivate Facebook.  Facebook's extremely frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, don't know.  Send it back right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is well, I may end up sending it back.  I had to order two.  This is the Facebook.  This is such a tone deaf product from Facebook, which is facing all these privacy concerns.  This thing has a camera built in that follows you automatically.  Oh, sure.  No problem.  Put that in your house.  Now Facebook can look around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin and I talked briefly about this, but here's the thing.  Yes, is this a privacy debacle?  Would people be excited about this?  No.  But Facebook, they've kind of been focused so much.  Remember the web and then they switched to mobile.  And now they're kind of we're entering this world with digital assistance and we're trying not to look at screens as much.  Yes, there is a screen component there.  But how do you spend time with your community if you don't call them on some weird communication device, right?  If you're not looking at a screen all the time.  So they have to have some play here.  It's just unfortunate that that their Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have Facebook on it.  It's the other weird thing.  It's you can't use it to browse Facebook.  You're kidding.  No, it's very limited.  It's a weird product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is Facebook's equivalent of the Amazon phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's basically a video phone.  It's like the AT&T video phone that they showed at the 1965 World's Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is you'll have sold two to you and maybe two to every other major publication out there that has to review gadgets.  And they'll be like, yes, we've sold 500 devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's private by design section here.  Apparently it means that there's a clip you could put over the camera.  That's it.  That's by design.  You can disable the camera.  Oh, and by the way, Facebook does not listen to a viewer.  Keep the contents of your portal video calls.  It has Amazon's Echo built in, not Jarvis.  I thought they should have put Jarvis in it, right?  But I guess the Amazon Echo.  This is why I'm buying it, because I want to read.  I want Jarvis in scale.  It's only a user of one.  I want to be able to read stories to my children and be the little pig or be the wolf.  And apparently when you're reading the story, it puts a little wolf face on you when you do the wolf.  No, I see the story time one more time.  Is there audio on this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't really want to hear it if there is.  Yeah, that's that's story time.  So no, I ordered it.  Remember, when I order buy stuff, even like cookware, I'm not buying as a private citizen.  I'm buying it for twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then don't you need a roadie robot?  No, that's exactly my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to buy technology stuff.  And that is the bread maker.  It's not technology.  It's a bread maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are seven different AI innovations in that roti maker.  It's a very impressive robot.  You are the devil.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I'll buy the roadie thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you know what's good on roadies?  What?  Keso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you guys are trying to kill me.  You just want me to have a heart attack.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could tell.  They're healthy.  Roti's are very healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing healthy about a Roti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not deep fat fried or anything.  It's got lots of butter on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These don't come out with butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's oil in there.  It goes through the oil pretty quick, I bet you.  Oh, yeah.  Twit needs to watch the carbs.  And I say that not as a private citizen.  So that's Facebook's competitor to the Google Home Hub.  $349 for the 15 inch display.  But you buy two, you save $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like the roadie robot.  You can get a discount for buying more than one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you?  Yeah.  I can buy eight robots.  So back to the home.  This doesn't have a camera.  That's how we got to this, which I thought was really smart of Google.  This is not a Google calling device.  This is like an Echo Show kind of.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You could do a call on it, but obviously the other person will not see you.  You'll just see them.  So you could do a duo call if you know anybody on duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it work with non-Google smart home products like, say, my Ring doorbell?  I presume it does.  I would hope it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I know it works great with the Nest on the home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, anything that works with Google.  Now, I don't know if Ring actually has an integration with Google Home because that is now owned by Amazon.  Right.  Now Arlo, it will show my Arlo cameras.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, good.  So that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you'll have to actually ask it to show the Arlo, whereas the Nest integration obviously  works.  Yeah, it just shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Photos also tightly integrated.  It becomes a photo frame.  It's funny how the photo frame is now once again in a live category.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we mock that, but my in-laws love those photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure they do.  So I'm like, eh.  And so does the Chinese government.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Paranoid.  Paranoid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just from a journalistic point of view, I got three really talented quality journalists  here with me.  All three of you.  Did Bloomberg Businessweek screw up?  Oh.  I, okay.  We're talking about, for those of you who are saying, what is he talking about?  On Thursday, Bloomberg Businessweek put out a story about super micro motherboards that  had been hardware hacked by Chinese spies to include a special chip on it that looked  about the size of a grain of rice.  It looked like a normal support chip, but actually phoned home.  Jordan Robertson and Michael Riley, the authors of the article, claimed they had 17 anonymous  sources, both in Apple, Amazon, and the federal government, that said, yes, there was this  chip.  Amazon discovered it when they were doing due diligence before they bought the elemental  technologies.  We use an elemental, but so does the Department of Defense.  Elementals are used for drones.  They're used in the Pentagon.  They're used by the Mormon church.  It would be an excellent device to place a spy chip on.  Then, the next day, massive denials from every company involved saying, that never happened.  It's wrong and misinformed, said Apple.  I'll tell you what I think.  I think it's not important whether it was super micro or not.  And by the way, there is a corroborating story also from these authors the next day or the  day, or I guess it was Sunday, saying that a security expert named Appleboom had discovered  a similar chip on a super micro motherboard destined for a U.S.  telecom.  But Appleboom did not deny it, but what he says is really the real point is this is happening  all the time.  You can't control the supply chain.  Sometimes it happens in the factory.  More often it happens in the process of mailing the motherboards that the U.S.  does it just as much as every other government does it.  It happens all the time and it's been going on for years.  And even years ago, we reported on this on Security Now.  A modified Ethernet chip was found on a motherboard that was phoning home.  So that's the bottom line.  And whether the details of this are accurate or not, this is absolutely not the case.  Nobody denies that this happens.  It's a problem.  And that these companies absolutely don't want you to talk about it because it's bad  for business for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But did Bloomberg Businessweek screw this up?  Stacy, you were starting to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I can't imagine that Bloomberg.  Seventeen sources.  Would have it is possible they didn't see the whole story.  It is also possible that our government is telling people like I tend to believe that  Bloomberg thought they were right.  Right.  Well, I know they thought they were right.  It was a prestigious.  But I mean, people do screw things up, but it feels like this isn't a screw up so much  as this is.  I can see the back half of the elephant and I'm calling it a rhinoceros.  Right.  And then everyone's like, no, no rhinoceros is here is what it feels like.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, what do you tell your students about this one?  I don't know, because I think we need more presumably.  I mean, I'm going only from what I've learned about journalism from from the, you know,  the post, but presumably these two reporters, 17 sources, that's a lot of sources.  A lot of people said they're anonymous.  I don't find that a problem at all.  That's normal operating procedure, especially with national security issues, because you're  not going to go on the record with this.  Seventy, if it were two, if it were three, I would say, oh, maybe they were being played  the national intelligence agencies who probably have a vested, I know our administration  has a vested interest in deprecating Chinese manufacturers.  So maybe that was, but if 17, some of them from Amazon, some of them from Apple, that's  an awfully large number.  Presumably, these two guys don't just get to put that on the magazine, by the way, on  the cover of the magazine, that there's an editor and an editor and a boss and a publisher,  all of whom say, okay, well, who are the sources?  Let me see your notes.  Who are doing some verification, right?  Right.  They're not doing it publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The economist is the chief of all content at Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So these are quality people.  And Bloomberg's standing behind it.  They're not putting the reporters out, hanging them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just weird that the 17 sources versus the vehement denials from those same companies.  That's the hard thing to explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the question, you know, on MacBreak Weekly, of course, the Mac guys, Andy and Ahko said,  oh, come on, Apple's not going to lie.  Here's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is the king of the artful denial.  But these are actually not artful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These were not artful.  They were unequivocal.  Is there SEC or some sort of regulatory issue if a publicly held company lies about something  like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, unless your point is there, is that they were, you know, would they follow the  orders of government to lie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said even we have not been told to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well, but that's like the first rule of fight club.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I guess if the SEC, well, first of all, the SEC already knows.  But if somebody went after them, let's say a shareholder lawsuit, they would say, oh,  Judge, let's go in your chambers and I want to just tell you something.  And they show them the national security letter that says you may not under any circumstances  reveal this.  And the judge says, OK, I'm going to dismiss out of hand.  I can't tell you why.  There will be more.  I mean, we're not done.  If this happened, there will be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the interesting thing you said, Leo, is whether it could happen someplace else  along the chain.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's the point.  It doesn't matter.  Really.  Supermicro is taking a huge bath.  Yes.  But it doesn't matter if Supermicro knew or didn't know or did it in the factory.  This thing happened.  These things happen all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't there physical proof that somebody has of this little tiny chip?  There's a there's a picture of the tiny thing on the finger.  OK, so well, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So you would have to have physical proof of the chip.  Bloomberg doesn't have that.  That picture was an illustration.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, the one guy on the record in the story said, I gave him that chip.  Fitzpatrick said, that's a picture I sent them.  They reused.  It wasn't the chip we found.  It was just an example.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they don't have the chip somewhere.  Someone has the chip if there is a chip.  And the idea.  So let's talk about what this means from a macro perspective, because this is a big  deal.  And this is a supply chain that we to get something equivalent, we would have to look  for the like how we brought car manufacturing back to the US and like like Japanese car  manufacturing to the US from in like the 80s and 90s, because we have outsourced so much  of this production.  We don't have the capabilities.  And I remember going through a packaging plan, which is how which puts a lot of these components  on a board and packages it up for servers and that sort of thing.  That shut down like 18 years ago.  So you know, we can't just bring this back.  And this is an easy thing to sort of infiltrate.  These are contractors, subcontractors come into this world.  It is not it is not secret.  So putting a component like this on a board, that's it's possible.  It's theoretically possible.  It's more than possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's already happening and everybody knows it's happening.  Everybody's acknowledged it's happening.  Even Brian Krebs says back 10 years ago when I was a reporter from the Washington Post,  I heard from an extremely well placed source that one Chinese tech company was on the United  States blocked entity list because they sold a custom hardware component for many internet  enabled printers.  They literally made a copy of every document or image sent to the printer and forwarded  to the Chinese government.  That was 10 years ago.  We know this happens.  There have been many stories.  We also know these stories are oftentimes quashed and that everybody involved from the  US government to these companies doesn't want these stories to become well known.  Bruce, I mean, Brian says in his article, supply chain security is the whole enchilada,  but no one's willing to pay for it.  But that we have literally, as you said, Stacey, given up on manufacturing in the United States.  Isn't that what blockchain is meant to fix?  I'm joking.  Blockchain.  Like it or not, he does this in italics, the vast majority of electronics are made in China  and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.  The central issue is we don't have any other choice right now.  The reason is that by nearly all accounts, it would be punishingly expensive to replicate  that manufacturing process here in the United States.  True that.  So it's, and by the way, it isn't just China.  And a lot of this is not a military espionage or cyber warfare.  A lot of it's industrial espionage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the other question, if we're going to get paranoid, is what does our own government  do to our own citizens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know the NSA is doing this kind of stuff.  Edward Snowden revealed it.  Right.  He was the one who talked about that ethernet chip.  So this is a new story.  The only thing really new in this story is the specifics about super micro Amazon and  Apple.  Maybe they got, I think you might be right, Stacey.  They thought it was a rhinoceros when it was really an elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the IEEE story about the X-ray and optical technology that you could run  your boards through just to check if there's any unauthorized or deviations from the design?  I thought that was kind of cool.  Chipworks does that.  Chipworks takes things apart.  I think the X-ray too.  Okay, maybe.  I mean, I'm sure you would X-ray it, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, good.  I wanted to bring that up.  That isn't the biggest story by any means here.  We've already done the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a huge story for journalists and it's a huge story in general for tech.  But there's a certain story for us.  And you know what it is.  And actually, let's start with the Wall Street Journal, sworn enemy of Google.  True.  Who wrote an article that really misstated the case.  Google exposed user data, feared repercussions of disclosing to public.  They opted not to disclose to its users its discovery of a bug that gave outside developers  access to private data.  It found no evidence of misuse.  The story is that last spring, Google discovered that the Google Plus API could be misused to  read everything in your profile, including the things that you marked private.  So I immediately went to my Google Plus profile and there's no credit cards numbers in there.  It doesn't have your other Google data in there.  It's your name address, jobs you worked at.  There were only two things I had marked private in that one.  One was my personal email address and one was my personal phone number.  And if somebody got that, I don't think it's the end of the world.  How about you?  Do you have anything in there, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I make nothing private.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's where all those spam calls are coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  Google did know about it back in the spring and fixed the bug.  Actually, we should now go to the Google Project Strobe post.  Fixed the bug.  Didn't tell anybody about it because to the best of their knowledge, which is imperfect  because they've been deleting logs every two weeks, it was never used.  Information was exfiltrated and since it had been fixed, they didn't feel like there was  anything to say about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And said that a bit indelicately like, oh, we don't need your father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then they said something which really surprised me.  So as a result, we're closing Google Plus.  Finding number one of Project Strobe, which by the way, Project Strobe is interesting.  It's what they call a root and branch review of third party developer access to Google  account and Android device data and of our philosophy around app data access.  So that was the problem.  Finding one, there are significant challenges in creating and maintaining a successful Google  Plus product that meets consumers' expectations.  So action one, we're shutting down Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this vision that Sundar said, is that still alive?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are doing that?  Yeah.  He thought that Gundurja Vikk took it with him.  Didn't Vikk take that with him?  So they're not shutting it down till August of next year.  Next year?  Of next year.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  August 2019.  So I went ahead and did the export of all my data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to be honest.  Every time I go to Google Plus, there's so much porno on it that I just kind of stop.  It's stuff that I wrote.  No, no, no.  Trey Radcliffe wrote a farewell.  So did Lauren Weinstein.  Lauren Weinstein, who was a genius at Google Plus.  They were the last ones left there.  But even on Lauren Weinstein's post about his farewell to Google Plus, the first comment  was sex, sex, sex and a link to a sex site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like it was it's it's obviously somebody rubbed my nose properly in a post when I said  some time ago on Twitter, no, New York Times, it's not a ghost town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I look like a ghost?  I'm there.  So much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are they advertising so much porn if no one's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good point, because spammers do it because it's easy and cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  What does Elton say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elton is the great defender of Google Plus.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what Mike said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trey Radcliffe wrote in because I think actually if anyone was the number one recipient of  benefit from Google Plus, Trey made his career based on Google Plus.  He made the service, too.  And he made the service.  He's a great photographer.  He was the number one followed photographer on Google Plus.  He was the number one followed photographer on Google Plus with eight and a half million  followers.  He wrote a post on Monday.  What I would have done if I were designing Google Plus, which I didn't read because who  cares?  But I mean, I've I mean, I've heard a lot of people, including Mike Yelgin, and I think  you, Jeff, talk about what Google Plus should have done.  They didn't do any of it.  Trey was a huge fan of Google Plus.  He thinks that sharing photos could have been the saving grace of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Flickr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like Flickr.  That did so well for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Mike, I have a few from his page.  One is social networking is dead.  It's dead, I tell you.  Poor Mike.  He loves Google Plus.  The best thing about Google Plus has always been its ability to attract great users.  From the start, the unlimited post size user moderation policy and comment centricism  favored substantive posting and commenting and the people who have who want to have real  conversations.  But I'm losing Google Plus.  But I don't want to lose you, says Mike and says where to find it.  And that's what everybody's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then another post.  They call them the pluspera.  Google is Google plus diaspora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike argues Google is the new Yahoo.  That I might agree with.  Remember Yahoo?  20 years ago, Yahoo.com got more traffic than any site on the Internet, but it failed to  evolve in place of evolution or innovation.  Yahoo simply started buying everything with the intention of integrating it.  But it was unable to integrate anything in a compelling way.  I get the anger and I share Mike's angst.  But I'm not sure that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I follow a ton of photography sites, as you can see.  So my Google Plus looks very different from your Google Plus, but it's a great place to  put pictures, as you can see, high quality pictures.  And so it's kind of it's kind of a shame.  A lot of this stuff, this is actually tame spam.  A lot of this stuff is spam.  A lot of the comments were spam.  In order to keep the comments spam out.  And this is what Mike really wishes Google had done.  You have to go through your comments and carefully prune it all out.  And he says they should have followed the Twitter model.  Sorry, sorry not to laugh.  Yeah it's sad.  But that's the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we have taps?  Can we play taps for Google Plus?  That's the changelog right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No more Google Plus.  Actually there's a few.  We've really been doing the changelog with all of the Google announcements, but there  are a few other things.  Google has done some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want the intro?  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know you had it in your pocket.  Thank you.  Google Photos is doing an update, a considerable update to Google Photos.  And I guess this ties to the new phones.  They talked about some of this at the event.  So you'll be able to for instance adjust the depth just like you do on a Pixel 3.  You'll be able to do that on Google Photos as well.  That's kind of cool.  The top shot feature is coming to Google Photos.  If you post a motion photo you'll be able to do that as well.  I think there's a new checkbox, which I don't see here in this article.  There's a new checkbox in Google Photos that has to do with sharing.  I'm trying to remember the details on that.  Let's see if I can find it.  I don't see it here.  What else?  Making your connected home even smarter with Google Home and Nest.  I guess that's the Home Hub.  Does it have Zigbee or Z-Wave or anything like that in this Home Hub?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it have Weave and Thread?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does not have Thread.  That's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that a Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was.  It was a Tony Fidel Google thing.  So they developed it under that.  And my hunch is they're like, that's a little weird.  Let's just screw that over.  No more.  Google even runs its own thread-ready version of Thread.  It's not the official thread.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they invented it and used it ahead of time and put all these radios and software  into their gear way before the standard came out.  So when the standard came out, they were like, we'll adapt it.  And the standards people were like, yeah, OK, you're Google.  We would still love to have you work with our stuff.  So that's how that rolled.  And now they're like abandoned again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new Home app.  I'm sure you're excited about that.  More control at your fingertips and updated Home app.  All devices in one view.  Quick actions.  It's really pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as part of this, Google, they have these lights, the GE lights that are tied into the  Google Hub.  And that's apparently you can just plug those lights in or screw them in and they will connect  automatically to the hub.  So that's doing something that both HomeKit and Amazon have done in the past or recently,  fairly recently, on making it easier to connect stuff.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it can tell you if your lights are on, right?  If you left some stuff, some things, if they're still on, like it can warn you.  You can get a notification.  You left the living room lights on that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that happening?  Kevin, did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't see that.  Are you sure that's not the hunches with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like Amazon hunches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's Amazon.  All right.  I get them all confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon did change their Madam A app.  So that also happened.  Everybody's moving like in lockstep.  Oh, oh, I'm going to tell you about an exclusive I had because it relates actually to Google.  Ta-da!  This was last week.  So I'm just going to share it.  Google or Walmart is actually saying to smart home device makers that want to sell stuff  in Walmart that they need to support Google Home or they shouldn't be, they won't be listed  in the store.  So you can't just have a lot of stuff.  You have to have Google Home as well.  They also, if you do support a lot of stuff, you should put that on the back of the box  or the side of the box.  It should not be the most prominent part of the box.  Those are two things that I had heard from many, many, many, many people.  They were all anonymous.  Jeff, so sorry.  Nobody wants to go up against Walmart.  So that was six companies told me that.  And then a couple of them actually said that Walmart was encouraging them to get off AWS.  So it sounds like Walmart is pushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart is encouraging them to get off AWS.  What was that matter to them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've actually in the past, like last year, they encouraged a lot of their tech vendors  to get off of Amazon Web Services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because, but isn't that a little anticompetitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's not.  I mean, it's it's they asked people to.  They did not demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like Microsoft asked you to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, it's it's it would be nice if you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens when that happens?  You're nice.  I mean, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see a reason, like especially if you wanted someone.  I mean, you could encourage people to have infrastructure in both spots, too.  That would be kind of more resilient anyway, even though it's harder as an architectural  decision and more expensive.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember the one thing and this really comes from the new Google Home Hub.  Live albums have been added to Google Photos, and that means you can check a box next to  any album and it will automatically be updated.  And the whole idea is that then if you're sharing to family and friends on their home  home, they'll get it.  They'll get it always up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that that works with people or pets.  So like when I take I actually have shared photo albums, Norm has a following, apparently.  And when I add photos or take photos of Norm, those photos will automatically be added  to the Google Home Hub Live album.  So they're kind of using like their search algorithm stuff and computer vision to just  update your photos on the Home Hub on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you choose the people and the pets you want to keep track of.  Photos will automatically add photos of them to your album as you take them.  And by the way, the album doesn't require to be shared to a Google Home Hub.  I could share it to anybody who has Google Photos and that album would be updated there  as well. Live albums now rolling out in a number of countries on Android, iOS and the  web. And that is the Google Change Log.  It is a big week for the change log if you include all the announcements, a lot of new  products coming out.  Let's see if we if we covered everything.  I'm going to go back now.  I had been jumping all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we haven't actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jumping all over the place.  Amazon's eliminating monthly bonuses and stock awards for warehouse workers after  raising wages to $15 an hour.  You know, Amazon giveth, Amazon taketh away.  Oh, I love the AI recruiting tool that Amazon was using.  That had a little bit of a bias against women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jesus, guys, we think for one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've stopped using it. Amazon says that they were really hoping to.  This is the Holy Grail.  According to Reuters, everyone wanted this Holy Grail.  They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes.  It spits out the top five and we'll hire those.  By 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software  developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender neutral way.  And this is something we've seen time and time again.  When you train these models, you're training with the biases that the material that  you're training them with has. And of course, they're using resumes that were submitted  to the company for a 10 year period.  And most of them came from men.  So as a result, and this is, you know, this is not a surprise.  Amazon system taught itself that male candidates were preferable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just like people today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like real people.  AI just like real people.  It penalized resumes that included the word women's in them, as in women's chess club  captain, it downgraded graduates of two all women colleges.  She's Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to those terms, but they finally  disabled, disbanded the team and stopped using it because they just got a tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not an expert in any of this, but it seems you just got to do a test of  seeing what the outcomes are. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you might even be blind to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might say problem. You share those biases.  But so if it's a number, I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could say, well, the reason it's not giving us an equal representation of women is  because they're just that aren't that many applying.  Just like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I know your result may end up being, well, we prefer Ivy League  schools, for instance.  But what you what you might not seeing is the underlying fact that that then prefers  men. But what I'm saying is what you might.  But you're right. If you looked at the raw number or you build in a desired result,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is no matter what the data show, give me a preponderance of good women candidates,  give me a preponderance of people of color, give me a preponderance of this or that.  That's called affirmative action.  Yeah. And there's no law involved here.  It's the it's the app and you can build that into the affirmative action into Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  scrapped it instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if you could make and this is interesting because, you know, if we're thinking  we're thinking about doing AI and so many more avenues of life, what if we just become  more astute about the key metrics that matter?  Right. So your college doesn't really matter.  And that becomes kind of like letting people like remember when orchestras let people  audition behind a curtain.  So it could become kind of a curtain.  So maybe you do the tech classes or the tech languages you need.  And I don't know if that's possible.  I'm just trying to think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that that's more sophisticated.  The problem is what they're doing is dumping.  They're doing machine learning and they just dump crap in there.  And you're absolutely right.  The smarter the better way to do it may not look as artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's to think a little bit more about the data.  It would be cleaning up the data more before running it.  Maybe that's it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're also looking at the outcomes.  You want you want to test the outcomes against certain criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a product you might be able to buy in a year or so.  Andy Rubin, as you know, was the creator of Android, went to Google, ran Android for  Google for many years, then left to start a company called Essential.  Essential's first phone was a flop.  Unfortunately, they said they were going to build a home automation hub.  They've decided to stop work on that and a second phone and focus on a phone  that I don't know when they're going to come out with it, but it is a tiny phone,  has a small screen and requires users to interact mainly with voice commands.  The phone would respond to text messages automatically.  Doesn't Google kind of already do that?  Well, maybe the ideas for the product of book appointments or responding emails and  text messages on its own.  All right. All that users would also be able to make phone calls from the plan device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a portable assistant, maybe that you wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it isn't a phone.  Maybe it's not. Yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because what's the Sam Lessons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Viv. Viv.  Viv. No, no, that was the one that Samsung bought.  Sam's is yeah.  His is humans, though.  Is it mostly? Oh, really?  That's why it's so expensive.  It's pretty pricey.  I used it for a little while and I didn't use it enough to justify it,  but it's basically human assistance to essential raised  three hundred million dollars because of Andy Rubin's name.  So they have I guess they have some leftover.  So so they're going to work on the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, it was going to the podcast service and ended up abandoning that for Twitter.  Yeah, it could be. He's a smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They put the Home Speaker Project on hold.  They according to Mark Gurman, who had this story in Bloomberg Technology,  they've already lost key engineers working on the project and  admit disagreements over the prospects for launching such an ambitious device.  So back to the drawing board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if this is a pivot on the ambient  OS, which is what Ruby was touted.  And he was touting that was going to be a smart home platform  or he's got something completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's what you mean.  Maybe that's exactly right.  It's just a different form factor for.  According to Gurman and a person  familiar with the development of this phone, a first prototype  should be finished by the end of the year.  And the person said the company might show off the device  to industry partners as soon as January at CES.  That'd be interesting.  I would be interested in such a thing.  Wouldn't you? I mean, yeah, I don't.  I mean, what is this device?  It's not a phone so much anymore.  No, I think the big screen and trend is towards bigger screens  because you're doing things that are screening on it.  But what if you had a separate device that wasn't screening?  What if it was just handling communications tasks?  And if we made a movie about it called Her.  And if you fell in love with it  and then it ran off to join the other AIs  and you were stuck with your high water pants and your bad mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff's looking at us funny.  You must have missed that movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on Netflix now.  It's an awesome movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good movie. It's depressing.  Oh, oh, her. Right. OK.  It's a little depressing. Yes, it is.  Isn't it? I think Stacey, you were the one who was told me it was depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's just depressing because everyone's so lonely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I think it's depressing because they all wear their pants up here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that is also not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see there was one guy from the future during the Google event?  Do we have I don't know if we have a video of that Shiggy with Shiggy there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the new Shiggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Google. I want to be the new Shiggy.  Shiggy. Shiggy.  I want to be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find the made with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just the playground thing they showed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, let me see if I can find the video.  I'm going to have to really run through this fast to find him because he only was a  it was nice. They brought a lot of different people up on stage.  Sundar was not there at any point, right?  No, this is just their promotional video.  Was it a presenter or was it a presenter?  I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.  Now I'm just embarrassed. Now we're all curious.  I'm just embarrassed.  There's a guy who was wearing a suit that looked like it was made out of the same  material, the same fabric, but it had a vest that had a very short  little window.  And then the suit was charcoal pepper, salt and pepper, and his hair was.  Oh, was it? Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it is a Mark Spates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was it was Mark Spates.  It's Mark Spates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Spates is the best dressed man in the Internet of Things.  Oh, my.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's that's Damien with faint praise.  I suspect it was Mark Spates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right. No, she's correct.  I'm serious. So he's known for being kind of a fashion plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. He is a fashionista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love when he turns and you can see his vest.  Because it was not a normal vest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not. No, he doesn't.  He's got a style, man.  I must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the head of connected.  He was the head of connected home platform at Logitech.  And now product leaders, smart speakers at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like he's one of the smartest people out there.  Oh, yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I just thought if you're going to make a movie about the future,  that's how people would dress for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in I wondered when you started talking,  when I was like, and when you mentioned the charcoal,  I was like, oh, I've seen this suit.  I know exactly what this is.  Yeah, I think that's is he wearing his red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, you're the you're the one who tweeted the best dressed person in IOT.  Here's his here's your tweet.  He retweeted you.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. I forget what color shoes he had, Stacey, but they were  very fashionable. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're light and no socks.  And in the future, no one wore socks because that's superfluous.  Just like a necktie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. If you're going to wear your pants that high ankle cut pants.  No socks because that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a really hot.  You don't think I'd look good in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid you think he invents surf, go shopping for.  I'd look like. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I bought a Bavarian vest.  I love this. It goes all the way up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want this to come back.  Yeah. I have a vested interest in vests.  That was below you.  This 20 year old is, according to Motherboard, archiving  thousands of flash banner ads from the early 2000s triggered me.  So you can relive the old days of online casinos and lower my bills as he's got  four gigabytes of them so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slap the monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Remember that?  Yeah. Oh, boy.  Now, please are hideous.  These are so bad.  They were hideous.  I got to find. I have to.

Transcript:  I have to give. I have to run in like 20 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just to get. We're done.  I'm just I'm just filling right now.  I want to make you anxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not anxious.  I'm giving myself time, but I'm just letting you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the problems this kid's going to have is in a couple of years,  Adobe says there won't be any more flash, so he's going to have to figure out  a way to play these back.  Tyler Grant, he has archived over sixty six thousand banner ads from the early 2000s.  Wow. Where's the site?  I got to go. I got to go to the site.  Now, I want to I want to check that out.  I hate articles that don't don't link to the stuff.  I know it's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate articles about date lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All articles should have a date.  All articles. Yeah.  Not a deadline. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A date. Grant has a pastebin page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What of the Internet archives?  He pulls them off the archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was wondering where he's fortunately.  I don't think I have flash on my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, fortunately, you don't.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fortunately, I don't have flash on my computer.  Netflix is actually buying a studio in Albuquerque with nine sound stages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't imagine the stars.  I mean, Albuquerque is a lovely city.  I love it, but I can't imagine the stars want to go there.  They've already been producing stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Breaking Bad was in Albuquerque.  Well, but the story was too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's actually there are studios all over the country in weird places,  believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of it to avoid the Los Angeles unions.  Yeah. Nobody, for instance, wants.  I've heard from many actors and others wants to go to Vancouver again.  But that that every everything is shot in Vancouver because they don't have the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but Vancouver so nice.  I love Vancouver.  I was like Albuquerque.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the company's called ABQ.  It will create a thousand new jobs and a billion dollars in the Albuquerque economy.  They shot the Avengers there and Sicario.  So a couple of movies have already been shot there.  Netflix is is deciding to do their own thing, make their own.  And they like New Mexico.  It's dry. It's a dry heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little cool here today.  I always thought it was always hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know we're having a well, winter is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, speaking of archivists, and I'm trying to get this guy,  we'd love to get this guy on the show.  Mark Graham is the guy who runs the way back machine.  He did a podcast in which he revealed  some interesting information about.  Oh, actually, this was at the ONA conference.  I know him. He's a good guy. Yeah.  He was a he did a whole bunch of archiving of television news.  Ah, he said, let me see if I can find the numbers.  1.6 million news programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what he's doing. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got 78, 200,000, 78 recently donated by the Boston Library,  an extensive video game collection.  The Internet Archive adds four petabytes of information a year,  four million gigabytes a year.  Their total way back machine content is 22 petabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do they get the money to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Brewster Kale funded it initially, and I think they get people to help them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing, because I never hear the begging, but it's a really valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's well, maybe all those flash ads are actually ads on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The mission statement Internet Archive has been around for 22 years.  The mission statement is simple, universal access to all knowledge.  The problem, of course, was that the Internet, as great as it was,  is disappearing, right? As job, you know, flash ads disappear and so forth.  So Graham says we try to get everything, but it's challenging.  Embeds, JavaScript's interactive apps.  We can't get some of this stuff, but we're working on it.  You can boot an old version of Mac OS, a system seven on it.  You can run the hypercard on it.  It's really important.  Really, it was too warped. Yeah.  He says, I love Google, but their job isn't to make copies of the homepage  every 10 minutes. Ours is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hit use bookstores everywhere I go now because I'm trying to search.  And so down in Menlo Park, there's a used bookstore there.  And I got a book that was all about bookshelves.  Not only are the books disappearing, but the shelves, the shelves are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I love books and bookshelves.  Yeah. All I ever wanted was a big deal.  A lot of the original libraries had chained books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, not that old. It was like the 1400 1500s.  Well, I went to Yale

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and the Beinecke Rare Book Library, where they do have, in fact, a Gutenberg Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. They're also having a book library.  There also have a map of Finland  that was used to demonstrate that the Vikings came to America before Columbus did.  And here we are in Columbus Day Week or Indigenous People's Day,  as it's widely referred to now.  This map is now finally being analyzed because it really is just a hoax.  Some undergraduate tore a page out of a manuscript and drew this map,  but nobody's ever admitted to it.  And it's always been one of the jewels of the Beinecke collection.  It's finally it's finally getting it's  it's the same people who analyze the Shroud of Turin.  Are finally going to take a look at the the Vinland map.  Fifteen came to be a 15th century map of the world.  OK, that is not my pick of the week.  Could have been.  But I think it's time for our picks of the week.  It's Jeff is in studio.  I think we should let him do his number first.  Let me see which one I want to use.  Pick a number, any number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is an underground food economy on Facebook. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I want to join Facebook now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You can buy roadie.  No, can you buy stuff so you can buy food?  These are things that are, you know, it's not the health department would go after you.  You're not supposed to do this.  But but grandma is selling her brownies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is becoming a real problem because a lot of people are starting to cook  in their kitchens and sell this stuff via these various delivery services.  Right. And it's not regulated by the health department or anything.  But it's grandma. Yeah.  She would poison you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I like that one. I thought that was an interesting one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you want to give us the address if people still use?  Facebook. It's just you go to various people are selling various locally on Facebook.  You haven't done a disclaimer all show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Facebook. Yes.  So I raised money for the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism from Facebook.  I have no official ties to Facebook.  I received no money from Facebook personally, and I'm independent of Facebook.  End of disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin Toffle, do you have a pick for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. I'm actually excited.  I have not used this yet, but I have just received  the Anki Vector Robot.  Oh, the new one.  The new one. So yeah.  This has all of its smarts on board.  There's a Qualcomm 200 level chip in there and Wi-Fi.  So it's got computer vision.  It can recognize your face. It can speak.  They are adding.  I just found today they're working on their Alexa integration,  which surprised they're doing that because they weren't going to do that.  But I got this because it's cute. It's fun.  It's autonomous.  So you set it up with a phone app and then it just does its thing  and reacts to you by voice.  Well, just like my echo is right now.  And there's what it looks like.  Pixar people helped develop the facial features and the little animations.  It's got personality.  See, he's shaking around his head and whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that is the robot smart enough to take over the world, but too nice to.  Yeah, that's a good that's a good slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The other reason I got this and I got it on Kickstarter,  even though Anki didn't need to do that because they're an established company.  It was one ninety nine on Kickstarter and it's two forty nine.  Yeah, it's it's small.  I mean, obviously it's it's very, very small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cosmo, it's a darker, smarter version of the Cosmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct. Where do I get where do I get the baby drone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not that robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the Boston Dynamics dog.  So this is their ad has all these robots that you maybe don't want in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  You'll even go back and just charging cable and all that.  So the other reason, Leo, that I got this was because the SDK is coming out  in December and it's all Python based.  Yay, Python.  Yes, yes.  So I'm excited for that.  And then if you guys can share the photo that I have on the on on there,  this is my bonus pixel three Excel portrait mode.  Wow, is that good?  Look at that.  But that is that is using the new color pop that they have  that works with portrait mode.  So that's why you see the gold on the robot and everything else  is kind of grayish, gray scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, the color pop picks something to make color the foreground  and then everything else is black and white in the background.  That was that cover.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's it's actually a filter.  But what you do is you then tap on the screen and pick what you want,  which color you want to pop.  So I could have changed that to have the white box be a color,  because I guess white is a color really absence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's a very cool piece.  I'm getting it just for the camera.  And I'm going to do this right now.  I'm going to say this right now.  I did an experiment last trip.  I only brought one camera and one lens.  It was a manual focus lens.  This next trip, I'm only going to bring a pixel three.  Where's the next trip?  Instead of all the fancy camera gear that I've spent so much money.  Where are you going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When is the next trip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hawaii in the spring.  Oh, my.  But I don't know where or anything else, because Lisa's surprising me.  She says, I'll tell you when you get on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so, Kevin, before you were off you,  the last question I have to ask you as the expert is, all right.  So if I had a thousand dollars burning the hole in the pocket, which do I buy?  The phone or the slate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you keep your Pixelbook in either right?  I keep everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What phone are you using now? Pixel 2?  Pixel 2 XL.  So you have the most recent of you're only a year old in either one of those.  Yeah. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe I'm biased, Jeff.  I'd probably go for the slate because.  I just would.  I mean, you're getting a full Pixelbook experience, but it's lighter, more mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you are Dr. Chromebook.  Yeah, but I'm Chromebook guy, too.  Yeah, I think that maybe it's not going to fix any problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that you have with the Pixelbook, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think Carson's going to do that soon.  Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because the two, the Pixel 2 to the three.  Sure, it's nice, but is it a thousand dollars nice?  I don't know. I guess you could say the same with the slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Dr. Toffle, you'll be sorry when you see my pictures from Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, you could buy the Rotimatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, there's a third choice.  What's behind door number three?  It's the road, the magic.  Make your own bread, not at pizzas with a road in medic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A 3D roadie printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even counts your roadie even counts your roadies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now Stacey Higginbotham and her pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Oh, man.  You guys, I'm going to stop traveling for a while.  So it's very exciting.  But until I get to my home, I'm back in Appland.  Actually, two things. I'll give you two things.  One that is kind of like fun.  I saw this at the Smart Kitchen Summit.  It is a app. It's only on iOS right now.  It's called Suggestic S-U-G-G-E-S-T-I-C.  And what it does is it helps you.  You pick a nutrition plan like vegan or vegetarian.  Or in my case, I've got someone in my family with the low FODMAP diet,  which is freaking esoteric or Whole30.  You tell it that and then it is it.  It gives you recipes that meet that need.  But also, if you're near restaurants that have things you can eat,  it will pop up when you're at a restaurant  and tell you what you can eat in those places.  So some of it is paid, some of it is free,  some of the design, like some of the food preferences you might have to pay for.  But you should check it out, see if you can use the free site.  And if you like it, you know, level up to the paid.  But I thought because I have people in my life that are on freaky diets,  this was actually kind of a really neat service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Suggestic. Suggestic.com.  So what's the diet? FOD?  Oh, FODMAPs. FODMAPs.  Just don't even. Don't even get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't even. All right.  Oh, and here's my other thing, because I just watched it,  because, again, traveling all the time.  This is so old. It's from 2009.  But if you have stars, Party Down is an amazing two season show.  That is all. I never heard of it.  It is hilarious.  And I cannot believe I hadn't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A group of actors moved to Los Angeles to make it big,  but end up working as caterers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just trust me on this one.  It is like Arrested Development Bunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, the cameos are worth it.  Steve Gutenberg is in one episode.  That was a really good episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You like Marvel's Mrs. Meisel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, love that show.
