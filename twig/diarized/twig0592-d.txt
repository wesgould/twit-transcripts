Transcript:  This week on This Week in Google, our last show of the year.  Stacey's here, Jeff's here, Ant's here, the whole gang's here.  There's a lot of random stuff to talk about.  We're going to give Jeff some good news about the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2.  We'll talk about another podcast network, this time being sold to Amazon for hundreds of millions of dollars.  And is Substack the future of media? It's all coming up next on TWIG.  Podcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From people you trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is TWIG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is TWIG This Week in Google.  Episode 592, recorded December 30th, 2020.  Hats on sticks.  It's time for TWIG This Week in Google.  Last show of the year, everybody.  Episode 592, it's the 30th day of December.  Stacey Higginbotham is all bundled up because she's the closest to the North Pole here.  Stacey on iot.com.  Hi Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Jeff might be close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff's in Jersey.  Jersey, as they said in Hamilton, everything's legal in Jersey.  I don't think you could ever say that Jersey's close to the North Pole.  Could you really say that?  You're saying latitudinally he might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do I find this out? Google Maps should tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, what is my latitude?  Google's really good on that.  And see if it does it. Maybe not. No, it doesn't.  It ought to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, it does.  Okay, so my latitude is 47.6062 degrees north.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's at the 47th parallel.  Mr. Jivis, where are you?  47th and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know yet. It didn't do it for me.  What city in New Jersey are you in?  I'm at latitude of 40.76.  Oh yes, he's in the 40s. He's not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.  Hunter.  And also with us, a man whose heart is deep in the south.  But whose body and mind we have brought north, Mr. Ant Pruitt from Hands on Photography.  Hello, Anthony Pruitt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello, Mr. Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said you were going to say y'all a bunch on the show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I plan on saying that word a few times because awesome listeners and followers on Twitter tend to enjoy little tidbits like that for their drink of dinner.  Drink up, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw this going on on Twitter.  Jeff said his drinking game would be Gutenberg, but I think moral panic would really get you a little higher.  That's when I drink.  What would we say for Stacey?  That's what's third on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it was y'all for Stacey.  Oh, yes, she says y'all too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm a Southerner too, so I can't help it. I'm going to have to say y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's twice the drinking. I think that's just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just say yo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just going to have to do this to Stacey because we should start the show with a nightmare.  Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  Can I mention something?  Yeah.  We intro the show this week in Google and we actually use the Google service to start the show.  Oh, that's right.  Good point.  We set a record. So there we go.  Our work is done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't have to do any more Google for the rest of the show.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the dancing robots.  This makes Stacey so happy.  I'm sure I'm not.  This will get us taken down for sure.  Let me turn on my audio, though, just in case, because I think you really should hear it.  Or maybe not. Maybe it's more interesting without the music.  Imagine, if you will, a robot dancing to Do You Love Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Leo, you sing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said this is what the robots are going to look like when they dance on our graves.  That is an appropriate comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, they're lovable now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you not love this?  You and your.  Notice, though, that there is a robot is noticed the angles of motion it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is also a wall between them and the humans.  I don't think that's by accident.  I think it's a real litmus test for how people feel about robots and technology.  Because my data, the problem.  Some people look at this and go, oh, isn't that cute?  The robots are dancing. They're still dancing.  And other people look at it and go, oh, my God, imagine that coming bounding out of the forest with armor running at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just imagine. I mean, think about this.  You know, let's say you're a dissident and the police use these robots.  Yes.  But it doesn't matter how well they dance with.  They can use those same moves like they're agile.  Like karate kid you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. They're agile is the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And really, that's the Charlie Hoover sent that to me.  He's a fan of the show as well.  And at the he sent it to me.  I asked him, I said, does this humanize it more for you?  Because that was the first thing that come to my mind is everybody just being all like Miss Stacy and afraid of them.  But I think this is just another leap, if you will, and bound for just how far this tech has come and what it could potentially be for us.  We've all wanted robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Should it? Would it? Does it concern any of you that now it's owned by a South Korean firm Hyundai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's probably actually better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't concern me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, when Google had it, I was a little worried.  Yeah, Google sold it. Softbank had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now Hyundai, which makes sense because Hyundai makes, you know, everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, what strikes me is if the first thing they had done was not the scariest stuff that they had done this, if they'd done if they'd done a robot ballet, I think we'd look at it.  There was a little ballet.  Really was. If they enclosed them with a different, they didn't look so mechanical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gives a nutcracker kind of a whole new meaning, though.  Not exactly a Christmas festivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only you. Anyway, I would tell you, even if they danced first for me, I would still be terrified of them because they represent an agile, scary device that could be used against people.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's the same reason, like, if you're dancing with a gun, I still think, dude, that person has a gun.  Same with cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's nice that he dances, but I just don't dance over here, buddy boy.  Well, here's the Google angle on that.  You'll now be able to, if they do a TikTok video, find it on Google search because they are now going to put TikTok and Instagram and other short form video at the top, not just YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Carousel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the carousel of Google love.  Okay, I got a good I got the Google angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know is how are they going to how are they going to what's the tax taxonomic structure they're going to use to search and categorize and prioritize them.  How the heck do you know what it's about?  Do you tag your TikToks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure you tag them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but that's that's that's not reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Can you put robot text in here?  Tick tocks robots robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you say robots?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask one of the kids because they would know I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Google has a I that can say like broadly this person absolutely this person is happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you use Google Photos, you know that they can they can they don't need any tags.  They can categorize all how would they get how would they guess Sarah Cooper's videos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Does Google never use any human input?  Do they ever have any like categorizers in judging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to hire a bunch of teenagers to what do you call this?  Videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's kind of lip syncing.  I don't know.  Is it comedy?  Work though.  It's not funny, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that would be awesome.  My daughter would be like, oh, this is another stupid this type of, you know, because there's  the whole I tried to convince.  OK, I'm still working on this, y'all.  But I tried to convince my family to learn it.  Drake Drake.  Do over the holidays.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Y'all we had a y'all.  Y'all have a topo chico, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no one will do it with me.  And I'm really sad because we don't have to put it on the Internet.  But I thought what better way to celebrate the holidays when you're cooped up inside  the learning a tick tock dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me I know.  In fact, it's such a big it's such a phenomenon now, cultural phenomenon now that I see more  and more advertisers doing either tick tock style advertising.  I watch a lot of watch an awful lot of football over the past week.  I couldn't do much else.  And there was yeah.  Whether I watched NFL, I'm sorry, I didn't watch college football.  But there was a lot of tick tock like ads.  And then Jack in the Box actually, they didn't say tick tock, but they actually said we have  a new version of the chicken dance and they did tick tock style.  You saw that, right?  If you look at it, that was clearly hoping tick tock influencers would pick it up.  And this is such a phenomenon now.  And yet and by the way, among the ads on the NFL, a lot of ads by paid for by tick tock.  The NFL also used tick tock in its ads.  And I wasn't clear which were which to be honest with you.  That was unclear.  So isn't tick tock status in hanging in the by a thread?  What's going on?  Is it is it over?  What did your president say about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to they're going to they're going to hang on for 21 days.  21 days and then never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, we do have just for you the story behind how Ratatouille the tick tock musical was made.  Oh, boy.  I did this to you.  Is that it?  Did I find it already?  Did I did I find the Easter egg already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that's not it.  That's not it.  But you know what?  I failed here.  I have been trying for the last hour to buy a ticket for you.  And their ticketing is down to see Ratatouille.  Yeah, I was trying to surprise them.  But it's it's online.  And it says we're finding your seat for you.  Oh, I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that tickets are on sale now at Ratatousical.  It does look it's for a good cause at the Actors Fund.  Two days, one hour, 20 minutes.  I heard Wayne Brady is doing it.  Who?  So this is part of the story.  Look at the cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cast is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's one of the stories.  I don't know if Wayne Brady is unbelievable.  But OK, let me first.  Well, I like Wayne Brady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, for for a pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, whose line is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love how they put like the whole month of January, like there's going to be a lot of tickets available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one day.  Oh, they're doing it in cities.  Is this a physical thing you go see?  No, this is this is this is a platform for buying tickets.  Oh, I see.  I get it. I get it.  So they don't know that they don't know all the shows are closed.  All right.  Ratatouille goes through the cast.  The other stories up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will. I can't go click off of it yet.  There we go.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why it's not a democracy.  I don't know if I have to explain this to you.  No, Leo, it's a revolution.  Only I know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The authoritarian report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Titus Burgess and and let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who else is Adam Lambert?  Adam Lambert.  Isn't that that dude on the voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he's like one of them.  What's that annoying singer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's either the voice or the mass singer.  No, Wayne, Brett, Kevin Chamberlain, Mary Testa, Priscilla Lopez.  You know, he was he won the he won either the American Idol or the voice.  I can't remember which one and who's going to be remme.  Who's going to be Rebbe?  That's the question.  She you want to watch just a little, just a little.  Yes.  Yeah, we've seen this.  Oh, you've already seen this.  I wasn't here.  Remme is Titus Burgess.  Oh, perfect.  Perfect.  Love Titus Burgess.  Five dollars.  Send them to five bucks and not watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have to watch it.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to do a thing where the more the more minutes you watch it, the more you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going to be able to watch it.  The more the more minutes you watch it, the more people will give to the cause.  You'll be duty bound morally bound because you're a nice good man to watch the whole  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're going to put it on Twig Watchathon.  So Reddit, Reddit bought a TikTok rival called Dub Smash, hoping to add their kind of TikTok  style creation tools to Reddit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't associate Reddit with fun teenagers hanging out doing dance moves.  Well, clearly you don't follow the right subreddits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reddit really even more than Twitter has its own personality, depending on which subreddits  you follow.  I only follow like programming and geek stuff and it's completely bland.  I follow the smart home stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's perfect for that.  Oh no, the sourdough one's pretty good.  Yeah, no, I used to follow that one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Another reason for Leo to be depressed today.  Apparently, I didn't know this, but Wondery, you knew already, didn't you?  Wondery was one of the last great independent podcast companies.  Did you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's one more.  There's one left.  When it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's official now.  Amazon got them for 300 million.  When we talked about it last September, mostly we were saying was Apple decline, Spotify  decline because it was so much money.  Wondery is only four years old.  We don't know the exact price, but the speculation is 300.  Their best shows are true crime series like, and I'm sure you've all listened to Dirty  John, Dr. Death, and who can forget the warm heartwarming over my dead body.  Now, here's the good news.  They have 10 million uniques a month, which is only about twice what we have.  So I figure 150 million.  You take 150.  That's fair.  Take Leo out.  Take me out, man.  Bezos.  Yeah, it's Bezos.  The real deal is Wondery has a lot of Hollywood deals, TV shows in the works, things like  that, because true crime makes for good TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I worked for Cunninghast and I worked for Time Inc.  And TV Guide, they all thought they were going to have Hollywood deals.  They hired executives to do this, and it never worked.  Never.  Yeah.  What was the disconnect?  I remember one year we had the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would it not work if you have connections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Still, these are huge media companies.  And even when Time Inc. became part of Time Warner, it didn't work.  I'll always remember we had the year end most intriguing people, and they had dancers coming  out singing the names.  Like Walenza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, you just got your answer in.  That's why it didn't work.  Oh, wow.  Maybe if they had Titus Burgess doing.  No, I think all these deals are hard to do in the first place.  Second, you know, Hollywood, I don't care, still looks askance at tech and tech looks  askance at Hollywood.  This whole thing of convergence, we've been talking about this now for almost 20 years.  It is, Quibi is the latest, greatest example of tech Hollywood convergence.  It's just, it's an impede- I call it an impedance mismatch, but that's a pretty geeky way to  talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly why I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was about to say, well, now we know why we're not getting bought.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my mind, it's an impedance mismatch.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it fair to say that it's the best way for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me talk about spectral efficiency and see how low we can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And the big Andean architectures versus little Andean architectures, they don't like tech.  They think they don't know.  But Wondery was founded by a guy from Hollywood.  It's only a couple of years old and they made the right decisions, the right deals.  If your goal is to get acquired, you tell me, Jeff, because you've been in and out of a lot of these.  There's a different way you build a company if your goal is to get acquired than if you  want to just build a company that makes a product that you think is pretty good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't know that I know anything more than you or anybody else, but yeah, you're  right.  And it goes back to the 2000 crash.  You use the money to put a lot of hats on sticks over the Fort Wall and make it look  like you're gigantic and you have traction.  I need to be able to say things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an analogy.  A lot of hats on sticks over the Fort Wall.  That's honestly that's what most podcast networks are is hats on sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that.  We promise we're fezzes on sticks.  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't work as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it safe to say that it seems like it would be in the best interest for the likes of Amazon,  Netflix to just continue to roll as if they're independent and just keep scraping the people  from Hollywood here and there for a particular project and just ship it, get it done and  then move on to the next about like what they've been doing now?  I don't think that's how they've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's how they've done it.  Pardon?  Just to what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, looking at this acquisition and saying, hey, we want to be the next Hollywood studio,  if you will.  Why not just say, hey, let's just continue to be Amazon?  No, that's not how you get to be Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say, let's just be Amazon.  You don't get to be Amazon by saying we're Amazon.  You get to be Amazon by saying what else can we eat?  What else can we engulf, devour, consume and spit out as a product?  That's how you get to be Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but to Anne's point, at what point did Amazon become a maker to a buyer?  Right?  Oh, it has always been a...  They made new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon, no, Amazon is very clear on how it works.  It looks at data.  It says, can I do this better in-house?  And it makes it itself.  And Amazon still makes lots of things.  Think about its brands.  Think about its devices it makes.  Think about all the services it launches over AWS or as part of AWS.  And then if for some reason it looks at it as like people are clearly interested in this,  but it's just not going to work for us, they buy it.  Which?  Yeah, they're super savvy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, oh yeah.  Amazon says we're going to make Wondery part of Amazon Music, which is interesting.  So Amazon has music.  Apple has music.  Google has music.  Spotify has music.  Spotify is a pure play.  Everybody else has music as a secondary business for other...  I don't know why they have music, but they do.  One thing that all of them were right about, and there were a lot of, by the way,  smaller companies that kind of stumbled along the way, like I guess Pandora is still around,  but Deezer and Tidal and there were a lot of small music businesses there may be still around,  but not doing great.  What they saw was the shift in listening habits from buying CDs, buying records,  buying cassettes, to streaming everything.  And they thought if we build a business...  But it's a synergy.  I don't think any of them are...  That's why Spotify is really in the tough position.  And that's why they've been most aggressive about buying content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was that something the market did or was that something the companies forced  because of all the copyright?  No, the market did it.  I think the companies...  We used to buy our songs.  We can't buy them anymore.  Yeah, I think the companies saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple did it.  If anybody did it, Apple did it when they said...  And people often point to this as the demarcation when they said to record companies...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spotify was the first streamer before Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is when it began, is before streaming.  Apple said to the record labels, you can't sell albums anymore.  You've got to sell every record as a 99-cent single.  And the record company said, we can't do that.  All the money is in albums, mostly because their artists weren't capable of 10 great songs.  But they could do three, surround them with seven filler songs and sell it as an album.  And that was their music model.  And Apple broke it back in the late 90s, early 2000s with iTunes and with the 99-cent single.  They forced that.  At that point, people stopped buying physical media.  iTunes quickly became the number one place to buy music.  But even...  And Apple was slow to the streaming music.  Even buying music wasn't enough.  It turned out, and that's when Spotify came along.  You're right, Stacey.  They said, why buy it? Rent it.  You don't like it enough to buy it.  So instead of buying an album from Taylor Swift or even buying a single, they further disaggregated it.  They said, instead of buying a 99-cent single, you pay us $15 a month.  You get it all as long as you keep paying us.  And I think consumers jumped on that.  That's when the market said, okay, that's a good deal.  Geeks complained.  A lot of people complained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I own my song forever.  People still complained.  I can't do this, but consumers said, no, I'm very hard-trodden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did not take a long time for people just to say, I don't need to own it anymore.  You're right.  They still say that about books occasionally.  And by the way, book sales and CD sales are through the roof in 2020.  We'll get to that in a little bit.  But that's a pandemic blip.  Streaming clearly dominated.  But then Spotify had a problem because they don't make their music.  They just sell it.  And all the record companies are kind of putting the...  People like Taylor Swift are saying, you can't give away my music anymore.  I'm not making enough money.  And the big stars are putting the screw to them.  The record label is putting the screw to them.  And that's when Spotify said, all right, we need our own content.  And that's when they saw podcasts as a savior.  I don't honestly think any of these guys think podcasts are an alternative  or an equally valuable business to music.  Not even close.  They're spending a lot of money on it, but not close to what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so confusing.  I don't understand what the obsession with podcasts is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't either.  And I know a little bit about podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She said a lot of podcasts.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, what percentage of the population of people who listen to podcasts  is still relatively small, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's growing very rapidly.  Maybe a quarter?  Yeah, but it was 2% and then it was 5%.  But it's also, as a defensive tactic, at least from Spotify's point of view,  against the record labels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  And if you think about podcasts also as like the new talk radio, right?  Then it makes a little bit more sense, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, there are a few big players now.  There's Spotify.  Amazon suddenly is a big player in this.  By the way, Audible had been adding podcasts, too.  So Amazon has spoken word in both audiobooks and podcasts already,  but now they add Wondery.  And then there's Apple, which doesn't currently own podcasts,  but is widely rumored to be building up a podcast library of stuff  and content library of stuff.  But that's been rumored that it's going on for a long time.  So like studios?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a studio model.  They already have a library of podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they don't own them and they don't make money on them.  They're just how you get them.  They're the pipe.  Come on, I need a living, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just give it, let me have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there are a lot of other companies that are looking at this.  And one of them is the big radio company,  which employs me for the radio show, which is iHeart.  iHeart Media is the largest radio company in the United States.  And for years, radio has said, oh, we'll always be here.  People will always listen to radio.  And I've even said on this show and others, radio's dying.  People say, no, I love radio. Listen to radio all the time.  Everybody I know listens to radio.  Folks, trust me, radio, if not dead, is dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's listening to the radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my question.  But our chat room says, we do, we do, we listen all the time.  I mean, my dad listens to the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter can't conceive of the radio.  She's like, I don't understand why you would...  Well, that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on when it's on?  This is the big shift in media in general, is your daughter,  everybody under 20, they don't watch TV.  They don't listen to the radio.  They don't consume media, anything like we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My kids listen to Sirius, but they often listen to the reruns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why do your kids listen to Sirius? It must be in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's in the car, and they're listening to Howard Stern or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because of you. That's because of you.  My kids don't listen to Sirius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I had Sirius, a Sirius subscription a couple years ago,  my kids, they enjoyed it because it made more sense to them  to be able to hire them and listen to on-demand content, if you will.  Then radio.  Because we had the radio in the car, and we'd flip it over to the radio,  and they realized how bad radio was for us as an experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Radio killed itself with 19 minutes of commercials an hour.  It's fascinating. In Europe, radio is still...  That's what happened with television.  Yeah, same thing.  So these companies did not embrace the opportunity, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I talk to you in the car at all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.  I was just going to say, it's NPR because there's not...  No commercials.  Straight content. But go Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just saying that people there say radio. They love radio still.  Yeah, but they still have government radio, right?  But it also influences the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, you're a little soft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think radio is hanging on by a thread still, even though it's dying,  because some people still just don't quite get the concept of podcast.  I can look at just my small circle in general.  When I mentioned coming out to California to work at a podcast network,  the first question by some was what is a podcast?  What the hell are you doing?  What is a podcast?  I finally figured out the best explanation was to tell them it was like having talk radio  on a regular basis when you want it kind of thing, not just because it happened to be on at that particular hour.  But the problem was the disconnect of how do I access that?  You tell a 20-year-old to get to a podcast through their favorite app on their phone.  That's no big deal.  But you tell someone that's slightly older than me to do such a thing,  and they're like, I got to do what on my phone?  Why can't I just put it on the radio in the living room?  It just seems like those are the people that are still holding on to radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think about it. There's still a market for mainframes, y'all.  And so just to forestall Jeff's Gutenberg moment here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no new media has ever replaced the old media.  No, radio didn't replace newspapers. TV didn't replace radio. Movies didn't replace...  They just diminish them and become the next thing.  But there's...  McLuhan, his McLuhan moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  McLuhan says that the content, that the old medium becomes the content of the new medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like it. It's like a snake eating its tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right. And it doesn't really have anything yet.  Of course, that changes over time. But Gutenberg, print, was manuscripted first, right?  For the first 50 years of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  McLuhan, that's quite an insight. I agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's McLuhan's not mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you look at the internet, what was the internet when it first started?  It was brochures and magazines and TV shows.  It's recognizable as... Exactly.  So we haven't yet... maybe podcasting is the first new medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's like radio.  No, you know what it is?  TikTok.  TikTok.  Yes. Because Ratatouille the musical...  High five, Ant.  ...shows the future. This is the future you're stuck in, Ant.  No, wait.  No, wrong way, Stacey.  This way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at Ray Gunn, Mr. Howell in our chat rooms.  There are plenty of people who aren't interested in on-demand media.  They really want... They don't really want that much control.  That's what Spotify's for. They listen to Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like I listen to my daily mix on Spotify, or one of my six daily mixes, on Spotify all the time.  Because I don't want to constantly be like, oh...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't... This doesn't preclude that by any means.  There's all sorts of ways to do it without having to think about it.  In fact, NPR has its own podcast app.  It's interesting. This probably was the insight that created NPR One.  They said, well, just start it. We'll just put stuff in there.  And you just keep listening. And it'll never end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the Internet. You can scroll all the way down and it'll never end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, never gets to the bottom.  What's interesting there, too... I know the guy who started it, Kinsey Wilson.  And the political struggles within the NPR network.  Well, they have a complicated...  The stations were not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a very complicated financial structure.  And they can't piss off the funders, which are the stations.  But at the same time, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the funders are the customers, in a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But this is exactly why radio stations have had a hard time with podcasts.  And it's why, in a way, iHeartMedia is surprisingly smart.  Because they are building a massive podcast empire, very, very successful podcast empire,  on a parallel track to their radio business, knowing that at some point the train's going to change over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh, that's how Verizon handled its wireline and its mobile networks for years.  And finally, the revenue switched.  Yeah.  Oh, the Inline Phones and broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's as much as newspapers, which don't have that.  They didn't have a second track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They could have had that.  They could have had a viable business online, but they did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to... Actually, I want to... Okay, can we change the subject?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not a democracy, so I guess you can.  I'm asking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did have one more question for you, but you can change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A good dictator knows when to pretend he's interested in the opinion of his subjects.  Go ahead, Ann. What did you want to ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you mentioned how these different platforms or mediums, they don't necessarily wipe out the original one.  They just sort of eat away at it.  And it made me think about that Dub Smash, whatever you just talked about.  Yeah, the Reddit just bought it.  What's the point of... What do you think their play is?  Is it to really try to take out TikTok, or is it just a nibble here and there?  Because I personally think that's pointless because we have too many options already out there.  And TikTok seems to have a really strong hold on that type of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't you remember that part we had about three weeks ago where every service is now getting every service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's just mimicking each other just because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly think that the companies that do real original thought are few and far between, and maybe they're the most successful.  But most companies go, oh, what's the other guy doing? Oh, we're in trouble. We've got to keep up.  And so a lot of what you see is just me tooism, the other kind of me tooism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they have an original start when they start.  Yeah.  But then Facebook makes the original thought when it started.  Then they're scrambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Reddit actually was not original. It was a complete copy of Digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but it's like...  Reddit, by the way, is interesting because that's owned by Conde Nast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Reddit is in fact, and the money behind Reddit that bought Dub Smash, I presume, directed by Conde Nast money, which is old school publisher, right, Jeff?  I mean, that is as old as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was my boss. My boss wanted me, Steve Newhouse, wanted... he really loved Digg.  Steve, go farther back.  Steve or Sy?  Sy's son.  Steve Newhouse. Sy's nephew. He's now basically in charge of the company.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-oh. Jeff is frozen. He's lost to the...  Make the contact.  Oh, there was a break. There was a break.  He could have gotten in on Facebook.  Hold on, Jeff.  He loved Digg.  Oh my God.  Hold on, Jeff.  Hold on, Jeff.  Okay. Wait till your line becomes stable.  All right. Let me see if Jeff is there. Jeff, are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I back?  Yes.  Am I... is this 2021 yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Sorry. Still in 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So close.  Oh, darn.  You know, I just want to warn people. It's possible 2021 could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Leo's mood.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just my mood. The CDC just said, you know, this isn't the big one.  It's like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The CDC also thought this last year's health, big health issue was mosquitoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what? That was the strangest thing ever.  The CDC put out a list of the top health issues of 2020.  And mosquitoes were number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And number two was something also not COVID.  I think COVID.  Three, four, and five were COVID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, yeah, it's like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. But Jeff was making a point about Reddit and Conde Nast and his boss, Steve Newhouse, who loved Dig.  And that's where you jumped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back to that story, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'll try. Back to 2020.  Yes.  So my boss, originally he loved Facebook, but it was just at Harvard and he was a Yale-y.  And he saw what it was. He understood what it was. He understood. He really... he's the one who taught me interactivity.  And I made a contact with Facebook, but it was with... what's his name?  The guy who went to Brazil, who wanted to sell ads and...  Glenn Greenwald?  No, the guy on Facebook.  Eduardo Severin?  Oh, Eduardo Severin. Yes, yes.  So that was the wrong person to go to because he was out of favor.  Who knew? You didn't know.  So next, the boss wanted...  You hadn't seen the movie.  Right. He wanted Dig. He thought Dig was great.  We had a relationship with Dig. They were wonderful. Dig was doing great. Dig didn't do anything.  So he then kind of cleverly just said, well, hmm, Reddit kind of wants to be Dig.  He got it. He got it.  Smart. He got Reddit.  And then he got it for a song or nothing.  But then, Wisely saw that to motivate the staff, he had to create equity.  So they basically spun it off to create the equity in the company  so that they could do all the things they've done so they could buy this company now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And they've done a good job, I think, a good steward of Reddit.  By the way, they were lucky they didn't buy Dig, as it turned out, because Dig immediately cratered, augured in.  And Reddit's done quite well for itself.  In fact, in the face of pretty daunting headwinds from the Donald Channel and white supremacy and Nazi channels and all sorts of issues,  they've managed to come out of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How did Red... Let me ask you this question.  I have an answer too, but I'm curious to hear yours for once.  Sorry. Reddit had worse stuff.  Oh, God. I think I just got shot. Oh, my God.  Reddit had worse stuff than Facebook.  Absolutely.  Reddit had bad stuff.  Yeah.  And it had a reputation for that at the very beginning, but it managed to get out of that while that bad stuff was still there.  Yeah.  But this idea that no two people see the same Facebook?  No, people think everybody sees the same Facebook.  No people see the same Reddit? People get that.  Oh, yeah, there's a seller and there's some...  Well, you're a little bit more in control of that on Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't insert stuff into your feed.  Is that it?  I think that's the biggest thing is on Reddit, it's divided into what they call subreddits, which are subject matter-based, basically forums, internet forums.  And we were talking before the show.  My Reddit is very bland because it's a lot of programming subreddits and technology subreddits.  But those are what I follow.  Reddit neither inserts content into that nor changes.  It's all chronological.  In fact, you have complete control of it.  It's not all chronological.  You could say I want to see the top stuff, the newest stuff, the most controversial stuff.  You get to choose how it's sorted.  But sort by new is always an available as a choice.  And so it is an algorithmic.  That's the biggest difference of all.  Reddit is not algorithmic.  Facebook is entirely algorithmic.  And the reason I stopped using it is even if I turn on the chronological feed on Facebook, it eventually turns it off because it knows that's not what it really wants you to see.  It wants you to see the algorithmic.  Well, let me try it another way on you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been spending the last two days to get ready for you.  I've been spending the last two days, actually for the book, reading up on third-person effect.  And for folks out there, that's the belief that I'm not affected by stuff.  Maybe you're not, but other people are.  And I know better.  And so this is what I argue that Leo engages in when it comes to Facebook.  And one of the papers I read, it says this.  Basically, people tend to believe that others are more negatively affected by media messages or Facebook as a way of enhancing self-image.  So part of the reason behind this is I make myself look smarter.  It's like watching Jeopardy and getting the answers, right?  Well, more like we love fortune.  Because I'm the smart one, and they're dumb on TV, and yeah, I'm not under the pressure, but screw it.  The comparison between self and other then constitutes a form of unrealistic and biased optimism.  So I'm optimistic about myself, and that's motivated by the need for ego enhancement, this paper says.  But what I say about others is, well, surely they see a lot more stuff.  So one of the papers I read, recent ones about Facebook, those who use Facebook less look down on those who use it more and presume they are all worse off.  It also says that when it came to television versus the Internet, that people say, well, I've got control over television.  I can turn it off.  Well, actually, you have a lot less control over television, but you have more of a sense of control over it, which is where you're headed, I think, here.  Whereas in Facebook, you don't know what's happening.  You actually do have control.  You can unfollow somebody.  You can do all kinds of things, but you don't feel like you're in control the way you do with the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Facebook also implements dark patterns and allows you that dopamine hit when you see things.  So I think there's an extra layer to what you're talking about, Jeff, which is Facebook also, they drag you in and they keep you there.  Whereas television, and I mean, you could argue that a cliffhanger.  Well, television drags you in and tries to keep you there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like we always try to do a minute ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're trying to get the difference is the way it does it with your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference is television does it on mass and Facebook's doing it particularly specifically targeted at you.  And I am not unaware of that effect, Jeff, at all.  I understand it completely.  It's kind of a version of the Dunning-Kruger effect.  And I completely understand that my entire argument against Facebook is the algorithm and the algorithm is targeted at you.  And you think you're seeing what you want to see.  You're seeing what Facebook wants you to see.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's also I can say the same thing about a network programmer or an editor in chief of a newspaper.  You're not in control of that at all.  No, no.  They're telling you what you want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're doing it on mass.  They're not targeting you.  They're targeting.  So what's the difference?  So it's worse.  It's worse.  No, it's not worse.  Part of it is also getting people to become aware of it.  This targeted thing at you is wonderful.  It's exactly not wonderful.  It's much better to have a mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you see, you have this view that everybody else is a lemming.  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm well aware of that effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm saying Facebook is nefarious.  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the Easter egg, Leo.  I looked and I tried to find any Facebook stories this week.  I didn't find any.  So one of the TikTok stories, I just put them in the Facebook box.  No Facebook in the box at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're hysterical.  I was wondering if your Easter egg was this guy who started a Spotify album, since we  were talking about Spotify earlier, called OKG Play Music.  We'll say it.  Go ahead and say it.  OK, y'all.  Play Music is the name of his album.  Yeah.  The songs are Hey, Gee, Play Christmas Music, Hey, Gee, Play Cookie Music, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me play it because it doesn't play music.  Oh, because if you say Hey, Gee, Play Christmas Music, Drum Koon, who is the guy who did this,  is going to get a hit.  In fact, this is a longstanding problem on Spotify, which because anybody could put anything  on Spotify, which is stuff designed to get plays by accident in effect.  Oh, really?  Oh, this has been going on for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have never encountered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not new at all.  That's pretty funny.  Drum Koon's album cover is him in a car.  On the side it says, OKG Play Music.  He didn't put a lot of effort into this page, but you know, this is a very common thing  on Spotify.  In fact, it's one of the reasons I kind of lost interest in Spotify Pandora 2 is because  you would get a lot of covers instead of the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that was only Google had a real issue with that and they've gotten better.  But like one of the reasons I did not like using the Google Assistant and the Google  Smart Speaker was because its API app with Spotify was terrible.  And it would always give me like the karaoke version of the song.  Yeah.  And there was a lot of gaming going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's by the way, what killed did gaming will kill a site like this.  By the way, if you love Drum Koon's play music, you're going to really like Hey, let's  get a little play music is follow up.  Oh, gee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Leo, were you going to change the subject a while ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.  It's OK.  You were you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've been thinking a little bit and actually follows along with what we've been thinking  about.  I thought I'd throw this out to you guys.  Let me see if I can get my head working and put this together in some sort of logical  way.  There clearly there's a problem and it's not entirely on Facebook.  Although I think a little bit, Jeff, you conflate Facebook with the Internet like, oh, if you  know, if you don't like Facebook, you mustn't like the Internet.  And I think if you're going to do something to Facebook, you might have an impact on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And look, it section 230 is heavily under attack right now for all the reasons.  So terrifying.  But right now we don't we're being told not to trust stuff we see on the Internet.  But there's this other thing that's going on.  And I really concerned me even more because increasingly journalists and even respectable  journalistic entities have started to kind of follow the same patterns that probably  for economic reasons, the Internet sites follow with link bait, B.S. stories.  This came to me sensational.  It's not new, but it came to me when I was listening to Jonathan Alters, excellent biography  of Jimmy Carter, his very best.  And he's talking about the Burt Lance affair.  Remember that, Jeff?  You guys are too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we're old enough to remember that Burt Lance, who was a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who was a Carter.  Well, I want I would say crony, of course, but he wasn't a crony.  He was an adviser.  He was director of OMB under Jimmy Carter.  And crony has been redefined.  That's what's interesting is he was William Sapphire decided in The New York Times to  take him down, to say he's a crony.  He was being investigated by the SEC for kind of loosey goosey banking standards.  He had a small town bank in Georgia and he would lend money to friends and stuff.  And in fact, he had to resign at OMB during his first year in office.  And Sapphire, after he resigned, said, yeah, maybe I was a little hard on the guy.  Burt Lance was cleared of all charges.  There were never any successful criminal charges against him.  But he was hounded out of the office by innuendo, essentially from mainstream press,  including The New York Times.  Now, that was a that was a long time ago.  That was 50 years ago.  But I think it has that was but it was also unique in that, I think, somewhat unique in that time.  But I think it's happening all the time now.  And there's so much gotcha journalism.  And it's gotten so bad.  It's almost a war back and forth between the Internet.  And I can top that, says The New York Times.  And but here's the reason I bring it up is it really concerns me because I feel like there is no trustworthy source of information anymore,  that we are now in a situation where nothing you can't you don't where do you go for answers to anything?  Everybody seems to have an axe to grind.  Everybody's trying to get more clicks and links.  And it seems to be there's so much BS out there that even the stuff that's not BS, you can't tell anymore.  And that worries me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So get your get your cups ready, get your martinis ready, get your scotch ready, get your bourbon ready.  Going back to Gutenberg's time, nobody trusted print for the first 50 years.  What do we trust?  We trusted the people we knew.  We trusted the innkeeper who talked to the post delivery guy who came through town and said things.  And this is the show, I think, last week.  Rumor was what we trusted.  Literally, rumor was better than print.  Print was not trusted.  It took time to invent the institutions that gave print trust.  A lot of print was garbage, fake news, witch trials, junk.  A lot of it was just an error.  It was worse than the scribes.  They'd make mistakes and things that get out.  You weren't guaranteed of who really made this.  You didn't really know who made it.  And if you did know who made it, then it was probably under the thumb of government because they insisted that you put your name on it so they could cut your hands off literally.  So there was no trust in print.  But we invented the publishing house.  We invented the editor.  We invented institutions that brought us some measure of trust in that new structure.  It took about 200 years.  Literally 200 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was getting ready to ask you that.  I was going to say, how long is it going to take?  I can think back to at least 10 years of seeing listicles and just buzzword-laden headlines on just about everything I read.  And I'm still seeing that stuff now.  Well, and the problem there is you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's a business model problem.  And the business model that we created in media, which is an attention-based business model, either for advertising or for subscription, rules the Internet now.  That includes Google.  That includes Facebook.  That includes everything.  Programmatic, right?  And the next advance has been – did I freeze again?  No.  And the next advance has been targeting.  But that's basically the last death gasp of old advertising in my view.  When do we get to a business of some new thing we eventually call media that's based on the value in my life and your life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it took two centuries to create that reputation, we've tossed it away in a decade.  How long is it going to take to get it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or does it matter?  We've got to get through 30 years' war first, a few peasants' wars, and reformation, and then on the other side.  But maybe it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's my real question.  That's the business opportunity.  Yeah, what's the opportunity? What's the future?  That's the opportunity.  What's the future of – is there going to be – I remember we were talking 20 years ago maybe about the future because there's so much information now that will be in curation.  That the curator will be the person we will – we will have a trusted curator.  Is that the solution?  Yeah.  What is the future of information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem with curation is it starts with – we're still making media like it was in the old.  And so we have to get past this idea that the story, uber all, that content is everything, that we have more content and more content.  There's too much content.  There's not too much speech.  Well, in a way I think what we do here is curation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We choose stories that we think are important.  We analyze them.  We break them down.  We argue about them.  And we try to come to some sense of what is so, what is true.  That seems like a decent model.  No?  I think it is.  That's why I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the kind of model we get to.  Or Vox says we're going to condense things.  So maybe – okay, well here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This model doesn't always work for mass and mainstream.  No, it doesn't.  There's the people who want information, like curated real information.  And then there's people who look at the news to entertain themselves.  It takes too much work to vet content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, two things there.  One, a little bit of third person in that.  People in their own lives get what they need to get, I think.  And second, I just finished the chapter on this in the book I'm working on.  Mass is a myth that was born of the French Revolution and that the internet finally kills.  It is fundamentally an insult to the public that people are all the same and the same product can serve them all.  I'm not getting into targeting here.  No.  I'm just getting into relevance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're absolutely true.  That's – if you're going to pick one thread throughout all of this is the fragmentation of all of these mass markets.  Whether it's TV, broadcasting.  But the word fragmentation presumes that the mass is the norm.  Well, it was the norm until my youth.  From the 50s.  Okay.  So we grew up in mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the business models are built – so the business models, especially for the internet, but even for many publications – not trade publications, actually, in most cases.  But many publications is mass because you need to reach a large number of people to make your seat.  In that old business model.  You're right, Stacey.  Yes.  And that's where – and the other thing is we're still in this big mindset.  Like, I make a decent living.  I'm never going to be like a millionaire, but I can clothe my children and feed them.  And you provide a service.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vetting content in a specific area and people learn to trust you, right?  And so you become that curator for them.  No, you become that curator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a thing that our business world, like the business world, denigrates.  Oh, yeah.  Or doesn't – they don't denigrate.  They just don't see it.  It's like, oh, it's a lifestyle business.  But I'm like, it's my lifestyle.  I like it.  And I think my readers, listeners, those people care, but it's –  Well, Stacey, we believe that you're the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one actually believes that.  That's why we see Amazon paying for laundry.  But you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah, if your goal is to get bought for $300 million, then you're going to create a tower  of BS, a house that Hype built, and you get bought for a way like Mark Cuban and laugh.  I was like, here is my tower of BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just make money, put some hats on sticks on top of that tower of BS.  You're golden.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bingo.  Whereas if you're actually building value – so what you're both saying is you build  value.  And Mr. Ant builds value when he has his expertise about photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I started doing what I do.  The notion was technology is so complex and difficult, and people are overwhelmed by it.  And I have a belief that you need to understand it in order to not be the victim of it.  And so what I said is let's start something where we get intelligent people discussing  this in a way that people can understand.  It's our mission statement.  In order to give you information, you need to understand what role technology is playing  in the world and what your role is and how you can use it.  And that's all I ever wanted to do.  And Stacey, yeah, would I like $300 million?  Sure.  But I knew that this was a lifestyle business the minute I started it.  And I was very content with that.  I would not like $300 million.  Oh, come on, you would.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you do with that kind of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to ever worry about money again.  Let me show you.  You have a very comfortable lifestyle business.  No, I mean seriously.  You don't have to change anything.  Actually, that's exactly the problem that you do.  I can get anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm with you 100%, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and I are doing the same thing exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Like if someone wanted to hand me $10 million, then I'd probably be like, oh, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can just curl up.  I presume after a commercial break, we'll come back to talk about Substack where everybody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dreaming this.  So Stacey, we changed our entrepreneurial program, as you know, and I talked to you about  this and my colleague talked to you about this, when we have a community of practice  started around the independent, resilient content creator, journalist, call them what  you will, rather than, hey, kids, let's make a company.  It's I can serve a community, a market.  I can do it with probably five different kind of revenue streams as you do.  I got subscriptions.  I got events.  I got sponsors.  I do everything I can to make this work and serve that audience really well.  Let me ask you a question, though.  Are you concerned about the fact that you're not going to be able to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you concerned that without some form of mass media, it'll be difficult to build consensus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We never had it.  That was a myth.  Walter Cronkite, that's the way it is, was always a lie.  Always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how do you build political consensus unless you have communities in agreement?  Here's what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The book, as I wrote and researched the book, and I don't have an editor who's bought it yet,  so it's not a book yet, but what I've been working on...  So call your friends.  Can we know, Jeff, this is your chance to build a lifestyle book?  Well, I've already sent it to my last editor.  Could be.  Could be.  If the editor doesn't take it, that could be what it is.  But what I realized, Leo, is the essence of the book is this, is that we are right now  relearning how to have a conversation with ourselves as a society.  If you go to the early days of print, Luther had a conversation with the Pope and Erasmus through print.  Erasmus had a conversation with Sir Thomas More through books.  Media was conversational.  Richardson's first novels were about letters.  Media was tremendously conversational.  We lost that somewhere along the way.  I think we lost it.  My theory is we lost that with Steam and with Mass and the Penny Press and so on.  You could argue that we lost at other points with radio or TV, but we lost it.  We don't know how to have a conversation.  And so actually there's an essay I read recently that said that our problem in society is we don't argue enough.  You think, well, that's insane.  All we do is argue.  Listen to this Twig show.  There are arguments all the time.  What's that?  But we don't know how to argue.  We don't know how to have a discussion.  Right.  We've lost that ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that we're...  Arguments lead to cancellations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think here the discussions we have, which sometimes can get heated, are all about getting to the core truth of it.  And trying to model a behavior.  Within this little group, and just as Stacey within her group and with her podcast and with her newsletter, we're bringing in people to get this mini consensus.  I just worry that a larger political consensus is tough.  Consensus isn't the goal.  Well, it is in politics.  Consensus isn't the goal.  It is in politics.  It is in governance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at some point, even then, it's negotiation.  You're never in consensus.  Consensus is a false goal.  Okay, so let's not use consensus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if we all operate from different facts, it becomes difficult to negotiate.  Maybe not.  Maybe it doesn't matter if we have the same facts.  It's not facts either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not facts either, I don't think.  And I was going to find another one of these papers I read today, which talked about the myth of objectivity.  Here's my concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I have to say, so for instance, in the tech sphere, which is the only sphere I really know, there are a lot of different groups like this, like Twitter, that bring people together.  And, you know, there's Marques Brownlee and there's magazines and blogs and stuff that bring people together and try to reach a consensus.  And then there is a somewhat larger consensus of them all.  So, for instance, when a new Android phone comes out, there's different reviews, different thoughts.  But it kind of all eventually kind of works its way to a generalized consensus, which then users kind of say, okay, we all kind of agree the Pixel 4a is a great phone.  We all kind of agree that the Samsung is kind of has that don't get a fold.  There's a certain sense of, I think, I mean, there's, of course, dissent, but we work its way.  It works its way to consensus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see, this is the problem is that media gave you that idea that that was the goal.  So one of the papers I read by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is the goal, because if you're an end user looking to buy a product, your goal is to get a consensus opinion on whether it's a good product.  Then we'd have two phones.  Then we'd be each for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is your goal?  You don't think what?  What is your goal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get what you want with more information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My goal is to understand if something will work for me.  So I know that when we do our reviews, I really focus.  That's fair.  I mean, yes, if a product is a total dog.  But I used to tease Kevin about his equivocal reviews.  And I was like, Kevin, you're like, if you're a lobster fisherman in Northern Canada, this particular device is going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're getting the information you need for you to make that decision.  That makes sense.  Yeah, no, that makes sense.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there is an argument that is called...  I forget what it's called.  But this writer talks about the naive realism and objectivity.  And I want to talk about this real quickly.  So he says there are three points of this notion of objectivity.  Number one is my own perceptions are realistic and objective, and therefore reasonable others will share them.  Number two, I'll be able to persuade them who disagree with me if we are reasonable and open-minded and once I explain the real facts.  Number three, those who disagree with me, especially those who challenge these important beliefs, are irrational if I can't get there.  And so we have this myth in journalism of objectivity.  And there's a really good piece in the New York Times about two and a half months ago by Wesley Lowery, former Washington Post reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner,  who talked about the structural racism of the notion of objectivity.  Because the person who decides in journalism what is objective looks like me, an old white man.  And the person who decides what's bias and says, no, you, Louis Raven Wallace, who got fired from NPR because you wouldn't get along because you're transgender and you believed you had a lived experience that was valuable,  and NPR told you, no, that's a bias.  Right.  So this notion of objectivity becomes a myth that, it's the wrong myth.  We're striving for the wrong thing.  What we need instead is a sense that we are in constant communication, constant disagreement, and we need the skills of understanding how to negotiate with each other.  And the end product is not consensus, it's negotiation.  I like it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that sounds reasonable.  And Facebook is not a...  We have to get used to the notion that we're going to be in a fragmented, factually fragmented world.  No, it's good.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what we do.  We used to have 20 newspapers.  The problem with Facebook, this is why I criticize Facebook, mark this.  Facebook is not built for building communities.  It is not built for negotiating ideas.  It is not built for those kind of connections.  It's built for people you already know to share stuff with you.  And news came to it accidentally, and it's not built for it.  But the opportunity here is, it's only 1475 and Gutenberg years, drink, the opportunity is to say, can I build something where people can share their lived experiences,  where we can do that in a safe space and understand each other a little better, where I can ask them questions and they can answer them.  Can we build a place like this where more people can discuss phones and come to conclusions?  That's what the Internet does and does pretty well, Reddit.  We're starting to build a new structure for conversation in society.  But the 30 years war is coming, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we're almost there, is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would a 30 years war, Austria is going to come back.  What would it look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it possible to conceive of what it would look like to build a space where this negotiation was prized and fostered?  What would Facebook look like if it were that way?  I think culturally, even in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.  You go, Stacey, then I'll go.  I was going to say, culturally, I think in the US, we're actually kind of afraid of these conversations.  We don't tend to want them, embrace them, or engage in them, especially with people who don't think like we do.  It's really interesting when I'm with my friends from Germany or even France.  Right, it's because disagreements can't happen anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Disagreements now lead to being a danger.  They're dangerous.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or worse.  I'll give you an example that I quite love.  Finish your thoughts, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, so now Jeff should tell us what the business model is and actually answer your question.  Well, this doesn't have to be a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just wondering what it would look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a company that's right near you called Spaceship Media, run by a woman named Eve Perlman.  It's small.  I think I've said on the show before, because I have tenure, I can do obnoxious things like redefine journalism.  So my definition of journalism is to convene communities into respectful, informed, and productive conversation.  Spaceship does that.  They bring in communities that are somewhat in conflict, African American teens in high school and their teachers, people who run guns.  Their first project was Clinton voters versus Trump voters.  What they do is the journalist gets to know them.  They put them in a Facebook group, doesn't that be Facebook?  And the goal is just to understand each other a little better.  Now, what happens then is people say, we're getting in trouble over here.  We're starting to fight.  Can you help us out?  Can you look up some stuff for us?  Well, the angels sing and the heavens open because they said we want an informed conversation.  We want facts and we want you to go get them for us, journalists.  What are the outcomes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they just all end up being, well, let's just agree to disagree?  No, they understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They come out saying, OK, I still disagree, but I understand you better.  I understand your perspective better.  I didn't get that piece of it.  Or now I get it better.  When Spaceship sees this, when they come to Spaceship, they don't do a narrative about it.  They deliver what they call fact stacks.  They say, here are the things that you asked for, that you're wrong about, that you're confused about, that you should know.  And you come to a better understanding so that you can at least have that negotiation not based on emotion and hate.  My view is that people don't really believe in Q, except for some really nut jobs.  But they want us to believe that they believe it.  There's a performative emotion involved.  You don't understand my circumstances.  You don't understand my life.  And I don't want to understand yours either.  And it is, as Dana Boyd says, an epistemological war.  I don't trust you.  I don't trust your experts.  You're all elites.  I don't like your facts.  F you.  This is what I'm going to do.  If it irritates you, good.  And that's where we are.  As Ant was just saying a minute ago, if you disagree, that's what it rises to.  And Spaceship has a methodology.  My graduates have worked for the company where they understand how to get people together.  This is a really interesting business.  And look at us.  You and I yell at each other, and we love each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but we're a lot closer than we are apart.  We're never going to agree with everyone on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are core moral and cultural differences between people.  The biggest thing you can think of is just broadest brush.  America, individualism, yay.  China, the collective good, yay.  Those are contrasting.  They're not.  There's I mean, we put it, you know, we each have moral thoughts about it.  But at the same time, this is we each are going to come down on different sides and that's OK.  And I do agree, Jeff.  I like how you call it a negotiation when you're trying to build laws.  And if we as journalists, one of the hardest things I think to write about and to talk to our audience for politicians to talk to their constituents about is this idea that.  Every law comes with tradeoffs and we're making them, you know, like we can fund children going to preschool or we can fund programs that help people when they get out of jail.  And maybe we don't have enough money to do all of those.  And we don't talk like that.  Well, that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Becomes fund community help, right?  Fund mental health.  But it gets turned into rhetoric.  And who's the fault for that oftentimes?  My business, media, journalism.  It's our business.  And we screw that up.  We don't we don't try to find.  I wrote a post some weeks ago about Hannah Arendt and totalitarianism.  I reread major portions of the roots of totalitarianism.  And she expressed it brilliantly in there where she said people give up their day to day concerns and they don't care about it.  They don't care about their day to day concerns and then they grab onto these abstract notions.  I don't believe that for 30 percent of America, the single most important thing every single day of their lives is guns and abortion.  I believe the most important thing in their lives is the health and well-being of their families and their children.  And that's the same for me and it's the same for all of us.  There's a commonality there which which media never deals with at that level because it's boring and it's not conflict and it's not new.  It's a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What were the outcomes with Spaceship Media?  Do you do so?  I'll take the example that you one of the examples was the Alabama, California conversation between Clinton and Trump supporters.  Was there an outcome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were a couple of outcomes.  By the way, they have a brand new book out.  So we should we should plug Spaceship Media on guns.  They did a nationwide project on guns.  Boy, they're courageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't mind taking on the big topics.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guns and American Conversation, Simon & Schuster.  My former publisher, my old publisher.  I hope my current publisher.  So on the Clinton versus Trump, you know, there was a limited time thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did it in a moderated Facebook group.  I have to acknowledge.  It was very moderate.  They would open it up occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so they would do stories for the papers.  This is what's going on here.  And so you could model a behavior.  What this is about is modeling the behavior, but how people can discuss.  And so the the my students who worked with us when they saw somebody was going to say something hostile, they'd say, maybe you want to think about saying that in a different way.  Why don't you ask that as a question and see what happens if you do that?  And they do that.  And they'd say, oh, well, you know, I got farther.  This is interesting.  Right. And and so at the end of it, at the end of the period, most of the people said we're going to stick around and we're going to keep going because we're interested in.  They actually enjoyed it.  Well, I joined my name be strong, but they recognize the value in it.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like eating broccoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may not enjoy it, but you know, it's good for you.  You got to burn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacy, you got to if you burn the broccoli, I can I can bear it.  But that's it.  Throw some cheese.  Oh, yeah. You roast that broccoli.  It's amazing.  Roasted is a lot better.  No hollandaise.  I'm joking.  Hollandaise on my asparagus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you answered my question, actually, because I was I am I was a little concerned about the profit motive and journalism and what it's brought us to.  And and I don't have a problem with mass media collapsing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I just I just had a conversation yesterday with a two hour conversation with a brilliant anthropologist at Northwestern.  I'm trying to do a new project here.  And and I said at some point, imagine journalism's died.  It's collapsed.  And as anthropologists, how would you approach the problems in society?  You know, what would you do?  And then it's just start by listening, by understanding communities, by by understanding what their connections are, by speaking their language back, by giving them the respect of listening, making them feel heard and learning about them on their terms.  What if what if journalism started from that base?  Everybody go watch TMZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, we solved the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journalism and bifurcation.  All right.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New subject.  I want to do the changelog.  How about that?  How about them apples?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is it's time for play the drums.  The trumpets, whatever the hell they are.  Whatever the hell they are.  The Google changelog trumpets and drums, trumpets and drums.  Goodbye cloud print.  Well, we knew that was going away.  Here's its replacement on January 1st cloud print turns into a pumpkin.  This was the I thought a really cool feature that allowed you to print initially from a Chromebook, but eventually from almost anything to almost any printer over the Internet without a wired connection.  Google sat in between as a kind of host.  They say, you know, now you got to got to do native printing.  I thought there was a replacement.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's well there's there's three or four private things, Mobia and things like that.  Yeah.  The beauty of cloud print was I could be in Germany and print something out of my home printer.  Yeah.  It was great.  And I don't know what was the cost to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It solved a lot of problems.  People had huge problems.  Printing is one of the biggest, thorniest problems of personal computing.  And it just solved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I guess you and I were old enough to remember having to get.  But how many people are all the drivers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People still print, don't they?  They think they still print.  Really?  Yeah, I don't.  You and I don't.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is this is for one chapter.  I see that you know, prints writers print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I'm printing out paper so I can mark them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But, you know, I'm just thinking today.  We talked for years about the paperless office and we never got there.  I think COVID just got us there.  Maybe.  Yeah, because you're not passing around memos.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't want to touch anything.  Google Store.  Having been remote forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  I've been in a paperless office.  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have a printer?  You have a printer there though.  Because you're so organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have I have a printer.  I print probably once a week and it's usually written labels.  All right.  Yeah, I print sparingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of the time it's more so for scanning.  That's what that thing is.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use my scanner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scanning is scanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting stuff into digital instead of out.  Right.  Google Store has added a nav bar.  Their online store that features a subscriptions landing page which includes information about  your subscriptions.  Who'd have thunk it?  What a clever idea.  Do you remember that you subscribed to YouTube TV, YouTube premium, YouTube music premium  all at the same time?  All completely unnecessarily?  Well, store.google.com slash subscriptions.  Get to know Google subscriptions and services and find out where you're wasting your money  or maybe find out new ways to waste money.  How about that?  They also are offering a la Apple packages, video entertainment, audio entertainment and  home security packages.  So, a new tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the ISPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, bundling.  Bundling, baby.  Android smart selection feature now lets you convert to other units.  So, you can select something like 60 miles an hour on your phone.  And if you wish, you can convert it to kilometers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's actually kind of, wait, is it, oh, convert.  Oh, does it do it for currency?  I bet it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why wouldn't it?  So exciting.  But don't enjoy it too much because it's already been deprecated.  No, I'm just kidding.  It's going away, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going away.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need an Android device with smart selection enabled.  Google camera 8.1 for reasons no one understands has disabled the ultra wide lens for astrophotography.  Ultra wide lens for astrophotography on the Pixel 5 and 4a.  Have you heard from your photography buff fans, Ann, about this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people that was using that didn't particularly care for it.  They weren't using wide.  Right.  The ultra wide is good for the field of view, but it's pretty soft as far as clarity goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't be a good choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Is soft code for blurry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I genuinely, I was like, it's soft.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not as crisp.  Sorry.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google photos.  But having an ultra wide for astro makes sense because you want to see all of the heavens.  Right.  The sky is very big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want wide though, not ultra wide because the ultra wide was like 16 millimeters.  It was super wide, right?  It was also distorted a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get curvature in there and things like that.  Then it bows a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I think Google is just trying to point you in the right direction.  I haven't looked yet, but you might want to check your Google photos because they are  starting to generate year in review stories.  Let me just look at my stories here.  And a 2020 photo book.  Aww.  So I always enjoy that carousel at the top.  That's the thing that I didn't buy last year.  Yeah, right.  That one.  You can buy that one, not buy that one again this year.  Yep.  Well done.  Photo books, photo prints, print series.  Yep.  It's all in there.  Well, you have it?  No, I don't have it yet.  But I'm actually not looking at my Android.  I should look at my Android, huh?  Not my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  What am I using an iPhone for?  Just checking real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have it.  I have recent highlights, but not the year highlights.  Yeah, recent highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A year ago, two years ago, three years ago.  I like that.  Apple actually is starting to do a better job of that with their photos than Google.  Despite all of the...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was just like, Apple doing better than Google?  Apple doing better?  Oh no.  What will Google have left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not available, I guess, yet.  Once it is available, maybe it will be after the year is over because something important  could happen in the next two days.  It'll appear first in the memories carousel on iOS.  Oh, it'll appear on iOS and Android with the web excluded.  Instead of the usual, what you're getting right now, look back at this day, week or year.  It's a recap from the past 12 months.  As before, you tap the edges to navigate backward and forward, press and hold pauses.  The date and locations at the top.  There's a preview book, lets you create an annual book.  I would like to do that, actually.  Has anyone ever...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to ask if anyone's ever bought a canvas from Google, like a photo?  I was just going to ask the same, if Ann had done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know someone that has and they did look quite nice.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple used to do really nice prints.  And I've printed from a number of people.  We do Shutterstock now.  In fact, our...  Shutterstock's good.  Our Christmas cards are pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shutterstock was in my old backyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, in Northern Kentucky?  Northern Kentucky?  I just printed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were just across the border from Charlotte in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just printed from a site called Artifact Uprising for...  I had taken one of Ohm's prints and had it printed on metal.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because he does black and white.  He does beautiful monochromes.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be nice.  They were really stunning.  I love metal prints, especially for monochrome.  Yeah.  And now I'm going to have Jeff Jarvis, because he's always good at this, get his Google Assistant  to sing the New Year song, if you would, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sing the New Year song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sing a song for the New Year.  I hope that we all thrive.  Kindness, love and laughter.  May that be our guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm here to look after.  This needs to be a chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There actually is animation on his screen right now.  We just don't get to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want to hear that song again, just ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please ask me.  I think that it sounds like GLaDOS from the Portal games.  Still alive, right?  Interestingly, if you ask for it in England, it'll have an English accent.  When Twitter gets best.  User also mentioned in Spanish, and the same thing happens in French.  Sing a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, what if I said it in Spanish?  Let's see.  Juego?  Juego?  I don't know Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be back with more as we call her Hilaria Higginbotham attempts to speak Spanish next.  And that's the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't speak Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be fair, my language is French.  It's my daughter who speaks Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really think I'm calling you Hilaria Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just couldn't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it speaks German.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New Year's in French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said sing a Noyaars lead and I heard sing a Does Noise Yaz lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's always fun to confound the Google Assistant.  Jeff, are you excited about the new Chromebook 2 from Galaxy Samsung?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope so. I hope so. I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from Kevin Toffle and AboutChromebooks.com.  It's from Leakin. It's down from $9.99 to $6.99.  Good price.  You go ahead.  Still got that beautiful red body we saw at CES last January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Little more square edges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the wedge shape anymore.  Walking Cat had the rumor.  Kevin says he's been, he says, I haven't been able to validate the latest leaks.  But he says it all kind of makes sense.  And QLED display is nice.  But it's a step down from what they have now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not OLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. QLED is better than, I don't know what they have now.  Do they have OLED now?  Oh, they do. It is a step down.  Yeah, yeah, it is a step down.  They went to an LCD panel.  That's how the price goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's how they saved it.  But I also wonder, Leo, does it suck less power?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's the problem with this machine.  OLED is notorious for sucking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's the reason here.  They're going to try to come up with a new model that doesn't lose its battery in three hours.  Is that what you're using as the Samsung?  No, I was going to get it.  No.  He still has the old pizza book.  You're waiting.  I'm afraid I'm going to buy it and then Google is going to announce something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the battery power turned me off on that one.  You really think that's going to happen?  A guy can hope, can't he?  I still haven't given that up.  From Yahoo!  I don't understand this story at all.  From Yahoo! Finance, the year in review of Google.  For Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the bad business model.  We've got to fill space online.  Online is never full of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honestly, I normally do not do a show this close to the end of the year because there's no news.  Which means anything in the news is, by definition, bogus.  Yes.  I hate this.  I despise this.  There's a ton of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You talk about Substack.  Oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wanted to talk about Substack.  So, Substack is the hot thing right now.  It is a newsletter platform, I guess.  Yes?  Do you have a Substack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a Substack, but I only made one just because I thought I should know about it.  Yeah, I was just looking at it.  But some people subscribe to it, which makes me laugh because there's no in-content on it.  But it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, people subscribe to individual things.  So, Ben Smith in the New York Times did a puff piece on, I'm forgetting her name suddenly,  Heather Robinson.  Oh, she's the hottest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I saw that puff piece.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so, she is pulling in, Ben said, a million dollars a year.  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he says the secret to her success is what?  People just want facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, she doesn't...  I've read it.  It's fine.  She's a curator.  But it's a summary of the news, but it's a slightly historical view.  It's fine, but it's five bucks and she gets enough people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five bucks a month.  And how much does Substack take of that five bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, in some cases, Matt Iglesias left Fox to go to Substack and they gave him an advance  of a reported $250,000.  So, he has to earn back that advance before he starts making money.  She chose not to take an advance.  Others did not.  But you have...  It's where the people are going.  So, I was just talking today with some of my colleagues at the school and saying, I  wonder if you're a publisher of a major publication and you have star names on, you know, The  Washington Post, New York Times, Time Magazine, wherever, and they see this million bucks,  what do you do?  Are they all going to leave you and try to do this?  Of course, what's going to happen is there's going to be too many newsletters on Earth.  And then it'll be the same...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, she's a professor of history, right, at Boston University?  Boston College.  Boston College.  Heather, you...  Heather, I mean, I'm sorry, Hilaria, you published a newsletter, but do you use a platform for  that?  Oh, she's muted.  Is that us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's me.  Sorry.  I'm in the midst of switching platforms.  But...  Would you consider...  I use MailChimp.  MailChimp.  I've considered Substack.  I actually met with Hamish.  Hamish?  Yeah.  Hamish McKenzie.  Yeah.  And he made the case that I probably could make as much as I do now without doing quite  as much work, which just kind of was like, of course, that's what I want to hear.  But I have a hard time...  I still toy with the idea, but I just have a...  I don't believe anyone would pay for my stuff.  Ah, because your newsletter is free right now.  Yeah.  Well, it's free, but it's also...  The other thing that is different about my model is my people are more...  They're an audience that you want to reach that cannot be reached easily.  They're a niche audience.  And so, people will pay a lot more to reach them.  So I can make...  Ben Evans model...  A decent, like I said.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That makes sense.  You know, I love Ben Evans.  He sends out the paid one on Sunday night with an extra piece that he writes just for subscribers.  And then he sends out a free version without those bonuses on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you, it beats writing a book.  You make more money than writing a book.  If you're going to write, figure out a way to make money at it.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could do Gutenberg every single week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I...  When I was at Fortune, they paid me very well.  Like I was well-renumerated.  Probably not like fancy person well-renumerated, but it was fine for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could afford fingers on your gloves when you worked there, but now you can't.  Yeah, when I worked there.  The video doesn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But...  Yeah, sorry.  I turned off the heat, so now I need my little warming things.  What was I going to say?  Oh, but when I left, I actually made more.  This was something I argued with Fortune when I was trying to get them to do the podcast  and they wouldn't.  I was like, I made more on the podcast than I made from them.  So I was like, dude, all of that could have been gravy and you could have charged even  more because you're Fortune.  So I would be terrified if I were a publisher that has a name because your stars are going  to go there, find their audience, do well, and then wander off to a sub stack.  That would be my journey.  I often...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alan Peterson, Iglesias, Andrew Sullivan, they've all gone there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I often wonder why our hosts don't use this platform as a launching point for a newsletter.  Because we love you.  No, no, but I wouldn't stop you.  You could do that.  Because we're lazy.  That's why I don't do it.  You'd have this opportunity every week to promote your newsletter.  The whole trick is generating, she must have 20,000 subscribers paying five bucks a month,  $100,000 a month in order to make that million dollars a year.  Which isn't a lot of people.  That's actually not a lot of people.  It's probably a tenth of the number of people you'd reach every month on the podcast.  So if you could get one in ten to subscribe, you could make a million dollars additional  a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, I think all she charges for is access to her comments.  I think the newsletter is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Isn't that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a lot of work.  And I also still, I often wonder, do really people want more email?  A, because I know I don't.  You'd be surprised.  Everybody always says newsletters are so good, so powerful.  I don't.  I think maybe people subscribe and then they end up in the bin and they don't read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they...  There are some newsletters that I subscribe to and I open every single time.  You read them every single time?  I open every single time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  How many are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to send it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  No, weekly would be enough, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many do you say you do that with Ann?  How many are you loyal to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking at least six or seven that I go through each week.  Maybe two or three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have about four.  Stacey?  Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo?  Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's funny because I know that it's the auto-generated mailchimp, yada, yada, yada,  but it still usually has interesting information or something useful for me in there and it  warrants me clicking and actually opening that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, those aren't people?  Those aren't like newsletters people give you?  These are like random company newsletters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It's people, but I know they're using MailChimp and even though you open it up and it says,  hi Ann, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You don't take it as personal.  Right.  MailChimp tries to personalize it and says, hey.  Oh, I don't expect it to be personal.  I read the New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't expect them to say, hey, Leo, here's your new article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can choose not to personalize it.  I mean, like that is a choice.  Like I always forget to personalize it, but like my husband goes in behind me and is like  first name click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like there's way too much content, so much content.  And I would love to consume more content.  There's a full issue of the New Yorker that's just about COVID-19 that I'm trying to read.  But then that but that gets placed on the back burner with a it's a pile of guilt.  It's a pile of guilt.  There's so much content.  And then there's the podcast.  And I worry that we're making so much content that, yeah, you can make money if you hit  the right new thing, sub stack now next year.  I don't know what the next big thing will be, but it's got to be a moving target.  And I don't is there's such a it feel like there's a glut which is going to reduce the  value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you can you get enough people to let you do what you love doing?  And you do that by serving somebody well and bringing them value.  God, I hope so.  That's what I try to do.  Yeah, it's what you do.  You did that.  One of my students, Matt Keizer started something called What the F spelled out just happened  today.  That's the full URL.  And he does a newsletter and he went on to Patreon and he got enough money and he makes  it.  Pete Dominic was a he's a comic and he was on Sirius.  And now he has a podcast and he goes on Patreon and enough people give me here all these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then I want follow ups because a year from now and two years from now, are they  still making it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know.  And well, that that because it's called this was a Trump thing, right?  He started kind of by accident.  He was.  And he came out.  A lot of people made money on Trump for sure.  But he I thought he was going to have to give it up.  He said, no, people his readers tell him, no, keep going.  Well, they tell him now the adjustment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see.  I I think it hurts us.  I mean, when we started 15 years ago, we there weren't a lot of podcasts and we were very  successful for a long time because there wasn't any competition.  But there is now so much competition.  There's more than 100,000 new podcasts every week that everybody can do.  And it's not just competition, by the way, for listenership, because I feel like our  listenership is pretty solid.  It doesn't doesn't go down much.  Doesn't go up much.  It's every one.  Thank you.  All of you people, you know, and they're in the habit of it.  But but you're also competing for ad dollars.  And that's gotten much more brutal, much more brutal over the over the years.  And I just feel like it's going to be harder and harder because pretty soon everybody's  going to have a podcast.  This is too much content problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  And I think that's where we are is we're still we had a scarcity based model where you had  you had a publication and it had a beginning and an end and you filled it.  Right. This is Gutenberg parenthesis.  Right. And that's what you did.  Well, now we're still trying to fill the Internet.  I can't go to bed, dear.  There's still an empty spot on the Internet.  Right. And and so I think that we haven't figured out how to get down to value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't media the substack of three years ago?  And I go to medium now.  It's link bait city.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they don't even have advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they make money from harassing you till you sign up.  Right. Five bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, sign up like read this particular article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a sense, so no, I'm looking now.  Here's here's the stories that I'm looking at right now on my front page.  I'm going to tell you the biggest secret about competing on dot dot dot.  You probably suspected it all along.  There are two types of genius and one doesn't reveal itself to middle age.  The Red Slime lawsuit, the magazine.  Yeah. This is New York Times. Yeah.  We hired a guy off Craigslist.  I stopped reading it because the value went way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is interesting.  Substack does not promote things.  Now, so when you go to medium, part of the argument is and I post on medium and my blog both.  I get some social bump from it.  People might discover it.  Substack doesn't do that, which is interesting.  I'm not sure. They leave it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. But but, you know, should they add value in that way?  I don't know. They have a leaderboard, but that's that's kind of mass thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never thought nudity was a big deal.  Then my hotel room door opened.  Oh, how I burn fat and build muscle without going to the gym.  Six habits of profoundly lonely people.  I mean, I'm just is this just me?  Maybe it's because of what I've read in the past.  I've ruined my medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In a world run by algorithm, it's just weird.  This is our best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why am I getting the article, the first signs of alcoholic liver damage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are not in the liver. Why am I getting that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing I know where the signs of alcoholic liver damage are.  I'm not going to lie, I'm intrigued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let me let me click on that.  What do you tell me what you're getting, Jeff?  So maybe so is it watching what I read and then giving me more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I can go I saw I saw follow some of the like algorithms.  Doug Rushkoff, we love what disagree with, but we love  in a world run by algorithms, weirdness is our best weapon.  Then we have John Mayeda, formerly head of the Rochester School of Design.  So these but these are people you follow.  That's the difference. No, not all of them.  Peter Diamandis, AI and shopping, the new retail era.  I don't follow him.  There's Spanish there. They don't know me that well.  One zero, which is one of their publications, ex Googler  Meredith Whitaker on political power and tech and the flaws of something.  It goes off.  Meanwhile, no, my first signs of alcoholic just like my Facebook is good  because I I care and I give it a little bit of attention and good things happen.  If you just give it a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, the subtitle on this subhead, not enough alcoholics are educated about this.  I'm OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they don't want to be either. That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Digestive, cognitive, neuromuscular and vascular.  I'll just leave the rest.  That's a lot of other things. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I open medium probably once or twice a quarter if that.  Well, I'm always looking for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always looking for news sources.  So last year, medium turned out to be a useful source of news for us.  So I added it to my beat check.  And the reason this comes up is about two months ago, I took it off my beat check  because it was such a wasteland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, I mean, they go there and through links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, now and I see people that I adore.  You know, I see Veratoon Day.  I see Roberta Blake, Eric Baker, Joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's because medium thinks you're black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder why.  But then I scrolled through and all of the different things.  I'm some chaser. Just a bunch of listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's too many listicles. I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm like, I don't read any of this stuff.  What would make it suggested to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I have an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, Leo, I think medium thinks you're a, I don't know,  64 year old woman.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nailed it.  But you know what?  You know what? Substack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't tell you what's what's Substack doing.  Substack is going to adhere them to a lot of people.  They have an RSS reader.  They're building RSS. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, hey, let me ask you this.  Showdown. Hilaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When we get to the RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did Hamish McKenzie have a great Scott accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did not know. Oh, man.  He was not that kind of Hamish with a name like Hamish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should sound like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does have red hair, doesn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, Lassie, you need to come over here and join us over here in Substack.  All right, let's take a break.  And no, there's nowhere to go.  We're stuck here together.  You and me together.  Sorry. Let us get the pics of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll start with should we first have just a moment of silence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you blew it. You blew it.  I did it. Oh, you did.  It doesn't have to be an actual pause.  The editors, their razor blades, they're this thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I didn't mean that. No, I was going to the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to a story.  Oh, you want to you want to have a moment of silence for Flash. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dum dum dum dum dum bum bum bum bum bum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 1995 was when Flash began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God, it took a long time to kill that sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little did we know what we were getting into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same thing can be said about the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I'm going to think of it. Yeah.  The Flash from Adobe is gone as of the end of this month in two days.  However, there are emulators.  There are other ways to do it.  And as we mentioned a couple of weeks ago, Internet Archive has a Flash archive  where they're using a rust based emulator to give people a chance  to experience peanut butter jelly time one more time.  Bless their heart. Bless their hearts.  But you know what?  I thought actually, at first I was starting to get calls on the radio show  from people saying, oh, what am I going to do, you know?  And I thought this is going to be a problem.  And then it just stopped.  People go, oh, I actually don't need flesh.  What's not going to work?  Nothing. What sites are still dependent upon it?  If a site's still using Flash, they deserve to die at this point.  Yeah. Well, actually still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually still requires Flash for taking a picture and sending it.  No, chat, but they're killing chat. So it's done.  Oh, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They thought it'd be easier to kill chat than to replace Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Skype needed it.  No, what was it?  No, I know what it was.  Watching MSNBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there used to be some content sites, but I think that's long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've gotten rid of it, I think.  Yeah, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've seen this coming for years.  And the biggest problem was starting in 2010.  If you had an iOS device, you couldn't use Flash.  And I would assume any site on the web that cared anything about what it's doing  was hoping that people with iPhones might be able to visit it. Right. So.  Is there is a site is Flash.  Dead yet.  Let's just see real quickly.  Is Flash dead yet?  A funeral has been scheduled.  That plugin really tied the room together.  It was the plugin for its place in time.  Flash is being retired.  Well, there you go.  There's really no debate.  This is a good if you want to read about it, you can read about it here.  At is Flash dead yet, which apparently was created in 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's. Wow.  Grief. Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get the picks of the week, starting with Stacey's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Today's thing is hoops.  Hoops. Hoops.  Y'all may have heard of this already, because Micah probably told you about it,  because I know he's a Homebridge fan.  I think he's a Homebridge fan.  OK, so there's this open source home automation software called Homebridge  that lets you tie other devices into the Apple HomeKit ecosystem.  So if you are all in on Apple's HomeKit and you have a couple of devices  and you want to use Siri to control it and you want to use the home app,  Hoops is the way to do that.  And it has existed for a long time.  But it's hard. It existed like, well, it existed initially as software  that you put you. You would have to buy a pie, flash an SD card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but they now sell it as a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they launched Hoops, which was Homebridge out of the box.  And it's basically an enclosure for a pie.  And they've installed Homebridge on it.  So it's kind of expensive for what it is.  But I had Kevin try it out because he's he's been playing with HomeKit for a while.  And his his verdict was.  That if you're all in on HomeKit, this is this is an option  and you don't want to flash your own card and download it,  which most people watching the show are probably OK doing.  But it's it's a neat alternative that's out there,  especially if, you know, you want to bring your ring doorbell into your HomeKit setup.  This all may be obsolete in a few months after Project Chip comes to fruition, but.  We're going to. So it's 170.

One hundred seventy bucks and it's got all or if you have a Raspberry Pi  or willing to buy one, the Homebridge software is free.  So you can download the image, put that on your Raspberry Pi  and do exactly the same thing, I presume. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is literally nothing.  Yeah, there is nothing that would make.  But there are a lot of people who, I mean, when I tell someone, OK,  you're going to go to this site and you're going to flash an SD card  with this software, they're like, stop everything. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try to tell those people, do it, do it, do it.  But they still go out and spend a hundred seventy bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  That's a ratio, Jeff.  That's not like a total numbers.  No, that's not the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where's the trend? Where's the growth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it has to do with home prices, obviously.  I was going to say, is a lot cheaper.  In Wisconsin. Yeah.  Yeah. Madison's nice.  It's cold. They're sorry.  They want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, I'm sorry to say.  Boston, Chicago and Cincinnati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is very small.  It's a sleepy fishing village.  People think it's a city.  It's 400000 people in seven square miles by seven miles.  It's not it's not a big city at all.  It's charming. It has some wonderful restaurants.  I love it. But it was it's been ruined.  And I just hope that all these people leave and they fix it because

It's a short film. And it's a nine minute film.  And I had no idea about this thing when I searched for it on Netflix  and pulled it up.  The algorithm said it was a 67 percent match for me.  That's why Netflix never showed it to me, because I typically don't watch stuff  like this, but it was rather charming.  And it's only nine minutes of your time.  So go over there, watch it.  It's like an animated short.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is something that's happening lately on Netflix that I'm really encouraged by.  They have a lot of shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This one was really good.  It definitely will tug at the heart.  So go give it nine minutes of your time and give it a nice rating  so these people can get some more.  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Netflix is recommending Death to 2020 to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no. Yeah, it recommended that one to me, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Nobody who's a parent could watch that.  No, no, no, no, no. I can't.  The only people who watch that kind of thing are people who have no kids.  It's too painful. Too painful.
