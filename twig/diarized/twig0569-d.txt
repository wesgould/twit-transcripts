Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think I don't I can't get excited about anything  On this thing we were it was actually I was excited last week  Because right in the middle of the show the big Twitter hack happens boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was news and by the way, I was off for 24 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because still off who?  Lori gills  Imor.com is still off  So is Crackberry because and this is a classic story  There they were very early their IT department immediately saw the first finance hack and  Rocked that it was gonna go I guess they saw a couple of people and they somehow understood that it must be blue checks  So they immediately changed all their passwords. I just the same thing they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did while we were on the show last week fortunate. I changed the password and so when everybody else came back  I wasn't back. I had to go to an executive whose job this was not but who was very nice  I don't want to say who it was because everybody go to him  They think they have a Twitter problem, but he was very nice  And he got me up, but I had to go through a couple steps to get back up because I was obviously it  Turned a flag

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. It's not cuz you're a QAnon conspiracy theorist. Well, let's talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, yes, Glenn Maxwell her fight see her father  I've met her her father had very close Russian connections. It was presumed to be a Russian spy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I don't know I complain of conspiracy theorist. Oh, yeah, you pronounce G H I S L I N E

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Glenn as Glenn Glenn Glenn

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Glenn I heard it from her father. It's like Siobhan. It's like one of those weird Irish

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah long and then and then bars father, of course  hired Epstein's  to teach at the  College and Maxwell has ties to the Israeli and Russian mobs through her father

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And yeah, I could do conspiracy there's a lot of there's a lot of threads on that one boy  Oh are there pulling because a whole sweater sweater will fall apart  But just to go full circle on the Twitter attack  The New York Times did some I think intrepid reporting unless it proves that at some point that they were taken for a ride  But they I think did a pretty good job of verifying that they were getting  From people actually at the scene the story of what happened  And they did this  Very quickly. This is only a couple of days later and they were able to finger a user  named Kirk a  User named Kirk who claimed at the time that he worked at the  Twitter  Which would sort of make sense except that it turned out he didn't work for Twitter  He in fact did have access though to something that only Twitter employees should have access to the God account the God  Dashboard that lets you do  Anything but the most I think dramatic part of this story and again, they're getting this from  People who are connected to the hack they match their social media and cryptocurrency accounts to accounts who were involved  The people that they were talking to also presented screenshots and other corroborating evidence logs on discord  So and so forth so there's some reason to believe this story  But boy, this is if you're Twitter and they've not admitted to this or said anything about it  This is the thing that is the most damning for Twitter. It turns out no Kirk didn't in fact  work at Twitter, but he did get access to the God mode because  apparently  Twitter had put the credentials for the administrator console in  Pinned them in fact in their internal slack messaging channel. Oh, that's that's smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not bueno, and that's that's true. No way. No, he's perfect. Yeah experts. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, and that's all it had to be hacked really was that slack and that gave him access  to all those accounts  Still I think this kind of the unknown  Which was is is Kirk really Vladimir and were the spammy and probably not very lucrative  Messages just a misdirection while he did other things because he certainly could have done other things Twitter says only the DMs of eight  Accounts were downloaded and all eight were unverified, but they won't say what they  Yeah, we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, when all this stuff was going down  I had reached out to our friend Dan Patterson because he he covers a lot of the security stuff and  The first thing he said to me he's like this can't be the end game. This is more than likely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Misdirection one that's that's certainly tempting isn't it?  That's so that's Dan will be on Twitter on Sunday, by the way, so we'll all ask oh it will yeah sweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell me not just talk to him a few minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hide in things from aunt well, you figured you know, you know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dan of course works for CBS. He's great CBS news. Go ahead Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was gonna say if you you have to think suspiciously like okay, this could have been something  You know that the 12 to me nine dimensional chess whatever  Dimensions of chess as many as you want basically  but  I'm also kind of like  After reading the New York Times story was like, oh, these are a bunch of stupid kids kids having fun  Yeah, and yeah, they may have just stolen, you know  They're friends accounts credentials just to see if they were talking about them and that's not  Implausible it would be stupid for you to like  plan for that, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So  They you know if it's if it Kirk if that's who we're talking about  Didn't get a lot of money  If you watch the account you can't really judge because hackers typically will  Put money into and out of accounts in such a way that you can't really be sure how much money they're making  But we do have one source Binance  Which is a Bitcoin exchange by it said as soon as we saw that address we blocked it and we were able to block  More than a quarter million dollar of transactions  So a lot of people wanted to put money  Idiots but you know, so  It wasn't a super lucrative hack it is like you have  the you have  the keys to Disneyland and  All you decide to do is ride the train around in a circle. It's it's  It seems like they could have done more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I feel like if you had if you were a state actor that had the ability to have those credentials in that access  You wouldn't blow it. You wouldn't do anything stupid. You wouldn't do anything, you know, you wouldn't do what you did, right?  Yeah, so that's why I'm like, maybe it's misdirection, but it's kind of looks like well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless you're a state actor that's had access for a long long long long time and now you just want to blow it up  But that even that doesn't make sense. You know, why would you blow it up now? Yeah  They do that right right?  Yeah, you know election I think maybe the surface reading is just the right reading so how did how did they get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they say it was it was  Social did they pay off somebody inside Twitter? Is there any fault of that still that's not that's not clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could but it could be all Kirk really needed was the access to the slack channel  So it could be  He got some Twitter guy drunk and it didn't think he the Twitter guy didn't think he was giving him anything particular  Yeah, you can come in our slack hang out with us. Maybe  Hey, I mean, I you know, that's not like saying hey, dude, I'll give you a hundred bucks if you give me god mode  That's that's a little lower level, but it turns out it was giving him god mode  So I don't know Twitter says it's an active investigation so they wouldn't comment to the Times and we haven't heard much since

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always worry about the social engineering at a company like this that  Supposedly should be sort of you know in tune with knowing that they could be socially engineered at any point in time  Just because of where they work. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you would think that I've been socially engineered in the past two times one a contractor on leaving in 2017  Deleting Trump's account that was fixed quickly  And of course, Jack Dorsey was hacked quite notably  Sim swap so long ago, but he was sim swapped was interesting because the sim swap gang  Another sim swap or the same. I don't know that did that started this  They do the sim swapping it with an eye to getting the og Twitter handles  Like at why or at six, right?  Makes me glad I didn't take out Leo way back when which I could have it was available, but I was at Leo report  Because that's those they go after those quite actively you don't want a short

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter handle like poor at net

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, poor at Matt  Yeah, yeah  And he doesn't even have two T's on his right. It's really short

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I do have a beef with one of the stories that went out that said  Twitter was better now that they verified accounts could he tweet. Yeah, that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little snarky every you're right. You're right. It was just a different for stark. I say that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's like it was back to the people I  Know I honestly think Twitter was better before  The celebrities and the big brands arrived Twitter was really cool when it was that's what you were the biggest seller  when I was number one

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me put it. Let me put it to you like this  I'm looking at three verifies right now on the panel  I want to see what you all are saying on Twitter  You know that I know that you can use it as a marketing platform and things of that nature  But most of the time I'm looking for you three for information for just general conversation because in my eyes you are  Regular people that just happen to have a blue check so  For them to just throw that blanket statement out there is like all the blue checks are gone  So Twitter is much better. That's that's poor because there are plenty of good blue checks out there providing a you know good content

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree like my dreams nicest person on the internet isn't he's way too nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been angry the last couple days, so maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, yeah, oh and you should have a wig it'll make you feel better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I got the mannequin for wig

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just saying you know when life brings you down you got a  Yeah, are you fluffing up right now Stacy? This is me. I'm trying to be fluffy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's just going

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just need a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A trash pan to behind you then you'll be really happy man. I just read over over her left shoulder there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd be so cool. That'd be perfect perfect perfect. They're just ready to ready the claw right just yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like that we all think might that my taxidermied animal should have some sort of aggressive anti happiness going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he uses a threat. It's the real misbehavior scream. Oh geez

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is it is the closest to me isn't it oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get my oh  Launch trash panda button. That's what I mean and it'll just come out over

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Comes out from behind the screen good to give Carson things to do get a  Tres on it now, so  Let's talk about this QA thing Twitter  banned  7,000 QAnon accounts this was you know I mean Twitter's known about these forever  They're going to classify QAnon the conspiracy theory is  coordinated harmful activity  Because of a rise in harassment targeting high-profile critics of the president which has been the definition of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bad for quite a while, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  The also a hundred fifty thousand accounts will be affected  Other qq knew there were that many QAnon accounts  It will stop recommending accounts and content related to QAnon  It's been doing that okay  Maybe that's a good idea Twitter, and it will take steps to limit circulation of content in features like trends and search  150,000 QAnon accounts are included in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the thing is folks  We can play whack-a-mole forever, they're not gonna go away we what we have to do is learn as a society to ignore them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, honestly, which the tension you have to be quite a mush mind to fall into the QAnon. Oh, there's a picture of a mush mind right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was the most minds and I would say Jeff no you can't ignore them some of these people are actively scary and hostile and  Represent in the physical world and as a woman I would say to you no ignoring them as a bad strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, what I'm saying is you're right. You're right. You're absolutely right. Absolutely. What I'm saying is though that  It's it's the revision of the old New Yorker cartoon. I can't come to bed. There's a nut on the internet  and so yes, you should get rid of them as best you can but we shouldn't declare the internet broken and  Throw up our hands that it's awful when one creeps on we'll get rid of them  We'll get rid of them we'll get rid of them but but when we give them attention, that's what they most want  Well, wait a minute. I'm saying is get rid of them quietly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just read that Chrissy Teigen has been a constant target of harassment by QAnon in  Recent weeks and they've targeted some of her friends some of whom are private figures  Posting violent threats on their Instagram accounts. Okay now you've gone too far if you that's practically  That's as bad as threatening ant pruett if you're threatening Chrissy Teigen  And why why  What it probably says that's a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try to break into their mind. That's kind of what they want is to be in your head  So just get rid of them and and when I say ignore them Stacy just don't give them attention. That's what I want  That's what I mean. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the hard part because human nature is to respond when someone speaks to you whether it's a hello  Or whether it's a you're a jackass you're gonna respond to either one of those statements and a lot of times with the people  On the internet. It's hard to sort of put that filter up to say. Yep. This is just another keyboard tough guy  Coming at me with some rubbish

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although sort of supporting your point, I guess the one of the reasons they're targeting Chrissy Teigen is because she  regularly goes on Twitter and  You know bashes them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She doesn't well she bashes them for being jerks to her and  Trying to police her because she's I mean  I maintain that they're trying to please her because she's a famous woman  Right, and if you see the attacks that women on Twitter get when they have a large audience. Oh, it's terrible  Oh, yeah, it's awful. Yeah, so, you know, it's it's kind of like I  Know that's politics. I'm not bringing it up  But see I'm with you and you just have to not respond and you have to tell yourself  like there's plenty of times people are like saying stuff to me on the internet and I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's funny because it's so outrageous  that you know, but it's also seductive in a weird way because  As you as you get sucked it down that rabbit hole you get all the support from other people say yeah now you're seeing  Now you're getting it now you're getting it and you get this feeling of being just like any cult  Yeah, it's really culty isn't it and you feel like if oh, wow  I'm the you know, the scales have fallen from my eyes. I'm finally seeing what's really going on  and so I understand why people get sucked into it, but  I mean, there's how much how much is it Twitter's job to  To fight this I mean that seems like an impossible task not just QAnon but conspiracy theories in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Openly says that they want to have this as a safe space for everybody to enjoy the platform  I mean if you go in to report a particular Twitter account or what have you they have all of these different  reasons why are you trying to report it because they totally don't agree to people being  Harassing or just insensitive or spammy I mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, I mean they're not I think I think that I mean think about it this way so if social media is a party  Twitter is like, you know what? You got to leave the party. You're being a giant dick to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bingo bingo. Yes  And Stacy I was thinking about this day to its its its so now Facebook is to me  Right if that should be the standard if you invited this  Dork into your party and everybody got pissed at you for they never come back to your parties again  That's exactly what's happening. So don't invite the dork and get rid of the dork from the party. Don't invite the dork

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Invite the dork it's like hey when the dork shows himself  It let's not call him a dork because I think there's lots of places for dorks on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was trying to well, I was gonna use a slightly different sounding thing, but I was trying to be polite

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so if you're being uncivil and  Rude on a perpetual basis and especially harassing  I think that you know, it's like a conference like most conferences are getting more aggressive about their, you know, civility policies where they're like hey  Don't be a jerk to people if you are we're gonna ask you to leave and if you don't leave we're gonna have security kick you out

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it clear where the line should be drawn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it is. No, I mean that's that's part of why being human is really  Fun and tough. I mean when you get a bunch of people together  we've all had encounters where like sometimes I've said stuff and made people feel bad and then I'm like  Oh, no, or someone said something to me and I'm like, oh that makes me feel really icky and uncomfortable  Is it icky enough to ask them to leave? I don't know. I mean  This is why we just learned something you didn't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember I remember the day when I used the phrase and I have not used it since but I'm gonna use it for example  right now to open your kimono  right to reveal something and  Someone wise said to me. No Jeff realize what you're saying. I thought oh right, right. And so that's how we change norms  That's what we do. We used to call women girls. We don't do that now and  And so so what's fascinating to me is what I said last week too is that the discussion around content moderation  That was occurring within Facebook and Twitter is now occurring across the culture  Thanks to the whole Harper's letter and cancel culture. It's a process of exactly what Stacy's saying. We're negotiating  We're adding things to lists that bother people they have the power now to say so and we're learning or we're fighting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kind of regret the loss of such salty sayings. It's done up in the kimono

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I kind of well Stacy Stacy get your claw out for it. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That I yeah, I understand but it's such a vivid  Analogy, I like it. It's like the camel's nose under the tent except camels don't have a voice in this conversation  You know what I'm saying time, yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's lots of phrases. I mean that's kind of the same argument  We see about people who are like, oh, I'm not racist, but I like those Confederate statues. They've been up for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They don't bother me. I mean, it's it's not your well in the tech sector that battle now is over blacklist  whitelist right master slave and  Sometimes it goes a little far for instance. I mean, what do you think of this Stacy and then I'll ask you  It was probably more appropriate but a github  When when you have a  When you commit something to github, it's the master  And you can and then others can pull the master you can commit to the master and in that case the master is there's no  Concomitant slave the master isn't a slave master. The master is like a school master  The master is the person the master of a ship. How about that? That's a better like the original actually  Do you like the master master ship? It's like yeah, github is going to deprecate that Apple is also getting rid of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is where the conversation becomes important Leo and  I would never have thought of this and then if someone brought this up and said this is really uncomfortable and here's why  It's my job to listen and say oh crap. That's right, right, you know, right and maybe I  Think a lot of the outrage here also is in part because we haven't ever listened to people if you never listen to someone  Their grievances build and build  If there weren't systemic racism it might not be such a bad thing to have the master branch but because there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, there's that history at all. Yeah, how does it does it bother you aunt?  Or let's put this this way because maybe it does today but a year ago  If I said well the the when you commit something to get you're committing to the master branch  Okay  Didn't work out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay  Didn't wouldn't have bothered me a year ago  But that's also because I think about things like my grandfather being a mechanic and teaching me how to work on brakes  There's a brake master cylinder, right? There's a slave cylinder. So and  Just thought about it that way because one controls sort of the other it's just the terminology that was used  But I'm a little more sensitive to that now because of you know, I think things are just being brought to my eyes a little bit more  Nowadays, so I would prefer to go with something as like the main versus the secondary. Yeah, because that's that's all it is  Master and slave I completely agree with that's blatant. But what about

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But he was a master mechanic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But right but on the other hand there are master mechanics. There are master photographers  There are master musicians and I get that that's that's a whole different aspect. They're not  Posing imposing their will on somebody else, you know  You can be a master musician and not necessarily have a slave musician in your camp or anything  It's just a master musician, you know  So I get that but when you start talking about having two two separate parties and one controls the other  There's a better way to put it. I agree and you can just  Say main and in secondary or right, you know main and prime name and whatever something like that and to negotiate that change  Is not impinging on anyone's freedom of expression

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a set as not, you know political correctness. It's just sensitivity  Sensitivity it's not being a dick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. Well, you said it I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because we have Lisa and I have a teenager  Because we have Lisa and I have a teenager teenage boy and he has a lot of teenage friends Lisa does dbd  Lessons don't be a dick lessons all the time with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and if you discuss that over lunch one day is pretty great

Oh great  It took them a long time to figure out there was other things you could do  and I agree we're kind of at that stage in the internet where initially it was brochures and magazines and  If you were a tv person you made your internet site look like tv if you're a radio person you did podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what it's going to be. What's the next is there was a wonderful thread today from a guy named adam lenson l-e-n-s-o-n  Uh that really inspired me because he said he's a theater producer  Everybody else is dying to get back in the theater. He understands that because he does theater  But he said I found an audience of 50 000 people who could watch these musical things that I created my lord  I couldn't do that. Otherwise  And and the way that we could we can collaborate around the world. I mean all these people, you know  so it was this it was this enthusiasm I missed for the internet and it happened because  Of coronavirus right nobody was going to do it  But now it's there and he's seeing the benefit in it. Others are complaining  But he sees the value and I just love that spirit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

I took at a lavender  Garden it was just a terrible photo, but by putting in the alps and giant popsicles  I think it's bringing it to bring it to life. Don't you think?  um  Sure  I think the alps really make it sure boss  Yeah, sure  But what's interesting is it knew where the horizon was it knew where to put the alps  Yeah, you can size and move the pie. It's ai. It's pretty smart  If I show you the original of that picture you'll say oh, yeah, you're right. Here's the original  This is this is such a boring picture  And in fact, that's why I picked it to run it through the photoshop camera because damn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish you'd fix that horizon line you crooked. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just driving me nuts. Oh it does doesn't it? Well, I I can fix that  We have the we have the technology just do a little please. Thank you a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Horizon line fix in here i'll sleep a little better tonight, but no i'm i'm glad to see adobe  Uh making this investment if you will  Uh, because again the photoshop camera app is cool for a certain crowd  There you go. How do you like it? I fixed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now you know why aunt does hands-on photography and not me

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought the popsicles were good. I don't know. I just thought you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean and then it has uh  The lightroom camera app that allows you to shoot raw and long exposures with your phone  And i've never used as long as you have a tripod and it would work really good  Some of the time. Yeah, you know so  kudos  This is a heck of a move because we saw what it did with the pixel 4 and  The pixel 4 computational photography is really really really good just makes it easy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So mark levois congratulations left google in march after six years. He had actually done the camera  Uh in the glass explorer edition as a visiting faculty member at munch at google x  Um, he was like anyway for that. Oh, yeah, he's really uh, I I get the sarcasm but no he's really  It was genuinely interesting  So he is now going to adobe and so expect some interesting software

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, his demo was awesome. It's worth rewatching that demo from last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He showed night shot and all or the um night sight in the and the astro astrophotography and all the stuff  It's interesting because I would have assumed that  An intimate knowledge of the hardware is required to do good computational photography, but maybe not  Maybe it doesn't matter what camera you're using

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think  When I when I think about like the astro stuff  It's not necessarily thinking about the hardware. It's thinking about geolocation and other  Variables outside of the camera where the ai is thinking about okay. How can I really make this work?  Okay, now I can shove this  Into the hardware and boom we got it looks good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is you know, so canon just announced  Its new mirrorless line the r5 and the r6  Finally going, you know, this is canon and nikon of the old line mirror big dslr's with  Moving mirrors in them and they were starting to get their lunch eaten  I think a little bit by sony and it's mirrorless line  so canon and I always thought canon and nikon will be slow on this because they don't want to cannibalize their  Very lucrative, you know mirror camera business, right and they have they were initially a little slow  But this r5 looks to be  Probably the best camera canon makes right it certainly competes with the 5d. I don't know if it competes with the 1d but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That one is  That one is right above right below the 1dx if you ask me. Yeah  Because the 1dx is just able to do some some things a little more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In extreme locations and in extreme situations. Yeah, but this is the size of a of a rock  You know a quail and the one day size of a turkey 1dx is a tank

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean there really is a big difference in size. Yeah, but it has a great weather ceiling and this r5 is pretty high  But personally, I i'd like to have the r6. I was pretty close to pulling the trigger on an r6

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little less expensive the r5 is 30 900 bucks  What's what's the r6 thousand bucks less an r6 is just a thousand under  so my reason I brought that up is  What's missing in this?  Is that computational photography? Yep. This is all about the the physical hardware  And the sensor and the processor and the in-body image stabilization  And they're not putting I mean, I there is a computer in it, but it seems like they're not really advancing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not?  The only advancing that you'll see in it is how it tries to process the jpegs and make them look prettier, right?  You know changing the color temperature and okay in saturation. That's about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are getting and I I don't know how good cannons will be compared to the  sonys the sonys are really good at face tracking  And eye tracking which is really amazing and they can even do animal eye tracking, right? Which makes a big difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last year's late last year's firmware update from canon to the eos r  updated their  Autofocus and made it a lot more reliable and faster  And of course they have iterated on that and put it into the new r5 and r6 and according to reports  It's really really good and a lot faster than before and it locks dead on today  I've watched a couple videos. Oh, I love it for some people on youtube trying to test it out and it was it was pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was right there with some in my a7r 4. It's just remarkable  so but nevertheless the whole idea of the of the  software and the  pixel 4  Is that you have essentially a tiny sensor kind of a junkie sensor relative to something like this, right?  Right, that's a full frame sensor. This is I don't know how many hundreds of times bigger  And yet because of computational photography you get remarkable images. What would it be like if they applied that same?  Capabilities to an incredible sensor like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably more expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Much more data is there in that sensor? I mean how much harder is it to do all that computing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. You'd be a lot more processing  But really what this I mean in order to do that when the pixel they take nine images, right?  Right really really quickly. They gather a lot of data intentionally. It's 12 megapixel camera. So so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a question for you 108 megapixels. Yeah, is it was it possible because these were smaller sensors and smaller cameras  Was it more likely for the innovation to happen here than on expensive cameras? It's kind of counterintuitive  For that reason with with computational you got to think about the cost though. You got to think about cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of the hardware  to handle all of that process and power of it again because you got this  Big 35 millimeter sensor pulling all this extra light in to process  That's that's a lot of data that r5 can shoot up to 8k  Resolution that's a lot of data to process

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, of course. We're getting close. I mean this is  This this phone is a thousand dollar phone. It's only a quarter of the cost of the r5  so  um  You know, that's an interesting question. Certainly the processors in here  Are faster than the process in modern cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we talked about this on my instagram today. I try to do it if y'all ain't following me on instagram  Why not follow me over there?  I just did a live stream just to chit chat with my people that follow me and we talked about this today because  Samsung apple and google they're making photography  Uh friendly  For everybody and allowing you to just literally pick your phone up and hit the button one time and you got a pretty good shot  Uh, someone mentioned in the comments. They said, you know, I went from smartphone photography  to  Buying a dslr and shooting and I was way better on my smartphone for a while  Yeah, you know because it's so much easier. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense  Well, I just I was I was wondering so we'll see I mean mark  Why didn't mark levoid go to nikon or canon? Maybe they could have used him better, but uh, certainly adobe  Is trying to find ways to stay relevant in a world where there's a lot more competition for the creative cloud than ever before  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, let's take a little break come back with more ant pruett's here  He's as you can tell our photographer hands-on photography hands-on wellness as well because he's he's also fit. I hate him

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's young I don't like him at all. I'll go ahead and tell you I am the most unhealthy healthy person  You know mr. Report you should see my barbecue. Oh, yeah, it's the barbecue  Ice cream every day pie every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but you can do it because you you all that hard work gives you that freedom if I lift every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could I eat pie every day because I would do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty good. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, would you buy another tesla stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would lease another tesla. I'm not gonna let elon's weirdness get in my way of it being an excellent car

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I let it get in my way  I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did because if you just didn't like the car it wasn't him. You just didn't like the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I loved my model x lisa didn't that's she didn't that's what it was. Oh, well then mama ain't happy ain't nobody  Yeah  It was a combination of factors, but that was one of them. It was my car  She didn't have to like it. I said if you don't like it, don't drive it  She because she said the car would attack her  Yeah, but I always felt a little  Nervous running autopilot and so forth and I just you know what the final straw was for me  And maybe they fixed this by now was the long lead time on repair parts  Oh, I'd heard stories. No, I think that's actually worse. Oh  I'd heard  I'd heard stories about people's windshield got broken and they couldn't drive the car because for months because they didn't have replacements  So that's not good  Anyway, i'm getting either getting now. Okay, they're throwing some monkey wrenches my way. I really was excited about the ford  Mustang mach-e  Right now this new volvo polestar 2 sounds pretty sweet, too  So, I don't know  I don't know  But you're still planning on the mustang something electric by the end of the year one way or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be electric tune in in december to see what happens. Yes. It's exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When's your lease run out on your model?  Model s

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so I actually purchased mine. Oh, see so why we never used to lease cars  Well the technology and I I tried to convince my husband that a lease would be better in this case, but he is a die hard  We buy it we own it till it, you know, we would own our cars for 11 or 12 years and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what I would do too. I always bought my cars  But lisa convinced me that there's tax benefits to leasing it as a company car

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So well, we hadn't explored that it was more just  With technology buying a car doesn't make a lot of sense anymore. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that was that was the other concern is especially in the early days of the tesla. This is the first model x is  What about battery life? What's that going to be like? How is it worth?  You know, can you try but I think now I would say that that car would go forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That car would go forever as someone driving the 2013 model. No, no  Your battery life is going down. Is it no my battery life is fine. That's not what's breaking down  But things like I mean, it's it's a 3g car. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the tech not see that's the problem. So we interviewed  Oh, I can't remember his name  Who wrote the book about uh, elon musk about tesla and he said the real thing is it's not a car company  Software company and so the the the development cycles the technology cycles are much more the life cycle of  Software than they are of a car because a car is you know, it's a 10 year takes five years design  It's on the market for a decade  You own it for a decade software. It's you know upgrade every five minutes and that's much more what the tesla is like  And since technology rushes along faster than cars do I think it's an issue  it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does hte or hd no does hd editor have a subaru wrx from 2001?  That's awesome. Do that is an amazing car  My dad bought it my brother stole it from him and now people still offer to buy it off of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? Okay. That's all hd editor in our chat room. My subi is 2001  My uh, it's funny made it so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay  Just saying if you want to get her stuffed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll keep that in mind I I don't think we want to commemorate my dog this way right there just right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She would be she would be cute and adorable. We'd snuff her curled up in a ball

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we could put a little sparking speaker in there. No, she should she should have her ears perked up. Yeah, perfect. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not not rushing you along by any means i'm just saying i'll i'll have her stuffed and send you the bill  Cars to get on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'd wait till she died jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lord, they're already planning to stuff world hazard. They're gonna put me right over in this corner here  I'll be standing with my arms folded looking over all the shows  Um  The ftc's anti according to sources the ftc's antitrust probe of facebook is going to at least go to next year  And part of it will be the  Giphy and the giphy acquisition, I don't know how to say it the giphy  acquisition  Giphy  Well, no, I know what it is  But I don't want I don't I don't want to offend people like saying giphy and then they say it's giphy or say giphy  And then they say it's giphy. It's giphy. It's giphy. It's giphy. Just accept it  You just see also do you have an opinion on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, I say it the same way the man that invented it say it says no he's wrong. He had a chance no  in the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't want leo to have the tie breaking. He does not time. We would be tied though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because it's two it'd be two. That's why I can't do math giphy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's neither giphy. It's like heroes. It's like heroes. It's not gyros heroes heroes. Yeah, I pronounce it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Memory hogs is what they're called. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, all right, I don't know. All right, what were we were talking about antitrust on facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's how exciting it was nobody cares. So how about eric schmidt starting a university?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, he's not starting he's asking for federal funds for a university which i'm like, but even so he wants to start the digital service academy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We compete with stanford and mit to train  artificial intelligence coders  It's actually a federal commission led by ex google ceo eric schmidt plus  former deputy secretary of defense robert o work, so this is you know, this is a  A government thing will be the u.s digital service, which by the way our good friend matt cuts is the administrator of  It would be the u.s digital service academy  An accredited degree awarding university that trains students in digital skills like cyber security and artificial intelligence

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's great year of work. So it's like google. So google last week announced a hundred thousand scholarships  To train people for certificates in data analytics project management ux  So as a as someone who teaches at university, should I be nervous? No  why

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they're competing with us. No. Well, okay. No, that's a capitalistic way of looking at it. Think about it this way  Well, I am that  If you want to keep the united states on the cutting edge  We've always said this  Education is critical and we've and we've got a we got we got institutions to do that  Okay, and they're being protectionist cuny is very good protectionist right now cuny is very good, but we could have more  Well, and especially I would say especially if these are government funded with with the goal of adding diversity to the workplace  Which was the google certainly is yeah need  Yeah, base it on need  Encourage black young men and women encourage women in general  I think it would be a really great idea because I think it's there's  In my mind, that's the kinds of things governments should do  Is really foster education because it helps the economy in the long run. I can tell you we need money right now. We're suffering

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and yeah, I still don't think it's competitive to to people like you though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It feels like it's not a four-year school

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's because I teach something useless and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're gonna teach really isn't a crisis of journalism in the united states. We're not  What's this? I think it's it's okay there. Are there a lot of h1b journalists being brought in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually have several friends in the journalism world. I have  Four of probably the hundred people i've worked with  So I guess it's not a huge percentage but um who were here on  h1b  Interesting interesting. I always want to say hb ones, but no I saw the um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The stats for h1b's it's a huge percentage like almost half of them go to  Go to google and facebook google  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the there's you see the story last week  About the indian cast coming to google was fascinating  That there's discrimination within google  One cast to another and the americans don't really have a sense of what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, this was crazy. This actually happened when I was in college  and we had a um  One I grew up in houston huge indian-american indian native like  Immigrant community. Um, and so this was actually something that  happened like  In my high school a little bit  But in college it was a big deal in the dorm I lived in and it was like totally under  Anybody's radar who wasn't indian

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So california state of california this month sued cisco  alleging discrimination based on india's caste system  An engineer faced discrimination because he was in the delet class delet class  Was it maybe it wasn't google it was cisco. Maybe I screwed that up deletes or you may remember then more as the term untouchables  Which is not  I guess no longer is the caste system still around I didn't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the this is the demonstration of it  It's still as people still try to draw it out of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They try to ask things that said the story and people like I have a friend who was in the the braman the  The priestly caste and he would he would let you know  And we would tease him about it because we thought it was absolutely hilarious, but it was actually very important to him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So two men who were cisco supervisors and higher castes  Are named in the suit for discriminating and again against and harassing the lower caste employee  He the lower caste employee received less pay and fewer opportunities  He could he opposed unlawful practices contrary to the traditional order  But between the dalit and higher higher castes the defendants retaliated against him

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's an interesting cultural. Is it by the way? I apologize. It wasn't google of cisco. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting fascination. It's big big data. That's good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you if you hang out with people  Who are indian for long enough these things like you you find them out little asides and things

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will never you can never underestimate the human ability to discriminate on the stupidest of premises  Yes  It's amazing  We and it just feels like it's built in somehow in some weird way into our you said what I was thinking  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just like dumbest stuff another thing just another thing and they're all fictions. They're all all fictions

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The irish hated the italians  You know the the jews hated the irish  I mean, it's just it's just non-stop  Just ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're thinking i'll just grow up to be a dog instead of a human

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's that text from michael sergeant

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, meanwhile speaking of ridiculous things  amazon or I mean  The eu is going after  And siri and company, yeah for antitrust, yeah  Why the fact that they've gone out for so many means that there's a lot means that there's not antitrust no antitrust, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right three. They're not just going after  So let us be clear  Okay, if you insist

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Accuracy is not good for ratings. Okay, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're going after  The digital assistance there are three  There are also lots of companies that want to get into this including big ones like samsung who weren't able to  And they tried because they they tried sucked  And yeah tough monkeys now. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on  Okay, okay  The eu one looks at competition a little bit differently from the u.s  We have to remember that they look at not just are you hurting the consumer?  But they also look at ease of entry from another from other people into the market  And there they do have kind of a case because you have market or network effects for  The number of devices or the developer ecosystem for these things you also and their questions are actually  more around like  Does the data aggregation that these companies get by virtue of being number one preclude others from  Winning in this market or ever coming to fight in this market  And I think that's actually a really interesting and relevant question that we should be asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree. I agree  EU though really is willing the eu really is willing to weigh in  To what here in the united states we'd say well, let the markets decide

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the market is not doing the best job at a lot of things  And i'm just going to leave it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would submit that the market's not doing a bad job of picking winners in voice assistance  But you're right. The market is not doing a good job. In fact, it fosters data acquisition

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't have any viable well  We don't have competitive viable options that protect our privacy  We are not actually having a good discussion about things like interoperability  Between these platforms until those platforms actually came to the table on their own because they were like, oh we're not selling enough to people  so yes, and that way the market was like, oh maybe interoperability matters, but  I would argue that  you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's never in the u.s been legislated interoperability between  mac and windows for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But is interoperability a part of this whole chip alliance?  Yes, and that's exactly came

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what i'm talking about is they came up with that last december because they were disappointed that the market was not adopting  Smart home stuff. They were like  Oh my gosh the market at work. Well, and that's what I said. That's the market at work  but the terms of that market are being dictated by the leaders as opposed to  The incumbents and new people with ideas so you could argue that once you're at the top  You're just dictating the terms of the market to everyone. I would love to see somebody come up with some sort of privacy protecting  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well digital assistant that's the idea of syria and apple  It's inherently difficult to do because the more I know about you the better. My assistant will be your assistant will be  But there there I think apple  Apple's seen the market value of becoming the privacy leader, right?  It was accidental. It was completely because they they couldn't do the ad business, right?  But you know, they made lemonade out of that lemon and uh, it's been that's not that's not ascribed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  safely into this  You're still locking people into the high-priced apple ecosystem  That has historically been  Not friendly to any outsiders, right?  And if you were a developer working within the apple ecosystem, you actually had to deal with some onerous terms  They've started to walk some of them back  You do have to give up your if you're in the app store your 30 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Again, I think the market is weighing in on that as well  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think around things like privacy data retention penalties for  Uh  not leaks hacks and  Sharing people's data breaches. Thank you  uh  I think that the government has a role to play there and I think they've  Abticated that role for a decade or more

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have been so look I am not the anti-government  No government low government kai and never have been and even more now  We're seeing the value of a coherent government in in some situations. That's very clear  But I have to say the government's intervention in technology has historically  Not been well  It's been heavy-handed. It's not it's been wrong and that's the u.s  Late late inevitably  But you know, I mean look what the government's trying to do is ban encryption right now  You know, I mean it's I don't I don't want the government to get I agree  A sane rational government as an expression of the will of the people  Would say something about privacy, but I don't think I think that I don't know  It's not that we should try and talk them into it  But it seems futile and it's just because government also is such a mismatch between the pace  Of innovation and technology and the pace of legislation and government. You know what we say this but we could move faster  And we could be better. We just we shouldn't I mean there's good reason for government to be slow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is good reason for government to be slow right now. I think we're a little too slow  I also think that we're  We just shrug our  Shoulders and we're like, uh, it's kind of like systemic racism in the sense like we're like, ah, who can we should do something about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree  Um, but but we have to start not by saying, you know, there ought to be a government law  What we have to start by doing is getting money out of politics so that these incumbents cannot influence the law  The systemic problem goes so low that we got to fix that  Before you can say well, I think government could solve these privacy issues  Yeah, they could in a perfect world as I said if the government reflected the will of the people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't agree that we need to wait for the world to be perfect. You can actually see pushback from citizens groups and privacy groups  Pushing back against industry and yes, we're going to get compromises and not everyone's going to be happy  But it's a start and from there you can look at court cases  You can come back and have you can appoint people to regulatory commissions that oversee this to actually take action  You know, there's a lot of flexibility that will come in once we have a law even if that law isn't perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is you know, that's a good point in the california privacy act  Which is now rolling out started july 1st. We're starting to see some, uh, I think beneficial effects from it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It started uh, january  Actually, they decided to start enforcing it on  The da said he would start enforcing it as of july 1st, right?  I know that's a tiny quibble, but it's worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, nobody paid attention to it until this month and then all of a sudden i'm noticing some effects  I think you told me this the guy who came up with it and was defeated by the legislature. They said oh god  No, we can't let you do this is back  He had made a deal. Okay. I'll take my initiative off the ballot since you're gonna do it legislature did their thing  And I guess he's not happy because it's back on the ballot in november  And it's a very it's a much more draconian privacy  I should look into it  And it's a very it's a much more draconian privacy  I should look into it so I know how to vote. I just ask you would you do that for me stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll go look at that. I have to look at it. Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um  he  He let me see if we see if we can  uh  Look it up  Because it's coming in november

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prop 20, I know what you're talking about. I just haven't seen the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll be one of our fabulous propositions. Is this the one?  Yeah, california personal information law and agency initiative prop 24  Expand the state's consumer data privacy laws including provisions to allow consumers to direct businesses  Not to share their personal information  Removes the time period in which businesses can fix violations before being penalized  And create in other words do it right now and creates the privacy  Yeah, well creates the privacy protection agency to enforce the state's consumer privacy laws  Yeah, so it's it's a it's a it's it's even more extreme

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just this is you know, we don't like the big companies and we're going to go after them  We're going to find another way to go after them  What does it really add in protection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not there. This is this is this is alistair mcteigert. Now. Can I use a scottish accent for him?  No  Alistair mcteigert san francisco, what if he's not scottish with a name like alistair mcteigert  Is a san francisco based real estate developer he filed this ballot initiative  Back in 2018. It was withdrawn after the california state legislature passed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mcteigert I enjoy hearing leo. I I enjoy that accent so it's a problem it feeds to me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said  The ccpa of 2018 is a great baseline, but I think there are additional rights californians deserve  You're too good at you guys are shy is yeah, the only thing I want to make sure is they can't undo the act  There's basically unlimited resources on one side of the fight if you don't do anything they'll win eventually  So, you know what? I don't you know, he sounds like his heart's in the right place  You could correct inaccurate personal information on request you can obtain permission  You have to obtain permission from a parent or guardian before  Obtaining information by kids younger than 13. We've always had that and those those are in gdpr  Yeah obtain permission before collecting data from consumers who are younger than  16 so they're going to expand that  Provide consumers with an opt-out option for having their sensitive personal information as defined in law used or disclosed for advertising or marketing  fair enough  Uh and businesses may not share a consumer's personal information  If the consumer so requests that's seems like that's already  in the ccpa  Um, I thought so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um some of those things the ccpa is not all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is now there would be if this passes and by the way, I expect it will a california privacy protection agency  And oh here's the thing it removes the ability of businesses to fix violations before being penalized  So there's no warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so that that I think is ridiculous is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like you're going to be penalized you did it. We're just trying to penalize you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're trying trying to see you slip up and penalize you. Yeah, uh, what's the point of the law?  The point is to get the right behavior. So if you get the right behavior, that should be a success  Penalties are not the point. Yeah  But that's the way we tend to look at it in america in so many ways and of course as california goes so much somewhat goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The world because we're a big  economy and uh companies want to get into california, so  Alastair i'm with you. I'm with you laddie  He says especially post covid people are going to be more sensitive to privacy concerns  I feel strongly and polling shows californians want more control over their information

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The story's going on twice as long as otherwise  All right, i'll stop we can talk about case so soon, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got that waiting there for us. I have a great story that's built for stacy higginbotham  Made for stacy and i'm going to do that next. I think I know what it is  But first I want to talk about roman now. Look  I know you jeff  And I understand how  Important this is guys. I have discussed it on this very show. Absolutely  And it's not just it's not just ed guys  Are not good about going to the doctor now good about getting health care  There I bet you aunt I bet you a queen pruett kind of is pushing you out the door saying would you go to the doctor?  But I know aunt as a kid  That you were brought up. I bet you anything  Not there's no crying in baseball  Rub it don't don't show any pain put some dirt on it, right? I plead a fifth. Yeah, no, I bet  That's why we guys we're supposed to be stoic, but that's not necessarily the best for our health so true  Yeah, so we put up with it  And and that's what's so cool about roman. They've spent the last few years building this digital platform  Literally a health clinic for men online that can connect you with a doctor licensed in your state  And it's a real doctor and it's real medical care. I want to really emphasize that this is not a prescription mill  This is not overseas.

This is the one I wanted when I saw this and put it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said, I want to hear what stacy has to say about this say spent a lot of money 32 billion dollars to buy arm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not so long ago a couple of years ago 2016 four years ago. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  2016 and they had this little thing called

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We work  Didn't work and they lost a lot of money  And they're trying they're thinking ipo. They're thinking sale, but this is the really interesting story and you know, I don't know how much  This rumor is real. I don't know what the regulatory they hired a bank  No, I know there I know that that's what soft bank is doing with arm, but the rumor is  Nvidia is  actively

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah seeking to acquire so this is interesting because invidia does have an arm license  and invidia is and  They got the money  They have the money. They don't have  An application processor business, which is arms big business right now arm is arms chip designs  It doesn't actually make chips  It only designs them and license them out to other chip which by the way is invidia's business as well, isn't it?  No, invidia actually  Okay, they're they're a fabless semiconductor  Okay, when you're fabless you you design your own chip. So invidia does design its own gpus. It has its own architectures for those  Um, and then it contracts out to have the manufacturer arm actually does not design a chip  They design the architecture and they license that out to companies who design the actual chip  And then those people so that's that's what arm does the arms architecture has competed forever  Okay, maybe since the early 90s late 90s sometime in the 90s. That's forever  They were designed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey stacey was about a year old then yeah  Hurts forever to me. It's yesterday, but go ahead  I'm sorry about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they were actually designed apple actually was what apple and acorn were one of the the founding that's right  Creators and funders of the original arm architecture was designed to be lower power  And for general purpose compute intel on the other hand was like we will be gpus and we will suck all the power  And we will be like powering your pcs and that worked for a while and then arm came up when smartphones became big they had the  Low power for any battery powered devices. They also made micro controllers, which are in the internet of things  and so that's why softbank bought them softbank bought them because they saw that  Power consumption power was not the big issue  Power consumption was and arm has a lock on that  Intel's trying they're not going anywhere and there's also the rise of graphics chips. So with  If you look at nvidia, they have the hottest silicon for  Super high end ai type computing right graphics processors. They can just run a bunch of those  They're inside supercomputers blah blah blah. So they've got the power unlock  arm has the power savings on lock so  Getting nvidia and arm together is kind of like leaving intel kind of in this middle gray area where  I don't know whether that's gonna be awesome or not  So it makes sense  it would not  Cause the scrutiny like an intel arm collab would because you know the two architectures  That'd be very anti-competitive. I would assume it also would possibly cause less consternation in the industry because  Arm licenses there's chips to apple amazon google  Intel probably has a license. I don't know  You know qualcomm nxp everybody in the chip industry. So if one other company bought  You know armed that'd be like super competitive you'd be like, uh, I don't want that  So nvidia is kind of interesting because they don't have a lot of head-to-head  Competition in the graphic space except for intel

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the reasons it's  Uh, and by the way, this story is from bloomberg mark german among others  And of course, we know him well from his apple reporting for bloomberg  one of the reasons  This is credible is a soft bank  Did used to own a fairly big chunk of four billion dollar stake in arm  Uh, i'm not arm in nvidia. I'm sorry, so they do have a relationship with nvidia. They no longer hold any nvidia stock apparently  Also the reason arm sold to nvidia back in 2016. I'm sorry the reason arm sold to soft bank  back in 2016  Is because soft bank wasn't considered in the space. It wasn't a competitive  a competitor  So, uh, it was it was a logical sale because there was no regulatory issue with soft bank owning them  I think there'd be more regulatory issue at least nvidia's in the same business as arm  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. They're not it's not any competitive. It's the most neutral of the people who have  arm  Licensees, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still don't think soft bank did also approach apple. That's maybe where mark german came in on this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But apple I don't think was interested apple does not typically do likely to make money or lose money on this deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they'll make money. They bought it for 32 billion  Uh, and it's probably gonna go for 100 billion. I would guess. Oh, wow. Yeah you really yeah, maybe not  There's a lot there's a lot of upside to arm now that apple's gonna be so well, okay, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well apple has been a licensee for a long time  Um, they I mean the iphone has an arm based application processor in it and has forever and then they took an architecture license to build their own  Bionic or whatever they're calling their chips  um  So putting it in the macbook  That's just kind of like we we knew that was going to happen eventually, right? I don't  I think it's why I would say it is a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're right. Obviously not it's not apple's not new to arm as you said they founded them  But it's a big deal because it's now going to be in desktop computing  Also, we see other moves to putting it in servers  Intel is showing some real weakness and I think that arm has a big upside. Well, maybe not 100 billion, but I think arm has a big upside

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arm has been playing for servers and they're finally just starting they've been playing that game since 2010, right?  Okay  So it's 10 years in the making for them to actually get anywhere and they're just starting they're just starting to get the software inside  The challenge for arm is actually going to be risk five  Is a new architecture that is an open source  Architecture that's coming out and we're seeing companies come back to arm and say hey, you know those licensing fees  I think they're a little high and we're evaluating doing a risk five processor that arm has been raising its licensing fees  I know and that's that's the squeeze for cash. So I really think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I also think there's a synergy the market will see a real synergy if with nvidia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because nvidia doesn't have you just unironically use the word synergy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this is one of the few places where it's safe to use. Let's open the kimono and take a look

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arm actually has a graphics processor. They have the malli graphics process

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they don't have a cpu. They don't have a general purpose processor  So oh arm does nvidia doesn't nvidia doesn't i'm, sorry  So yeah, nvidia does not but they have a single one  Uh, I think nvidia and well nvidia's big business lately has been ai which is a separate thing from what arm's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think nvidia has the power

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right arm has the power there's the synergy exactly and I think it's I think it's conceivable that nvidia would like to  We look we got a wounded player here. We got intel  Limping around I think nvidia sees this as a big opportunity  to to really jump way ahead so  I think you're gonna have a high premium on this, but that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not exactly that jim what happens to the lice all the licensing that arm has done  Nvidia try to shut that off for no no  Yeah, that's the big money, right, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they wouldn't be and truthfully maybe it isn't as valuable because they wouldn't be getting any intellectual property they don't already  License have access to yeah, right  They just become the collector of the license fees  But I think that they're I think it's worth more than 32 billion  I think it might might be 2x if not 3x  Yeah, I see 2x is about what I was thinking. Well, it's still a pretty hefty payday. Yeah  Nice payday. They've earned it  They need it  How much did they lose on we work? Do you know?  oh  a password

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much did they write off five a six point five billion dollar loss  Right, so you know 60 million profit on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Arm is gonna make up for that. Well, wait a minute a 17.7 billion dollar loss when you combine uber

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh  That's right. They are tied. Yeah, I was now this is a hundred dollar a hundred billion dollar fund division fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they lost 17 almost 18 percent of their value on two of their investments  Yikes  that's a  record 1.36 annual operating loss and then here's a great picture of  Masayoshi's son  With the graph you never want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like the politicians will never wear a hat. Yeah, never stand in front of anything going down

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now truthfully this slide is unfair because you can see that there's more to it  There's a minus sign still and there's an equal sign, but boss don't stand there. Don't stand there boss. They should have  sun sun, please  Please so yeah  interesting  interesting  Do you think there'd be regulatory issues with an invidia acquisition of arm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't  Know it depends on how they look at the chip market, right? I'm guessing it's still pretty competitive  Yeah, I don't think so. I mean the issue really is how will arms customers how many of them will look at invidia and feel threatened and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Turn to their own processor. Well, and they and it may be those customers who  Yell and scream saying we don't want invidia to we don't want to be  We don't think of video is a good steward for these licenses  Did you know that kosovo

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This must be your story. It is I just found it fascinating. It was from ben evans  newsletter, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, I we actually I thought we had talked about this before oh we didn't oh I didn't know that maybe not  Tell me if you remember this  That a couple of years ago  Electric clocks in europe began falling behind  They lost three months in january three minutes in january three minutes in february  In march the brussels-based european network of transmission system operators of electricity issued an apology  The reason is these clocks are tied  To the cycle the 60 hertz cycle  Or maybe in europe, it's 50 hertz. I don't know what the cycle is in the in the u.s  It's 60 hertz and so electric clocks in countries count on that  regular cycle to  time themselves  Oven timers alarm clocks losing time because power  Is the grid is ratcheting?  Their frequencies up  Actually down and then they ratcheted them up to speed up the continental the continent's clocks to fix it  They found out I think we had that story, but now we know why the power fluctuations are being caused by kosovo  East north kosovo is there a south kosovo? Okay north kosovo  Since 2015 its major city  Mitrovica had been under the control of spurs kalista a mafia masquerading as a political party  We know what that's like  I never heard of that before around the time serbs came to power north kosovo's electricity consumption surged  The region now requires 20 more power than it did five years ago. Why well  bitcoin  bitcoin and ethereum rigs  bitcoin miners  Had taken over the region from shabby apartment blocks of mitrovica to the cellars of mountain villages  cryptocurrency mining  The power is free because they weren't charging for power. I love that. Is that you is that your thunder there?  Yes, it is. You got electricity coming out of the air, dude

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Again another storm. Yeah, I know i've done it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why is the electricity free in kosovo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the the party it's almost like kind of venezuela the party wanted to wanted to stay in charge of everything  Um the the the mob and so they just made a whole bunch of stuff free  Oh interesting see sometimes  Well, that's what you know, um, uh, who was who was it in minne?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, what's his name? Yeah, he would give people money to say oh, it's okay  I've got money and there was a drug cartel there. Yeah, I think his name. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not el chapo the narco for yeah the narco narco. That's it narco.

I am I'm a fan of that actually that goes to jalaquiri

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, not anyway. So yeah, so the party's in so there's free power there  So the crypto people realize what can you do with free power?  mine  bitcoin cyber  It's bitcoins

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So bitcoin going anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Only up buddy buy now in fact I have I have a wallet you could buy for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good price. I'll give you a fair price if you put his his thumbs in screws. He still won't remember what the password is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually technically uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Florence ion owns it technically. Yeah, she owns it. That's right. Could you be uh hypnotized to find out the password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm open to anything. I don't think I can be hypnotized. I've tried  I actually went to a hypnotherapist for weight loss for a long time paid the guy a lot of money for like 10 sessions  Never really went under I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, okay, but hey what about what about things are we at things yet? Yeah, let's do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No  Change log. Oh crap. Let's do the google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google's going to use authenticated logos to reduce phishing and spam  Google area found this interesting. Okay. Now we gotta stop what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Logo space, right? So now you're gonna verify the logo  That's the google change log  No, no, go ahead  Don't forget. We got queso coming folks. We got queso coming. I know we're not done yet  No, no, we got queso. I just found it interesting that there's now logo space that you're gonna have a place where logos become  verified and and okay, never mind the next story, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are places I I keep getting  Like banks do this where they say, okay, this is your image  If you try to log on to this bank and you don't see this image, it's not your bank

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. Is that does that do anything? First of all, not unless there's an intermediary that confirms the image

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't you well you got to remember your image is a spoon always a spider right? Yeah, you got to remember that  And then you're supposed to note the next time you go to the bank if you don't see the spoon  Oh, it's not your bank. Does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I can never remember my image. I like it. I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
